There was a sudden dip in the night temperature due to which water drops on the mustard crop were frozen.Sube Singh, a farmer of Surpura Kalan in Bhiwani district, said, “I have sown mustard crop on more than 20 acre of land. However, we are worried as Hisar is about 65km away and farmers there are already facing crop loss due to cold conditions and frost.”Professor ML Khichar, head of department, agriculture meteorology at Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University (CCSHAU) said, “The day temperature was recorded at 14.5°C on Friday whereas the minimum temperature was 0.4°C. However, the temperature few centimetres above the ground is minus 4.0°C and there are chances of crop frost during the night, which can damage the mustard crop.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/frost-on-mustard-crop-in-hisar-worries-farmers/story-KJHxXvu9b8NK0FweaMIPbP.html
