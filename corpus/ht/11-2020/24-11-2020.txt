Food Minister Piyush Goyal is also expected to be present in the meeting.Officials from food and agriculture departments of the Punjab government have also been invited for the talks.The first round of talks was held on November 13, but it remained inconclusive, with both sides sticking to their ground.Punjab farmers have been demanding the repeal of the new farm laws and replace them with another set of laws framed after wider consultation with stakeholders. They also demanded a guarantee on the MSP front, as they claimed that these new laws may lead to the end of minimum support prices (MSP) procurement, which the Centre has denied.When asked about their demand on MSP, the secretary said, “Earlier laws too did not have any mention of MSP. Even the new agri-laws do not mention it. MSP is mentioned only in the National Food Security Act (NFSA) which has not been changed. Till Public Distribution System (PDS) is there, MSP will continue”.The Prime Minister has also stated this and even the Union Agriculture Minister has said in Parliament that MSP will continue, he added.“We have explained in detail to farmer unions about this issue. Hopefully, we will resolve the issue with them at the December 3 meeting,” he noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-protests-punjab-farmers-centre-to-meet-for-second-round-of-talks-on-dec-3/story-128A93Rd2hNsTEZDFxb2PN.html
