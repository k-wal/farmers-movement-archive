This has been further aggravated by a series of anti-people legislations on agriculture and labour code enacted by the central government. Along with these measures, the National Education Policy (NEP) imposed on the nation during the pandemic will further cause irreparable harm to the equity and access of education,” said the joint statement released on Monday morning.Also Read: Farm leaders mobilise support for November 26 rally in capitalThe statement further highlights how the introduction of NEP will violate the constitutional mandates of the policy of reservation and right to free and compulsory education act. “This new act will systematically break the present structure of education and could also result in the closure of thousands of schools and colleges. Not only will this lead to high drop-out rates among students, but also simultaneously push more teachers and non-teaching staff in ad-hoc and contractual appointments,” said the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/teachers-unions-to-join-nationwide-strike-against-labour-farmer-and-education-reforms/story-7LxuRLGHUelXAolm0MpKmK.html
