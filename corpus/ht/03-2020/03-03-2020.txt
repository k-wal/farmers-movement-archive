My government will pay attention to see farmers remain happy,” he added.The portal, which is in Marathi language, was developed by the state government’s IT department in 28 days.There was no involvement of private tenders, Thackeray said.The portal has a high capacity server and cloud technology, he said, adding that authentication of four lakh farmers is done every day.Unlike the loan waiver scheme of the previous government, farmers do not have to fill online forms. They don’t have to login or stand in queues, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-4-807-cr-deposited-in-accounts-of-over-7-lakh-maharashtra-farmers-says-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-GmxbT7i1EK7gdRjIzkaXYP.html
