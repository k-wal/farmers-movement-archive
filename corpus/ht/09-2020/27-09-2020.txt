Our farmers‚Äô leaders at least now have to understand the intention, and should drop the bandh call and stop creating unnecessary confusion. There will be no scope for it (bandh),‚Äù he added.Revenue Minister R Ashoka, who was present, also said there would be no scope for the bandh from the government side and steps would be taken to ensure normal life remained unaffected.Noting that there were clear court orders regarding such bandhs, he said, all necessary arrangements have been made for government offices, hospitals, shops and establishments, taxis and bus to operate smoothly.There was no need for people to fear about bandh and they can carry on with their day-to-day activities normally, he said, warning of stern action by police against anyone enforcing the bandh forcefully or indulging in incidents like stone pelting on Monday.Despite the stiff opposition from the opposition parties, especially Congress, the Yediyurappa government was successful in getting the APMC bill and also the Karnataka Land Reforms (Second Amendment) Bill passed in the assembly on Saturday.While the amendments to land reform act liberalises farmland ownership, the APMC bill curtails the powers of local agricultural produce marketing committees (APMCs) and allows private individuals to start agricultural trading, if they hold a permanent account number (PAN).The bandh is also supported by several labour organisations who are protesting against amendments to certain labour laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-bandh-our-farmer-leaders-clear-about-govt-s-intentions-no-scope-for-agitation-karnataka-cm-yediyurappa/story-BGJlxOWrlSAyjJYiQDrFJL.html

President Ram Nath Kovind signed the bills, making them an act, and the government notified them.The passage of these bills has led to a series of protests by farmers across the country, the Shiromani Akali Dal‚Äôs exit from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and also saw the suspension of eight parliamentarians of the Rajya Sabha when Parliament proceedings were ongoing.Protests against the three acts - The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 - began in Punjab and Haryana in early September before the monsoon session had begun.Also Read: Address farmers‚Äô issues now | HT EditorialFarmers and farmers‚Äô union leaders are still continuing to stage protests all over the country over the passage of these bills as they fear public procurement will be affected and the system of minimum support prices (MSP) will exist no more. Farmer leaders believe that the passage of these bills will affect how the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) used to work exposing farmers to the whims and fancies of private players and corporations belonging to the agricultural sector.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has continually assured farmers that their agricultural produce will continue to be sold under the ambit of MSP and government procurement will not be affected. Opposition parties had earlier requested the President to not give his assent to the three bills.Parliament also saw huge ruckus in the upper house which then led to the suspension of eight opposition members due to unruly behaviour. Former Union minister and SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from her post as her party voiced its concerns regarding the passage of the bills.Farmer agitations against the passage of the bills continue across northern India. Farmers in Punjab held a ‚ÄòRail Roko‚Äô agitation while in Rohtak farmers blocked the Rohtak-Chandigarh National Highway. Protests were also held in Bengaluru and Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-get-president-s-assent-amid-protests-sad-s-exit/story-5CLoiIi9r3HhTHWJbuZwLL.html

27-09-2020||Editorials||Address farmers‚Äô issues now | HT Editorial||The three farm bills piloted by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to liberalise agricultural trade and passed by Parliament, overriding demands by the Opposition for greater scrutiny, are a done deal. Big farmers‚Äô groups, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, are continuing to protest the bills, fearing deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful corporate agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before, but it is unlikely this will force the government to have a rethink. The reforms have cost the Bharatiya Janata Party one of its oldest allies, the Shiromani Akali Dal, which has quit the ruling alliance. Farm reforms have been long overdue in India, but the government‚Äôs new farm laws have become contentious for two reasons: one, they do not guarantee acquisition of farm produce at the minimum support price (at least, not in letter); and two, the manner in which they were pushed through, by a dubious voice vote, ignoring calls for parliamentary oversight, even voting. A prolonged agitation by farmers can impact rabi or winter-sown farm operations, hamper procurement of kharif or summer-sown crops and delay the benefits that should accrue from the reforms themselves. Reforms can‚Äôt be forced on a sector that still employs the poorer half of all Indians. Mere laws cannot change ground realities or alleviate India‚Äôs agrarian distress if the farming community doesn‚Äôt perceive them to be beneficial. The agriculture sector has been the only bright spot in the Indian economy, growing 3.4% in the June quarter, as the overall economy contracted 23.9% due to the widespread lockdown. It will have to keep up the momentum to protect rural incomes, even as the wider economy heads for a rare recession. The government must, therefore, resolve this crisis. The government ought to have agreed to the Opposition‚Äôs demand to send the bills to a select committee for greater scrutiny. And it should have written in the concept of support prices into the laws. These would have reassured agitating farmers, satisfied critics and made regulatory oversight more robust. One way to do this is by framing appropriate rules to operationalise the farm bills that provide for a strong regulatory mechanism to ensure that private agribusinesses don‚Äôt act as the new overlords.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/address-farmers-issues-now-ht-editorial/story-oov5IHBUiYkRLxHuFojVyI.html

Others participating in the protest are state affairs in-charge Harish Rawat, all state Congress MPs and MLAs, said party chief Sunil Jakhar on Sunday.This will be Amarinder Singh‚Äôs first protest against the farm bills.

27-09-2020||India||President Kovind gives his nod to all 3 farm bills, government notifies them||President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday gave his assent to all the three contentious farm bills, which opposition parties say are anti-farmer and corporate-friendly, after they were recently passed by Parliament during its monsoon session amid vehement protests.The three bills - The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Bill, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 - have now become acts.The government, which has said that these landmark legislations will make farmers self-reliant, has notified them. More than a dozen opposition parties had urged President Kovind not to sign the contentious bills, alleging that they were passed ‚Äúunconstitutionally‚Äù in ‚Äúcomplete disregard‚Äù of parliamentary norms.SAD quits NDA: How farm bills ended friendship between oldest alliesThe Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) even pulled out of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition at the Centre over the passage of the contentious farm bills, which the Punjab-based party said were ‚Äúlethal and disastrous‚Äù. The SAD and the BJP had been allies since 1996 when both forged a pre-poll alliance ahead of the 1997 Punjab assembly elections which brought them to power.Farmers, especially in Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the bills and have said the Centre‚Äôs farm reforms would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the ‚Äúmercy‚Äù of big companies.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been trying to allay the fears of the farmers, saying that the country‚Äôs agriculture sector has unshackled itself after the passage of these bills. Farmers and the farm sector, Modi said, need to be strong to lay a strong foundation of ‚ÄúAtmanirbhar Bharat‚Äù. ‚ÄúThey have the power to sell their fruits or vegetables to anyone, and anywhere. It is this power which is the foundation of their growth, now the same power has been given to farmers across the country. They have got the freedom to sell not only fruits and vegetables but grains, sugarcane, mustard and anything that they grow, they can now sell to anyone and anywhere they like,‚Äù PM Modi said while addressing the 69th edition of his monthly ‚ÄòMann Ki Baat‚Äô radio programme.Also Read:¬†Harsimrat Kaur Badal quits Cabinet over farm billsSeveral Union ministers, including defence Minister Rajnath Singh, have said said the Centre has taken the steps to ensure that farmers get the right price for their produce.‚ÄúOur government has taken steps to ensure that the farmers get the right price for their produce. I have studied the bills, and I am saying that the farmers will benefit from it. But some people are trying to mislead the farmers,‚Äù Singh said recently.The Farmers‚Äô Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, seeks to give freedom to farmers to sell their produce outside the notified APMC market yards (mandis). The government says this is aimed at facilitating remunerative prices through competitive alternative trading channels.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, seeks to give farmers the right to enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters, or large retailers for the sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price.

27-09-2020||India||Akalis quit NDA over farm bills||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) said on Saturday it was exiting the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition at the Centre after Parliament‚Äôs approval of three contentious farm bills, days after the party‚Äôs lone minister in the central government resigned from the Union Cabinet over what the party said were ‚Äúanti-farmer‚Äù laws.All leaders at the SAD‚Äôs emergency core committee meet late on Saturday were unanimous in deciding that the party can no longer be part of the NDA, its president Sukhbir Singh Badal said.Parliament has passed the three bills that the Narendra Modi-led government says are aimed at unleashing reforms in agriculture. While some experts have hailed the move, farmer bodies and opposition parties allege that the laws will benefit only the corporate sector and traders.While announcing the decision to snap its 24-year-long ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the SAD cited ‚Äúinjustice to farmers, Sikhs, Punjab and the Punjabi language‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe core committee decided unanimously to pull out of the BJP-led NDA alliance because of the Centre‚Äôs stubborn refusal to give statutory legislative guarantees to protect assured marketing of farmers crops on MSP [Minimum Support Price] and its continued insensitivity to Punjabi and Sikh issues like excluding Punjabi language as official language in Jammu and Kashmir,‚Äù said a statement issued by SAD spokesperson Harcharan Singh Bains after the three-hour-long meet.The SAD, a long-time constituent of the NDA, and the BJP have been allies since 1996, when they forged a pre-poll alliance ahead of the 1997 Punjab assembly elections that brought them to power. In a statement, Badal said that the SAD will continue to stand by its core principles of peace, communal harmony and guard the interests of Punjab, Punjabi in general and Sikhs and farmers in particular. Last week, the SAD‚Äôs Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned as the Union minister for food processing in protest against the three farm bills that were later passed in the monsoon session of Parliament.The new laws aim to liberalise the agriculture sector by removing hurdles created by the Agriculture Marketing Produce Committee (AMPC) Act in direct procurement of agricultural produce by buyers and create a level-playing field for all, thereby allowing private players a bigger role in farm trade.Farmer bodies and opposition parties say that these reform bills take away price protection provided through MSP, whereas the government maintains that MSP will remain in place and the bills will ensure higher remuneration for farmers.Badal said the new laws on agricultural marketing are lethal and disastrous for the already beleaguered farmers. He said the SAD was the oldest ally of the BJP but the government did not listen to it on honouring the sentiments of farmers.Responding to the developments, BJP national spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said: ‚ÄúFarm bills are for the benefit of the farmers‚Ä¶ MSP was an administrative mechanism, which will continue to be operational as earlier. The Akali Dal‚Äôs apprehensions are uncalled for. Hope they will realise it and come back to the NDA fold. But our government will continue on the path of farmers‚Äô welfare and take steps to increase agriculture sector income.‚Äù||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akalis-quit-nda-over-farm-bills/story-lsvL3rGoqp5g3XE0CUoAWL.html
