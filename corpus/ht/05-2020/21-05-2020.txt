They will no longer be at the mercy of middlemen who made profits while the farmers took home a pittance,” he said.Even as farmers’ groups associated with the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh complained of having to sell their produce at much lower rates and tonnes of milk being discarded in the absence of demand, Patel said the Mandi act amendment will boost income since the farmers now have the option of selling their produce at higher rates.“Farmers can even set up their own private mandis, warehouses and cold storages. With one licence they will be able to sell wherever they want. We have also bought milk from the farmers and made powder worth crores that will be sold once all restrictions are lifted,” the minister said.To a question on whether the government has addressed concerns of farmers who were opposed to the limits set for the purchase at mandis, he said efforts are underway to see that the interest of the farmers with smaller holdings are as protected as those of bigger farmers.He also ruled out that the agri-sector will face labour shortage as migrant workers from UP, Bihar and Jharkhand are heading back to their native places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saved-from-starvation-mp-minister-hails-farmers-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-7AQErwRk3Nhg8HwzGlykAO.html
