Why is every farmer of Punjab agitating?” he asked.The Congress leader also released a ‘kisan-mazdoor ekta’ (farmer-labourer unity) flag.He was joined by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, and a battery of senior Congress leaders. The chief minister urged Gandhi to bring the farmers from across India under one roof for an organised protest against the Centre. “The Akalis sold off the farmers’ interests as part of the Central government, with Bathinda MP Harsimrat Badal being party to the decision as a minister. The Centre might pay MSP for a couple of crops, but eventually it would scrap the system completely,” he added.The protest march in Punjab covered a distance of approximately 22km on the first day, starting from Badni Kalan in the state’s Moga district, then headed to Ludhiana’s Jagraon and moved ahead to Chakar, Lakha and Manoke before concluding in Raikot.The Congress team’s 50km tractor rally will end in Punjab on Tuesday.
