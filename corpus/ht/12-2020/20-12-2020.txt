20-12-2020||Bollywood||Diljit Dosanjh hits back after Kangana Ranaut’s video attacking him, writes ‘some people just want to watch the world burn’||Singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh has shared a couple of indirect responses to actor Kangana Ranaut’s video on Saturday, in which she spoke about the ongoing farmers’ protests, and demanded to know why people like Diljit and Priyanka Chopra aren’t questioned about their stance on the matter. Kangana and Diljit have been involved in a Twitter feud over the protests. Before Kangana posted her video, Diljit took to Twitter to share an audio note in which he said, in Punjabi, “Oh my god. I have to share something with you guys. There are two-three girls who are unable to digest their food until they chant my name in the morning. It’s just like a doctor prescribing two tablets in the morning and two in the evening. Only then are they able to digest food. One of those girls has a very irritating voice, so irritating. Don’t pay any attention to them. They will bark themselves hoarse. Ok ta ta”. Ek Funny Gal Share Karni c 😂 Mitran Da Naam BLOOD PRESSURE Di Goli Varga Ek Vaari Lagg Jave.. Fer kithey hatda.. Tera ni Kasoor... 🤣 pic.twitter.com/5fMyn2oGoBIn the audio clip, Diljit laughs uncontrollably, and at one point tries to mimic someone’s voice, presumably Kangana’s. In another tweet, he wrote, “Don’t spread hate. Karma is a very important thing. Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian, Jain, Buddhist... We are all one, that’s what we’ve been taught since we were kids. Even today, people of all faiths work on the same film set, like family. Some people want to watch the world burn.” Har Vaar Chiddi Kalolo Ni Hundi Bugge😊Hate Na FailaoKarma Baut Waddi Item anHindu Sikh Muslim Isai Jaini BodhiSab Bhara Ne Aaps Vich..Nikke Hundeya Ton EH Hee Sikhde aeye anHun V Har Dharm Da Banda Film Set te Kam Karda Family wangu.. Kush Lokan Di Job aa Agg LaunaIn her video message, Kangana had said that it had been proven that the farmers’ protest is politically motivated. She said that she is always questioned about her political allegiances, but Diljit and Priyanka’s words are met with no resistance. Diljit and Kangana’s Twitter spat reignited recently, when she wrote in a tweet, in Hindi, “I want Diljit Dosanjh and Priyanka Chopra, who are acting as local revolutionaries for the farmers, to make at least one video explaining to the farmers what they have to protest about. Both of them have disappeared after inciting farmers. Look at the state of the farmers and the country!”In response, Diljit had written in Punjabi, “Don’t even think that I have disappeared. Who gave her the authority to decide who is a patriot and who is an anti national? Who made her the authority? Have some shame before you label farmers as anti nationals.”Also read: Kangana Ranaut demands to know why Priyanka Chopra, Diljit Dosanjh aren’t questioned about their intentionsThe argument started with him referring to a tweet posted by her on November 27, in which she wrongly identified an old woman at the ongoing farmers’ protest as Bilkis Bano, the face of the Shaheen Bagh protest. After claiming that Bilkis was ‘available (for hire) in 100 rupees’, Kangana deleted the erroneous tweet. However, Diljit criticised her for spreading misinformation.Follow @htshowbiz for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/diljit-dosanjh-hits-back-after-kangana-ranaut-s-video-attacking-him-writes-some-people-just-want-to-watch-the-world-burn/story-My6wDE3kehhYMBzw4aP41I.html
20-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protests more political in nature, says Union minister VK Singh||Union Minister VK Singh on Sunday said the on going protests by farmers against the three Central farm laws was “more political” in nature and underlined the NDA government’s intent to ensure the welfare of the ryots.Speaking to reporters here ahead of his interaction with farmers, the Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways claimed that “actual farmers are very happy with what has been done in last six months.” He sought to allay fears on Minimum Support Price (MSP) and other issues, saying MSP will carry on while contract farming will only benefit the farmers.ALSO WATCH | ‘Those who take commission...’: Union minister VK Singh slams farmer protest  “Lot of misconceptions are being given where farmer issue is concerned. Farmers all over India mostly are happy, actual farmers are very happy with what has been done in last six months,” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ensured the benefit goes to the farmers, Singh said, adding, “the present agitation actually is more political than about farmers.” Farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting for the last 25 days outside Delhi against the recently enacted three farm laws, with five rounds of talks with government so far failing to break the deadlock. Singh further said that other political parties, whether Congress, AAP or the NCP led by Sharad Pawar, all of them wanted that farmers should have the freedom from the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) and “they didnt want them tied up to these mandis.” He said Modi has the “highest regard” for the farm sector and assured the government was with the farmer and pointed out at the various schemes including insurance and soil card to benefit them. “The government wants the farmer, who feeds the nation, to feel protected, to get the benefit of the government’s protection so that his income can be doubled,” he said. “...the farmer must understand that there are people who are misleading them and that is why I have come here to explain to our farmers that things are good, not as being given out by people,” he said. The legislations in question aim at protecting the farmer and one of them says the farmer is free to sell his produce anywhere he wants with “India being one market” for him, Singh said. “This is beneficial to the farmer since he can get better price.. what happens in the mandi is price is decided by the middlemen, the commission agents,” he said. The farmer has now been “freed from this,” but some were insisting “we want the mandis.” “Mandis are going go stay. No problem in that. A voice is raised on Minimum Support Price. The bill (Act) says minimum support price will stay,” Singh added. “So this misconception that has been created in the minds of our farmers friends needs to be taken away,” he said. On contract farming, he said the government has ensured the farmer gets the benefit irrespective of the price fluctuation and is especially in a position of advantage when the prices go up. “Land is free from this contract and is provided protection...the farmer is provided protection from any exploitation by a contractor,” the minister said. Singh later tweeted he attended a Kissan Sammelan Programme here. “Having interacted with people here, one can feel that farmers are excited about the #FarmBills2020 brought by the @narendramodi government and feel that these historic reforms were long due. #GenerallySaying,” he said in the tweet. He further tweeted some political parties,”to hide their historic incompetence,” were adamant on misleading farmers about bills which will bring welfare and prosperity to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protests-more-political-in-nature-says-union-minister-vk-singh/story-cINs8lEMFdXJ6tuVfSfiiI.html
