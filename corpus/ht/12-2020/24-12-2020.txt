24-12-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi meets Prez over farm laws, says India an ‘imaginary democracy’||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that India is now an “imaginary democracy” as he attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying anyone “trying to take power from him will be dubbed as terrorist and anti-national” even if it is Rashrtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat. Leading a Congress delegation to meet President Ram Nath Kovind, Rahul Gandhi demanded a joint session of Parliament to repeal the three “anti-farmers, anti-agriculture, anti-poor and black” laws. “Democracy…. which country are you talking about? There is no democracy in India. It is in your imagination but not in reality,” he told reporters after handing over to the President a memorandum signed by 20 million farmers seeking withdrawal of the three legislations. However, the government dismissed the remark and recalled the emergency imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. “The country hasn’t forgotten what happened during emergency days. Democracy has flourished in Prime Minister Modi’s term,” union minister Kailash Choudhary said.

Anyone trying to take power from him will be dubbed anti-national,” he said. Apart from him, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and party’s leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury were the other two members of the delegation that met the President.  India is now an imaginary democracy. pic.twitter.com/4WZJiJ9XelSoon after the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 were enacted, the Congress launched a three-month-long “mass movement” against the government. Rahul Gandhi also undertook a ‘tractor yatra’ across Punjab and Haryana as part of the campaign. “You have an incompetent man who does not understand anything and is running a system on behalf of three or four other people who understand everything,” he said. The former Congress president said if the Prime Minister does not repeal these laws, the country will suffer. “We told the President that these laws are anti-farmer and anti-farm labourers. The government claims the laws are in favour of farmers, but they are standing up against these,” he added. “I want to tell the Prime Minister that farmers are not going back home until the laws are taken back. The government should convene a joint session of Parliament and repeal them,” he said. The former Congress chief said all opposition parties are standing with farmers. “The way these laws were passed in Parliament without any discussion and consultations, they need to be withdrawn,” he said. “The farmers are in pain and dying, the Prime Minister will have to listen to them,” Rahul Gandhi added. Earlier, Delhi police detained Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other leaders and took them to Mandir Marg police station for violating prohibitory orders after they held a sit-in protest outside the party office at 24, Akbar Road. “It is an assault on the idea of India. The government is stopping our MPs from moving out of our office. PM needs to realise that there is limit to this,” Rahul Gandhi said. “China is sitting at the border and has snatched thousands of kilometres our land. But why does the PM not speak up on it? Why is he silent? He is making the country weak and outside forces are seeing it as an opportunity. The country is moving on a dangerous path and it will suffer,” he claimed. In the memorandum, the Congress claimed that 44 of them have so far lost their lives in the ongoing protests at various Delhi borders. For her part, Priyanka Gandhi said the government was not ready to listen to farmers. “It is a sin to brand farmers as anti-nationals. If the government is terming farmers protest as sedition, it is a sin,” she told reporters. “Any dissent against this government is classified as terror. The government is arrogant and has no respect for farmers or jawans, who are the sons of farmers,” she alleged. But union minister Choudhary maintained that the new agri-laws are good for farmers. “Rahul Gandhi doesn’t want the agitation to stop. Congress cadre won’t stop agitating but farmers will. We are interacting with farmers while Congress and other political parties are inciting them,” he said. On Priyanka Gandhi’s remark that it is a “sin” to label farmers as terrorists, Choudhary said some elements are trying to vitiate the atmosphere. “This can’t be overlooked,” he said. “We saw which flags were hoisted there. Even Maoists and communists and likes of Rahul Gandhi are trying to hijack the protest but they won’t be successful,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leaders-meet-president-seek-repeal-of-farm-laws/story-QZ5KmTdQXfrE2pfqaWA7RL.html

The detained leaders were part of a delegation, led by former party president Rahul Gandhi comprising Congress Working Committee (CWC) members and Members of Parliament, that was going to meet the President with 20 million signatures collected in the past three months against the three new farm laws enacted in September this year. “We are living in a democracy and these are elected MPs.

24-12-2020||India||‘Even Mohan Bhagwat would be called terrorist...’: Rahul Gandhi targets PM||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday slammed the Modi government and said anyone can be labelled as a terrorist by if they come in the way of the crony capitalists. Farmers, labourers and even Mohan Bhagwat can be bracketed in the same term, Rahul Gandhi said after submitting a memorandum containing 20 million signatures against the farm laws to the President Ram Nath Kovind. “I want to tell the PM that these farmers are not going to go back home until these farm laws are repealed. The government should convene a joint session of Parliament and take back these laws. Opposition parties stand with farmers and labourers,” Rahul Gandhi said on the ongoing farmers’ protest. The farmers on Wednesday took objection to the way the government is dealing them like a “political rival”. In their letter to the Centre, they denounced the government’s attempt to link the protest with “Maoists and anti-social elements”.“I told the President that these farm laws are anti-farmer. The country has seen that farmers have stood up against these laws,” Rahul Gandhi said.“There is no democracy in India. It can be in your imagination, but not in reality. PM Modi is making money for the crony capitalists. Whoever will try to stand against him will be called terrorist - be it farmers, labourers and even Mohan Bhagwat,” he said.“You have an incompetent man who is controlled by certain other people. This is what India has to understand. This is what all youngsters have to understand. You have an incompetent man who does not understand anything and running a system on the behalf of 3 or 4 other people who understand everything. And their aim is to take huge amount of money from the poor people of India and put it in their pockets. And that’s what we are fighting. Frankly, it doesn’t matter what you think right now. Because all of you will face this. There is not going to be a single person who will not face it. If you are a farmer, you are going to face it. If you are a small businessman, you will face it. You are a journalist, you will face it,” Rahul Gandhi said.As the government sticks to its ground that the laws are pro-farmer and will not be repealed but can be amended to accommodate the demand of the protesting farmers after consultation, Congress collected signatures of two crore farmers, labourers and other stakeholders who are against the farm laws from across the country.The meeting on Thursday comes a day before the ongoing protest of the farmers to march towards Delhi completes a month on December 25. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address farmers from six states and will release Rs 18,000 crore as part of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme. While Thursday’s march was only by Congress, opposition leaders met President before seeking his intervention to resolve the deadlock.Though both the Centre and farmers are ready to proceed with further talks, the situation is far from any solution as the farmers in their latest move have refused to fix the next date for talks unless the Centre modifies its proposals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-to-tell-pm-farmers-won-t-go-back-unless-laws-are-repealed-says-rahul-gandhi/story-LzVKPf4wIPJG5GJC2wusmO.html

In this satyagraha, all of us will give to support our annadatas,” he said. भारत के किसान ऐसी त्रासदी से बचने के लिए कृषि-विरोधी क़ानूनों के ख़िलाफ़ आंदोलन कर रहे हैं।इस सत्याग्रह में हम सबको देश के अन्नदाता का साथ देना होगा।https://t.co/iZ6HgnunzwAddressing the farmers of Madhya Pradesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recently said contract farming will benefit farmers. The contracts will be only on the produce, not on land. Under the agriculture reforms, farmers can approach the administration if contract provisions are not kept. Farmers have also been empowered in the new laws to opt out of contracts at any time they want.However, the report the Congress leader shared claimed that the contract did not have any sign or seal of the company.The ongoing protests of the farmers will complete a month on December 25, coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi releasing Rs 18,000 crore aid for farmers.Rahul Gandhi on Thursday will lead a protest march of Congress MPs from Vijay Chowk to Rashtrapati Bhavan and will submit a memorandum containing two crore signatures to President Ram Nath Kovind. Farmers’ protest at Delhi borders demanding an immediate withdrawal of the three agriculture laws entered the 29th day on Thursday — with no solution at sight. The agriculture ministry had invited the farmers for further talks which did not proceed after 5th round. But no date has been decided yet. Farmers have sought a new proposal from the ministry as fresh talks can’t happen on proposals which they already nixed. In their reply, they have demanded higher MSPs from the ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-avoid-such-tragedy-rahul-gandhi-tweets-in-support-of-farmers-protest-will-meet-president-today/story-LFiG0Fjha6tkFwTGLP9RjP.html

24-12-2020||India||Farm law protests: Govt invites farmers for talks, Rahul Gandhi meets President Kovind | 10 points||Protests against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws continued for the 29th straight day on Thursday. As the deadlock continued, the government reached out to the farm unions, once again inviting them for talks at a date and time of their choice. Earlier in the day, a three-member Congress delegation, including Rahul Gandhi, met President Ram Nath Kovind to seek his intervention to repeal the farm laws.Here are key developments from day 29 of anti-farm law protests:1. Vivek Aggarwal, joint secretary in the Union agriculture ministry wrote to farm unions, again requesting them to hold the sixth round of talks as per a date and time convenient to them. The farmers had on Wednesday rejected the government’s initial proposal in this regard, which it sent on Sunday.2. In the letter, Aggarwal stressed that it was “crucial” for the government to keep negotiations open with various farm unions. He also reiterated the government’s commitment to arrive at “logical solutions” for issues raised by the farm unions.3. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar met two groups of farmers, both of whom, he claimed, were in support of the reforms. 60 members of the Kisaan Majdoor Sangh and 21 from the Kisan Sena met Tomar separately, and expressed their support. He also showed a letter of support from the Kisan Majdoor Sangh.4. Tomar lashed out at Rahul Gandhi for meeting President Kovind and submitting a memorandum seeking a repeal of the laws. Remarking that even the Congress doesn’t take Gandhi seriously, Tomar said that the farmers told him that no one from the party came to get their signatures.5. The minister was referring to claims made by the Congress that its memorandum to the President had signatures of two crore people against the laws. “If Rahul Gandhi was so worried, he could’ve done something when his government was in power. Congress has always been anti-farmer,” Tomar said.6. 11 Opposition parties, including the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Samajwadi Party (SP), issued a joint statement, condemning prime minister Narendra Modi for his “baseless allegations” that the Opposition was lying to farmers about the new laws. “PM’s accusations are a “complete travesty of truth,” the statement said.7. The parties further demanded a repeal of the three laws and that of the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The government should hold discussions with the farmers and all stakeholders, the statement said.8. Earlier in the day, Rahul Gandhi, interacting with the media after meeting President Kovind, called PM Modi “incompetent.” Targeting the government, he said that Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat, too, would be called a “terrorist” if he too “stood up” against the PM.9. The Delhi Police detained several Congress leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, for trying to march to the Rashtarapati Bhavan, despite not being given permission to take out a march. Only Rahul Gandhi, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury had an appointment with the President, the police said.10. Continuing his outreach, PM Modi will on Friday transfer Rs 18,000 crore to the bank accounts of nine crore farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-law-protests-govt-invites-farmers-for-talks-rahul-gandhi-meets-president-kovind-10-points/story-u3mf7w1pf5L4hpdNSPvdHI.html

The leaders have been taken to Mandir Marg Police Station, according to news agency ANI.Deepak Yadav, additional DCP (New Delhi), said that some Congress leaders marching towards Rashtrapati Bhavan were detained and confirmed that Priyanka Gandhi was among them. However, it would take some time to ascertain the identities of the other detained leaders, he said.“We are living in a democracy and these are elected MPs. They have the right to meet the President and they should be allowed. What is the problem with that? The government is not ready to listen to the voices of lakhs of farmers camping at borders,” Priyanka Gandhi said. “Any dissent against this government is classified as having elements of terror. We are undertaking this march to voice our support for the farmers,” she added.After the demonstration, that started at 10:45 am from Vijay Chowk, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and other senior leaders met President Kovind and submitted the memorandum containing 2 million signatures.“I told the President that these farm laws are anti-farmer. The country has seen that farmers have stood up against these laws,” Rahul Gandhi said after the meeting.“I want to tell the PM that these farmers are not going to go back home until these farm laws are repealed. The government should convene a joint session of Parliament and take back these laws. Opposition parties stand with farmers and labourers,” he added.According to a letter written by Congress MP KC Venugopal to the personal secretary to the President, only three leaders, Rahul Gandhi, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary were permitted to meet President Kovind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-other-cong-leaders-on-their-way-to-meet-president-with-20mn-signatures-against-farm-laws-taken-into-police-custody/story-ft73UWvO3CI5ShzB5XmKmK.html
