It has smashed the national unity to pieces, shamelessly inciting Hindus against Muslims & now desperately setting peace-loving Punjabi Hindus against their Sikh brethren esp #farmers. They’re pushing patriotic Punjab into communal flames” Badal alleged in a tweet.The SAD had quit the National Democratic Alliance over the issue of farm laws. SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal had also resigned as Union minister.Later in a statement, Badal alleged that the BJP has been “splitting the country into pieces by setting one community against another.” “So desperate is it for the power that it has no scruples about taking the communal polarisation route and setting the country on communal flames,” he alleged. “The BJP first set Hindus against Muslims. Now, it is determined to replay the same evil game and re-enact the same tragedy in Punjab also,” he alleged.“It is conspiring to set our peace-loving Hindu brethren in Punjab against their Sikh brethren with whom they have shared strong bonds of blood for centuries. The BJP wants to replace those bonds of blood with bloodshed,” he further alleged.He warned the BJP against any attempt to incite “brothers” against each other.The SAD chief accused the saffron party of resorting to “dangerous conspiracies to sabotage the hard-earned atmosphere of peace and communal harmony just for the realisation of petty political goals.” “The BJP leadership must realise that their party today has become the most powerful divisive force. It has been resorting to dividing the country and its people by spreading hatred in the name of religion,” he alleged.The Shiromani Akali Dal chief asked the BJP-led Centre to shun its “arrogant attitude”.“Those who framed (farm) laws were never involved in farming activities. The central government acts on what its officers say,” he added.Referring to the ongoing farmers’ agitation over the three farm laws, Badal said, “The whole country except the BJP gratefully acknowledges the debt which we owe to our patriotic farmers and soldiers.” “The BJP is provoking the people to deny that debt. It believes only in emotionally exploiting farmers’ sacrifices but remains so ungrateful to them that it is painting them as anti-national. “Today it is against farmers. Nobody knows what the BJP might say even about soldiers tomorrow if it suits them. The farmers are hurt and angry against the BJP,” he alleged.Badal said it is shocking and unbelievable that a party which claimed to take pride in India’s heritage is determined to “destroy” the foundations of that very heritage.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and elsewhere have been protesting near various border points of Delhi including Singhu and Tikri for over a fortnight demanding the Centre repeal three new farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-out-to-set-hindus-against-sikhs-in-punjab-sukhbir-badal/story-GSDeExx9JDH1cqqP3EbsbL.html
15-12-2020||India||PM Modi says farmers surrounding Delhi have been misguided; blames Opposition||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday blamed the opposition for the ongoing stir by thousands of farmers, who have been protesting the three new farm laws by camping near Delhi’s borders, saying they have been misled.“People who are sitting in the Opposition and misleading farmers today were in the favour of these farm reforms during their government. They could not make a decision during their government. Today when the nation has taken a historical step then these people are misleading farmers,” PM Modi said.PM Modi was addressing the public after laying the foundation stone for a desalination plant and a milk processing and packaging plant in Gujarat’s Kutch.मैं किसान भाई-बहनों से फिर कह रहा हूं कि उनकी हर शंका के समाधान के लिए सरकार 24 घंटे तैयार है।किसानों का हित पहले दिन से हमारी सरकार की प्राथमिकता रहा है।- पीएम @narendramodi #KutchWelcomesPMModi pic.twitter.com/Y0akSWoCMm“The country is asking why small farmers who produce grains and pulses should not get the freedom to sell crops. Agricultural reforms were in demand for years. Many farmers’ organisations have also demanded in advance that they should be given an option to sell food grains anywhere,” PM Modi said backing the clauses from the recently-cleared laws by the government.“Today those who are confusing the farmers by sitting in the opposition, have supported these reforms in their time. They just kept giving false comfort to the farmers. When the country has taken these steps, they are now confusing the farmers,” he said.ALSO WATCH | Farmers’ protest: Top ministers warn ‘some elements’ trying to take advantage PM Modi said that a conspiracy is going on to confuse the farmers. “They are being scared that after new agrarian reforms, others will occupy the land of the farmers. You tell me, if a dairyman contracts to take milk from you, does he take your animal?” he asked.Extending support to the farmers via his address, PM Modi said, “I am again telling farmer brothers and sisters that the government is ready 24 hours to solve their every doubt. The interest of farmers has been the priority of our government since day one.”Thousands of farmers hailing from Punjab and Haryana have been protesting in and around the national capital demanding the repeal of three farm laws, alleging that it will reduce their earnings and will give larger control to the corporations.As the protests entered the 20th day, there have been no signs of a resolution to the standoff between the farmers’ unions and the government. So far, the government side - represented by agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, food minister Piyush Goyal and minister of state for commerce and industries Som Prakash have engaged in five rounds of negotiations with 40 farmer unions without any resolution.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the many thousands of farmers protesting at Delhi borders have expressed apprehension that it will pave the way for eliminating the minimum support price (MSP) cushion and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agriculture-reforms-are-exactly-what-farmers-unions-oppn-have-been-asking-for-over-years-says-pm-modi/story-UcLzpoxv8cpM0N53j2yvvM.html

15-12-2020||India||BJP cites poll wins to claim farmers’ support||Following its win in the Goa zilla panchayat polls, the BJP on Monday asserted that the spate of its recent victories in a number of elections across the country would not have been possible without the help of farmers.While the opposition has been spreading confusion over the ongoing farmers’ protest, the BJP will dismantle their claims scientifically using poll data, party spokesperson Sambit Patra told a press conference.Patra’s comments came as the BJP won the zilla panchayat polls in Goa. The BJP has won the Bihar assembly polls, assembly by-polls across the country and local polls in states like Rajasthan, Assam and Goa, he noted.“The poor, rural regions and farmers form the spine of this country. These results would not have been possible without their support,” he said. He said the opposition, especially the Congress, has tried to corner the ruling party over four issues; the Covid-19 pandemic, economic problems due to overall global situation, migrant crisis and recent agri reforms.Elections results have shown that people, including farmers, stand with Modi because he is their true “well-wisher”, the BJP spokesperson said.Also Read: Anti-national elements leading farmers’ protest: Himachal BJP vice-presidentTaking a jibe at the Congress over reports that it has put up a tent to help protesting farmers at the Singhu border, he said the opposition party’s tent had blown away.“It cannot even elect its president,” he said, and took a swipe at its leader Rahul Gandhi, saying he considers rabi and kharif are “BJP workers”. Patra said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh are engaged in a war for power in the border state in the name of farmers’ protest.Kejriwal’s fast has been caused by his hunger for power, the BJP spokesperson alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-cites-poll-wins-to-claim-farmers-support/story-8hdyKZxNEjyIWS7TD3hYhJ.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Police deploy cargo containers as barricades at Singhu border||Delhi Police on Monday placed cargo containers at Singhu border near the barricades that divides the security personnel from protesting farmers. Two cargo containers were seen placed at the border on Monday which police officers said are being used to replace with the mud-laden dumpers that have been stationed here since Day One of the agitation. The protests, overall, remained peaceful at Delhi’s borders on Monday.A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said that deployment at Singhu border remained the same as the farmers’ agitation entered into its 18th day on Monday. More public announcement systems were installed on Monday by the Delhi police and a drone was also used to keep an eye on the gathering now spreads across 5-6 kilometers on the Delhi-Sonepat highway.Additional deputy commissioner of police, Jitendra Kumar Meena, said that the situation continued to remain peaceful at Singhu border on Monday. “We ensured sufficient deployment and the situation is being continuously monitored,” he added.The day was also peaceful at Ghazipur border on Monday even as some protesting farmers tried to block the other two carriageways of the Delhi-Meerut expressway earlier in the day. However, they were immediately disbursed by the police and their own leaders.Traffic at the Delhi-Meerut Expressway also remained the same, with one carriageway leading from Ghaziabad to Delhi closed and the other connecting Delhi to Ghaziabad operating as normal. The NH-24 service lane, which has been blocked by the farmers November 27 onwards, also continued to remain closed for traffic on Monday.Chilla border that was closed by the farmers since December 1, and was cleared on Sunday morning, witnessed normal traffic movement on Monday. However, because a small group of farmers had stayed back, still occupying one lane near the central verge at the Gautam Buddha Dwar, on the Delhi - Noida border, the traffic moving from Noida to Delhi slowed down.Apart from Chilla and Ghazipur borders, seven borders that continued to remain completely blocked, are Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Jharoda, Piao Maniyari, and Mangesh in outer and south-western parts of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-deploy-cargo-containers-as-barricades-at-singhu-border/story-cg407Ar8m4YiCbfvPGEbxO.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Several farmers keep day-long fast, warn of indefinite hunger strike if demands not met||Eighty-five-year-old Randheer Singh from Haryana, 40-year-old Arjun Arya from Madhya Pradesh and 28-year-old Seema Bharti from Uttar Pradesh came together on Monday to observe a 10-hour hunger strike at Delhi’s borders, to strengthen their demand for the withdrawal of the three new farm laws. The farmers said Monday’s ten-hour strike, from 8am to 5pm, was a symbolic protest and it may soon take the shape of an indefinite hunger strike, if the government doesn’t agree to their demands.Also Read| Will resume talks, but with some riders: Farmer unionsSingh, a farmer from Jind, has been camping at Singhu border since November 26 when the police had stopped them from entering Delhi. After more than a fortnight of peaceful protest, farmer groups had given a call for hunger strike on Monday after multiple rounds of talks with the government failed.One of the eldest members of the group to observe the hunger strike, Singh said, “Even on the 18th day of our protest, we are all full of energy as we were on Day One. The movement is not about us individuals anymore. Even if any of us have to sacrifice ourselves, we will not step back,” Singh said.At Singhu border, at least 10 farmers, three of them women, observed the day-long hunger strike. One of them, Seema Bharti, a 28-year-old farmer from Sindhauli in Uttar Pradesh, said if the government remains deaf to their requests, they will intensify the protest. “If nothing works, we will walk into Delhi like we had planned and make the government heed our demands,” she said.Apart from Singhu, a group of 10 farmers observed the fast at Ghazipur border, and another group of 20 of went without food at the Tikri border.At the Chilla border, two farmers were seen observing the ten-hour fast.Rakesh Tikait, 51, leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union Takait (BKU) faction in Uttar Pradesh were among those who kept the fast at Ghazipur. “It’s unfortunate that the government has forced farmers, who provide food to the nation, to go on a hunger strike. We had on Sunday said that we are ready for discussions but the government has not extended an invitation as of now. It government clearly doesn’t think about the farmers,” he said.At Tikri border, at least 20 farmers took part in the hunger strike. Among them was Bogh Mansa, 68, a farmer from Mansa district of Punjab. “The government has neither been able to explain how the new farm laws are good nor been able to tell us why they can’t be withdrawn,” he said.Two farmers took part in the hunger strike at Chilla border. Brushing aside the rumours that farmers have left the site, Yogesh Pratap Singh, 35, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu), said, “There have been rumours that we have backed out but that’s not true. We just opened the road for the convenience of the people. We will sit here and protest for as long as it takes.”A group of students and activists on Monday also participated in a protest held in Shaheedi Park, ITO. “The new farm laws would cause enormous harm to the public, marginal farmers, and urban-rural workers by forcing them to buy essential commodities at inflated prices. Moreover, the introduction of contract farming through another law aims to hand over the reins to corporates. These laws have shown that the BJP government is anti-people, anti-worker and anti-small farmer,” said Dinesh Kumar, member of Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS), a student organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/several-farmers-keep-day-long-fast-warn-of-indefinite-hunger-strike-if-demands-not-met/story-UQUBl0MFkPNfNG0KtKCHQK.html
15-12-2020||India||Little trade in MP mandis in October after passing of farm laws, traders say||Ganeshram Sahu, a farmer from Pipara village in his early 40s, sold toor daal (a pulse) in an auction at Rs 4,782 per quintal at Krishi Upaj Mandi, Karond, Bhopal against the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 6,000 per quintal on Saturday. Similarly, another farmer Suresh from Shekhpura under Parwalia tehsil, sold his gram produce for Rs 4053 per quintal under auction against the MSP of Rs 5100 at the mandi the same day. However, both the farmers had no qualms in accepting the price as the produce was not of fair average quality (FAQ) and they sounded satisfied with the entire auction process as they were supposed to get the payment against the sale within 24 hours. For Ganeshram and Suresh or for that matter Hameer Singh Dangi, another farmer from Bhopal, the farmers’ agitation in Delhi against the central government’s three farm laws has hardly made any difference in their routine life and sale of their produce as of now. But there are doubts if the situation will remain the same in the time to come as is reflected in the low tax collection through Krishi Upaj Mandi tax and farmers numbers dwindling and also a good number of Mandi employees waiting for their salaries for the past more than two months due to low tax collection. The farm laws have made the traders jittery as the business is going down. Karond Krishi Upaj Mandi Traders Association president Harish Gyanchandani said, “The farm laws are nothing but the death knell for the mandis across the state. The reason being, a trader has to pay Mandi tax at 1.70% which was reduced to 0.50% for three months by the state government after their agitation in October, whereas traders dealing with farmers outside the mandis are not required to pay any tax. In this situation, why should a trader come to the mandi to buy agriculture produce? Instead, he will pass some of the amount, saved by not paying the tax, to the farmers to encourage the latter to sell their agriculture produce outside the Mandis.” Also, he added, the traders outside the mandis are not bound by any rules and regulation unlike the traders registered with the Mandis. Hence, farmers might not get adequate amount of money against sale of produce outside the mandi and also the payment is likely to be delayed. Agriculture Mandi Board Employees and Officers Association state president Angira Pandey said, “After the farms laws were enacted, at least 11 Mandis in the state, out of the total 259, registered zero transaction in the month of October and more than 36 mandis had their transactions reduced by more than 90%. Since the tax collection is low, only about 1500 of around 9000 employees engaged with the mandis have been able to get salaries in the past two months or so.” As per a document, the most affected mandis are at Sagar, Panna, Tiakamgarh, Rewa, Satna, Sahdol, Anuppur, Sidhi, Singrauli, Dindori, Chhindwara, Jabalpur, Shivpuri, Sheopur, Bhind, Guna, Mandsaur, Agar-Malwa, Shajapur, Dewas, Neemuch etc..In October, farmers in Madhya Pradesh harvest paddy and soyabean and sell through local mandis and other tradersDwivedi said, “In Mandis the traders are bound to make payment to the farmers within 24 hours. If a trader fails to pay the amount within 24 hours he has to pay additional amount at 1% interest rate within 48 hours and the this interest rate goes up to 5% on failure of payment on subsequent days. Also, till he clears the payment he is not entitled to take part in the auction. As there are transactions outsides there are hardly such restrictions on the traders.” Also Read: ‘Anti-Modi elements part of protests, not farmers’: Union minister Narendra TomarAway from the Mandi, Jitendra Thakur, a farmer who is a resident of Arwalia village and has about 8 acre of land in his family in Bhopal, speaks why farmers’ agitation in Delhi has not affected the farmers in Madhya Pradesh much. “Unlike Madhya Pradesh the Mandi system in Punjab and Haryana is very strong and there is interdependence between farmers and traders. For instance, if a farmer needs a good amount of money for medical treatment, marriages or any other occasion, he gets it from the traders at the mandis. Also, the farmers there don’t have to cover long distances to reach the mandis. That’s why they fear that the new laws will lead to closure of the mandis.”Also Read: ‘For our farmer brothers’: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind KejriwalThakur added, “If our interests like MSP etc are protected in the laws, we would like to save a good amount of money otherwise spent on transportation to mandis for the auction,” he said. Another farmer of the village, Lalaram said, farmers were ready to back the new laws if they turn out to be in their favour.“If transparency is there in the laws and our interest is protected we would welcome it. If there are people who can buy our produce at the time of sowing, then it will give guarantee for our income. But until there are provisions in the law, our interest can’t be protected.” However, a farmer from Dalouda in Mandsaur Jitendra Patidar said, “There are many discrepancies in the new laws. For instance, in Mandis there are checks at several points so that the farmers get payment from traders and the latter are able to do business only after getting licences, whereas, once the traders start buying produce outside the mandis, there is no such scrutiny and licence required for a trader to buy the produce.” Bharatiya Kisan Union state president Anil Yadav said that the farm laws will only benefit the corporate houses. “If the central government really wanted to protect the interest of the farmers why did it not include the provision of MSP in the laws and why the farmers are debarred from approaching the courts in case of any buyer backing out from the contract?,” he asked. Minister for farmers’ welfare and agriculture Kamal Patel said, the state government is committed to safeguarding the interest of farmers.“We have made it clear that Mandis and MSP both will continue to exist. Hence, there is no reason for the farmers or Mandi traders to be worried. The farm laws aim at ensuring enhancing the income of the farmers,” said Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/little-trade-in-mp-mandis-in-october-after-passing-of-farm-laws-traders-say/story-aveDzQYBkckLAYDzSdoERP.html
15-12-2020||Editorials||Why the winter session matters | HT Editorial||The pandemic has caused enormous disruption to lives and livelihoods, but among its other casualties has been the functioning of India’s most important democratic institution — the Parliament. This year will see no winter session, and the reason being offered is Covid-19. It is indeed true that holding the monsoon session was a difficult exercise, requiring an overhaul of logistics and seating arrangements. Despite precautions, dozens of parliamentarians and many more Parliament officials got infected. There is no debate on the fact that the pandemic is still here, caution is essential, and the health of India’s political leadership is important.But to suggest that this means Parliament itself cannot meet is disingenuous. The budget session this year was —rightly — prorogued earlier than scheduled because the pandemic had just hit India, a lockdown was in offing, and little was known about the disease. The monsoon session itself was truncated. Key legislations — including the farm bills, the opposition to which has moved to the sadak, streets, from the sadan, house, where it was not adequately discussed — were pushed through with the Opposition not getting the space and time to raise issues. And now India will only see Parliament meet for the budget session in 2021, where the focus will, understandably, be on the budget itself.But the need for elected representatives to meet in the sovereign house could not be greater. A farm movement has disrupted lives across north India; the management of the pandemic has been inconsistent with a varied track record across states; a framework for vaccine distribution is in the works; Centre-state relations remain fragile; the security situation is worrying with China continuing its aggression in Ladakh; and the economy, while recovering, is still not out of the woods. All of this merits open discussion and debate where the government offers its point of view and the Opposition critiques its performance and offers constructive suggestions. The fact that government is functioning with offices returning to a degree of normalcy, events are being held with leaders in attendance, a full election was fought in Bihar and bypolls were held across states shows that despite the pandemic, the Indian State has not gone dormant. Neither should Parliament. To show their commitment to citizens in these times of distress, India’s parliamentarians owe it to the country to get to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-the-winter-session-matters-ht-editorial/story-UbO9LkHJ4VAKkvyalfKVXL.html
15-12-2020||India||PM Modi to ‘keep assuring farmers’, blames Opposition for misleading them||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday mounted a scathing attack on the Opposition parties and farmer organisations, asserting that there was a conspiracy being hatched “in and around Delhi” to confuse the agitating farmers.The PM said the opposition protesting against the very laws wanted to implement the same during their rule but could not.“(The agitating) farmers are being misled about the agriculture reforms. They are being fooled into believing that others will occupy their lands,” said the PM speaking in Hindi at Dhordo in Kutch in Gujarat after laying the foundation stone of the world’s largest hybrid renewable energy park, a desalination plant and a fully automated milk processing and packing plant.The Prime Minister went on, without naming any party, “Those in the opposition and misleading farmers today were all for these very reforms during their rule, but they could not take a decision. Today when the country has taken a historical step, they are misleading the farmers.” He added, “The Government of India is always committed to the welfare of the farmers and we will keep on reassuring the farmers and addressing their concerns.” On the sidelines of the function, Modi also held an interaction with the local farmers, including Sikh cultivators who have been staying near the Indo-Pakistan border in Kutch since Independence. Some 5,000 Sikh families live in and around the Lakhpat region. He also met representatives of a local self-help group. The Gujarat Chief Minister was also present. Asking researchers to look at Kutch as a case study, the Prime Minister recalled the devastating 2001 earthquake in the desert district and said the people there had converted tragedy into hope. PM Modi counted Kutch among the country’s fastest developing regions.“Everyone rose from the destruction caused by the quake and see where they have brought Kutch,” he said, and referred to the renewable energy park he launched. This is one of the world’s biggest renewable farms with capacity to generate up to 30,000 MW of power. “Gujarat was among the earliest to work on strengthening solar energy capacities. Today Kutch has the world’s largest hybrid renewable energy park. It is almost as big as Singapore and Bahrain. It is built on 70,000 hectare land, larger than many big cities in the country,” the Prime Minister said.He added that India featured in the top three among 144 countries in the Clean Energy Investment rankings. PM Modi said, “The country has shown a path to the entire world and is leading the fight against climate change.”Remembering Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 70th death anniversary, the Prime Minister said Patel’s statue in Kevadia in Narmada district was a source of inspiration for the people of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-keep-assuring-farmers-blames-opposition-for-misleading-them/story-6wDpUYsHNyDWfgRocBULaL.html

The BJP has won the Bihar assembly polls, assembly by-polls across the country and local polls in states like Rajasthan, Assam and Goa, he noted.“The poor, rural regions and farmers form the spine of this country. These results would not have been possible without their support,” he said. He said the opposition, especially the Congress, has tried to corner the ruling party over four issues; the Covid-19 pandemic, economic problems due to overall global situation, migrant crisis and recent agri reforms.Elections results have shown that people, including farmers, stand with Modi because he is their true “well-wisher”, the BJP spokesperson said.Also Read: Anti-national elements leading farmers’ protest: Himachal BJP vice-presidentTaking a jibe at the Congress over reports that it has put up a tent to help protesting farmers at the Singhu border, he said the opposition party’s tent had blown away.“It cannot even elect its president,” he said, and took a swipe at its leader Rahul Gandhi, saying he considers rabi and kharif are “BJP workers”. Patra said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh are engaged in a war for power in the border state in the name of farmers’ protest.Kejriwal’s fast has been caused by his hunger for power, the BJP spokesperson alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-cites-poll-wins-to-claim-farmers-support/story-8hdyKZxNEjyIWS7TD3hYhJ.html

15-12-2020||India||Will resume talks, but with some riders: Farmer unions||The Union government and farm unions protesting a set of agricultural laws the latter claim will hurt their livelihood are likely to restart negotiations that ran aground last week, with both agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and a major platform of farm unions on Monday signalling their willingness to resume talks.Tomar told reporters in Delhi that the government was engaged in efforts to restart negotiations that broke down after five rounds last week. “When a date is fixed, we will let you know,” he saidHours later, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Committee (AIKSCC) — a joint platform of the protesting farmers camped on the outskirts of Delhi — said it was ready for talks again but with certain conditions. The farm groups, mostly from Punjab, which have been pressing for a complete repeal of the three laws, said they needed three principal assurances before returning to the negotiating table.One, talks cannot be about old proposals which farm unions have rejected. Two, the government should draw up a new agenda. Three, discussions must be focused on a repeal of the farm laws. The riders appear to put the onus on the government to draw up an agenda acceptable to the farmers. To be sure, the government has reiterated the farm laws will benefit farmers. On their part, the farmers have held firm on the demand for repealing the three laws, and on Monday observed a hunger strike across the country, blocking highways and hitting the streets in protest. “The government [is] repeatedly dishing out old rejected logic. Farmers are ready for talks, but the three Farm Acts and the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 have to be withdrawn,” said Avik Saha, the secretary of the AIKSCC. Kavitha Kuruganti, another leader of the AIKSCC, said farmers were not averse to talking again. “So, if the government sends the invite, the agenda laid out there will be the key to any future negotiations.” Earlier in the day, Tomar met a delegation of farmers from five states who pledged their support for the laws, and said that a meeting will “definitely happen”. “Our efforts to restart talks are on. Talks will happen. We are always open to discussions to solve farmers’ issues,” Tomar said. “The government has been talking to farm leaders over phone informally. When things work out, a formal invite is likely to be sent again with a revised agenda,” a person familiar with development told HT, requesting anonymity. A massive farmers’ protest was set off by three laws pushed by the government in September that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules. Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices. Protesters decided to call off further negotiations on December 8, after a meeting with home minister Amit Shah, claiming a stalemate. The government on December 9 sent a written proposal to amend some provisions of the laws for greater oversight on deregulated markets, sparing farmers penalties for stubble burning, which causes pollution and promising to keep providing farmers subsidised power instead of direct cash transfer, but farm union say they won’t call off their agitation until the laws are fully repealed. The willingness expressed by both sides to explore ways of meeting again comes amid hectic behind-the-scenes efforts to prepare a mutually agreeable agenda, the official quoted above said. “Why are thousands of farmers sitting out in the cold? Only to talk to the government. The government has ruled out a repeal of the laws. But we can still talk to see light at the end of the tunnel,” Saha said. “Withdrawal of three laws is necessary but not sufficient,” said Yogendra Yadav, a senior leader of the agitation, implying farmers also want legal guarantee of support prices. Analysts say economic reforms in mass sectors, such as labour and agriculture, will always be challenging because unlike financial reforms, these sectors are about livelihoods. “The government could suggest new institutions like a regulator for contract farming to gain confidence of farmers,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh , group chief economic adviser of the State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender. The developments came on a day farm groups across several states clashed with police and reiterated their opposition to the laws. Meanwhile, farm organisations from five states representing the All India Kisan Coordination Committee met Tomar for over two hours.This is the fourth group of farmers who have met the agriculture minister to show support to the reforms, which has come as shot in the arm of a government battling the massive agitation against its move to liberalise the farm sector. Tomar told the farm organisations that “intention and policy of the government are clear and farmers are already benefiting from the pro-farmer reforms which will help in increasing the income of farmers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-resume-talks-but-with-some-riders-farmer-unions/story-mP0rWh7tkMMiItK8FdQbSP.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Police deploy cargo containers as barricades at Singhu border||Delhi Police on Monday placed cargo containers at Singhu border near the barricades that divides the security personnel from protesting farmers. Two cargo containers were seen placed at the border on Monday which police officers said are being used to replace with the mud-laden dumpers that have been stationed here since Day One of the agitation. The protests, overall, remained peaceful at Delhi’s borders on Monday.A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said that deployment at Singhu border remained the same as the farmers’ agitation entered into its 18th day on Monday. More public announcement systems were installed on Monday by the Delhi police and a drone was also used to keep an eye on the gathering now spreads across 5-6 kilometers on the Delhi-Sonepat highway.Additional deputy commissioner of police, Jitendra Kumar Meena, said that the situation continued to remain peaceful at Singhu border on Monday. “We ensured sufficient deployment and the situation is being continuously monitored,” he added.The day was also peaceful at Ghazipur border on Monday even as some protesting farmers tried to block the other two carriageways of the Delhi-Meerut expressway earlier in the day. However, they were immediately disbursed by the police and their own leaders.Traffic at the Delhi-Meerut Expressway also remained the same, with one carriageway leading from Ghaziabad to Delhi closed and the other connecting Delhi to Ghaziabad operating as normal. The NH-24 service lane, which has been blocked by the farmers November 27 onwards, also continued to remain closed for traffic on Monday.Chilla border that was closed by the farmers since December 1, and was cleared on Sunday morning, witnessed normal traffic movement on Monday. However, because a small group of farmers had stayed back, still occupying one lane near the central verge at the Gautam Buddha Dwar, on the Delhi - Noida border, the traffic moving from Noida to Delhi slowed down.Apart from Chilla and Ghazipur borders, seven borders that continued to remain completely blocked, are Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Jharoda, Piao Maniyari, and Mangesh in outer and south-western parts of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-deploy-cargo-containers-as-barricades-at-singhu-border/story-cg407Ar8m4YiCbfvPGEbxO.html
15-12-2020||Delhi||Several farmers keep day-long fast, warn of indefinite hunger strike if demands not met||Eighty-five-year-old Randheer Singh from Haryana, 40-year-old Arjun Arya from Madhya Pradesh and 28-year-old Seema Bharti from Uttar Pradesh came together on Monday to observe a 10-hour hunger strike at Delhi’s borders, to strengthen their demand for the withdrawal of the three new farm laws. The farmers said Monday’s ten-hour strike, from 8am to 5pm, was a symbolic protest and it may soon take the shape of an indefinite hunger strike, if the government doesn’t agree to their demands.Also Read| Will resume talks, but with some riders: Farmer unionsSingh, a farmer from Jind, has been camping at Singhu border since November 26 when the police had stopped them from entering Delhi. After more than a fortnight of peaceful protest, farmer groups had given a call for hunger strike on Monday after multiple rounds of talks with the government failed.One of the eldest members of the group to observe the hunger strike, Singh said, “Even on the 18th day of our protest, we are all full of energy as we were on Day One. The movement is not about us individuals anymore. Even if any of us have to sacrifice ourselves, we will not step back,” Singh said.At Singhu border, at least 10 farmers, three of them women, observed the day-long hunger strike. One of them, Seema Bharti, a 28-year-old farmer from Sindhauli in Uttar Pradesh, said if the government remains deaf to their requests, they will intensify the protest. “If nothing works, we will walk into Delhi like we had planned and make the government heed our demands,” she said.Apart from Singhu, a group of 10 farmers observed the fast at Ghazipur border, and another group of 20 of went without food at the Tikri border.At the Chilla border, two farmers were seen observing the ten-hour fast.Rakesh Tikait, 51, leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union Takait (BKU) faction in Uttar Pradesh were among those who kept the fast at Ghazipur. “It’s unfortunate that the government has forced farmers, who provide food to the nation, to go on a hunger strike. We had on Sunday said that we are ready for discussions but the government has not extended an invitation as of now. It government clearly doesn’t think about the farmers,” he said.At Tikri border, at least 20 farmers took part in the hunger strike. Among them was Bogh Mansa, 68, a farmer from Mansa district of Punjab. “The government has neither been able to explain how the new farm laws are good nor been able to tell us why they can’t be withdrawn,” he said.Two farmers took part in the hunger strike at Chilla border. Brushing aside the rumours that farmers have left the site, Yogesh Pratap Singh, 35, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu), said, “There have been rumours that we have backed out but that’s not true. We just opened the road for the convenience of the people. We will sit here and protest for as long as it takes.”A group of students and activists on Monday also participated in a protest held in Shaheedi Park, ITO. “The new farm laws would cause enormous harm to the public, marginal farmers, and urban-rural workers by forcing them to buy essential commodities at inflated prices. Moreover, the introduction of contract farming through another law aims to hand over the reins to corporates. These laws have shown that the BJP government is anti-people, anti-worker and anti-small farmer,” said Dinesh Kumar, member of Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS), a student organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/several-farmers-keep-day-long-fast-warn-of-indefinite-hunger-strike-if-demands-not-met/story-UQUBl0MFkPNfNG0KtKCHQK.html
15-12-2020||India||Little trade in MP mandis in October after passing of farm laws, traders say||Ganeshram Sahu, a farmer from Pipara village in his early 40s, sold toor daal (a pulse) in an auction at Rs 4,782 per quintal at Krishi Upaj Mandi, Karond, Bhopal against the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 6,000 per quintal on Saturday. Similarly, another farmer Suresh from Shekhpura under Parwalia tehsil, sold his gram produce for Rs 4053 per quintal under auction against the MSP of Rs 5100 at the mandi the same day. However, both the farmers had no qualms in accepting the price as the produce was not of fair average quality (FAQ) and they sounded satisfied with the entire auction process as they were supposed to get the payment against the sale within 24 hours. For Ganeshram and Suresh or for that matter Hameer Singh Dangi, another farmer from Bhopal, the farmers’ agitation in Delhi against the central government’s three farm laws has hardly made any difference in their routine life and sale of their produce as of now. But there are doubts if the situation will remain the same in the time to come as is reflected in the low tax collection through Krishi Upaj Mandi tax and farmers numbers dwindling and also a good number of Mandi employees waiting for their salaries for the past more than two months due to low tax collection. The farm laws have made the traders jittery as the business is going down. Karond Krishi Upaj Mandi Traders Association president Harish Gyanchandani said, “The farm laws are nothing but the death knell for the mandis across the state. The reason being, a trader has to pay Mandi tax at 1.70% which was reduced to 0.50% for three months by the state government after their agitation in October, whereas traders dealing with farmers outside the mandis are not required to pay any tax. In this situation, why should a trader come to the mandi to buy agriculture produce? Instead, he will pass some of the amount, saved by not paying the tax, to the farmers to encourage the latter to sell their agriculture produce outside the Mandis.” Also, he added, the traders outside the mandis are not bound by any rules and regulation unlike the traders registered with the Mandis. Hence, farmers might not get adequate amount of money against sale of produce outside the mandi and also the payment is likely to be delayed. Agriculture Mandi Board Employees and Officers Association state president Angira Pandey said, “After the farms laws were enacted, at least 11 Mandis in the state, out of the total 259, registered zero transaction in the month of October and more than 36 mandis had their transactions reduced by more than 90%. Since the tax collection is low, only about 1500 of around 9000 employees engaged with the mandis have been able to get salaries in the past two months or so.” As per a document, the most affected mandis are at Sagar, Panna, Tiakamgarh, Rewa, Satna, Sahdol, Anuppur, Sidhi, Singrauli, Dindori, Chhindwara, Jabalpur, Shivpuri, Sheopur, Bhind, Guna, Mandsaur, Agar-Malwa, Shajapur, Dewas, Neemuch etc..In October, farmers in Madhya Pradesh harvest paddy and soyabean and sell through local mandis and other tradersDwivedi said, “In Mandis the traders are bound to make payment to the farmers within 24 hours. If a trader fails to pay the amount within 24 hours he has to pay additional amount at 1% interest rate within 48 hours and the this interest rate goes up to 5% on failure of payment on subsequent days. Also, till he clears the payment he is not entitled to take part in the auction. As there are transactions outsides there are hardly such restrictions on the traders.” Also Read: ‘Anti-Modi elements part of protests, not farmers’: Union minister Narendra TomarAway from the Mandi, Jitendra Thakur, a farmer who is a resident of Arwalia village and has about 8 acre of land in his family in Bhopal, speaks why farmers’ agitation in Delhi has not affected the farmers in Madhya Pradesh much. “Unlike Madhya Pradesh the Mandi system in Punjab and Haryana is very strong and there is interdependence between farmers and traders. For instance, if a farmer needs a good amount of money for medical treatment, marriages or any other occasion, he gets it from the traders at the mandis. Also, the farmers there don’t have to cover long distances to reach the mandis. That’s why they fear that the new laws will lead to closure of the mandis.”Also Read: ‘For our farmer brothers’: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind KejriwalThakur added, “If our interests like MSP etc are protected in the laws, we would like to save a good amount of money otherwise spent on transportation to mandis for the auction,” he said. Another farmer of the village, Lalaram said, farmers were ready to back the new laws if they turn out to be in their favour.“If transparency is there in the laws and our interest is protected we would welcome it. If there are people who can buy our produce at the time of sowing, then it will give guarantee for our income. But until there are provisions in the law, our interest can’t be protected.” However, a farmer from Dalouda in Mandsaur Jitendra Patidar said, “There are many discrepancies in the new laws. For instance, in Mandis there are checks at several points so that the farmers get payment from traders and the latter are able to do business only after getting licences, whereas, once the traders start buying produce outside the mandis, there is no such scrutiny and licence required for a trader to buy the produce.” Bharatiya Kisan Union state president Anil Yadav said that the farm laws will only benefit the corporate houses. “If the central government really wanted to protect the interest of the farmers why did it not include the provision of MSP in the laws and why the farmers are debarred from approaching the courts in case of any buyer backing out from the contract?,” he asked. Minister for farmers’ welfare and agriculture Kamal Patel said, the state government is committed to safeguarding the interest of farmers.“We have made it clear that Mandis and MSP both will continue to exist. Hence, there is no reason for the farmers or Mandi traders to be worried. The farm laws aim at ensuring enhancing the income of the farmers,” said Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/little-trade-in-mp-mandis-in-october-after-passing-of-farm-laws-traders-say/story-aveDzQYBkckLAYDzSdoERP.html
