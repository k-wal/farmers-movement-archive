06-12-2020||India||Farm talks deadlocked, another round on December 9||The fifth round of talks between protesting farmers and the Centre showed no signs of progress, dealing a blow to the government‚Äôs offer to bring a set of amendments to the three new farm laws that agriculturists say will hurt their interests. Farm unions stuck to their demand for a full withdrawal of the legislation, but agreed to another meeting on December 9. With the stalemate persisting, farmers‚Äô representatives said they would intensify their agitation, as thousands laid siege to the Capital‚Äôs entry points for the tenth straight day. They have called for a nationwide blockade on December 8. The government team, led by agriculture minister Narendra Tomar, railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal and minister of state for commerce Som Prakash, offered to make four major amendments to the set of farm laws during the talks, although they presented no written material, an official said, requesting anonymity. While the government has leaned on its new reform agenda for better crop prices and higher investments in the farm sector, farmers say changes approved by Parliament in September would allow big corporations to exploit them. The government on Saturday proposed new rules for free markets provided for by The Farmers‚Äô Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, one of the laws being opposed by the farmers. Before the meeting, home minister Amit Shah, Tomar, defence minister Rajnath Singh and Goyal met Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an hour to discuss the four amendments they had offered to make. During the talks, the government made four verbal offers. One, it offered to amend the Farmers‚Äô Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, to levy trade fees in new free markets to create a level playing field between these and traditional, government-controlled notified markets. Farmers say free markets, where traders don‚Äôt have to pay any trade fee, will wipe out traditional markets which they depend on for assured prices of staples. Two, the government said it was open to bringing a system of registration for traders in free markets to help bring transparency in farm trade, price levels and traceability of traders. Three, the government said it would bring new clauses to its new contract-farming legislation ‚Äì the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 ‚Äì to strengthen farmers‚Äô land-holding rights. Lastly, officials said it would allow farmers to approach any civil court to settle disputes with traders. Under the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, such disputes were to be settled at the level of a sub-divisional magistrate within 30 days. Farmers feel they should be free to approach higher courts, but the government has maintained that restricting dispute settlement to the local level was done for speedier resolution.The talks stalled at one point, as farmers carried out a silent protest on their seats during the discussions, according to Kavitha Kuruganti of the Women Farmers‚Äô Rights Forum, a participant. ‚ÄúWe rejected the proposal for amendments. All members of delegation have decided to keep silent. The government side was trying to draw us out. There was utter silence from our side,‚Äù Kuruganti said. Farmers showed placards, asking the government to say ‚Äòyes or no‚Äô on the demand for complete withdrawal of the laws, said Rakesh Tikait, the leader of the influential Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait faction). The government sought more time to come up with a ‚Äúconcrete proposal‚Äù and ‚Äúwritten suggestions‚Äù from the farmers would help take the talks forward, Tomar said. He appealed to the farmer leaders to send elderly protesters and children home.Kuruganti said the agriculture minister concluded by complimenting the farmers for holding a ‚Äúdisciplined and peaceful protests, which were free from party political‚Äù. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs quite a distance from the initial view of the government that the farmers were misled and were being instigated.‚Äù The recent reforms in the antiquated farm sector allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers fear the reforms could pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at federally fixed minimum support prices (MSP), erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of private buyers. ‚ÄúThe issue is not about one particular clause, but about the direction in which the Govt of India is pushing farming in India,‚Äù said Avik Saha, the secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-talks-deadlocked-another-round-on-december-9/story-LyTx1DrdohD6tQt36nACaJ.html

When St√©phane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN Secretary-General, was asked about the farmers‚Äô protest at a daily news briefing on Friday, he replied: ‚ÄúAs to the question of India, what I would say to you is what I‚Äôve said to others when raising these issues is that people have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and authorities need to let them do so.‚Äù The reporter who asked the question also contended the farmers involved in the protest were being met with ‚Äúrepressive measures‚Äù and this had a bearing on India‚Äôs democracy. Dujarric responded by saying: ‚ÄúWe want to see people have a voice in their lives.‚Äù Trudeau was the first world leader to comment on the farmers‚Äô protest, telling a Facebook video interaction on Tuesday that the situation in India was ‚Äúconcerning‚Äù.

06-12-2020||India||Odisha farmers block roads to protest against centralised paddy procurement system||Hundreds of farmers stacked their paddy produce on major roads in various parts of Western Odisha on Saturday, demanding the withdrawal of the centralised token system for procurement of the crop in the state-run market yards.Farmers, under the banner of the Paschim Odisha Krushak Sangathan Samanway Samiti (POKSSS), demanded the procurement of paddy from across the region on the basis of the harvest report, submitted by the agriculture department of the districts concerned.POKSSS convenor Lingaraj said the paddy procurement system should be decentralised.The government has decided to procure 19 quintals of paddy per acre of irrigated land and 13 quintals of rain-fed fields. But the decision has been taken in Bhubaneswar.‚ÄúThis should be taken at the district level. In a decentralised procurement system, the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS) play a pivotal role and generate tokens for selling of the crop in the market yard. But the tokens are being generated from Bhubaneswar,‚Äù he alleged.Bargarh sub-divisional police officer Deepak Kumar Gochhayat said the paddy growers blocked the National Highway- 53 at Attabira for more than five hours. ‚ÄúAs the people faced severe difficulties, we were forced to take around 40 farmers into custody to clear the road,‚Äù he said.In Sambalpur, the farmers parked their paddy-laden vehicles at Sindurpankh on NH-53, protesting against the ‚Äúfaulty‚Äù procurement system and refused to discuss with the district officials.However, police detained at least 15 farmers there to clear the road in the evening.Farmers in Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sonepur and Balangir districts also took out rallies and held sit-ins to protest against the centralised procurement system.Food supplies and consumer welfare minister R P Swain said that some groups with vested interests have been agitating in the name of farmers to disturb the procurement process. He said senior officers of the department have been posted in each district to oversee the process and ensure transparency in the system.‚ÄúHad the farmers raised the issue at the district level procurement committee (DLPC), the government would have considered their demand. More than 56 per cent paddy has already been procured in 16 districts. It is not possible to revise the decision now,‚Äù the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-farmers-block-roads-to-protest-against-centralised-paddy-procurement-system/story-LldyjlkQn99ddCuX44cdqM.html
06-12-2020||Delhi||Chilla border completely shut as farmers block Delhi to Noida carriageway as well||Chila border (Delhi-Noida Link Road) was completely blocked by farmers on Saturday morning, bringing traffic to a standstill and forcing the police to increase the deployment in the area. Senior police officers said as the road leads to multiple hospitals in east Delhi as well as Noida, they have requested protesters to open a passage for emergency vehicles. Other borders points that are completely shut, as on Saturday, are Singhu and Tikri borders, where farmers have been camping since November 27 to protest the Centre‚Äôs new farm laws.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said until Friday, only one carriageway (from Noida to Delhi) was blocked by protesters while the other one (from Delhi to Noida) was open to traffic. ‚ÄúOn Saturday morning, farmer groups blocked that carriageway as well, leaving no scope for traffic movement,‚Äù he said.Joint commissioner of police (eastern range) Alok Kumar said they are negotiating with farmer leaders at Chilla border to open one carriageway or at least give a passage for emergency vehicles. ‚ÄúOnce before, too, they had shut the Chilla border completely, but we had convinced them to open one carriageway. Our talks are in progress,‚Äù he said.The DCP also said since the number of farmers have also increased at Chila border from Saturday, the police have accordingly stepped up deployment. ‚ÄúAdequate presence of paramilitary and police personnel along with teams of the rapid action force in riot gear was maintained at the border point throughout the day,‚Äù he said.Satish Tomar, IT in-charge of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, who is camping at Chilla border, said more farmers were on their way to Chilla border on Saturday when they were detained by police in Jewar. ‚ÄúIn protest, we blocked the other carriageway also at Chilla border. The farmers were released by evening and they have reached Chilla. But we are continuing with the blockade of the Chilla border completely. If they try to remove us forcefully, we will march to Jantar Mantar,‚Äù Tomar said.Apart from Chilla border, the traffic situation at the other Delhi border points remained the same as on Friday. A senior police officer said that on Thursday, the situation was bad as the closure of the border had happened suddenly and during office hours. ‚ÄúOn Friday, people got used to the diversions and on Saturday, because the traffic volume was low, the situation was much better. However, because main routes at the Gazipur border (on NH-24) also remained closed to traffic from Gaziabad to Delhi, people were advised to avoid NH-24 and use Apsara, Bhopra or DND Flyway instead to reach Delhi. Since these alternative routes are narrow as compared to the main roads, they witnessed slow-moving traffic,‚Äù the officer said, requesting anonymity.Delhi Police kept making regular updates on social media to keep commuters informed about the diversions and closures.The movement of the vehicles on Anand Vihar-Ghazipur road and other routes by which motorists were entering Delhi from Ghaziabad also saw slow-moving traffic on Saturday. The traffic remained diverted on other routes such as the DND Flyway, Kalindi Kunj, Dallupura, Khoda, New Ashok Nagar, and Kondli borders.The other border points fully closed since Wednesday are Jharoda, Lampur, Auchandi, Safiabad, Piao Maniyari, and Saboli. Badusarai border remained open only to light motor vehicles such as cars and two-wheelers, while Jhatikara border was open only to two-wheelers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chilla-border-completely-shut-as-farmers-block-delhi-to-noida-carriageway-as-well/story-hlRraLqIQ6J2XLbM7oEGhO.html

If they need to reach out to the peaceful protesters, they will have to go through us. Nihangs mean safety and security. We are here to provide our people safety and we do not mean any harm. We do not endorse violence in any way,‚Äù said Gurdeep Singh, a member of the group, from Ludhiana.Condemning the violence that left many protesters injured on the first day of the agitation when police stopped them from marching into the city, he said Nihang groups were spread over the country and assembled whenever required. ‚ÄúWe do not want the violence to be repeated. We have our men from Delhi, Haryana and many parts of Punjab joining us. At present, there are about 500 of us,‚Äù he said.The horses are tethered next to the concrete barriers placed by police. On a pole, in between, rested the bird, around which the Nihangs were busy preparing their meal of the day. The area where they cook is considered sacred and no one other than a Nihang is allowed near the spot.Another Khalsa fauji (warrior) Aman Singh, from Ropar, said their fight was not a religious one. ‚ÄúWe are here to fight for our people‚Äôs rights. We have weapons but we will never resort to violence. The weapons symbolise safety. Our presence means that no one will be oppressed or ill-treated.‚ÄùAnother Nihang, Satnam Singh Baaghi, who joined the group from Maharashtra, said there are more of them coming. ‚ÄúOur number will only swell. We will only move forward,‚Äù he said.Singh said they were keeping an eye on any anti-social elements who may try to malign the peaceful protest. ‚ÄúOur men are vigilant and we are keeping an eye on anyone who looks like an outsider. They are intercepted and only let in after their credentials are verified,‚Äù he added.While Nihangs were spotted only at the Singhu border in a noticeable number, at the Ghazipur protest site too participants sounded concerned about anti-social elements.Digambar Singh, 40, a farmer from Bijnor and president of the UP unit of the Bhartiya Kisan Union‚Äôs youth wing, said, ‚ÄúPeople are trying to politicise the protests. We‚Äôve had political cadres come in and sport caps from farmers‚Äô bodies to mislead public and get their agenda across. Our volunteers keep a strict eye on who is doing what at the protest sites.‚Äù While addressing the gathering on the highway, Singh told the farmers that they must be alert and not allow anyone to harm the legitimacy of the agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-ensure-peace-khalsa-fauj-forms-ring-of-security-at-singhu/story-dir6elcChHMugCndToUN7M.html
06-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers camping at Burari move to join protests at Ghazipur||Davinder Singh, 27, a farmer from Pooranpur in Uttar Pradesh, has been keeping a track of protests that erupted in Punjab after the Centre passed the new farm laws two months ago. Active on social media platforms, Singh received numerous messages that farmers from different parts of the country were marching to Delhi to demand a repeal of the laws. On November 27, Singh, and four other farmers, finally joined the protests.‚ÄúWe packed some woollen wear, a few essentials, clothes, and drove from Pooranpur to Burari. Our friends from the village later brought in the ration, mattresses, tarpaulin sheets, bamboo sticks, gas cylinders, stove, utensils, and other items in trucks and tractors. The supplies are enough for us to last at least six months,‚Äù Singh said.However, nearly a week after setting things up at the Nirankari ground at Burari ‚Äì the government‚Äôs designated spot for farmer protests -- Singh and his friends had to move again. ‚ÄúWe thought our issues would be addressed here. We waited for the government to come to meet us and listen to our concerns, but no one came. This is why we decided to pack all our essentials and drive to Ghazipur to participate in the road blockade,‚Äù he said.Every evening, he draws a yellow tarpaulin sheet from his truck over the red cycle track on Ghazipur flyover and ties it to the railing on the road. Singh and his friends then sleep below this canopy on some mattresses, with blankets being their only protection against Delhi‚Äôs harsh winters. Every morning, the tarpaulin sheet is folded back and the poles used to erect them go back to resting against the railing. Singh, a first-time protester, said it is challenging to live on the road and to deal with the possibility of moving from one place to another with all their belongings. ‚ÄúIf the talks with the government are inconclusive today, we will move further inside the city. We are aware that it means moving with our belongings once again. But there is no other option,‚Äù said Rambir Singh, 63, another farmer from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh who reached Delhi on November 30. He too was among those who had camped at Burari Ground. (QUOTE WILL BE UPDATED) Several protesters, who have travelled from different states, said that apart from the bigger issues of non availability of toilets, water, and having to sleep in the open, there are smaller problems that people fail to notice. ‚ÄúFor instance, if we have to cook something or make tea, we have to take out food portions from our polythene packets and then put them back in the vehicles,‚Äù said Davinder. ‚ÄúThis is no way to live.‚ÄùAlthough Singh was not stopped on his journey from Pooranpur to Burari, others weren‚Äôt that lucky. Tajinder Singh, a member of the Trai Kisan Sangathan, said that they had left with all the protest paraphernalia including banners and poles, food, clothes, blankets, and other essentials on November 26 from Uddham Singh Nagar in tractors and vehicles. But were stopped at Rampur. The group had to camp there for two days before moving on again.‚ÄúAfter continuing our journey from Rampur on November 28, we learnt midway that protesters had gathered at Burari so we went there. We waited there for the government to address the issues of farmers but nothing happened. So, three days later, around 500 farmers from Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh left the grounds and came here to Ghazipur,‚Äù he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-camping-at-burari-move-to-join-protests-at-ghazipur/story-1WxTwEda0v7FTN8cSD1kFO.html

They protested from 12am to 1pm and raised slogans against the central government. They demanded that the Centre roll back the decision to introduce the farm laws and continue with the old system. The bus stand wore a deserted look as the gates were closed by the members of the unions. Chaos was also witnessed outside as private operators parked the buses on the road which led to traffic snarls. The one-hour protest affected the movement of over 80 buses and passengers had a hard time finding buses for their desired route. Due to the farmers‚Äô agitation in Delhi, over nine Volvo buses (three of Punbus and six of PRTC) operating from Ludhiana to Delhi ISBT and Ludhiana to Gurgaon have been suspended. Basant Singh, 65, said, ‚ÄúI have been trying to find a bus for Malerkotla for the last half an hour. But, due to the protest, we are stuck at the bus stand. My wife has knee problems and cannot stand for long hours. It is sheer harassment for the public and protests must be held outside central government offices.‚ÄùAnother passenger, Sunita Rani, who wanted to take a bus to Chandigarh with her two-year-old son, said, ‚ÄúI was not aware of the strike and reached the bus stand at noon. There was a chaos outside and took 10 minutes to cross the road. After inquiring, I found out that the service will resume after 1pm. I thought about taking a bus from outside, but private operators were charging double.‚Äù District president of Punbus Contractual Employees‚Äô Union, Shamsher Singh, said, ‚ÄúIf the central government does not accept the farmers‚Äô plea in the next meeting, then the joint action committee of Punjab Roadways and Punbus will launch an agitation.‚Äù||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farm-bills-ludhiana-passengers-left-in-the-lurch-as-punjab-roadways-staff-stage-strike/story-LRdTJR2pP1J9C8JdkJ5AaP.html

What was the hurry, the entire country was focussed on the fallout of Covid-19, the economic, social, health fallout? But the government was busy surreptitiously bringing ordinances to help its industrialist-corporate friends,‚Äù Khera said.‚ÄúWhere was the need to bring these legislations so fast, you suspended the opposition parties from Parliament, you did not follow parliamentary procedure and hurried through the passing of the bills, why was the hurry,‚Äù he added.Khera said the government would have sought suggestions from the farmers before introducing the legislation if it was really bothered about them. The Congress leader said that the entire nation was witnessing the plight of protesting farmers, who are camping outside at national capital borders during winter nights waiting for the government to listen to them.‚ÄúWhat we are seeing today is the result of a conspiracy between the government and its corporate friends, wherein the victim would be the farmer, and the farmer knows this,‚Äù Khera claimed.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are sitting on various borders of the national capital since November 26 to protest against three farm laws - Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020- cleared by the government during the monsoon session of the Parliament.Leaders of farmers‚Äô unions met the central leadership on Saturday to resolve the deadlock.
