The police termed the alleged storming of the fort by the protesters a “well-planned conspiracy.” According to the charge sheet, the accused came well equipped to “cause mayhem” and use the Red Fort premises as their new protest site.The police also attached hundreds of clips gathered from various photographers, CCTV cameras and those posted on social and media as evidence to show how protesters indulged in violence while carrying "weapons" like swords, rods, pharsi (saintie), wooden legs of a cots and spears.The charge sheet running into 3224 pages was submitted before a duty metropolitan magistrate in Tis Hazari court on Thursday.On January 26, farmers protesting against the three agriculture laws carried out a rally at demanding Centre to repeal the new reforms. However, the protests turned violent as some of the protesters carrying swords barged into the Mughal-era fort tried to hoist a religiously significant flag, Nishan Sahib, at the ramparts of the monument.Following the violence, two separate cases were registered by the Delhi Police. While one case involving serious charges such as rioting, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy was registered on the police’s complaint, the second case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which is the custodian of the Mughal-era fort. Sidhu was arrested in both cases and is currently out on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/red-fort-violence-court-to-pronounce-order-on-delhi-police-charge-sheet-today-101622184891147.html
28-05-2021||India||'Heed public opinion': Chidambaram hits out at Centre over farmers' protests||Senior Congress leader P Chidamabaram on Friday lashed out at the Centre saying that it is trying to use the coronavirus pandemic in its favour to change the narrative over the ongoing farmers' agitation at the Delhi borders. "The new spin is 'prolonging the agitation in the midst of a pandemic is unconscionable,'" Chidambaram wrote on Twitter."The obvious counter is 'prolonging the controversial farm laws in the midst of a pandemic is unconscionable,'" he added.Calling on the government to scrap the three contentious farm laws, Chidambaram said, "If the government is a servant of the people, it should heed public opinion... and begin fresh consultations.""The farmers are determined, the government is stubborn, '' he also wrote on the micro-blogging site.The farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have camped on major national highways for six months now, demanding a repeal of the laws. The protests continued as the second wave of Covid-19 raged in the country and the daily numbers rose at unprecedented levels.During the rise in Covid-19 cases, several government leaders appealed to farmers to call off their mass protests over fears that it may emerge as a viral "super-spreader" event.However, agitating farmers said that the new agricultural laws make farmer livelihoods vulnerable to corporate agri-businesses is itself a life and death matter, and continued with their sit-ins.On May 26, farmers observed a "black day" to mark six months of the agitation. They are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The laws open up the agriculture sector to private players and have been hailed by the government as "historic" and long-needed reforms. However, the farmers fear that the legislation will end the mandi system where they are assured of the minimum support price for their produce.However, protesting farmers say that it will open up the vast agriculture sector to a big corporation and would leave them at the mercy of them without any legal guarantee.The Centre has held several rounds of talks with farmers' representatives but so far they have failed to be fruitful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heed-public-opinion-chidambaram-hits-out-at-centre-over-farmers-protests-101622178285953.html
