The CM must explain his silence when women were attacked, sustained head injuries, tear gas shells were fired. Where are his tears now,” Bhukkal asked.Khattar and other BJP leaders had in March slammed the Congress after former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda rode a tractor being pulled by some of the opposition party's women legislators to protest the rise in fuel prices.Khattar had expressed his anguish and said in the Assembly, “This treatment to women MLAs was worse than bonded labour.”Shakuntala Khatak said when she was pulling the tractor in a symbolic way, the Chief Minister had said that he was deeply pained.“The State Women's Commission went a step further and had also issued a notice to the Leader of Opposition (Bhupinder Singh Hooda). Now the whole country is watching what happened in Hisar. The Chief Minister is not shedding any tears now, the Women's Commission is not giving any notice to anyone. Why this double character,” she questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-congress-seeks-cm-khattar-s-apology-over-alleged-lathhicharge-on-farmers-in-hisar-101621355374409.html
