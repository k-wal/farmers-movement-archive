BJP's efforts not to make citizens' livelihoods issues, such as the anti-farmer central agri laws and the anti-worker labour codes, as poll plank has clearly failed."We now appeal to farmers from all over India to strengthen their resistance and join the movement in greater numbers. This movement will continue to spread the democratic values that our Constitution espouses and will further strengthen itself till our demands are fulfilled," read a statement from the SKM.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- for over four months, demanding a repeal of the three agri reform laws enacted by the Centre in September last year.Clarifying that the ongoing farmers' agitation won't end until their demands are met, the farmers' union said it is time that the BJP listens to people's mandate in different states, which includes the sentiment of farmers, and immediately repeal the three agricultural laws and give legal guarantee to procurement at minimum support price."The government, instead of making peasants and workers their enemies, should fight against the corona pandemic and the livelihood and economic crises in the country," it added.The Centre says the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assembly-poll-results-vindicate-stand-of-agitating-farmers-samyukta-kisan-morcha-101619974912112.html
