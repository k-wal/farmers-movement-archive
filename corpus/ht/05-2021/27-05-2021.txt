27-05-2021||Delhi||Farmers observe ‘Black day’ to mark six months of protest at Delhi borders||Farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders marked six months of their agitation on Wednesday by observing a “Black Day” and burning effigies of the government, and once again demanding that the Centre repeal the three farm laws promulgated in September 2020. The farmers also celebrated Buddha Poornima at the protest sites at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri on Wednesday.While black flags were hoisted across tents and trolleys at the protest sites, farmers’ collective Samyukta Kisan Morcha said people from several villages and cities also shared pictures of black flags hoisted atop houses as well as pictures of them attired in black, in a symbolic show of support to the agitation at the Delhi borders.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Singhu, Ghazipur, and Tikri, since November to press the government into repealing the new laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses.“From across India, visuals have arrived of farmers and their supporters expressing solidarity with the protesting farmers, and anger against the BJP government. Lakhs of Indians responded to the call put out by SKM and wore black clothes, hoisted black flags atop their homes and vehicles, and assembled in small groups to burn effigies of the BJP government,” SKM said in a statement.“We had arranged for black flags and they got delivered on Tuesday. We carried the effigies around, raising slogans, before burning them,” said Tejvir Singh, a farmer from Ambala district in Punjab. “More people are expected to join us on Thursday and in the coming days as the harvesting season is now over.”The continuous rain in the Capital last week, and the deadly second wave of the pandemic since March, have led to a thinning of the numbers at the protest sites. But, the farmers said they will continue the agitation till their demands are met.“Even though the farmer agitation has had to continue for six long months, with farmers suffering many hardships including the martyrdom of more than 470 farmers so far, we are prepared to continue (with the protest) for however long it takes; the determination and resolve of farmers remain strong and firm,” the farmer leaders said in a joint press statement on Wednesday.Experts had warned that such a gathering could turn into a super spreader event, particularly at a time when cases have been receding in the Capital after a devastating few weeks and a hard lockdown.But SKM said they were taking several steps to arrest the spread of the virus at protest sites. “We put up the sound system [loudspeakers] closer to trolleys so that farmers would not have to come towards the stage to listen to speeches. We invited doctors to speak on stage and educate the farmers on precautions, symptoms and Covid-appropriate behaviour,” ’SKM media coordinator Harinder Singh had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-observe-black-day-to-mark-six-months-of-protest-at-delhi-borders-101622057415397.html
27-05-2021||India||Tamil Nadu govt to bring resolution against new farm legislation||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Wednesday said that the government will bring a resolution in the assembly, asking the Centre to withdraw the three farm laws.The statement coincided with various farmer unions holding a ‘black day’ protest across the country to mark six months of their agitation against the three laws: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.In this, Tamil Nadu will join several other non-BJP and non-NDA-led states, which have passed assembly resolutions opposing legislations promulgated through ordinances last year during the first wave of the pandemic. These include Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Kerala, and West Bengal, with the eastern state passing the resolution in January, two months before the assembly elections there.A resolution for the rollback of the laws was an election promise of Stalin’s party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The CM said that six months have passed but the Union government hasn’t tried to have a constructive dialogue with the farmers to resolve the issue or taken steps to revoke the three farm laws that were passed in haste. “This is a matter of concern,” he said.The previous All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government, an ally of the BJP, had supported the legislation and continues to back it. “We supported the new laws because they allow the farmers to directly sell their produce through which they can gain more profits,” said AIADMK spokesperson C Vaigaichelvan.But when asked if AIADMK will not back the resolution when it’s tabled in the assembly, Vaigaichelvan said the party will hold a meeting to arrive at a fresh decision.Stalin drops cases against politicians in anti-Sterlite protestsThe Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday announced that it was withdrawing 38 cases against political leaders in connection with the anti-Sterlite protests in Thoothukudi in May 2018 in which 13 people had been killed in police firing. This includes Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief Vaiko, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam founder T T V Dhinakaran, Communist Party of India leader R Nallakannu, and Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam treasurer Premalatha Vijayakanth.This was based on the recommendations by the Justice Aruna Jegadeesan commission in an interim report, the government said in a statement.Last week, cases against the protesters were withdrawn, and 93 people were offered compensation.However, cases against other protesters filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and those pending in the Supreme Court have not been withdrawn.The protesters had been demanding the closure of a copper smelting factory owned by Vedanta when things turned violent on the 100th day, leading to police firing on May 22, 2018. A day later, the then AIADMK government appointed the Justice Jegadeesan committee to investigate the case and shut down the factory for environmental violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-govt-to-bring-resolution-against-new-farm-legislation-101622054414770.html
