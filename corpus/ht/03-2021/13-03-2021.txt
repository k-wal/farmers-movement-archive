Talking about her arrest, trial and judicial custody, Ravi said that even when she was produced before the court, she was unaware if she would get any legal assistance.“As I stood in that courtroom, desperately searching for my lawyers, I came to terms with the fact that I would have to defend myself. I had no idea whether there was legal assistance available so when the judge asked me if I have anything to say, I decided to speak my mind. Before I knew it, I was sent to 5 days in police custody,” she wrote in a statement published on her social media accounts on Saturday evening.She further added that in the entire ordeal her autonomy was violated. “My autonomy was violated; my photographs were splashed all over the news; my actions were pronounced guilty - not in the court of law, but on flat screens by seekers of TRPs. I sat there, unaware of the many abstractions made of me in order to satiate their idea of me,” she wrote.In jail, she realised how talking about climate change had become a crime but also learnt that her grandparents, who were farmers, birthed climate activist in her. "At the end of the five days I was shifted to Judicial Custody for 3 days, I wondered when it became a crime to think the most basic elements of sustenance on this planet were as much mine as theirs," she wrote.Also read: ‘Going to Nandigram…’ -BKU’s Rakesh Tikait says ‘BJP has robbed the country'Before ending her statement, she made case for those who didn’t get the support she received. “The immense outpour of love from the people gave me strength. I am grateful for everyone who stood by me. The past few days have been beyond painful, yet I know that I am one of the privileged. I was lucky enough to have excellent pro bono legal assistance but what of all those who do not?” read her statement.On February 23, a Delhi court had granted bail to Ravi, days after the Delhi Police arrested her for allegedly editing a social media document, or a toolkit, about the ongoing farmer protest against the three central laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/my-autonomy-was-violated-disha-ravi-s-statement-after-28-days-of-arrest-101615649612291.html
13-03-2021||India||Permanent shelters come up at Delhi border as farm leaders warn they won’t budge||The Kisan Social Army, a group backing the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws, has constructed permanent shelters at the Tikri border in Delhi as union leaders said protests will continue at the borders of the national capital for the rest of the NDA government's tenure."These houses are strong and permanent just like the will of the farmers. So far, 25 houses have been built," Anil Malik of Kisan Social Army was quoted as saying by news agency ANI on Saturday. Close to 1,000-2,000 similar houses will be built in the coming days, Malik told ANI.One of the key farm leaders, Narendra Tikait, said on Thursday farmers are ready to stay put on Delhi’s borders to protest against three agricultural laws for the remaining three and half years of the Modi government's second term and the stir cannot be "culled" any which way the Centre tries. "This government has a misconception, probably because it never faced such kind of protest, but we have seen agitations and been part of those for 35 years. This government only has an experience of facing smaller protests and of getting those culled through various tactics," he told PTI.Farmers, hailing from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28 last year, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops. The Centre has denied allegations that it was trying to put an end to MSP and the mandi systems.The government, which held 11 rounds of formal talks with protesting unions before the negotiations completely broke down, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmers. It has emphasised that the protests by farmers must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity even as the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that some vested interest groups have tried to mobilise international support against the country. The remarks from the MEA came as a push back after several foreign leaders extended support to the farmers’ protest or questioned the government’s handling of the snowballing demonstrations.The MEA has maintained most of the remarks on the internal matter of the country didn’t reflect India’s democratic ethos or the government’s outreach to the farmers."Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken," the MEA said in a statement last month after comments by celebrities, including pop icon Rihanna, on the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/permanent-shelters-come-up-at-delhi-border-as-farm-leaders-warn-they-won-t-budge-101615612963960.html
13-03-2021||India||Farmers hold protest in Haryana's Kurukshetra during event organised by JJP||A group of farmers under the banner of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) tried to force its way into the Circuit House here on Saturday, where workers of the ruling JJP had organised a function to honour a few "safai karamcharis" to mark the birthday of party chief Ajay Singh Chautala.A large police contingent was deployed in the area as a precautionary measure. The doors of the Circuit House, a state government building, were locked to prevent the farmers from entering its premises, officials said.Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) MLA Ram Karan Kala was to preside over the function. However, he skipped the event.The farmers raised slogans against the JJP MLAs and said they had not backed the opposition's no-confidence motion against the Haryana government, which was brought on farmers' issues.A leader of the farmers said they wanted to meet the MLA who had assured them sometime ago that he would support the farmers' agitation against the Centre's new farm laws but failed to support the no-confidence motion moved by the Congress against the BJP-JJP government in the state Assembly.With the intervention of the police, the farmers agreed to disperse after the organisers decided to cancel the function.Kurukshetra Station House Officer (SHO) Devinder Walia said the police kept the doors of the Circuit House locked for about an hour-and-a-half because the agitating farmers were adamant on entering the building.The protesters said they wanted to "blacken the faces of those holding the function", he said.Meanwhile, another group of farmers staged a protest and raised slogans against Independent MLA Dharam Pal Gonder, who was to attend an event in neighbouring Karnal district, alleging that the legislator had not stood with the peasants as he had voted against the opposition's no-confidence motion against the state government.The farmers reached near the spot in Karnal's Nissing, where the MLA from the Nilokheri Assembly segment was to attend an event in a "gaushala" (cow shelter).The protesters, who were carrying black flags, claimed that Gonder skipped the event in view of their protest."We had gone to Gonder's residence on March 9, where his wife was present, and we requested the family that the legislator should stand with the farmers and support the no-confidence motion. However, he chose not to support the farmers and voted against the motion," one of the protesters said.Another protester said they will not allow those MLAs, who chose not to stand with the farmers, to hold public meetings in villages."We will not allow them to hold meetings in villages till the farm laws are repealed," he said.Farmers from the state had blocked traffic in Jind and Hisar on Thursday while another group protested outside BJP MLA Asseem Goel's residence in Ambala, a day after the no-confidence motion against the Haryana government was defeated in the Assembly.The BJP-JJP government in Haryana survived the floor test on Wednesday, comfortably defeating the no-confidence motion moved against it by the main opposition Congress.The motion was defeated following a division of votes. Fifty-five members voted against the motion while 32 backed it.All the 10 MLAs of the JJP and five of the seven independent lawmakers voted against the no-confidence motion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-hold-protest-in-haryana-s-kurukshetra-during-event-organised-by-jjp-101615629814799.html
