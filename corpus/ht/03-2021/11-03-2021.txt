He also said that teams will visit the poll-bound states and union territory to appeal to the people to vote for any other party.“It has been 105 days of farmers' protest. We have decided to form teams that will visit the 5 states where elections are going to be held. An appeal will be made that people can vote for anyone but not BJP. I'll go to Kolkata,” Rajewal said in Chandigarh as reported by news agency ANI.Farmers, in their thousands, have been protesting against the Centre’s contentious farm laws for over 100 days since November. According to them, the laws will take away the minimum support price (MSP) and will allow a wider scope for exploitation by private players and big corporates.The farmers have made it clear that they would not bring an end to the protests until all three laws were repealed, while the Centre has refused to do so. Several rounds of talks between the two parties have ended in a stalemate.Four states and one union territory are set to have their Assembly polls - West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry.The BJP, in West Bengal, is the main opposition to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). After managing to grab a meagre three seats in the state’s 2016 Assembly elections, the party grabbed 19 out of 42 seats in the Lok Sabha polls.They have managed to poach several former TMC stalwarts like Suvendu Adhikari, Dinesh Trivedi and Rajib Banerjee ahead of the polls and have also roped in senior actor Mithun Chakraborty.Party heavyweights like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath have campaigned in the state as the polls near.The polling process for the state will be stretched over a month and will span over eight polling phases. It will begin on March 27 and conclude on April 29, with the result scheduled to be announced on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/farmer-leader-will-visit-kolkata-dissuade-people-from-voting-for-bjp-101615467010633.html

He, however, did not condemn the government’s stand against the discussion. “I don't blame the government of India for doing its job, for speaking up for its point of view. But we must recognise there is another point of view and that in democracies, elected representatives are free to air their point of view on this,” Tharoor added.The Congress MP was referring to a debate on Monday in the British parliament, which was a response to a public petition signed by more than 115,000 people. During the discussion, Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democratic, and Scottish National Party lawmakers called on the Boris Johnson government to raise their concerns about the handling of the protest and media freedoms in India.On Tuesday, British envoy Alex Ellis was summoned by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and served a demarche or formal diplomatic representation that conveyed India’s “strong opposition to the unwarranted and tendentious discussion on agricultural reforms in India in the British Parliament”, a statement from the external affairs ministry said. The foreign secretary said the debate “represented a gross interference in the politics of another democratic country”, and he advised British MPs to refrain from “practising vote bank politics by misrepresenting events, especially in relation to another fellow democracy”.The Indian mission in London called the debate a “distinctly one-sided discussion”. “We deeply regret that rather than a balanced debate, false assertions – without substantiation or facts – were made, casting aspersions on the largest functioning democracy in the world and its institutions,” the mission said in a statement.According to Tharoor, it wasn’t something “so surprising”. “We should take it as a normal give and take that happen between democracies,” he told ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-like-we-discuss-palestine-shashi-tharoor-on-farm-stir-debate-in-uk-parliament-101615442902095.html
