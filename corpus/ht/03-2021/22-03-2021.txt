Tikait said there were many such bills in the pipeline relating to milk, electricity, seeds and fertilizers, which were also being prepared to be introduced.He claimed that the privitisation of nationalised banks will result in farmers who have availed loans through Kisan Credit Cards, by pledging lands, will be forced to part with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-farmers-should-lay-siege-on-bengaluru-just-like-delhi-rakesh-tikait-101616350549738.html
