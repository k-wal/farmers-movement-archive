Being a purely religious body, by getting involved into the farmers' agitation, which comprises farmers from all religions and castes, the SGPC is going completely against the mandate given to it under 'The Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925' and 'Punjab Act 8 of 1925'. Not only the SGPC is going beyond its brief by doing all this but is also giving the farmers agitation a religious colour, which is extremely unfortunate and uncalled for."Pointing out that Punjab has always been a volatile state, Grewal said, "From a responsible person like you, who is holding an important chair of SGPC president, any such highly controversial statement can have serious repercussions, which could be extremely detrimental for the peace of Punjab.""History will not forgive you for giving a religious colour to this agitation", said Grewal, a former national secretary of the BJP, as he appealed to Kaur that SGPC should strictly desist from any such activity that brings disgrace to a religious institution and should completely stay away from the farmers' agitation.On March 4, Kaur had also stated that the ongoing langar and moveable toilet facilities will continue to operate besides announcing that each family of the deceased farmers would be given ₹1 lakh each as a mark of tribute towards their contribution in the struggle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sgpc-giving-religious-colour-to-farmers-protest-bjp-s-harjit-singh-grewal-101615360965784.html

The three were booked for sedition, promoting hatred among groups and criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) after the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeted a ‘toolkit’.Delhi Police’s special cell, while opposing Muluk’s anticipatory bail plea, alleged before Additonal Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana that he participated in a conspiracy that “stretched across continents and covered people of multiple nationalities”.The judge said no coercive action will be taken till March 15 against Muluk and co-accused Mumbai lawyer Nikita Jacob, whose pre-arrest bail plea, was also heard simultaneously.In a reply filed in the court on Tuesday, the police have claimed that Muluk is receiving routine foreign remittances from a person named Christopher Mills, a resident of UK, while working as a volunteer for a company named Climate 2025, of which very limited information is available on the internet.The police said Muluk has “failed to satisfactorily explain the actions and activities that he undertook in lieu of the funds received on a monthly basis”.Muluk’s lawyer Sarim Naved refused to comment on the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nikita-shantanu-get-protection-from-arrest-till-march-15-101615321057677.html
