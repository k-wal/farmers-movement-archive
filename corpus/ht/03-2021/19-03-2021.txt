The UK government firmly believes that freedom of speech and the right for peaceful protest are vital to any democracy but we also accept that if a protest crosses the line into illegality, security forces in a democracy have the right to enforce law and order," UK Minister of State for Asia Nigel Adams said during a debate in Parliament complex on the issue of peaceful protests and press freedoms in India.On January 26, violence broke out during the farmer tractor rally on the occasion of Republic Day.Protestors broke barricades to enter Delhi and indulged in vandalism across several parts of the national capital during their tractor rally organised to protest against the Centre's three new farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-us-senators-say-farm-laws-internal-indian-policy-urges-biden-govt-to-engage-with-pm-modi-on-farmers-protest-101616130194234.html
