'Annadaatas' demand their rights, government commits atrocities."Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several border points of Delhi, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of the three new farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.The government has denied allegations that it is trying to put an end to the MSP and the "mandi" (wholesale market) systems through the new laws. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also assured the farmers that the MSP system would continue.Farmer leaders have made it clear that they would not settle for anything less than a repeal of the new agriculture laws.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the Centre in a tweet in Hindi.She said, "100 days of farmers' struggle, of fight for rights, of respect for 'annadaatas', of the path shown by Gandhiji, Sardar (Vallabhbhai) Patel, Nehruji, (Lal Bahadur) Shastriji, Shaheed Bhagat Singh."With the hashtag '100DaysOfBJParrogance', she said, "100 days of BJP government's arrogance, of assault on farmers, of lies and scorn for farmers."Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the defeat of the BJP in the upcoming assembly elections in four states Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Assam, and and Union Territory Puducherry will lead to the victory of the farmers."The Modi government is blinded by the arrogance of its majority. It sees nothing but selfish power. Democracy is run in a 'public' way, not 'arbitrary way'," he said.The defeat of the Modi government in these states will open the way for the farmers getting minimum support price and the withdrawal of "anti-farmer black laws", Surjewala said in a statement."Let us pave the way for 'BJP's defeat' and 'victory of the country'," he said.The BJP government has crossed all limits of "cruelty and barbarity" in dealing with the protesting farmers in these last 100 days, Surjewala alleged."Farmers were hit by water cannons in the bitter cold, roads were dug, sticks were used on them, tear gas shells were fired. Not only this, attempts were made to book them under the anti-terrorism laws and even spikes of nails and thorns were put in their way," he said.The farmers tried their best to resolve the issue through talks but the government having an approach of 'Hum Do, Humare Do' paid no heed to their pleas, the Congress leader said.He alleged that the Modi government is aware that the three laws will "destroy" the mandi system, farmers will not get MSP and their lands will be "usurped", but it is only interested in helping its crony capitalist friends.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the protesting farmers have been braving all odds -- of nature and the might of the State -- for the last 100 days."They have braved all kinds of insults heaped upon them by the government and pro-government media. Today, what we are witnessing is an attempt to wipe out the narrative of the farmers, to wipe out the narrative of their protest from the media," he alleged at a press conference here."Each one of us, whichever category we may belong to, have our own struggles and that is the awareness on which the government depends," Khera said.There is one section of the society that has found time to come out and protest -- farmers -- against these "black laws" and they are "our voice", he added."The country has seen through this government's efforts for headline management...a cornered regime is there and how it will react now is for us to wait and watch," the Congress leader said."The farmers have called this day a black day. We think this is a black chapter in our democracy, where everything was done to disrupt this peaceful protest. They (farmers) were demonised, all kinds of conspiracies were hatched against them, but they stayed on," he added.The Congress demands that the three new farm laws should immediately be repealed, Khera said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-farmers-protest-completes-100-days-cong-says-100-days-of-bjp-s-arrogance-101615050572330.html

06-03-2021||India||100 days of farm laws protest: Farmers block major expressways. See pictures||The farmers' protest against the three new farm laws completed 100 days on Saturday. The three borders of the national capital- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur - have been the main locations of the protest where farmers from all across the country had come and settled to protest against the Centre until the laws are repealed.To mark the 100th day of the landmark protest, protesting farmers' unions decided to observe March 6 as the 'Black Day'. As part of the protest, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha called for the blocking of the KMP (Kundli–Manesar–Palwal) expressway or the western peripheral for five hours between 11am and 4pm.Here is how the road blockade is going on:Even with several rounds of talks between the farmers' representatives and the government, deadlock still persists. No conclusion has come out of the talks and the farmers are adamant on their demand of withdrawing the three contentious laws.Women too have been a part of the movement since its beginning. As the protest entered its 100th day, women in large numbers came forward to continue the protest by taking part in blocking the KMP expressway.The protest has "reinforced the identity of women farmers”. "Women farmers have been able to assert themselves and make their presence and participation felt," PTI quoted Kavitha Kuruganti of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee as saying.Farmers have also blocked the eastern peripheral expressway in Ghaziabad to observe the 'Black Day'. Farmers have been concerned that the laws will take away the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system and will do away with the 'mandi' system as well. One of their demands is a legal guarantee of MSP.Protesting farmers are marching on the KMP expressway with the flag of the farmers' unions to agitate against the laws. Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Friday accused the government of introducing the laws for the benefits of its corporate friends and said that the government is working as the puppets of the businessmen. He also highlighted that the godowns were built first and the laws came after."The government is working as a puppet in the hands of industrialists, the government is doing what the traders are telling them. Godowns were built first, laws were made later," Tikait's tweet, in Hindi, read.The farmers from all across the country, mainly from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been protesting against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act passed by Parliament last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-days-of-farm-laws-protest-farmers-block-major-expressways-see-pictures-101615011636078.html

Farmers from all age group gathered at the six-lane expressway outside the national capital with their cars, trucks and tractors as they staged a five-hour-long blockade. It will continue till 4pm. Commuters are advised to check traffic advisory before travelling on Kundli–Manesar–Palwal (KMP) Expressway.The protests are continuing since November 26 last year and in these 100 days of the agitation, farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have braved harsh weather conditions while remaining firm on their demands. As the capital braces for scorching summers and the harvesting season begins, farmers gathering on Saturday asserted that they had no plans to turn back until their demands were met."Bitter cold didn't affect our movement, and neither will deathly heat," news agency Reuters quoted Raja Singh, a 58-year-old farmer from Punjab, as saying. "The government has left us no option but to protest," said another farmer from Punjab, Reuters reported.The farmers are protesting at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders. They are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The laws open up the agriculture sector to private players and have been hailed by the government as "historic" and long-needed reforms. However, the farmers fear that the legislation will end the mandi system where they are they have assured of the minimum support price for their produce.The agitating farmers want the Centre to repeal the laws, meanwhile, the government has assured that it is ready to make amendments and claimed that laws will give farmers the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country.While the protests have been mostly peaceful, a brief spate of violence on January 26 led to the death of a protestor and many policemen being injured. Following the violence during the tractor rally, Delhi police put barricades around the protests sites of Ghazipur and Tikri borders. They also installed barbed wire to restrict the movement of the protesting farmers.Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Congress' Rahul Gandhi who has been supporting the protests since the beginning, criticised the Centre over the controversial laws. He alleged that the government is torturing the farmers who are fighting for their rights."Nails have been laid at the Delhi borders for sons of those who sacrifice their lives on the borders of the country. 'Annadata' ask for their rights, government tortures!" Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-gather-at-western-peripheral-expressway-as-agitation-completes-100-days-101615015711778.html
