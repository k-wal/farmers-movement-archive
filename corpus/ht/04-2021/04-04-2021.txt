04-04-2021||India||Farmers not leaving protest sites near Delhi, says Rakesh Tikait||Refuting claims that farmers have left protest sites along the Delhi border, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday said they had gone to the fields to work and would return when the Central government was "free from West Bengal elections".Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, have been protesting at the Delhi border for over 4 months now against the Centre's three agri marketing laws, and have demanded its repeal along with a legal guarantee on the minimum support price mechanism.Tikait, who reached Gujarat to drum up support for the stir, began his two-day visit by praying at the Ambaji Temple in Banaskantha district and then addressing groups in Ambaji and Palanpur.He told a gathering that the three laws were enacted to help businessmen and not farmers, and the latter had decided to not move from the protest sites till victory, that is acceptance of all their demands, was achieved."All reports that farmers have left the agitation sites are wrong. Farmers come and go. At present, they have gone to work in their fields. We have told them to come back once the government is free from (West) Bengal elections. The entire government is camping in Bengal. Once the government returns, we will start negotiations with it," Tikait claimed.He said farmers from Gujarat must also join the protest in large numbers so that the country feels confident that cultivators from the state from where some of the big leaders hail, a possible reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, are also against the new laws.Exhorting farmers from Gujarat to use tractors to protest, Tikait said these vehicles are the "tanks of farmers" and were put to good use in Delhi to remove police barricades.While former Gujarat chief minister Shankarsinh Vaghela accompanied Tikait in his rally from Ambaji to Palanpur, Congress MLA Geniben Thakor welcomed the BKU leader when he entered the state earlier in the day.Incidentally, Tikait had taken a swipe at the BJP government in Gujarat earlier in the day by showing his passport to reporters while entering the state after alighting from a train in Abu Road in neighbouring Rajasthan.Asked about whether he was carrying a Covid-19 negative certificate, which is mandatory while travelling to Gujarat, Tikait showed his passport and said, "I have all the documents with me. This is my passport if it is required to enter Gujarat".Tikait will visit Sabarmati Ashram on Monday and go to Bardoli on the second day of his Gujarat visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-not-leaving-protest-sites-near-delhi-says-rakesh-tikait-101617549393644.html
04-04-2021||India||Direct payment to farmers: Navjot Singh Sidhu claims Centre wants to ‘destroy’ mandi system in Punjab||Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday dubbed Union minister Piyush Goyal's letter regarding direct payment to farmers as “part of a larger conspiracy” against Punjab to “destroy and disrupt” the state's tried and tested mandi system.Goyal had written a letter to the Punjab government, asking it to implement a system for direct payment to farmers for crop procurement. The state government was also asked to integrate land records, available with the revenue department, with the procurement portal.Addressing the media in Patiala at his residence, the cricketer-turned-politician questioned the timing of the letter and alleged that the Centre wanted to “instigate” farmers and “create a law and order situation” in the state.“This tantamounts to economic blackmail by the central government to force the farmers and Punjab to withdraw their agitation against the three farm laws,” he further alleged.Sidhu said the motive of the letter was to “disrupt” the age-old, tried and tested and successful mandi system that allows for the implementation of the minimum support price in the state.It also intends to create a “division” between arhtiyas (commission agents) and farmers in the state, he alleged.This letter is part of a “larger conspiracy” to stall the procurement of wheat crop in Punjab and destroy the state's agricultural economy, he alleged.         The Amritsar East legislator said according to Goyal, the revenue department of the state government had all the information about the land records of farmers in the state.        But according to data collected by the National Sample Survey for year 2012-13, it shows that more than 24 per cent of the land under cultivation in Punjab is under tenancy.“These tenancy contracts are oral or unwritten in nature,” he stated, adding that the land under tenancy may have increased and not decreased over the years.If the sale of wheat crop is allowed with ownership rights, then about 25 to 30 per cent farmers will not receive payment for sale of their crops, he claimed.The former Punjab minister accused the Centre of planning to “destroy” the state's successful Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee model and also questioned the timing of the letter.He emphasised that the state and its people should come together and build “an alternative economic model” for Punjab's agricultural prosperity.Asked when he would return to the state government, Sidhu refused to comment.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Sidhu had on March 17 met over tea at the former's farmhouse, where they had discussed the cricketer-turned-politician's possible reinduction into the state cabinet.The following day, Singh had expressed confidence that Sidhu would be back in his cabinet.For the last several weeks, the Congress circles have been abuzz with speculation over a key cabinet berth for Sidhu and there has also been talk of him being appointed the state Congress president.The rift between Singh and Sidhu had come out in the open in May 2019 when the chief minister blamed him for the "inept handling" of the local government department, claiming it had resulted in the "poor performance" of the Congress in urban areas in the Lok Sabha polls.Sidhu was later stripped of this portfolio in a cabinet reshuffle, following which he had resigned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/direct-payment-to-farmers-navjot-singh-sidhu-claims-centre-wants-to-destroy-mandi-system-in-punjab-101617549093293.html
04-04-2021||India||Farmers across India will protest outside FCI offices on Monday, says Samyukt Kisan Morcha||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Sunday said that protests will be held by farmers in front of Food Corporation of India (FCI) offices across the country on April 5, which the group said it will mark as ‘FCI Bachao Divas’.“Tomorrow, on April 5, farmers will protest in front of FCI offices across the country by gherao. Marking this day as FCI Bachao Divas,” news agency ANI quoted a statement from SKM.“A memorandum letter will be given in the name of the Minister of Consumer Affairs,” the statement added.On March 11, FCI sent a proposal to the government recommending tighter quality controls for the procurement of wheat and paddy. For wheat, a reduction in moisture level from 14% to 12% was proposed, along with a reduction in procurement of damaged grain from the existing 4% to 2%. For paddy, stricter quality control measures like reducing the permissible limit of foreign material in grains from 2% to 1% have also been proposed.Congress Member of Parliament Pratap Singh Bajwa strongly opposed the new recommendations in Parliament during the budget session. He contended that presence of foreign materials and moisture content in food grains is weather related, and farmers cannot be penalised for it since global warming is not in their hands, reported news agency PTI.SKM told PTI on March 19 that protests were held across mandis in the country over these new procurement norms."In addition to being unresponsive to protesting farmers' legitimate demands, the Government of India's Food Corporation of India has brought in new quality specifications and procurement norms in a direct attack on the procurement regime and the ongoing protests,” the morcha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-across-india-will-protest-outside-fci-offices-on-monday-says-samyukt-kisan-morcha-101617544254334.html
04-04-2021||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal says Centre ‘punished’ Delhi govt for supporting farmers’ protest||Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday that the Centre “punished” the Delhi government by “handing power to the Lieutenant Governor” for standing with agitating farmers against the three new “black laws”. Kejriwal was addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Haryana’s Jind district.“They've introduced a bill in Parliament to punish Kejriwal. We faced repercussions for supporting farmer's protest. They are punishing us by passing the bill and handing power into LG's hands instead of the elected government. Did we fight freedom struggle for this?” Kejriwal said.“BJP-led central govt conspired to put farmers coming to Delhi in jails created by converting 9 stadiums. But we were fortunate as the law stated that the power to convert the stadium into jail rests with Delhi’s chief minister,” the AAP chief added.Kejriwal further said, “Centre sent me a file and kept on calling me. The central government started pressuring me by saying there will be a law and order issue. They even threatened to take away my power. I didn't listen to them and rejected their file. The BJP-led Centre government was extremely angry with me for rejecting their move to convert the stadiums into jails.”Kejriwal started his Mahapanchayat by claiming that 300 individuals have died during the farmers’ stir, and added that their sacrifice should never be in vain. The Delhi chief minister told the crowd that AAP leaders were personally dispatched by him to the national capital’s borders for supporting the farmers’ cause but not under the banner of any political party.“We salute the sacrifices of 300 people who died during the agitation (farmer's protest). It is our responsibility that their sacrifice does not go in vain,” said Kejriwal.“A country which does not respect farmers will never be able to develop,” said Kejriwal pledging his support to the protesting farmers.Last month, Kejriwal had attended two similar farmers' Mahapanchayat in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut and Punjab's Moga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-says-centre-punished-delhi-govt-for-supporting-farmers-protest-101617531733718.html
