13-01-2021||India||On Lohri, protesting farmers near Delhi burn copies of farm laws||Farmers burned the copies of the three central farm laws at Singhu border near Delhi on Wednesday as a symbol of celebrating the Lohri festival. The farmers have been protesting against the three laws since late November and Singhu border has been the epicentre of protest since then.Lohri marks the beginning of the new harvest season. It is one of the most widely celebrated festivals of Punjab.The farmers also shouted slogans against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government and slammed it for not acceding to their demands.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of Delhi against the farm legislation enacted by the Parliament in September last year.On Wednesday, the agitation at Delhi’s four key borders - Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate, and Chilla - entered its 49th day.The farmers are demanding the repeal of the laws. They are also demanding a legal guarantee for the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system for the procurement of their crops.The three farm laws are Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the three laws.

13-01-2021||India||'They don't know what they want': Hema Malini on farmers' protest||Echoing party line that the ongoing protest by the farmers has been instigated by "vested interests", BJP's Mathura MP Hema Malini said the farmers don't know what they want.The actor-MP also referred to the vandalism of mobile towers in Punjab and said Punjab has suffered a lot of losses owing to the protests. "Punjab has suffered a lot of losses. It was not nice to see them (farmers) vandalise towers. The government has called them for talks repeatedly but they don't even have an agenda," she said.he BJP MP also welcomed the stay on the implementation of the Centre's farm laws saying that this is likely to calm the situation."It is good that the Supreme Court has stayed the laws. This will hopefully calm the situation. Farmers are not willing to come to a consensus even after so many talks. They do not even know what they want and what is the problem with the farm laws. This means that they are doing this because someone asked them to do it," Hema Malini, as quoted by ANI.The Supreme Court on Wednesday appointed a panel which will find a way out of the ongoing impasse between the farmers and the Centre. The farmers have been protesting against the three recently passes farm laws putting forward their demand for a complete withdrawal of the laws.BJP leaders and ministers have been claiming that the protests are politically motivated. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too pointed at the opposition for instigating farmers for their own political gains. During Supreme Court hearing on Tuesday, attorney general KK Venugopal told the apex court that Khalistan supporters have infiltrated the farmers' protest. It was also said during the hearing that banned group Sikhs for Justice put up posters that ₹10,000 will be paid to anyone who joins the protest.On January 15, farmers will have another round of talks with the Centre but as they are unwavering in their demand of nothing short of a complete withdrawal, a solution is unlikely. The farmers have also complained that the SC-mandated committee comprises members who are pro-government and in favour of the farm laws.On Wednesday, a group of farmers reportedly gathered outside a shooting venue in Punjab where actor Janhvi Kapoor was shooting for Anand L Rai's 'Good Luck Jerry'. The protesters demanded her opinion on the ongoing protest. The actress earlier took to Instagram and wrote she recognises and values the role farmers play in feeding the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/they-don-t-know-what-they-want-hema-malini-on-farmers-protest-101610522904122.html

First we need to listen to farmers, if they have any misconception about Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), we will clear it, they need to be assured that whatever is happening is in their interest," Ghanwat told news agency ANI.Also Read: Supreme Court stays implementation of farm laws, forms 4-member committeeSC on Tuesday, after putting a stay on the farm laws' implementation, formed a four-member panel to listen to grievances of the protesting farmers and the point of view of the government on the issue. The committee is to submit its report to the court on the same within two months."Several farmer leaders and unions want freedom from the monopoly of APMC, this need to be stopped and farmers should be given the freedom to sell their crop. This has been a demand for the last 40 years. Farmers who want MSP should get it and those who want freedom from it should also have an option," Ghanwat further said.Also Read: Farmers say copies of new laws will be burnt on LohriMeanwhile, farmers' leaders rejected the committee formed by the SC on the grounds that all its members were 'pro-farm laws'. According to the farmers' leaders, the committee has been formed by the government through SC and all its members have supported the new legislation at one point or another.However, according to Ghanwat, farmers' fears are not justified. "It is a total misconception. Ashok Gulati is not a political leader or even part of any group, he is an agricultural economist. I have been neutral on this, I have never worked for any political party but only in favour of farmers, and whatever happens in the coming days, we will try our best to get the issue resolved in favour of all farmers of the nation, not just for farmers of Maharashtra or Punjab," he said.The other three members of the committee appointed by the top court are Bhupinder Singh Mann, President of Bharatiya Kisan Union's Mann faction, Pramod Kumar Joshi Director of International Food Policy Research Institute and agricultural economist Ashok Gulati.(with ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-will-get-justice-says-anil-ghanwat-member-of-sc-panel-on-farm-laws-101610501185536.html
