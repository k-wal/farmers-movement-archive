The parade would commence after the Republic Day parade, but there is no clarity regarding when it would conclude. The police has also estimated that about 15,000 tractors were present at the three border points, Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, and more would trickle in later.The police has suggested three short routes for the farmers with respect to the border points. Those at Singhu border have been asked to follow the Kanjhwala-Bawana route, while the protesters at Ghazipur border must take the Apsara border-Duhai route. The protesters at Tikri have been asked to take the Nangaloi-Najafgarh-Badli route.The tractor parade will feature a number of tableaux from across states depicting village life, the protest against the farm laws, and hailing the courage of the farmers as per organisers. Arrangements for 'langar' have been made along the national highway for the journey to the national capital's borders, as per farm leaders.Each protest site has had a war room set up to ensure smooth and effective coordination during the parade. There will be 40 members, including doctors, security personnel and social media managers, in each of these rooms.Thousands of farmers have been protesting the Centre's three contentious farm laws, that were passed in September, around the national capital for several weeks, braving the bitter cold.The agitators demand a complete rollback of the laws and have refused to accept anything less, while the Centre has remained adamant that it would not withdraw the laws.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-mlas-will-move-towards-delhi-on-tractors-to-support-farmers-punjab-aap-101611495289746.html
24-01-2021||India||15,000 tractors, 170 km: All you need to know about the farmers' tractor rally||Marking a symbolic protest against the three contentious farm laws, thousands of farmers will enter the national capital on the country's 72nd Republic Day on Tuesday after camping on Delhi's border for nearly two months now.Farmer leaders said the tractor parade will remain peaceful will not affect the official Republic Day parade in any way.With barely 36 hours to go, the plans for the tractor rally have been set in motion on Sunday after Delhi Police granted formal approval to the agitating farmers by stamping certain restrictions.Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at Delhi's borders for several weeks in bitter cold, demanding the repeal of the farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops.Here is all you need to know about the upcoming Tractor Rally by farmers:Why are the farmers protesting:The protests - longest such demonstration in decades of independent India - will soon enter their third month and show no signs of abating as the farmers have refused to halt them. They are protesting against the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September which essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The farmers claim these laws will benefit big corporate houses. The government has, however, tried to allay these fears and even said that it is ready to discuss changes to the law. The government has made it clear that it won’t scrap these laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15000-tractors-170-km-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-farmers-tractor-rally-101611493581603.html
24-01-2021||India||308 Twitter handles from Pakistan creating confusion over tractor march: Police||The Delhi Police on Sunday said 308 Twitter handles have been generated to create confusion over the tractor rally proposed by protesting farmers on Republic Day. "Through intelligence and various other agencies, we have continuously been getting inputs regarding a threat to create disturbance in the tractor rally. 308 Twitter handles have been generated from Pakistan to create confusion," Dependra Pathak, Special CP, Intelligence, Delhi Police said.Giving details of these Twitter handles, the special commissioner said all these handles have been generated in Pakistan between January 13 and January 18.The proposed Republic Day tractor march which got formal permission on Sunday from Delhi Police has been the eye of controversy for the past few days as Centre had already reported 'Khalistani infiltration' in the protests and moved the Supreme Court, which in turn asked Delhi Police to take the final call on allowing the tractor march. Initially, the Delhi Police didn't allow farmers to enter the Capital. Instead, it offered an alternative route at the Kundli border. But after several rounds of discussions held between farmers' representatives and Delhi Police officials, it has now been agreed that farmers will be allowed to enter the Capital under certain terms and conditions.Formal permission received from police for Jan 26 tractor rally: Yogendra YadavNow it has been decided that the tractor rally will enter Delhi from Tiri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders. From Singhu, the march will pass through Kanjhawala, Bawana, Auchandi border, KMP Expressway and then return to Singhu, police said.The protesting farmers have been planning this tractor march for a long time and several tractors from Punjab have joined the protest sites in the past few days for their Republic Day parade where they plan to showcase tractors from different states as it happens in Republic Day parade. Farmers' union leaders have promised that the march will be peaceful and the Delhi Police have also placed trust on them that the tractors will go back to the protest sites after their march, without proceeding further into the Capital.While several Union ministers in past claimed that farmers are being instigated from outside, early this month, the Centre told the Supreme Court that it was informed about Khalistani infiltration in the protests. It also mentioned the name of the banned organisation 'Sikhs for Justice' as being part of this ongoing protest.This is the first time, Delhi Police officially talked about outside links, specifically, Twitter handles having roots in Pakistan attempting to create disruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/308-twitter-handles-from-pakistan-creating-confusion-over-tractor-march-police-101611492703767.html
24-01-2021||India||Farmers protest: AAP ups ante, quotes RTI document to slam Amarinder Singh||The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday upped its ante against Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh over the ongoing protests of farmers and claimed that Singh was a member of the committee which approved the three contentious laws that farmers are protesting. The party also attached an RTI document which proves that the Punjab CM was one of the 10 members of a high-powered committee of chief ministers for 'Transformation of Indian Agriculture'.The order for setting up of the committee, as seen in the RTI document, was passed in August 2019. Then Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, Kamal Nath, former CM of Madhya Pradesh, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh were part of the committee, apart from agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand.Protesting farmers assure 'Kisan Gantantra Parade' will be peaceful"When you had the document in 2019, why didn't you tell the farmers that the Modi government was set to bring such anti-farmer laws," AAP leader Raghav Chadha said.RTI Exposes @capt_amarinder's lies.Punjab CM was a member of the committee that approved the 3 Anti-Farmer Farm bills.#DhokhebaazCaptain pic.twitter.com/Ne6r3U1P6bSince the beginning of farmers' 'Dilli Chalo' protest, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh locked horns over farmers' issues. The allegation that AAP has brought on Sunday is not new as Kejriwal has been accusing Amarinder Singh of drafting these laws. The RTI documents have now been added to AAP's attack.Singh had earlier answered to the accusation without denying that he was part of the committee but he had said that these farm laws were not discussed at any of the meetings of that committee.These farm laws were NOT discussed at any meeting & your repeated lies will not change that Mr @ArvindKejriwal. And naturally BJP can’t accuse me of double standards as I don’t have any nexus with them like you have. They after all have to cover up their collusion with you! https://t.co/R7Diu8jrzNThe farmers' protest, meanwhile, stares at a dead-end as the union leaders have rejected Centre's proposal of staying the implementation of the farm laws for 1.5 years. The farmers who have been camping at various points on Delhi's borders with neighbouring states since November are now preparing for their Republic Day tractor march. The Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the laws and has set up a committee which is listening to several farmers' unions from all over the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-aap-ups-ante-quotes-rti-document-to-slam-amarinder-singh-101611483210166.html
