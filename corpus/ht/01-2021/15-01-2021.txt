15-01-2021||India||Read your 2019 Lok Sabha manifesto: Tomar reminds Rahul Gandhi over farm laws||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday lashed out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for criticising the government over the new farm laws. Tomar also questioned the Congress Lok Sabha member’s stance over the farm reforms, saying that Gandhi had forgotten that even his party had promised the same reforms in its manifesto for the general elections in 2019.“The Congress party laughs at statements and actions of Rahul Gandhi. The party mocks him. I would like to remind him that in their 2019 election manifesto Congress promised that they will bring these reforms. If he doesn't remember, he should once again read the manifesto,” the agriculture minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.In its plan for reforms in the agricultural sector, Congress’ election manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls had said that if the party forms the government it would “repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC) Act and make trade in agricultural produce — including exports and inter-state trade — free from all restrictions.” The party manifesto had also said it maintains that the “Essential Commodities Act, 1955 belongs to the age of controls. Congress promises to replace the Act by an enabling law that can be invoked only in the case of emergencies.”Tomar also attacked Congress president Sonia Gandhi over her party’s stand on the laws. He said that both leaders should clarify if they were lying about these reforms in their election manifesto. “If it is mentioned in the manifesto, then Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi should appear before the media and accept that they were either lying at that time or are lying now,” Tomar said.Congress party workers observed Kisan Adhikar Divas on Friday to protest against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, and gheraoed Raj Bhawans across the country. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi also joined Congress workers and leader at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi on Friday morning to protest against the laws.Rahul Gandhi during the protests alleged Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to tire out the farmers. “The talks are being held only to delay. PM Modi thinks he has the power and will tire the farmers out, but he is mistaken. Narendra Modi does not have basic respect for farmers. He does not even care if over 100 farmers die. He thinks he has the power and the protesting farmers will tire out after some days, but they will not relent,” the former Congress president was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Tomar also said that discussions with farmers’ unions' representatives can solve the deadlock between the farmers and the government. Farmers’ unions' representatives and Union ministers could not reach a resolution on the farm laws, which were passed during the monsoon session of Parliament last year, after the ninth round of discussions concluded on Friday. The farmers' union representatives and the Centre will sit for another round of discussions on the farm laws on January 19.Union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman and Tomar had previously claimed that Congress was protesting against the farm laws because they lacked the willpower to implement them. Tomar in an interview with HT in December last year said that Congress could not implement these laws because of influence from allies.“They spoke about these reforms in their election manifesto; when the UPA {United Progressive Alliance} was in power they made attempts to introduce these reforms, but could not because of dabav and prabhav (pressure and influence) (of allies). PM [Narendra] Modi Ji does not give in to pressure or influence,” Tomar had said.Sithraman had also pointed out that the party had mentioned these reforms in their manifesto. “I want to ask Rahul Gandhi (that) were these pro-farmers policies not mentioned in the 2019 election manifesto of Congress? They are protesting just because those reforms are being implemented by PM Modi, and not them,” the Union finance minister had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/read-your-2019-lok-sabha-manifesto-tomar-reminds-rahul-gandhi-over-farm-laws-101610720165863.html

"We suggested they can form an informal group of people who can understand the laws better and prepare some concrete proposals, detailing what are farmers' expectations and what clauses are problematic for them, which the government can consider with an open mind," the Union agriculture minister said.Tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of Delhi against the farm legislation enacted by Parliament in September last year.

The decision was taken at a panchayat of 36 ‘biradris’ or caste groups, held in the village on Wednesday.Subhash Nain, a farmer who attended the panchayat, said, “Entire panchayat unanimously condemned those leaders (of political parties or farmers' organisations) who are not extending their support to the ongoing movement and unanimously decided to ban their entry in the village.”“What's their relevance if they can't stand with the farmers during their battle for survival?” asked Nain, quoting the panchayat's views. Saroorpur Kala has a population of about 25,000.The panchayat also decided to take ration and other essential items required by protesting farmers in Delhi on January 16 to the protest venue.It was decided to collect donations--monetary or otherwise-- from each family of the village, irrespective of their caste and community, in support of the movement.“Villagers have so far donated ₹4.5 lakh and spared at least nine tractors to take ration and other commodities including firewood for the farmers protesting at Delhi borders in the bitter cold season,” said Nain.The villagers claimed that they had nothing to do with any party, he added.The villagers are reported to be questioning why the government wasn’t listening to even their ‘genuine’ demands.Meanwhile, the farmers’ indefinite sit-in protest at Baraut town of Baghpat district, continued for the 28th day. Earlier, farmers led by khap chaudharies or clan leaders sat on a dharna on the Delhi-Saharanpur highway on December 17 in order to extend their support to the ongoing protest.Activists of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tomar), led by their divisional president Padam Singh, had staged a day-long protest at the Meerut Cantt railway station on Tuesday to show their solidarity with the farmers' movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baghpat-village-bans-entry-of-leaders-not-backing-farmers-protest-101610699617109.html
