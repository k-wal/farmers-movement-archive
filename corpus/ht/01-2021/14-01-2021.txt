The minister reiterated the government's stance and said that the Centre is ready to hold talks with farmer leaders with an open mind.The farmer union too said that they will attend the scheduled talks on Friday asserting that it is necessary to continue the dialogue to resolve the deadlock and end the agitation. "Let's see what happens tomorrow. But, our meetings will continue with the government till our protest ends as it is necessary. We will not oppose the meetings with the government," Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said.The government and representatives of the farmers' unions have previously held eight rounds of discussions but both sides continue to stick to their original stance. After the last round of discussions, Tomar had asked farmers to suggest an alternative for the farm laws and made it clear that the government will not repeal the laws.On their part, the farmers have maintained that they will not end their protest till the time the three laws - passed by Parliament in September - are repealed. They have also sought a legal guarantee that the system of procurement under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) will continue unaffected.The Supreme Court had on January 12 stayed the implementation of the farm laws and ordered the formation of a four-member committee to end the impasse between the government and the farmers who have been protesting near Delhi since late November.The three contentious laws are Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act after several petitions were filed against them.The farmers' unions representatives after the Supreme Court order had said that they do not want the four-member committee to resolve the issues citing government's stand on the farm laws. They highlighted that discussions with the committee will not lead to any results if the government remains firm on not repealing the laws.Farmer unions believe that these laws allow multinational companies to enter the agricultural sector and earn profits at the expense of the farmers. They also believe that these laws will affect government procurement of crop yields under the MSP system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-before-ninth-round-of-talks-with-farmers-agriculture-minister-narendra-singh-tomar-says-hopeful-of-positive-discussion-101610626250771.html
14-01-2021||NA||‘Mark my words…’: Rahul Gandhi says Centre will be forced to repeal farm laws||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday expressed confidence in the ongoing agitation by farmers’ unions at Delhi’s borders and claimed that the government would be forced to repeal the farm laws introduced by the government.“Mark my words. Take it from me. The government will be forced to take these laws (newly introduced farm laws), back. Remember what I said,” Rahul Gandhi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.He is in Tamil Nadu to take stock of Congress’ preparation ahead of the legislative assembly elections due in April-May this year and also participated in Pongal and Jallikattu celebrations in Madurai.Gandhi also lashed out at the Centre alleging that these laws have been introduced to benefit multinational companies. The Congress leader, while speaking to the press, said that these laws will benefit a handful of individuals at the expense of farmers across the country.“(The) government isn't just neglecting them, it is conspiring to destroy them because they want to benefit 2-3 of their friends. They want to give what belongs to farmers to 2-3 of their friends. That's what's happening. Neglect is too weak a word to explain what is taking place,” he said.Farmers have also pointed out that the new laws will pave the way for corporate farming and affect procurement under the Minimum Support System (MSP). They have been protesting for more than seven weeks against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 at Delhi’s borders.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders had earlier attacked Rahul Gandhi regarding his stance on the farm laws. Union minister Nirmala Sitharaman had questioned Rahul Gandhi’s stance while highlighting that his party, Congress, had mentioned the reforms in their 2019 Lok Sabha elections manifesto.“I want to ask Rahul Gandhi (that) were these pro-farmers policies not mentioned in the 2019 election manifesto of Congress? They are protesting just because those reforms are being implemented by PM Modi, and not them,” Sitharaman had asked.In its plan for reforms in the agricultural sector, Congress’ election manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls had said that if the party forms the government it would “repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC) Act and make trade in agricultural produce — including exports and inter-state trade — free from all restrictions.” The party manifesto had also said it maintains that the “Essential Commodities Act, 1955 belongs to the age of controls. Congress promises to replace the Act by an enabling law that can be invoked only in the case of emergencies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/tamil-nadu-assembly-election/mark-my-words-rahul-gandhi-says-centre-will-be-forced-to-repeal-farm-laws-101610618516971.html

Farmers have said that they will not hold any talks with the committee as all four members are pro-government.The other members of the court-appointed committee are economists Ashok Gulati, Dr Pramod Kumar Joshi and farmer leader Anil Ghanwat. The committee has been asked by the Supreme Court to submit its report in two months.Tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of Delhi against the farm legislation enacted by the Parliament in September last year. So far, eight rounds of talks have taken place between the government and farmers but have failed to resolve the deadlock. Both sides will now meet on January 15 to discuss the matter.Farmers have been demanding a complete withdrawal of the laws which has been refused by the government. Instead, it has offered to make amendments.Farmers are also demanding a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) system for the procurement of their crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-view-of-apprehensions-member-opts-out-of-supreme-court-appointed-panel-on-farm-laws-101610617112085.html

She advocated in favour of the farm laws and alleged that farmers were being misled and were not protesting on their own. She held that the Central government passed the farm laws for farmers’ benefit.Hema Malini, who was visiting her parliamentary constituency after 10 months, interacted with the media on Wednesday.“Farmers should say what is wrong in the farm laws and what needs to be done. Farmers are opposing farm laws without understanding them. During talks with the Centre, farmer representatives do not point out any problems in the farm laws but simply call for their withdrawal. If farmers understand, they will find the farm laws to be beneficial,’” said Malini.She accused the opposition of hypocritical behaviour on the issue. ‘The Opposition is opposing the farm laws just for the sake of it. Congress wanted to bring such laws during their regime but is now opposing them,” Malini said, while welcoming the Supreme Court order aimed to break the deadlock between the protesting farmers and the Central government.Speaking in favour of setting up industries in Mathura, the BJP MP favoured decreasing the area of Taj Trapezium Zone so that big industries could come up in Mathura.
