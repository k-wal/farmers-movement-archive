While the farmers insist on camping at Delhi's northern border seeking the repeal of the three contentious farm laws, local residents have lodged their discontentment over the clogging of roads in the area due to the farmers' protest.The group claiming to be locals demanded that the farmers vacate the Singhu border, one of the main protest sites around the national capital, alleging that they had "insulted" the national flag during their tractor parade on Republic Day, reported news agency PTI.Here is what you need to know about Friday's development at the Singhu border:Why are the farmers protesting:The protests, the longest such demonstration in decades of Independent India, entered their third month and show no signs of abating as the farmers have refused to halt them. They are protesting against the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September which essentially change the way farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. The farmers claim these laws will benefit big corporate houses. The government has tried to allay these fears, saying that it is ready to discuss changes to the laws and has made it clear that it won’t scrap them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/policeman-stabbed-tear-gas-fired-what-we-know-so-far-about-singhu-border-chaos-101611921802686.html
29-01-2021||Lucknow||'Big disappointment': Mayawati on President's address to farmers||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national president Mayawati on Friday termed the President Ram Nath Kovind's address to the joint session of Parliament as a "big disappointment" for the farmers and the poor."The Centre is harassing and exploiting the agitating farmers who have launched a stir demanding withdrawal of the three newly enacted agriculture laws. The BSP will raise its voice against the exploitation and injustice meted out to farmers," she said in a tweet.Mayawati’s reaction came after the BSP announced in the morning to boycott President Ram Nath Kovind’s address to the joint session of Parliament at the start of the budget session.Earlier in the day, while expressing solidarity with the agitating farmers protesting against the three farm laws enacted in September last year, Mayawati posted a series of tweets, "In protest against not accepting the agitating farmers' demand of the withdrawal of the three disputed laws and adopting a lax attitude in the matters of public interest, the BSP today (Friday) decided to boycott the President’s address to Parliament."Also read: India took short term pain for long time gain - Chief economic adviserShe further said the Centre should take measures to normalise the situation in Delhi and other areas. "The Centre should not make innocent farmers scapegoat under the guise of riots on the Republic Day in Delhi. There is truth in the objections of the BKU and other farmer leaders against the farm laws. The central government should pay attention to their demands," Mayawati added."Farmers, who have made the country self-reliant in agriculture, are agitating for the withdrawal of the three agriculture laws. The government is harassing the farmers and the silence of the government over the issue is sad," the BSP chief said.Communicating her party's stand on the three agriculture laws, Mayawati said, "The BSP has always opposed the new agriculture laws in Parliament and outside which were introduced by the Centre in a very immature way. Along with the poor, the Dalits and the backwards, the BSP will always raise its voice against the exploitation and injustice meted out to farmers."Mayawati's tweets announcing a boycott of the President's address came at 9 am— two hours before the start of the President's address to the joint session of the Parliament. The Akali Dal, the Aam Aadmi Party and 16 opposition political parties led by the Congress on Thursday announced the boycott of the President’s address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/big-disappointment-mayawati-on-president-s-address-to-farmers-101611925681844.html
29-01-2021||India||'Repeal farm laws, put them in a wastebasket': Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reiterated his demand that the three farm laws be repealed and extended his support to the farmers protesting in the national capital."We all should understand the three farm laws. The first law destroys the mandi system, the second law allows unlimited storage of grains and other material and will make it impossible to negotiate prices and the third one says that if the farmers have grievances they can't go to court," Rahul Gandhi said.Accusing the government of destroying the livelihoods of the farmers, he said that it is obvious why the farmers are agitating. "The laws are going to give the middle class a shock because the prices of food are going to go up," he said, adding that what is being done to the farmers is absolutely criminal as they are being beaten up, threatened and discredited by the government.The Congress leader further said that the only way forward was to repeal the laws. "The only solution is to repeal the laws and put them in a wastepaper basket. The government must not think that the farmers are going to go home because they are not. This situation is going to spread. We need a conversation with the farmers and we need a solution," he said.  Responding to a question about the incident that took place on January 26, Rahul Gandhi said we should think about how the farmers were able to reach the Red Fort.As part of their tractor rally organised in protest against the farm laws, hundreds of farmers reached the ramparts of the Red Fort on Republic Day."Was it not the job of the home ministry to ensure that they didn't enter the fort? What was the reason behind allowing them inside the Red Fort? We should ask these questions to the home minister," he said.The leader also encouraged the farmers to carry on the agitation and assured them of his support. "Do not step back even one inch. Fight for your rights. Do not let these people steal away your future. We are with you," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repeal-farm-laws-put-them-in-a-wastebasket-rahul-gandhi-101611921789329.html

The police deployed at the toll plaza failed to stop the farmers. The farmers’ siege of the plaza had been vacated by authorities on Thursday and toll collection had resumed.Also Read: ‘National flag, R-Day insulted’: President Kovind on January 26 violenceThe farmers swung into action after Bhartiya Kisan Union (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni gave a call to continue the protests at the toll plazas until farmers’ demands are met.In a video message, Charuni also warned the BJP-led Haryana government to not use force on farmers, protesting “peacefully” for the past one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-turf-war-in-haryana-as-farmers-resume-toll-plaza-protests-forces-deployed-101611907156021.html
29-01-2021||India||5,000 farmers gather to support Rakesh Tikait after he wept on national TV||Over 5,000 farmers gathered in support of Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait in Muzaffarnagar’s Sisauli village on Thursday evening after he burst into tears in front of television cameras, accusing the BJP of hatching a conspiracy against him, the union’s Muzaffarnagar district chief Dheeraj Latiyan said.Rakesh Tikait is among the farmer leaders protesting against the three farm laws, who have been booked for the violence during the tractor parade in Delhi on Republic Day. Sisauli, a village in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar district, is the headquarters of BKU and the native village of Rakesh Tikait and his brother Naresh Tikait, who heads the union.BKU, which is demanding the withdrawal of the cases against farmer leaders, has now decided to hold a mahapanchayat at the government inter college ground in Muzaffarnagar, on Friday, to decide the strategy of the movement going forward, Latiyan said.About 50 kilometres from Sisauli, farmers held a panchayat at Baraut in Baghpat district of western UP earlier in the day on Thursday and constituted a nine-member committee to take a decision about the ongoing farmers’ movement. They claimed that the police used force to chase away farmers who were sleeping at a protest site on Wednesday night. The police have denied the allegations of a crackdown.The farmers' protest had been continuing on the Delhi-Saharanpur highway in Baghpat since December 17 last against the Centre's three contentious agriculture reform laws.The protesters alleged that police personnel entered their tents late on Wednesday night and resorted to a lathi-charge on the sleeping farmers. The police, however, claimed that the matter was resolved through deliberations and the protesting farmers were sent home on Wednesday night.Chaudhary Brijpal Singh, thambedar (local chief) of the Desh khap, who was leading the indefinite sit-in on the Delhi-Saharanpur highway since December 17, claimed that at least 15 farmers sustained injuries in the lathi-charge and five farmers were missing.Watch: Rakesh Tikait reacts to police order of vacating Ghazipur protest siteHe alleged the police lathi-charged even elderly farmers who were sleeping and took away their belongings. He said the committee formed at the panchayat would take a decision after consulting the people of the area.In a video, additional district magistrate (Baghpat) Amit Kumar said, “We removed farmers on the request of NHAI (National Highways Authority of India) which wanted to restart the work on the road that was hampered due to the farmers’ agitation.”He further claimed that there were four or five farmers at the protest site at the time and they were sent home.The office of the superintendent of police (SP) in Baghpat said a case against farmers was registered on the complaint of NHAI officials. Abhishek Kumar, public relations officer to the SP, said no farmer was arrested.However, Chaudhary Brijpal Singh claimed that he was taken to a police station and released from custody late in the night.Refuting the charge, circle officer Alok Singh said police did not resort to lathi-charge on the protesters. Whatever happened was in agreement with those present there, he said, adding that the protesting farmers returned home peacefully.In Sisauli, BKU's Muzaffarnagar district chief said it was indeed painful for farmers to watch Rakesh Tikait breaking down in front of TV cameras.Latiyan said farmers were carrying Ransingha (a traditional instrument that is blown before a march) and shouted slogans supporting the BKU and the Tikait brothers. He claimed that thousands of farmers would gather at Friday’s mahapanchayat.In a statement, Rakesh Tikait has blamed BJP for hatching a conspiracy to disgrace the farmers’ movement.Earlier in the day, another meeting was held at Sisauli under the leadership of BKU chief Naresh Tikait. At that meeting, the situation after the Delhi violence on Republic Day and cases registered against farmer leaders were discussed.BKU had called for a symbolic protest at the police stations in Muzaffarnagar against the cases lodged against farmer leaders. Latiyan said a memorandum was given at the Muzaffarnagar tehsil and at the Chartgawal, Bhopa and Purkazi police stations. Security was beefed up at all the police stations of the Muzaffarnagar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5000-farmers-gather-to-support-rakesh-tikait-after-he-wept-on-national-tv-101611890707445.html

29-01-2021||Delhi||At Tikri border, farmers take out a ‘tiranga rally’||Several farmer unions protesting at the Tikri border took out a “tiranga rally” on Thursday in what they said was an attempt to dispel “myths” allegedly being propagated by the government that protesters at Delhi borders did not respect the Tricolour, while insisting they would not vacate the protest site until their demands were met.On Tuesday, a group of agitating farmers had stormed Red Fort during the tractor rally organised by farm unions against the three new farm laws and hoisted religious flags.At least 394 policemen were injured in violence at different spots in the city during the agitation.One farmer was killed when his tractor rammed into a police barricade and overturned.Unlike the Singhu border, where a group raised slogans against the farmers and accused them of “disrespecting the national flag”, the Tikri border remained relatively peaceful on Thursday even as security was beefed up by the police at the main entry point.Pargat Singh, a protester from Ferozpur, said: “The tiranga rally was taken out by the farmers from Punjab and Haryana to condemn what had happened at the Red Fort on Republic Day. We have been constantly saying that those involved in the incident were infiltrators. Farmers like us, who work day and night to ensure that every citizen in the country gets enough food to eat, can never disrespect the national flag.”Navkiran Natt, another protester at Tikri, alleged: “The government first sent its infiltrators to perform that shameful incident at the Red Fort. Now, it’s trying to stage protests against the farmers and trying to set a narrative that it’s the farmers who had disrespected the national flag. We want to make it clear that we love our national flag and we have nothing to do with what happened at the Red Fort.”The protesters also said that the police were trying to cut off the protest site to discourage the supporters of the farmers’ movement from visiting them.Jagmohan Singh, a farmer leader, said, “Some visitors also complained that police did not allow them to enter the protest site.”A senior police officer, who was not authorised to speak to the media, said that the police were reacting to the violence on Republic Day and ensuring it was not repeated.Shalini Singh, joint commissioner of police (western range), said that the increased police presence at the Tikri Border was as per an “upgrade” in force deployment.“The inner roads where people can walk to the protest venue or nearby neighborhoods are still open. The situation is peaceful,” said the officer.On whether protesters were going back to their villages, Joginder Singh, president of BKU (Ugrahan), a prominent group of protesting farmers, said, “People are spreading rumours. Only those who had come just to participate in the January 26 tractor parade have left. All the other protesters are still here and we will not leave till our demands are met.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-tikri-border-farmers-take-out-a-tiranga-rally-101611879251661.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||At Red Fort, crowd tried snatching guns from two cops: FIR||Protesters who ran amok at the Red Fort on Republic Day tried to snatch weapons of two Delhi Police constables, according to a first information report (FIR) filed in connection with a farmers’ demonstration that spun out of control in the national capital.In the FIR — filed on Wednesday — the police registered a case against unidentified protesters for attempt to snatch weapons of security personnel and attempt to murder, theft, dacoity, rioting, and criminal conspiracy, among other charges.It said some of the protesters, who deviated from the route agreed upon with the police and stormed the historic monument, were armed with pistols as well as swords, spears, sickles, sticks and rods. The nine-page FIR added that they also stole the police’s anti-riot gears.They were also booked under the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 (for causing damage to the monument), Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 (for vandalism), and the Arms Act 1959 (for illegal possession of arms).Hundreds of farmers climbed the ramparts of Red Fort after storming it, hoisted religious flags, resorted to vandalism, fought a pitched battle with the police, and threw some of them into trenches as dramatic scenes unfolded on Republic Day.The FIR was filed based on the statement of Rituraj, a station house officer at Kotwali police station; Red Fort comes under the jurisdiction of the police station.In his complaint, the police official, who was present during the mayhem, said nearly 1,000 -1,200 protesters reached near Raj Ghat in 30-40 tractors, 125-150 cars, and motorcycles around 12.15pm on Tuesday.According to the complaint, the protesters rammed their tractors into police’s barricades at Nishad Raj Marg on Shanti Van Chowk and made their way towards the fort. It said after entering the fort premises on cars, tractors and motorcycles, they made their way to the ramparts and hoisted various flags, including the Nishan Sahib of Sikhs.When senior police officers ordered the use of force against protesters who were entering the fort from the Meena Bazar side, those who were already inside attacked policemen with swords and sticks, the FIR said.It said the protesters thrashed policemen with spears, swords, sticks and rods, and pushed them into the moat, injuring some of them grievously. The FIR mentioned that one of the constables on duty, 31-year-old Bhawani Singh, said he was carrying an MP5 rifle (a submachine gun), which the protesters tried to take away from him.“When I did not let them take it away, they took out the magazine and stole it with 20 live rounds. I was surrounded by the protesters and they pushed me into the moat. The impact of the fall was such that I fractured my left knee. The protesters continued to pelt stones at me and I had to use a shield of another policeman to cover myself. I was saved by my colleagues who also have sustained injuries,” Singh, who is due for a knee surgery on Friday, told HT over phone from Sushrut Trauma Centre at Kashmere Gate.Protesters also tried to snatch the single loading rifle of another constable but failed, the FIR said. But he lost a magazine that had 20 live cartridges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-red-fort-crowd-tried-snatching-guns-from-two-cops-fir-101611878215659.html
29-01-2021||India||Farmers deny to leave protest site at UP Gate, 'excess police force' removed||Hundreds of Bharatiya Kisan Union members stayed put on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway early on Friday, notwithstanding the Ghaziabad administration’s ultimatum to vacate the UP Gate protest site.A confrontation was building up at the UP Gate in Ghazipur even as frequent power cuts were witnessed in the evening at the protest site, where BKU members, led by Rakesh Tikait, are staying put since November 28.In a post-midnight review of situation, Ghaziabad District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey and Senior Superintendent of Police Kalanidhi Naithani visited the protest site even as hundreds of security personnel in anti-riot gears were deployed since Thursday.Flanked by supporters at 1 am, Tikait remained at the centre stage of the protest site -- the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, which has been barricaded from both the sides, prohibiting regular traffic movement.Around 500 protestors stayed put at UP Gate with more pouring in from western Uttar Pradesh in the night on the call of the BKU, an influential farmers’ union in North India."Excess security force from the protest site has been withdrawn and only a minimal deployment of personnel remains there," a Ghaziabad police officer told PTI on the condition of anonymity."The tension was building at UP Gate due to excessive deployment of force since Thursday evening," the officer added.Several protestors waved the tricolour with some waving flags of farmer unions like Kisan Ekta Manch amid a continuous sloganeering of "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan", while many were lying down on mattresses covered in blankets as they braved bone-chilling cold and wind."Zaroorat padi to khade rehke dharna denge, tum dharne pe baithe rehne ki baat karte ho (I can protest while standing up and you are asking whether I am going to continue my sit-in protest)," Jagat Singh Rathi, 78, said.With a muffler tied around his head and a stick in his hand for support while walking, the septuagenarian from Meerut said that he has been at the BKU's protest since its beginning on November 28.Asked if he would vacate the protest site following the administration's communication, he said, "(UP Gate) khaali nahi karenge. We have not seen any such order to vacate the protest site. When the Supreme Court has said that farmers have a right to protest then what? We will do it."The "verbal" communication from the district administration to the BKU on Thursday came close on the heels of three farmer unions withdrawing their protest against the three farm laws over the violence in Delhi on Republic Day."Ghaziabad District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey has communicated to the protestors camping at the UP Gate at Delhi border to vacate the spot by tonight or the administration will remove them," a district official had told PTI.Thousands of protesting farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-deny-to-leave-protest-site-at-up-gate-excess-police-force-removed-101611870095961.html
29-01-2021||India||Eviction notice, high drama at Ghazipur||Tension hung in the air at a key protest site on the Delhi-Ghaziabad border on Thursday after authorities gave an eviction notice to farmers who have been protesting there since November-end, while they refused to leave the site and alleged a conspiracy to crush their movement.High drama unfolded at the Ghazipur border, where rumour mills were abuzz throughout the day, and a large number of security personnel were deployed with authorities moving to bring an end to the demonstration at the key intersection.Farmers protesting there against three central agricultural laws said that power was disconnected in the area on Wednesday night. They feared that police will use force to evict the demonstrators in the cover of the night.On Thursday morning, they also said that water supply was discontinued, prompting a group of farmers to leave their empty tents behind at UP Gate — as the place is known — and return home.In the evening, hectic parleys began between officials and farmer leader Rakesh Tikait, whose Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)-Tikait group is spearheading the protests there. There were indications that farmers were planning to court arrest peacefully in the evening.But Tikait later said he would fight the “conspiracy” to silence his movement.“We received a notice from the officers and we are ready to surrender and get ourselves peacefully arrested. But now it seems that it’s a larger conspiracy to attack us. Now, we are not moving from here (the protest site) and ready to face bullets. If they (police) will force us, I will hang myself on the stage. Our agitation will now continue and we will remain here only,” Tikait told the gathering in the evening.Tikait broke down on the dais and alleged that the district administration was taking help of some “unruly elements”, who he said were brought to attack farmers after he courted arrest.“So, I have decided that I will not court arrest and will continue the dharna at the site...Police asked me to court arrest, but people owing allegiance to the Bharatiya Janata Party were sent by some local MLAs, and those persons were armed with sticks...,” he said.Tikait is among the farmers’ leaders named in one of the first information reports (FIRs) filed by the Delhi Police in connection with a violent farmers’ protest on Republic Day. BKU-Tikait says the government is “misusing” its powers by registering FIRs against farmers and farm leaders.The Ghazipur border is one of the four border points near Delhi fully or partially blocked by thousands of agitating farmers since their protests began in the last week of November.On Tuesday, groups of farmers deviated from the route agreed upon with authorities for their Republic Day protest and drove their tractors till Delhi’s ITO, where they were involved in a clash with the police.While a smaller protest at the Chilla border nearby ended on Wednesday in the aftermath of the violence, a majority of the protesters at the Ghazipur stayed put.By Thursday morning, a large number of police and paramilitary personnel arrived at the venue and occupied the pavement of the carriageway on the opposite side of the one occupied by the farmers. They brought water cannons and vehicles used for firing tear gas.The turn of events — from seemingly courting arrest to staying put -- at the Ghazipur border caught the district officials by surprise. They eventually walked out of the protest site, and marched to the other side of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, where a huge contingent of civil police, Provincial Armed Constabulary jawans and personnel of the Rapid Action Force were deployed.“We served him (Tikait) the notice...for eviction from the site and he was also to be arrested. But he seems to have played a ploy and unexpected events unfolded, in which he refused to leave the site. We have deployed sufficient police and other security personnel at the site and are also in talks with other farmer leaders,” said Ghaziabad additional district magistrate (city) Shailendra Kumar Singh, who went to the protest site to serve the notice.By night, the ripples of Thursday’s developments were felt at Muzaffarnagar’s Sisauli village in Uttar Pradesh, where over 5,000 farmers gathered in support of Tikait after his breakdown in front of television cameras.Before officials arrived at the Ghazipur border with a huge contingent of armed police, some people came in groups and began raising slogans against Tikait and demanded complete eviction of protesters from the site.“Tikait is lying since the beginning to farmers and brought them here for the protest. Many of these protesters went to Delhi on Republic Day and clashed with police...He is just trying to evade arrest and making unwanted statements against the BJP and even the BJP MLAs,” said Sunil Sharma, the party legislator from Sahibabad. The area on the Uttar Pradesh side falls under his constituency.“None of the people who arrived near the UP Gate site were BJP supporters; they were local people furious after the incidents at the Red Fort and in Delhi,” Sharma, who was not present at the border on Thursday, said.As tension spiralled, the Delhi Traffic Police closed off entry and exit from Ghazipur border on Thursday evening. Till afternoon, vehicles going from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh were allowed, while the opposite carriageway was closed. The action led to long traffic snarls in the national capital, with commuters getting stuck for several hours amid unannounced diversions and high traffic volume. Snarls were reported on the Noida Link Road, Ashram crossing, Vikas Marg, ITO intersection, Sarai Kale Khan, Barapullah, Pragati Maidan, Bhairon Marg and Lajpat Nagar.Satpal Singh, a farmer from Rampur, said many protesters left the site after panic set in. “It was a trick that the police used to intimidate farmers,” he said, referring to allegations that power and water connections were disrupted at the site.Sompal Singh, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar, said, “Since it was dark, we switched on lights of our tractors and lit log fires at many places,” he said.The standoff continued till the time of going to print.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eviction-notice-high-drama-at-ghazipur-101611868796538.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||Shameful to call me a traitor: On the run, Sidhu releases video||Actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, who was seen at Red Fort during a violent farmers’ protest, is likely to figure prominently in the list of people the Delhi Police will probe in connection with the mayhem on Republic Day, according to officials aware of the matter.“He will be probed in two cases by two different units. The crime branch will probe him for the violence at Red Fort. The special cell will probe him for the alleged conspiracy and plans to embarrass the government and the country at an international platform for doing what he did on Tuesday,” one of the officials said.The officials said they were yet to approach Sidhu, who allegedly led the mob that laid siege to the historic Red Fort, resorted to vandalism, and fought a pitched battle with the police after the protest by farmers against three agricultural laws plunged into chaos.A video purportedly showing Sidhu at Red Fort has been circulating on social media.The officials privy to the investigation said Sidhu may not be in Delhi and could have already fled to Punjab or Haryana. Officials posted at the borders have informed the police’s top brass that Sidhu, who was in Singhu (on the Haryana border) on January 26 morning, has not been spotted since that night.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella group that is organising the ongoing farmers’ protest, at Singhu and Tikri borders, blames Sidhu for the violence and for insulting the national flag at Red Fort.The SKM is holding meetings with the government on the farm laws that they want scrapped, and agreed to follow certain routes specified by the Delhi Police during their rally on Republic Day. Trouble began after some protesters deviated from the routes agreed upon.On Thursday, Sidhu denied the charges through a Facebook post. “...We all were peaceful and were exercising our democratic rights to protest peacefully, we were under the leadership of our farmer union leaders. We did not damage property... everything was peaceful nobody disrespected our national flag. Stop portraying this incident in any bad manner or bad light...(sic)”“...The tricolour was not demeaned, and there was no violence till I was there. Their support for what the public did at the Red Fort would have pressured the government to repeal the black (farm) laws,” Sidhu said. He added that thousands of people had reached there, but there was “no farmer leader”.They put up the ‘Nishan Sahib’ and a farmer flag at the flagpole to register their protest, said Sidhu.“If you say by doing so I have turned traitor then those who were present there were traitors too,” said the actor-turned-activist said.“If you impose all these things on one person and give him a certificate of traitor then I think you should be ashamed of yourself,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shameful-to-call-me-a-traitor-on-the-run-sidhu-releases-video-101611861434971.html
29-01-2021||India||Tension at farm protest sites as forces build up||Security forces dug trenches, put up barricades, and bolstered numbers at farmer protest sites on Delhi’s borders on Thursday, as tensions simmering since a violent Republic Day tractor rally threatened to boil over at Ghazipur on the eastern fringe of the Capital, where authorities issued an ultimatum to defiant cultivators, who refused to budge.Cracks have started to appear in the 64-day-old protest, which has lost momentum after the deadly turn of events on January 26 when farmer groups broke through barricades, clashed violently with police, ran riot on the Capital’s streets, and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, on its ramparts.Thursday’s standoff began in the afternoon when Ghaziabad additional district magistrate (city) Shailendra Kumar Singh asked protesters at UP Gate to end their two-month-long stir and vacate the spot at the earliest, or face penal action.The order came hours after protesters said power and water supply to the site were cut off, and hundreds of policemen streamedinto the site. Police also diverted traffic on arterial roads connecting Delhi to UP and Haryana, and closed several checkpoints, such as Auchandi and Piau.“We served him (Rakesh Tikait) the notice under section 133 of CrPC (conditional order for removal of nuisance) for eviction from the site and he was also to be arrested later on. But he seems to have played a ploy and unexpected events unfolded in which he refused to leave the site,” said Singh.But the farmers refused to move, with Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait saying he may approach the Supreme Court.“There is no question of vacating Ghazipur. Police can do whatever they want,” he said, as small groups of people shouted anti-farmer slogans. “The government wants to destroy farmers. If the farm laws are not repealed, Rakesh Tikait will commit suicide,” he told the agitators late evening, breaking down towards the end of the address.As night fell, a large police contingent and protesting farmers were positioned on either side of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, and Tikait announced a hunger strike. With visuals of Tikait breaking down beamed on television, around 5,000 farmers gathered at his ancestral village of Sisauli, roughly 100km away, and threatened to march to UP Gate.At the time of going to print, the standoff continued.Farmers, primarily from western UP, have been sitting in Ghazipur for about two months. Tikait’s brother, Naresh Tikait, announced in Muzaffarnagar that the agitation will be withdrawn. On Wednesday, at least two other unions had pulled out of the protests and the farm unions called off a march to Parliament on February 1, the day the Union budget will be presented. The unions lost more momentum on Thursday when another union, BKU (Lokshakti), which was camped at Noida, pulled out.Tension has been building at Delhi’s borders since the January 26 violence. Police and the government have accused farm leaders of betraying their trust, vandalising property worth crores, and threatening lives. Farm unions have taken responsibility for the violence, but blamed fringe elements led by Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu.At Singhu, on the Capital’s northwestern border, the biggest of the four sites for farmer mobilisation, police increased security, blocked major entry points to the site, installed more concrete barriers using cranes and dug trenches using a JCB machine.At around 12pm, nearly 50 people gathered and demanded that the protest be cleared. “We had been sympathetic to their cause so far because we too are farmers. But when we saw their actions during Republic Day, when they insulted the Tricolour at Red Fort, we knew that they were not farmers,” said Mohan Bhardwaj, 42, a resident of Bawana.The farm unions dismissed this demand and said they will continue their movement against three recently passed laws that they claim will erode their bargaining power and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by corporate giants.“The protests are not about sites but issues of farmers’ livelihoods. We will atone for the violence with a fast and whoever doesn’t agree with our peaceful goals are free to leave but the protests will continue as they are. They will only expand,” said Avik Saha, the national secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a farmers’ organisation that plays a key role in the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body leading the protests.Farm unions have called for a day-long fast on January 30, Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary, as a step towards “atonement” and taking moral responsibility for Tuesday’s violence.Delhi Police have already named senior leaders in their first information reports, including Yogendra Yadav, Balbeer Singh Rajewal, Buta Singh, SS Pannu, and Darshan Pal. Farm unions said they were prepared to face jail but won’t retreat. “When we began the agitation, we expected repression from the government. We didn’t expect cakes,” Saha said.The protesters also received political support from Opposition leaders. “Time to pick a side. My decision is clear. I am with democracy, farmers and their peaceful movement,” tweeted former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Ajit Singh spoke to the Tikait brothers over phone, announced Singh’s son Jayant Chaudhary. “Don’t worry. This is a do or die situation for the farmers. We need to remain together and united,” Singh told the farm leaders, according to a tweet by Chaudhary.Late in the evening, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced that members of BKU (Lok Shakti), which wasn’t a part of SKM, met him and announced their withdrawal from the stir. “BKU (Lok Shakti) condemns the way some elements spread havoc in Delhi,” read a letter to Tomar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tension-at-farm-protest-sites-as-forces-build-up-101611858252881.html
29-01-2021||India||Listen carefully, farmers won't stop protests: Yogendra Yadav||Yogendra Yadav, Swaraj Party leader who has been supporting the protests against the three farm laws, said on Friday farmers will continue holding their stance against the legislation and will not turn away. "Modi ji and Yogi ji and all others must listen carefully. Farmers will not go back from this movement, humiliated and defamed,'' Yadav said during a farmers' rally at Delhi's border with Uttar Pradesh.Earlier in the day, clashes broke out at the Singhu border between the farmers and counter-protesters who wanted the agitators to vacate the area. Both the groups pelted stones prompting the police to fire multiple tear gas shells in order to control the situation at the protest site. At least one local resident and a police personnel were injured during the clashes.Also Read | Tense situation at protest sites, police fire tear gas shells at SinghuFarmers have been protesting on the borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the new agricultural laws that the opposition parties and farmers say have been passed without any deliberations.Farmers from various states have been protesting against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, that they deem only benefit the market capitalists.Yadav is among the more than 40 people who have been named in the first information reports (FIRs) filed by the Delhi Police after the January 26 violence in the Capital.
