Reports said more and more farmers from various states of the country have now come to Delhi's borders to join the movement. By February 2, a record number of people will join the protests at the Delhi borders including Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, claimed various farmer leaders as per a PTI report."People from several areas area are heading towards Delhi borders to join the agitation. Our 'jatha' (group) of at least 700-800 tractors will leave for the Tikri border protest site on Sunday," Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said according to PTI. BKU (Rajewal) leader Balbir Singh Rajewal also said that people are reaching the protest sites in large numbers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. "Possibly by February 2, there will again a record gathering of people at the protest sites," claimed Rajewal while insisting that it would be completely peaceful.Also Read | ‘BJP leaders’: AAP on ‘locals’ who pelted stones on farmers at Singhu borderAs Singhu and Ghazipur borders turned into a fortress amid escalating tension, Rajewal urged people to not get provoked by any misinformation otherwise it would harm the ongoing movement. He appealed to the people joining the agitation at the Delhi border to keep the protest peaceful.Meanwhile, people who were not able to join the agitation in Delhi observed a hunger strike in Punjab, the PTI also reported. Protesting farmers also burnt effigies of Union ministers at 400 places in 14 districts, including Sangrur and Mohali, to mark their disapproval of the farm legislation. To express solidarity with protesting farmers, panchayats of some villages in Bathinda, Ludhiana and Sangrur in Punjab even passed resolutions, asking villagers to send one person from each family to the protest sites, PTI reported citing farmer leaders.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at Delhi's borders for more than two months now against the new farm laws. They are demanding a repeal of the laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for the procurement of their crops. Agitating farmers claim that the new laws will weaken the MSP system, despite the Centre seeking to assure them in vain that the MSP system was here to stay and the new laws would only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.The government has held several rounds of talks with the farmers but so far it failed to bring any resolution to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agitation-continues-to-gain-momentum-as-more-farmers-head-towards-delhi-101612027411953.html

I myself visited there and sent several hundred water tankers, but the Delhi police, at the behest of BJP, are not letting the tankers reach farmers.""The Delhi police are also blocking food provisions, machines to clean toilets, and doctors that the Delhi government has provided from reaching farmers," he added.On being asked about the attack on Alipur SHO, he said, "They are all BJP workers.

They say they are with farmers but they are doing the opposite. The JJP is ordering the tear gas and water cannon attacks on farmers," he said.He criticised Captain Amarinder Singh over his 'Pakistani elements' remark saying that Captain sahab is trying to give a new angle to every issue. One the one hand, he is making pretense of supporting farmers, and on the other, humiliating them.He said the attacks in the name of farmers are all orchestrated by the BJP.On Tuesday, during the tractor rally, a group of farmers deviated from the assigned route, broke through barriers, clashed with security personnel in several parts of Delhi.

Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-laws-will-break-the-backbone-of-agri-sector-arundhati-roy-101612024893499.html

Some villagers from western Uttar Pradesh including places like Muzaffarnagar, Greater Noida, and Meerut also reached Ghazipur border with water and buttermilk in clay pots to feed the protestors.Water and power supply at the protest site was disrupted by the local administration two days ago following an ultimatum to protestors to vacate the spot by Thursday night, prompting Tikait to say he would drink water only when farmers bring it from their villages but continue the stir.Overwhelmed by emotion, tears welled up the eyes of Tikait, who had proclaimed he would rather commit suicide than end the protest for farmers."A conspiracy is being planned by the BJP to weaken the agitation of farmers," Tikait claimed, a day after a BKU member filed a complaint at Kashambi police station here against two BJP MLAs for allegedly orchestrating violence at the protest site.A senior police official confirmed to PTI that the complaint was made against Loni MLA Nand Kishor Gujjar and Sahibabad MLA Sunil Sharma but FIR has not been lodged.Tikait also urged the Centre to restore internet services at protest sites so that farmers could put forth their views and demands on social media.Besides sending water tankers, the Ghaziabad civic bodies have also re-stationed mobile toilets at the protest site on Saturday, as support for the farmers' protest swelled with more villagers pouring in at the Delhi- Meerut highway in Ghazipur on the border with Uttar Pradesh.   The Bharatiya Kisan Union-led protest against the Centre's new farm laws here looked like it was going slim on Thursday but more protestors have joined the stir, following a mahapanchayat of farmers on Saturday in Muzaffarnagar, while supporters also joined in from Haryana and Rajasthan districts."The movement was and is strong," BKU's Meerut Zone president Pawan Khatana told PTI.Khatana, who is at the demonstration site with BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, said there has been continuous support for the "peaceful protest" against the farmers' demand for removal of the new agri laws."This is not a political protest. Anybody who shares the ideology of the BKU and Rakesh Tikait are welcome here. But it is our appeal to those who do not wish to support the movement till the end that please do not come only to leave in between," he said.Asked about estimated crowd size at the site, the farmer leader from western Uttar Pradesh said, "Farmers are coming in to show solidarity and leaving. It is not a stagnant crowd."On Friday night, the BKU office-bearers had estimated a crowd of around 10,000 people at Ghazipur while the Ghaziabad police officials pegged it around 5,000 to 6,000.Heavy security deployment, including personnel of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), Rapid Action Force (RAF) in anti-riot gears and civil police, was made at the protest site.Meanwhile, the Delhi Traffic Police said to and fro movement on the National Highway 24 (Delhi-Meerut Expressway) has been closed.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parathas-pickle-and-buttermilk-rakesh-tikait-s-tears-draw-food-in-form-of-love-101612023935508.html

According to a person aware of the details, though LJP’s Chirag Paswan was invited for the meeting, he later stayed away citing ill-health.The NDA has lost two of its oldest allies, the Shiva Sena and the Shiromani Akali Dal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-facts-to-counter-misgivings-on-farm-laws-pm-modi-101612018840111.html
30-01-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand BJP MLA faces ire for likening farmers' demands to 'eagle's urine'||Amid the ongoing protest by the farmers demanding the Centre to repeal the three farm laws, BJP MLA from Uttarakhand's Jhabreda constituency of Haridwar stirred a storm by likening farmers' demands to "eagle's urine". BJP MLA Deshraj Karnwal said that that the "farmers don't know what their demands are".A video of the MLA making the aforementioned statement to some local media persons in Haridwar went viral on the social media on Saturday morning drawing sharp criticism from opposition Congress and local farmer leaders. Karnwal reportedly made the statement two days ago.HT has access to the video in which the ruling party MLA could be purportedly seen making the derogatory statement while condemning the violence in Delhi during tractor parade on Republic Day.Karnwal while condemning the violence said, "What happened on January 26 in Delhi was very unfortunate. I fully condemn it. It was completely a conspiracy by the Congress and other Opposition parties."Also read: What the Union Budget needs to get rightHe further stated, "Initially the farmers had demanded amendments in the farm laws which the government accepted. Then also they didn't end the agitation. The government is asking them about their demands but they are like we want eagle's urine, which is a non-existent thing. How can the government meet their demand for a thing which doesn't exist?"Karnwal couldn't be contacted despite several attempts.As soon as the video went viral on social media, Karnwal and BJP came under attack by the Congress and farmer leaders which termed his statement "highly condemnable and unpardonable."State general secretary of Rashtriya Kisaan-Mazdoor Sangathan, Anil Choudhary termed Karnwal as a "blot in the name of an elected public representative.""What he said for the farmers shows his mindset. And the shameful thing is that a person like him is an MLA. He knows nothing about the laws and is using such derogatory words for the farmers. They will answer him and the BJP in the next election," said Choudhary.Congress state vice president Suryakant Dhasmana attacked the ruling BJP on Karnwal's statement."What he said about the farmers is not just his words but the mentality of the BJP which has been labelling our farmers' as terrorists, anti-nationals and people funded by Pakistan and China. It is just unpardonable," said Dhasmana adding, "BJP leaders like Karnwal are just towing the line of their senior leaders sitting in Delhi."The state BJP leadership, meanwhile, said that they have come to know the matter through media and would ask Karnwal for a "clarification."Bansidhar Bhagat, BJP state president said, "The matter has come to our notice through media. We would seek a clarification from Karnwal on his use of words for the farmers following which an appropriate action would be taken."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-bjp-mla-faces-ire-for-likening-farmers-demands-to-eagle-s-urine-101612016996724.html
30-01-2021||India||Rakesh Tikait is the cynosure of many eyes – not just farmers||His tears exercised an emotive pull even he may not have envisaged, helping turn the tide for a movement that seemed to have lost both sheen and momentum after the violence on Republic Day. It was but a moment in time and Rakesh Tikait was the man in it.He was once a Delhi Police constable, tried his hand at electoral politics and been a farmer leader for years. But Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Tikait has broken out of the confines of western Uttar Pradesh to find a space in the national spotlight as arguably the most powerful farm leader of the day.The two-month farmer movement against the Centre’s three farm laws was till now dominated by protesters from the fields of Punjab and Haryana who set up camp at the Singhu and Tikri border points into the city. Now, the focus has shifted to Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border where farmers are gathering in thousands to boost the fight that seemed to have been weakening only two days ago.A day after the Republic Day violence in Delhi, when a section of farmers taking part in the tractor parade broke through barriers, clashed with police and stormed the Red Fort for a few hours, the farmer game it seemed to be over. Morale plummeted and many farmers returned home. On Wednesday night, the atmosphere was tense at Ghazipur. The Ghaziabad administration issued an “ultimatum” to the protesters occupying a stretch of the Delhi-Meerut expressway to vacate as the January 26 clashes painted a not-so-peaceful picture of the peasant community.And then came the Tikait moment. As security presence at the site escalated and fears grew that the protesters would be forcibly evicted, an emotional Tikait broke down while talking to reporters.“The protest won’t be called off. Farmers are being met with injustice,” he said and even threatened to end his life for the cause.It soon emerged that the 51-year-old who was leading BKU supporters at the Ghazipur border since November 28, was no ordinary man at all. His call for continuing the protest against the government struck a deep emotional chord. Videos of his emotional outburst were circulated across multiple platforms.It led to his brother Naresh Tikait calling a ‘mahapanchayat’ at their home town in Muzaffarnagar on Friday where tens of thousands of farmers gathered to back the movement.The crowd at Ghazipur border that had reduced to 500 on Thursday night grew manifold over the next 12 hours, running into well over 5,000 in next 24 hours. The farmer movement was not just revived but further energised.Tikait, who has been part of a delegation talking with the Centre over the ongoing protest, is also one of the accused in the January 26 violence in Delhi that saw one farmer dying when his tractor overturned and hundreds of people, including police personnel, being injured.He has denied the allegations of conspiracy and demanded a judicial probe into the violence, blaming infiltrators in the tractors’ parade of the unrest. To be named as an accused by the Delhi Police is perhaps strange for Tikait, who served as a head constable in the force but quit in 1992-93 when he had to deal with a farmers’ agitation led by his father, the legendary Mahendra Singh Tikait.Born on June 4, 1969 in Sisauli village of Muzaffarnagar district in western Uttar Pradesh, Rakesh Tikait joined BKU after quitting the Delhi Police and gained prominence as a farm leader after the death of his father to cancer in May 2011.Mahendra Tikait, who was hailed as “messiah” of farmers, had inherited the ‘Chaudhary’ title of the regional Baliyan khap (a social and administrative system in parts of north India) at the age of eight from his father. Going by the tradition of the khap, the title passed on to his elder son and Rakesh Tikait’s elder brother Naresh.But Rakesh Tikait, a BA graduate from the Meerut University, was designated national spokesperson of the BKU. He has two younger brothers -- Surendra, who works as a manager in a sugar mill, and Narendra, engaged in agriculture.The father of three – two daughters and a son -- has been at loggerheads with various governments on a range of farmers’ issues, including loan waivers, minimum support price (MSP), power tariff and land acquisition in states such as UP, Haryana Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh.He also tried his hand at elections but lost both times.In 2007, he contested the UP Assembly polls from Khatauli constituency in Muzaffarnagar as an independent candidate. In 2014, he fought the Lok Sabha election from Amroha district on a Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) ticket.It’s an affluent family.Ahead of the 2014 polls, Tikait had declared assets worth ₹4.25 crore, including ₹10 lakh cash, and liabilities of ₹10.95 lakh with land worth over ₹3 crore forming the biggest chunk of his assets.He also declared three criminal cases against him in the election affidavit. These cases were lodged in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, and Anuppur in Madhya Pradesh.The vocal farmer leader had to spend nights behind the bars for defying public servant’s orders during several of the protests that he has led in the past decade.Having dug in his heels along with his supporters at the Ghazipur border amid a deadlock with the Centre over the new farm laws, Tikait on Saturday was once again teary eyed.But this time overwhelmed by emotion as villagers, including children, reached the protest site carrying water, homemade food and buttermilk, after he announced he would drink water only when farmers will bring it since the local administration had barred water tankers at the protest site.Rakesh Tikait is now the cynosure of many eyes – and it’s not just farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-is-the-cynosure-of-many-eyes-not-just-farmers-101612017260597.html
30-01-2021||India||PM Modi should talk to farmers directly, says Congress' Ashok Gehlot||The Centre can still correct its "ill-measures" against the farmers, who have been protesting against the three central farm laws, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi must talk to them, senior Congress leader and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot suggested on Saturday."There is still a chance for the government to correct its ill measures. I believe the Prime Minister must take cognizance and talk to the farmers himself. The government should reverse the decision (regarding the farm laws)," Gehlot said, reported news agency ANI. Suggesting a rollback to PM Modi-led government, Gehlot said, "There is nothing wrong with changing decisions. It happens in a democracy. People will welcome it."Gehlot criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for not carrying out a judicial inquiry into the incident of violence on Republic Day in the national capital. "We condemn the violence on Republic Day by some anti-social elements. Why did judicial inquiry not happen? There should be a fair probe into the incident."Gehlot also backed the farmers' movement and said that they were protesting peacefully for 65 days. Blaming the BJP for sparking clashes at Delhi's Singhu border, where alleged local residents protested against farmers occupying the space on Friday, Gehlot said, "The clashes happened on the behest of the BJP. They (BJP) are pushing villagers to clash with farmers. This is not good."Three days after the clashes that broke out on Republic Day in the national capital, opposition parties are training guns at the government and the ruling party at the Centre, accusing them of discrediting the farmers' movement. Earlier in the day, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) claimed that the violence that took place during the tractor parade on January 26 was scripted by the BJP with the help of Delhi Police to "defame and discredit" the farmers' movement.Addressing a press conference, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj called BJP leaders the "greatest anti-nationals" and demanded that cases of sedition must be filed against them and probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). "Police and BJP together scripted the violence of January 26 and the days after. This script was prepared by the BJP with the help of Delhi Police to defame and discredit the farmers' movement," the AAP leader claimed.The BJP has not responded to the allegations so far.Protests had erupted in parts of Delhi and on its surrounding borders after the tractor rally called by the agitating farmers took a violent turn on India's 72nd Republic Day on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-should-talk-to-farmers-directly-says-congress-ashok-gehlot-101612009528590.html

On being asked whether he has plans to join the protest being spearheaded by his union, he said after attending a mahapanchayat at Baghpat, he will head to Delhi.There is a Panchayat in Baghpat tomorrow, we will head to Delhi after attending it: Naresh Tikait, President, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) when asked if he will go to the ongoing farmers' agitation at the borders of Delhi#FarmLaws pic.twitter.com/0jlRv5QN6cOn Friday, Naresh Tikait called a mahapanchayat at Muzaffarnagar which saw massive participation of farmers. The panchayat has decided to throw its weight behind the protest.After Ghaziabad administration asked the protesters at Ghazipur site to vacate the place, Naresh Tikait initially decided to yield to the pressure. On Thursday evening, he announced that the Ghazipur site will be vacated. His brother and union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, however, held the fort and said he will commit suicide but not vacate the protest site. His emotional video apparently mobilised a number of farmers who set out for the Ghazipur site.Though the difference of opinion between the two brothers came across as a discord, Nareh Tikait later said that his brother's tears will not go in vain.Uttar Pradesh Police, however, has said that there was additional security at the site on Thursday to keep an eye on outsiders entering the protest site to create disruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-head-to-delhi-naresh-tikait-may-join-brother-rakesh-tikait-in-protest-101611994981278.html
30-01-2021||India||Centre stands by offer made to farmers: PM Modi at all party meet||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday chaired an all party meeting ahead of Monday’s budget session where he said government stands by the offer made to the farmers by agriculture minister Naresh Tomar at the last meeting between the government and farmer representatives.Even as the government has offered to put the new laws in abeyance for 18 months, a section of protesting farmers and opposition parties are adamant on the laws being repealed. Speaking at the meeting, the PM said discussions in Parliament will be a way out of the current logjam, even as a clutch of opposition parties demanded more discussions on the new farm laws.Parliamentary affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi told media persons that the Prime Minister, at the meeting, said that whatever was discussed between the Agriculture minister and the farm leaders at the 11th meeting still stands good. “Agriculture minister Tomar had said that the government is open for discussions; he also said that I (Tomar) am a phone call away and I am ready for discussions and this still stands good,”Joshi said.Joshi also said the government is ready for discussions on a range of issues that the opposition wants. He said discussion will be taken up in the second half of the budget session.As per people aware of the meeting, the Prime Minister also noted that disruptions in Parliament affect the smaller parties the most. He said smaller parties must get more time to speak in Parliament and that they must prevail on the parties with more representatives to not disrupt the functioning.A second person privy to the meeting said most of the floor leaders agreed that Parliament must be allowed to function and the issues related to the farm agitation can be taken up during the discussions on the President’s address and during the discussion on the budget.BJD’s Pinaki Misra who was present for the meeting said, Odisha chief minister and BJD president, Naveen Patnaik, has specifically requested the Union government to have the women's reservation bill passed in this budget session.He said the BJD gave 7 out of 21 MP tickets to women in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the only political party to have done so.According to a person aware of the details, the YSR Congress and the TRS, too, backed Odisha CM’s demand for the passage of women's reservation bill in the forthcoming session. The bill was earlier passed in Rajya Sabha in 2010.On Friday, the Prime Minister had expressed hope that MPs from across political parties will contribute to make the budget session effective in meeting the aspirations of the people. The opposition parties, which boycotted the President‘s address on Friday, are likely to attack the government on a raft of issues, including the ongoing farmers’ agitation for repealing the contentious farm laws, escalation of tensions between India and China along the line of actual control and the government’s response to the corona pandemic and its impact on the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-stands-by-offer-made-to-farmers-pm-modi-at-all-party-meet-101611997421719.html

30-01-2021||Delhi||Farm agitation swells after surge in Jatland||Thousands of farmers poured into Ghazipur on the eastern fringes of Delhi on Friday after an emotional appeal for support by farm leader Rakesh Tikait, indicating that the government crackdown on the two-month-old agitation following violence on Republic Day may have partially backfired.Farmers from 10 districts in western UP, a stronghold of the influential Jat community, congregated at a massive gathering in Muzaffarnagar, where they announced the social boycott of anyone not backing the movement. In Haryana, khaps, or clan-based bodies, vowed to send at least one person from each family to bolster the ongoing stir against three agriculture laws passed in September.Throughout the night, cultivators took tractors, trucks and motorbikes to reach the Delhi border, where numbers swelled and morale mounted with the arrival of a new contingent of protesters determined to defend the honour of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Tikait.While just about a thousandfarmers had gathered at Ghazipur on Thursday, the number swelled around 10,000 on Friday.“If the police use force on us for not leaving, it is not a problem. But if some political organisations attempt to trouble us, that is unacceptable...Now, I will not surrender (to the police), we’ll continue to protest here,” Tikait told the gathering.It was a dramatic reversal from Thursday afternoon, when dwindling numbers, bitter public fallout of violence by farmers at the Republic Day tractor rally, and increasing police presence, left the protesters demoralised.The Ghaziabad administration served Tikait, son of legendary farm leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, with an ultimatum to vacate the site or face penal consequences, part of a wider crackdown on the agitation since January 26. Farmers also said that the authorities cut off their water and power supply to the site.But instead of caving in, Tikait broke down in front of television cameras and vowed to not leave the site until the government repealed the laws. “If the farm laws are not repealed, Rakesh Tikait will commit suicide,” he had said, biting back tears.These visuals were beamed on television channels and went viral on social media, triggering calls for mobilisation from temples, mosques and panchayats across western UP throughout the night. Tikait’s resolve to not drink water unless it was brought from his village in particular touched a chord with the people, who carried water in bottles and pouches from their homes in the heartland to the Capital’s edge.Prabhjeet Singh, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar who returned to Ghazipur a day after he left for his home, said, “We couldn’t leave him (Tikait) to battle it alone when he needed us the most”By morning, the agitation seemed to have regained some of the momentum it lost when on Republic Day, farmer groups broke through barricades, clashed violently with police, ran riot on the Capital’s streets, and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, on its ramparts.The violence and vandalisation were widely condemned and sparked statements of remorse and anguish from farm groups across north India, even as unions leading the stir blamed fringe elements, a government “conspiracy”, and Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu for stoking passions.The improvement in morale was visible in the principal protest site at the Singhu border despite violence by a mob of around 200 people earlier in the day. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body leading the stir, said farmers will hold a one-day hunger strike to mark Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary on January 30.“Today, we just saw farmers arriving in Ghazipur. In a couple of days, more protesters will arrive at Tikri, Singhu, and Shahjahanpur border from Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan,” said Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union Punjab.Ghazipur is the smallest of the three protest sites — after Singhu and Tikri on the Capital’s northwestern and western borders respectively — where farmers have camped since November.But on Friday, it was the focal point of the agitation as politicians, journalists, ordinary people made a beeline to meet Tikait, and union leaders scrambled to put up more tents, and set up community kitchens for the incoming crowds.Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia met Tikait and extended unconditional support on behalf of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “It is in such tough times that one aandolankari (protesters) come to help other aandolankari (protesters),” Tikait responded.Other politicians to visit were Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, and Congress leader Deepinder Singh Hooda. Opposition politicians across the country also extended their support.“I want to tell the farmers, don’t retract even by an inch. These laws will give a shock to middle class too, as food prices will skyrocket. The only solution is to repeal these laws,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said.In Haryana, khaps held meetings across the state and decided to send members to the farmer protests, and socially boycott leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janata Party (JJP). Haryana is governed by a BJP-JJP coalition. The move came even as the Haryana government suspended mobile internet in 17 districts.In Muzaffarnagar, Tikait’s brother Naresh Tikait organised a show of strength attended by tens of thousands of farmers. “The ongoing movement is a battle for the honour of farmers and, if it ends, it will damage our very existence,” said Naresh Tikait after the seven-hour mahapanchayat.In the face of increased mobilisation, police retreated from the Ghazipur site even as UP additional director general of police (ADG), law and order, Prashant Kumar said they were in touch with farmer leaders to find an amicable solution through talks.(with inputs from HTC in Lucknow, Chandigarh and Rohtak)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farm-agitation-swells-after-surge-in-jatland-101611970909266.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||More FIRs on Cong leader, journos||Police in Bhopal and Gurugram filed a case against seven people, including Congress leader Shashi Tharoor and journalist Rajdeep Sardesai, for allegedly misreporting and spreading disharmony during violent clashes in Delhi on Republic Day.This came a day after Noida police filed an FIR against the same group of people under similar charges. On Friday, the Editors Guild of India condemned the police action, saying it was an attempt to “browbeat” and “intimidate” the media.The Gurugram FIR was filed on Thursday night on the basis of a complaint by Jharsa resident Pankaj Singh, 34, who works with a private company. In Bhopal, the FIR was registered by Sanjay Raghuvanshi, 43, a local resident, late on Thursday.All three FIRs name Tharoor, Sardesai, Mrinal Pande, Zafar Agha, Paresh Nath, Anant Nath, Vinod K Jose and unknown persons. In the Noida and Gurugram complaints, charges of sedition, criminal conspiracy, promoting hatred, among others, were leveled.

30-01-2021||Delhi||Questions raised after police fail to stop breach||Multiple barricades, deep trenches, and at least 1,000 personnel of Delhi Police and paramilitary forces failed to stop a mob of 200 people from reaching the stage of the farmer protest at Singhu border, attacking the protesters with sticks, and pelting stones at them in a breach that sparked clashes at the site on Friday afternoon.This was the first incident of violence at the protest site, and forced police to lob tear-gas shells and lathi-charge both farmers and the mob, who claimed to be local residents. Television visuals also showed police and some counter-protesters beating a farmer.Many farmers at the site accused Delhi Police of being mute spectators while the mob came dangerously close to the farmers and attacked them. They also pointed out that the security forces had stopped several journalists and politicians from reaching the stage of the site earlier.“If police wanted, they could have stopped those goons. Carrying national flags and shouting slogans, it was clear that they were protesting against us. Police should have stopped them from coming here. It wasn’t difficult to make out that they are not among us protesters. The violence could have been avoided,” said Joginder Kaur, 55, a farmer from Kot Budha village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab, who was near the stage when the violence started.The site is divided in two parts. First is the Kisaan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) stage, and then a larger Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) stage about 500 metres away. Vehicle coming to Singhu are stopped at the first barricade set up a kilometre away from the KMSC stage. Only police officers, media personnel, and people connected to the protests are allowed to pass through the barricaded highway.But on Friday, the mob managed to walk past barricades and security forces from the first barrier to the KMSC stage. The farmers also alleged that the mob shouted slogans like “Goli Maaro... ”.“Police stopped water tankers from reaching us. This morning, I walked up to the barricades requesting them to let the tankers enter but the police did not allow. Some politicians were also stopped . Then, why did they allow the mob shouting provocative slogans reach till the stage area? The videos are there for everyone to see,” said Jaswant Singh, 32, a farmer from Jalandhar district.He was referring to videos on social media -- not verified independently -- that showed a group of men pelting stones while police personnel stood next to them. One video showed a masked man throwing stones. Another showed some police personnel in anti-riot gear standing during the stone pelting.A photograph of a man, who was identified by many on social media as Aman Dabas, husband of Bharatiya Janata Party councillor from Bawana Anju Dabas, also went viral on social media. Anju Dabas confirmed her husband was in Singhu but said he was not there as a party representative. “He was there as any other local who is facing problem due to the ongoing agitation of farmers,” said Anju.Delhi Police issued a statement, which said that around 1.30pm, around 200 locals reached the GTB Memorial, towards Singhu and went to meet the farmers. “They said they have been providing all kinds of help to protesters for last two months but now their livelihood is getting affected, hence they are requested to open the border and vacate the road,” a Delhi police spokesperson said.“This was resisted by some farmers and pushing-pulling of the police barricades kept to secure the langar tents...during this stone pelting started,” the spokesperson added. The statement did not clarify which group pelted the stones.A senior officer in Singhu said police did not let the locals reach the stage. “The place near the stage, where the locals reached today is an open area. People are free to walk until this point. After today’s incident, people will not be allowed to walk up to that point too,” said the officer.Until late Friday, police arrested 44 persons from both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/questions-raised-after-police-fail-to-stop-breach-101611966151021.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||Sticks, stones at Singhu as group enters site, clashes with farmers||A group of around 200 people who said they were locals entered the Singhu border protest site despite heavy barricading and police presence on Friday, and clashed with both cops and farmers in an incident that led to injuries to an SHO and several others.The SHO of Alipur, Pradeep Paliwal, was injured after he was hit on his left palm by the sword of a protesting Sikh farmer. Eyewitnesses said that the farmer was intending to drive the stone-pelting mob away, even as police said that he attacked the officer. There were also visuals of police personnel and members of the group of counter-protesters beating the farmer with lathis.Gurkirat Singh, 22, a farmer from Gulalipur village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab, said the incident unfolded before him. “The violent crowd which had come to attack us was throwing stones, sticks, and bricks. The farmer was trying to chase the mob away. Instead, he was attacked by police and the mob, and the officer got hurt in the process,” he said.Delhi Police said they have registered a case of attempt to murder, rioting, obstructing public servant on duty and other sections against the 25-year-old farmer, Ranjeet Singh from Nawanshahr district in Punjab. Police said 44 people from both groups, who were indulging in violence, were caught at the spot.“At least five police personnel sustained injuries. The 25-year-old protester who injured inspector Paliwal has been arrested, and the sword has been recovered. We are verifying the identity and the affiliation of the 43 persons arrested in the case. They belong to both groups,” said a senior police officer.Farmer leaders said at least 15 protesters were hurt during Friday’s clashes.How it beganThe main protest site at Singhu border -- where hundreds and thousands of farmers have gathered at different points over a 64-day protest, and where tents now stretch for more than 10km -- is divided into two parts. First is the Kisaan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) stage, and then a larger Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) stage about 500 metres away.At around 12.30pm, over 100 people claiming to be locals managed to come close to the KMSC stage by crossing police barricades set up over 1km before the tents begin. They were raising slogans of “goli maaro...” (shoot the traitors) and branding the farmers as “Khalistanis”. Some of them had covered their faces with mufflers and handkerchiefs.These protesters claimed to be anguished by the insult to the national tricolour during the Republic Day tractor rally by farmers that descended into violence, and particularly by the hoisting of a Sikh religious flag alongside the national flag at Red Fort.Many among them had come to the protest area on Thursday as well, demanding the removal of farmers. HT reported on Thursday that the protesters included members of groups called the Hindu Sena, the Hinda Yuva Seva Sangh, and the Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch (DDVM), which is a collective of about 50 villages.“Some of us had gone to Alipur police station to submit a letter calling for clearing the highway and we sent a similar letter via email to Delhi police commissioner and Lieutenant Governor. While we were returning, we got to know of the incident. Our people told us that farmers had become hostile leading to the clashes. If we had been there, we could have stopped the situation from escalating,” said Anup Singh Maan, general secretary, DDVM.Ravi Das, who was part of the group, said he was a local resident and was bothered by the farmers’ protests. “We wanted farmers to clear the highway. They were carrying weapons like swords, so we had to save ourselves. They started throwing stones,” he alleged.The group was briefly stopped by the police at the point of entry at the barricades set up on one carriageway near the Singhu border toll plaza. However, they soon jumped over to the other side and rushed at the tents set up by the farmers, disrupting their lunch langar.Rare breachIt was a rare breach of the security setup on a day when Delhi Police did not allow any vehicles to cross the barricade. Only those on foot were allowed after stating the purpose of their visit. Aam Aadmi Party leaders Satyendar Jain and Raghav Chadha were also not allowed to visit the protest site on Friday morning.“We had come here to ensure that the farmers have water and adequate facilities for toilet and cleaning. But the police are not allowing the Delhi Jal Board water tankers to pass. This is a human rights violation. The BJP government is treating farmers like terrorists,” said Chadha, AAP MLA and DJB vice chairperson. Jain added, “The police are telling us that they have orders from above to not allow water tankers. We asked them to show the orders, but they didn’t do that.”At around 1.40pm, the counter-protesters began pelting stones at farmers, and they retaliated. The two groups threw sticks, stones, and bricks at each other, injuring several people and leading to the police firing several rounds of tear gas shells to control the situation.Kashmir Kaur, 60, a farmer from Wali Pur village in Tarn Taran district, said she was sleeping inside a tent set up for women – close to the flashpoint. “We were resting when the first tear gas shell entered the tent. I couldn’t see because of it and had to run towards the other side. Our blankets and clothes caught fire as well. I don’t know why police were firing tear gas shells towards us when they [the mob] was the one attacking us,” she said.Though police were able to take the counter-protesters away from the main site around 2pm, nearly 30 minutes later, another round of stone-pelting began despite the presence of personnel from the Rapid Action Force. The police then led the group to around a kilometre from the protest site.Around 3pm, however, the group entered a Guru Tegh Bahadur memorial on the side through a gate near the barricades and replaced farmer union flags with the tricolour, before being chased away by the security forces.KMSC member Kuldeep Singh, 56, a farmer from Lohian in Jalandhar district, said: “These elements were sent here to provoke us. How is it possible that when water tankers are not being allowed, a mob of around 100 people managed to enter, damage our langar, and throw stones at us amid police presence,” he said.Near one of the concrete barricades set up on Friday after the incident, a group from Tarn Taran district sat huddled. “Around a dozen of us will participate in vigil and patrol in batches of three. Today, all of us will stay awake and keep an eye,” said Karaj Singh, one of the protesters in the group.(with inputs from Abhishek Dey)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sticks-stones-at-singhu-as-group-enters-site-clashes-with-farmers-101611965723289.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||Tears, water, and a protest rekindled||It was around 9pm on Thursday when Gaurav Sangwan, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar, back with his wife and two children for only three hours after spending a fortnight at the Ghazipur protest site, received a video message on WhatsApp. It showed farmer leader Rakesh Tikait breaking down in tears while speaking to the media.Tikait, facing a situation where water and power at the encampment was cut off and an eviction notice served by the Uttar Pradesh Police and the district administration, was saying in the video that he would not leave. He also vowed that he would not drink water until it was brought from his village in the heart of western UP.Less than 30 minutes after he watched the clip, Sangwan was driving back to Delhi in a car with five other farmers. “If a man cries, he is a good man. I will be betraying a good man if I stayed back at home,” Sangwan said at the Ghazipur site on Friday, summing up his decision to return.Sangwan was among thousands of agitators who were swayed by Tikait’s tears and his call for water from back home; they rushed to Ghazipur despite the possibility of a midnight crackdown on the protesters days after the Republic Day tractor march in the national capital descended into violence and chaos.This time, apart from old-timers who had been here before, farmers who initially sat out of the protest landed up as well. Instead of winding up, by Friday morning the protest spot had crowds much larger than at any time over the past two months. Farmers there said the crowd would swell even more by Saturday morning.As they streamed in, most of the farmers did not head to tents or langars (community kitchens) ; instead, they went straight to the stage to hear their leader speak. And Tikait -- son of the legendary late farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait who headed the Bharatiya Kisan Union -- addressed them again and again, until his voice cracked and broke.Each time he could speak no more, the crowd called out to him. “Tikait tum aage badho, hum tumhaare saath hain (Tikait, you move ahead. We are right behind you).”Farmers flocked to click pictures with him, journalists queued up to interview him, and protesters all around discussed his video message from the previous evening.For the first time since the protests began in November, attention , restricted largely to the two larger protests sites, Singhu and Tikri, inhabited largely by farmers from Punjab and Haryana, moved to Ghazipur.From the stage, Tikait hit out at the local administration for cutting the water and power supply to the protest site.“If the government (local administration) doesn’t send water tankers within two hours, we’ll dig our own bore wells here and draw water. The ground and its water belongs to everyone,” he told a gathering that was growing through the day.But neither Tikait, nor the other farmers here, were short of water on Friday.While some locals arranged for water tankers, as did the Delhi government -- it was visuals of people bringing drinking water directly from their villages to Tikait that stood out.A man from Meerut brought an old plastic bottle, only half filled with water; a young boy from Muzaffarnagar, sitting on his father’s shoulders, carried a large tumbler in his hands; someone from Amroha brought water straight from the Ganga; and lots of the returnees carried water to the stage in large plastic jugs. Tikait’s associates would pour some of the water in a small steel container as a symbol of respect.A woman who sang on the main stage offered to sell a recently constructed house if the movement needed funding; some residents of Noida and leaders from the Ghazipur Mandi said from the stage that, despite the inconvenience, they did not mind farmers occupying the road.Support also arrived in the form of political leaders. Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia extended unconditional support, and said that he was sent by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to ensure that all arrangements were in place.“Kejriwal ji sent me to ensure you don’t face any problems,” Sisodia told the gathering.“It is in such tough times that one aandolankari (protester) come to help other aandolankari (protester),” Tikait responded.Other politicians to visit were Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary, UP Congress Committee chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, Haryana Congress leader Deepender Singh Hooda, Swaraj India founder Yogendra Yadav, and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad.As more people poured in -- some tractors made multiple rounds to nearby villages to ferry people; others took public buses -- the Ghazipur site was clearly not prepared for the surge. Tents brought down by the departing farmers on Thursday afternoon were hurriedly re-erected; new ones came up as well. At the langars, the lunch was mostly limited to rice and dal, and the snacks to tea and rusk.“Now we won’t make the mistake of leaving in large numbers until our demands are met. Tikait’s cries made us realise that taking one step back would mean government taking many steps forward to remove us,” said Harminder Singh, a farmer who returned from Bareilly.Tikait assured the farmers that there was no going back a second time.On Thursday, he offered to surrender to the police before saying he would not leave -- for the sake of the agitation to repeal three contentious farm laws, and for the sake of his “Sikh brothers”, who, he said, were being branded as traitors over the Republic Day violence, which he said was part of the “conspiracy” to malign the movement.“The government conspired to insult us. But now I’ll ensure the farm laws are repealed and you return homes safely and with pride,” he told the gathering.By repeatedly waving a large national flag from the stage, he did his bit to undo the damage caused to the movement by the violence and vandalism on Republic Day.The UP Police were on the sidelines throughout Friday.A Delhi Police officer, who did not want to be named, said the barricades were made more secure to negate any chance of people from either side mingling with each other. “But we did not stop any media persons. They were allowed to pass, upon producing identity cards,” said the officer.Delhi Police personnel stayed beyond the barricades, several hundred metres from the stage, where the gathered crowd raised their hands each time Tikait sought their assurance for a peaceful protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tears-water-and-a-protest-rekindled-101611963311489.html
30-01-2021||India||BJP wary after Jats answer protest call in UP, Haryana||The Jat mahapanchayat’s decision on Friday to support the farm protest, the presence of tens of thousands of farmers from western Uttar Pradesh in this meeting, and the fact that some of these farmers and also Jat farmers from Haryana have arrived at or are driving towards Ghazipur on the Delhi border has set alarm signals flashing in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which counts the community as part of its support base in key northern states.Senior BJP leaders said on condition of anonymity that they fear the farmers agitation could affect its prospects in states such as Uttar Pradesh.“We are watching events unfold. While it is too soon to say that there will be a problem with the Jats, we are cautious. The party is continuing to reach out to community leaders and Khap (clan) elders,” said one of the leaders, a senior party functionary.On Thursday night, facing an ultimatum from Uttar Pradesh police to vacate the area, and the prospect of no power and water (the local administration cut of supplies of both to the campsite) farmer leader Rakesh Tikait broke down while appealing to farmers from western UP to join the protest; this resulted in a huge mobilisation of farmers at the Ghazipur border that continued through Friday.On Friday, opposition parties such as the Congress, the Rashtriya Lok Dal and the Indian National Lok Dal extended support to the farmers who are demanding a repeal of the farm laws.While the BJP has so far managed to quell voices of dissent in Haryana, where it runs a coalition government with the Jannayak Janta Party that counts Jats as its primary vote base, party leaders said it does not want a repeat of the violence that erupted in 2016 following the agitation by Jats seeking the benefits reserved for OBC communities.“Despite the 2016 Jat agitation, the party managed to increase its vote share in Haryana, but recent events have the potential to cause problems,” said a second leader.Since the beginning of the farmers’ agitation, over half a dozen JJP MLAs, a few independent legislators, and BJP leaders from the region have expressed concern over the handling of the crisis. In Rajasthan, the the BJP’s ally, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party leader and Nagaur MP, Hanuman Beniwal, parted ways with the party over the farm agitation.“The events that unfolded last night are avoidable. It does not augur well for the party to have the farm agitation take the form of communal politics,” added the second leader.Former national general secretary of the BJP and Rajya Sabha MP Anil Jain said the agitation is politically motivated.But experts said that doesn’t solve the party’s problem.Political commentator Manisha Priyam said the coming together of Sikhs and Jats is a message that the politics of identity is not enough.“The BJP government will have to address economic insecurities. The farm crisis shows that there is a fear among the landed, dominant castes (such as the Jats) that their land will go,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-wary-after-jats-answer-protest-call-in-up-haryana-101611959795627.html
30-01-2021||India||One person from each house to reach Delhi: Haryana khap leaders||Major khap (clan) panchayats in Haryana on Friday decided to send at least one person from each family to farmer protests on Delhi’s borders and socially boycott leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) , khap leaders said. Haryana is governed by a BJP-JJP coalition.The move came even as the Haryana government suspended mobile Internet in Rewari, Ambala, Jind, Bhiwani, Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Hisar, Rohtak, and Sirsa till Saturday evening, one of the most extensive internet blackouts in the state. The move is aimed at restricting communication between farm groups and preventing mobilisation. But the damage had already been done.One of the state’s most influential khaps, Kandela, held meetings at Kandela village on Friday. Likewise, the Dadan and Barh khaps hold their meetings at Uchana and Julana in Jind respectively. The Phogat khap met in Dadri, the Sarv khap in Rohtak , and the Sarv Sheoran khap at Kharkari village in Bhiwani.Balwant Nambardar, head of the Phogat Khap, said, “We have socially boycotted Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh and former Dadri MLA Rajdeep Phogat, who is a chairman in the BJP-JJP government. We will not call these leaders in our social functions.Om Prakash Hooda, president of Hooda Khap, said his clan has unanimously decided to restrict the entry of ruling party leaders and government officials in villages under their control until the three farm laws are repealed.Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other northern states have been protesting at Delhi’s borders demanding the rollback of the three contentious farm laws passed in September last year.The farmers say they fear corporate farming will affect their earnings. However, the government continues to claim that the new laws would increase incomes of farmers and introduce a level-playing field.The khaps also decide to send reinforcements to the state’s borders with Delhi where farmers have been camping since November. The Sarv Panchayat khap held a meeting and said thousands of farmers from Haryana would soon reach Delhi’s borders. “The (Phogat) khap has decided to send at least one person from each family to Delhi’s border,” Nambardar added.“Hundreds of our tractors will head towards Ghazipur border tomorrow (Saturday) from Sampla here after visiting the statue of farm leader Chhotu Ram. We will ensure supply of milk and other items daily,” Hooda of Hooda khap said. On Friday, protesters blocked the Chandigarh- Jind highway; other protestors reached toll plazas in Rohtak, Dadri, Bhiwani, Jind, Hisar and other parts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-person-from-each-house-to-reach-delhi-haryana-khap-leaders-101611956451909.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||Forensic teams visit Ghazipur as part of Jan 26 violence probe||Forensic teams visited the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border at Ghazipur on Friday afternoon to collect forensic samples, as part of their probe into the violence during the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26. The police also released a notice appealing to citizens, including media personnel, to submit videos and any other information related to the Republic Day violence.Senior police officers, who asked not to be named, said the law enforcement agency’s special cell (anti-terror unit), which is probing the alleged conspiracy behind Tuesday’s violence, has issued notices to several farmer leaders and other protesters, including Punjab actor Deep Sidhu and gangster-turned activist Lakha Sidhana.A second police officer, who asked not to be named, said they also visited the protest sites at Delhi’s borders on Friday, but found neither Sidhu nor Sidhana.Apart from the incidents of violence and rioting, the two are being probed on charges of sedition under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for allegedly conspiring to trigger violence in the national capital on Republic Day and “create an international embarrassment for the government on Republic Day,” as per the Delhi Police FIR.Meanwhile, the police have arrested a 22-year-old farmer for robbing a police officer of a wireless set during the tractor rally at Nangloi on Tuesday.“The suspect, Ajay Rathee, robbed the wireless set from a constable deployed in a Vajra van (a special police vehicle) at Nangloi Chowk. We recovered the device and arrested him based on intelligence inputs,” said A Koan, deputy commissioner of police, in a press release.The officer said Rathee, a resident of Rohtak in Haryana, was found to be involved in three previous criminal cases registered in Delhi — one under the Arms Act and two under the Excise Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/forensic-teams-visit-ghazipur-as-part-of-jan-26-violence-probe-101611945677475.html
30-01-2021||India||Tikait’s appeal triggers show of strength in Muzaffarnagar||Tens of thousands of farmers poured into the Government Inter College (GIC) grounds in western Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar town on Friday, a show of strength after government crackdown on protests against three agriculture laws forced farm leader Rakesh Tikait to issue an emotional appeal for support.Farmers said they left their villages in the middle of the night after calls for mobilisation given from temples, mosques and panchayats. Viral videos of Tikait breaking down late in the face of police ultimatum on Thursday and vowing to not vacate Ghazipur protest site, on the eastern fringe of Delhi, cemented their conviction.“The ongoing movement is a battle for the honour of farmers and, if it ends, it will damage our very existence,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Naresh Tikait after the seven-hour meeting, calling on farmers to strengthen the movement at Delhi’s borders.Naresh Tikait said that defeating Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader Ajit Singh in the 2019 Lok Sabha election by supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was a mistake. “We will not commit this mistake again...,” he added, with Singh’s son Jayant Chaudhary next to him.Jayant lashed out at central and state governments. Holding a pot of water from the Ganga, Jayant asked the crowd to swear that anyone who didn’t support the farmers stir would be socially boycotted. He then dropped a fistful of salt in the pot, a local oath-taking tradition, to seal the promise. “It is a matter of life and death for farmers, but do not worry. All have to stay together, united in this -- this is Chaudhary sahab’s (Ajit Singh’s) message,” he said.The mobilisation began late night on Thursday. The Ghaziabad administration had given him an ultimatum to vacate the site, as part of a wider crackdown on the two-month-old protests in the aftermath of violence in Delhi on Republic Day.“Tears of the son of Chaudhary Mahendra Singh Tikait and my younger brother Rakesh Tikait will not go waste,” Naresh Tikait tweeted soon after, referring to their father, a legendary farm leader who held Delhi hostage in 1988 over demands such as free power and water for cultivators.By morning, farmers from Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Saharanpur, Meerut, Baghpat, Bijnor and other districts of western UP had taken tractors, cars, scooters and trucks to come to the GIC grounds, which can hold up to 100,000 people.When the mahapanchayat began, the venue was packed with people, many of whom were defiant in front of the heavy police presence. “Thousands of people arrived for the mahapanchayat and it was self-driven,” said Anuj Baliyan, a resident of Soram village. “I have not seen such a self-driven and motivated crowed in my life. Roads of Muzaffarnagar were jammed with tractors and the entire ground was packed with people,” he added.Emotions ran high at the meeting as people recalled Rakesh Tikait’s vow to not touch water until the farm laws were rescinded by the government.Vice president of BKU (Bhanu) Chaudhary Diwakar Singh said he defied his leader Bhànu Pratap’s decision to withdraw from the movement. “Rakesh Tikait’s tears have turned it into a complete farmers’ movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tikaits-appeal-triggers-show-of-strength-in-muzaffarnagar-101611945317515.html
30-01-2021||India||Cop to farm leader: Tracing Tikait’s journey||Rakesh Tikait, to whom the Delhi Police issued a notice asking him to explain why legal action should not be taken against him for breaching the agreement with police regarding the tractor rally on January 26, is himself a former Delhi Police constable.And the ongoing farmers’ protest, specifically a tearful speech he delivered when all seemed lost, could well mark his ascension as his father’s son. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson is a prominent name in the farmers’ movement and belongs to the well-known Tikait family of Sisauli village in Muzaffarnagar district of western Uttar Pradesh.His father Mahendra Singh Tikait, one of the tallest farmer leaders of the country and president of the BKU is still remembered as the man who brought Delhi to a halt for 7 days in October 1988 at the boat club. Over 5 lakh farmers joined the movement.Tikait, who, along with his supporters, has been camping on the Ghazipur border between Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, was asked to vacate the site on Thursday. The administration shut off power and water at the farmer encampment. Then came Tikait’s speech, and tractors from Haryana started rolling towards Ghazipur. Farmers in Uttar Pradesh organised a Mahapanchayat on Friday to discuss the issue and expressed their support for Tikait.His elder brother Naresh Tikait is the current BKU chief.Born in Sisauli village on June 4, 1969, Tikait went to DAV School of Sisauli and thereafter joined Kisan Inter College in Lalukheri of Muzaffarnagar district.He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree from Meerut University.He briefly served the Delhi police as a constable and resigned during the 1993 farmers’ protest spearheaded by his father.The then government pressured him to convince his father to end the movement, but he refused to give in and opted to resign and join the protest.Tikait was elected national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union in 1997.He contested the assembly elections from the Khatauli constituency of Muzaffarnagar in 2007 and lost.He then joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal ( RLD) of Ajit Singh in March 2014 and contested the Lok Sabha election from Amroha constituency against the advice of farmer leaders of the area. He received only 9,539 votes (0.62 percent) of the total votes polled and lost again.He belongs to the Baliyan khap (clan). In keeping with the khap’s tradition, his elder brother Naresh Tikait was appointed head of the khap and chief of BKU after the death of their father Mahendra Singh Tikait on May 15, 2011.The title “Tikait” was given to the head of Baliyan khap by King Harshvardhan, the Jat ruler of Thanesar in the 7th century and the tradition is still in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-to-farm-leader-tracing-tikait-s-journey-101611945318063.html
30-01-2021||Delhi||Tikri simmers after ‘locals’ demand farmers’ eviction||At least 100 people on Friday gathered near the Tikri border where farmers are protesting against the three contentious farm laws and demanded the removal of protesters from the main Rohtak Road, which has been blocked for the last two months.Tension prevailed when the counter-protesters tried to cross the barricades to go near the farmers but before the situation could escalate, the police managed to push them back. The farmers said it was a “conspiracy” to defame and undermine the movement.On Friday, violence was reported during a similar counter-protest at Singhu border.Pintu Kumar, a resident of the nearby Baba Haridas Nagar at Tikri Border, said that these protesters “broke our trust” and “insulted” the national flag on January 26, when the farmers took out a tractor rally.“These people cannot be farmers, as a Kisan will never attack a Jawan. These are anti-social elements. We initially supported them and gave them food as well but they have broken our trust by resorting to violence on Republic Day,” Kumar said, who was leading the protest.Another member of the group, Ravindra Kumar Chaudhary, said, “For the last two months, we have been tolerating whatever these protesters were doing on the pretext of agitation against farm laws. Whatever they did on January 26 is unacceptable. We will not tolerate the insult of our national flag.”Police did not let the counter-protesters to move towards the site where farmers are sitting.“After the violence during the Republic Day rally, we enhanced the deployment here. More police personnel along with teams of RAF (Rapid Action Force) were deployed at Tikri to handle any untoward incident,” a police official, deployed at the site said, requesting anonymity.The police have placed barricades to stop locals as well as the farmers from clashing with each other. They also appealed to the people to maintain peace.The number of farmer protesters at Tikri increased on Friday when groups of Haryana and Punjab joined them.Maninder Pal Singh, a farmer from Muktsar in Punjab, said the protest will continue to gain strength and more people will join the protest in coming days. “We will not relent unless our demands are met... Today’s protests by so-called locals was a conspiracy by the central government to defame our movement,” Singh said.Kushvinder Singh Mann, another farmer who has come from Bhatinda said locals have no problem with the agitation. “Those who protested against our movement today are connected to the ruling party at the centre. They want to disrupt our movement. We have never caused any inconvenience to any local resident here. We will ensure that no one faces a problem because of us,” Mann said.Sudesh Goyat, a farmer and a member of the Kisan Morcha at Tikri Border, said, “Mahapanchayats (meetings) were organised on Thursday in many Haryana villages where it was decided to carry on the agitation. As a result, over 100 tractors reached here today to be the part of this historic movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tikri-simmers-after-locals-demand-farmers-eviction-101611944050988.html
