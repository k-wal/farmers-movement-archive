However, the protesters outnumbered the cops and the pro-Kisan Panchayat organisers and ransacked the venue, sending cops scurrying for cover.The police used tear gas in an attempt to contain the crowd. The protesting farmers assembled around the venue while police’s attempt to control the situation with the help of the locals failed.The chief minister is yet to reach the venue. His mahapanchayat was aimed to drum up support for the three contentious agriculture laws that have triggered widespread protests in North India.All the roads leading to the village had been blocked by the police with the help of trucks laden with construction material, parked on the roads, to avoid the entry of farmers protesting against the laws. However, it didn’t work.Additional forces from the nearby districts had been called in and duty magistrates were appointed to monitor the law and order situation in Karnal.The farmer union leaders, protesting against the farm laws, first gathered at Karnal's Bastara toll plaza on national highway 44, better known as Delhi-Chandigarh highway.Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, a local leader of The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Charuni, accused the chief minister and BJP leadership of attempting to divide farmers by holding such meetings."What is the logic of holding such meetings in the favour of agriculture laws when the farmers’ stir at Delhi borders (against the laws) has entered its 45th day,” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-ransack-khattar-s-kisan-panchayat-venue-clash-with-pro-farm-laws-group-101610268828536.html
10-01-2021||India||Shiv Sena’s latest attack on PM Narendra Modi has reference to Ratan Tata||The Shiv Sena has once again condemned the Narendra Modi-led Central government for its alleged antipathy for the farmer’s agitation and called the existing situation, emergency-like.Sena MP Sanjay Raut, in his weekly column Rokthok, said it was regrettable that while the 83-year-old industrialist, Ratan Tata, could go to Pune to inquire about the health of his former employee, the government was being insensitive to the protesting farmers.“The farmers have been protesting in shivering cold at the Punjab border. 57 farmers have already lost their lives but there is not a single word of sympathy from the inhuman government. In contrast, Ratan Tata goes to Pune and meets the family of one of his former ailing employees in their small house,” he added.Raut alleged that PM Modi’s actions had reduced the significance of the Parliament and concentrated power in his hands. “In the last few years, we have witnessed many constitutional amendments but the government is not ready to repeal the farm laws despite the protests since the last 45 days. They are not even ready to discuss the issue in parliament. This is akin to the emergency,” he added.He alleged that the ruling party’s preparations for the 2024 Parliamentary elections have already begun with finishing off political opponents using central agencies.Recently, Raut’s wife Varsha appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in an alleged money laundering case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-s-latest-attack-on-pm-narendra-modi-has-reference-to-ratan-tata-101610266757214.html

Rampal Jat, National President of Kisan Mahapanchayat said, “Dilawar should give list of such bird flu-infected persons who are spreading bird flu and also the terrorist/robbers who are participating in the farmer agitation”.Rampal said that Dilawar has made a vague allegation just to grab headlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/socalled-farmers-enjoying-chicken-biryani-trying-to-spread-bird-flu-bjp-mla-101610217359930.html

The incident took place at a village in Karnal, after the farmers protesting against the Centre's three farm laws broke chairs and tables, and damaged a helipad where Khattar's helipad was scheduled to land.WATCH | Farmer protest: Vandalism at Haryana CM's event venue, helipad demolished"It is not right to obstruct anyone who wants to speak. I don't think people will tolerate violation of provisions given by Dr BR Ambedkar. Congress had attempted to finish democracy in 1975. At that time people identified their disgusting work & threw them out of power," Khattar said at a press conference, targeting the Congress.“Our nation has a strong democracy where everyone has freedom of expression. We never stopped statements of these alleged farmers and leaders. Their agitation is going on. Despite Covid, we made arrangements for them,” he further said.Hinting at a political angle involved in the vandalisation incident, the Haryana chief minister reiterated that the agitating farmers were being influenced. “Today's incident gave a message to people, bigger than what I'd intended to give. These people have defamed the farmers because a farmer doesn't have such nature. A farmer can be less educated or simple but he's sensible,” Khattar said.Earlier in the day, a clash first broke out between the farmers marching towards the helipad and the police, which was trying to stop the protesters, according to eyewitnesses. However, the protesters outnumbered the cops and the pro-Kisan Panchayat organisers and ransacked the venue, sending cops scurrying for cover.The police used water cannons and tear gas in an attempt to contain the crowd. The protesting farmers assembled around the venue while police’s attempt to control the situation with the help of the locals failed.Following the chaos, Khattar’s mahapanchayat, which was aimed to drum up support for the three contentious agriculture laws enacted by the Centre in September last year, was called off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/todays-incident-gave-a-message-haryana-cm-after-meeting-venue-vandalised-101610289186284.html
