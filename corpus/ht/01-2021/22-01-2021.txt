Another round of talks between the police and farmer unions is likely to take place at Singhu Border on Saturday.After the Central government's negotiations with protesting farm unions hit a roadblock on Friday farmer leaders said they will intensify their agitation now and alleged that the government's approach was not right during the meeting.They also said their tractor rally will go ahead as per the plans on January 26 and unions have told the police that it is the government's responsibility to maintain peace.Coming out of the meeting with the government at Vigyan Bhavan, farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said, "Tractor march on January 26 will take place as decided by us on Outer Ring Road. We have informed the police it is for the government to ensure that it should be peaceful."The government's negotiations with protesting farm unions hit a roadblock on Friday as the farmer leaders stuck to their demands for a complete repeal of three farm laws they find pro-corporate and a legal guarantee for minimum support price, even as the Centre asked them to reconsider its proposal for putting the Acts on hold for 12-18 months.Unlike the last 10 rounds of talks, the 11th round could not even reach a decision on the next date for the meeting as the government also hardened its position saying it is ready to meet again once the unions agree to discuss the suspension proposal.This followed a big climbdown made by the Centre during the last round when they offered to suspend the laws and form a joint committee to find solutions.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November 28, demanding a repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP (minimum support price) and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hold-tractor-rally-outside-delhi-police-tells-farm-leaders-farmers-deny-101611336442484.html
22-01-2021||India||'Sanctity lost': 5 things Narendra Singh Tomar said on farmers' protest||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday accused the ongoing farmers' protest of losing its sanctity. The accusation from BJP ministers is not new but on Friday after the 11th round of meeting failed, the protest came under a sharp attack of the minister.Here are five things that minister said which can shape up the protest in the coming days> "Government gave many proposals to end the protest, but no resolution possible when the sanctity of agitation is lost."> "Government always maintained it is ready to consider alternatives to repeal; Our proposal is in the interest of farmers and of the country."> "We told unions to get back to us by Saturday with their decision on our proposal; If they agree, we will meet again."'Will intensify protest now': Farmers issue threat as 11th round of talks fails> "Some external force definitely trying to ensure agitation continues; Obviously, those forces are against farmers' interests."> "We told farmers to come up with their own proposal, other than repeal if they have anything better than our offer."Farmers' unions have rejected the Centre's proposal of holding the implementation of the farm laws for 1.5 years. This was decided in a meeting of all farmers' unions on Thursday. After the decision was conveyed to the Centre during Friday's meeting which took place briefly as there was no discussion, the minister asked the union leaders to come up with an alternative plan, excepting the repeal of the farm laws.As no new date for another meeting has been announced, the situation has reached a dead-end, though agriculture minister said if the unions agree to Centre's proposal, or come up with their own new proposal, there will be further discussion.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanctity-lost-5-things-narendra-singh-tomar-said-on-farmers-protest-101611336221309.html

He alleged that the Centre had struck at the DSGMC because it was at the forefront in providing aid to the farm movement."The DSGMC has been providing langar to farmers from the very first day they arrived at the Singhu border and continues to do so even today," Badal said in a statement.He underscored that the DSGMC was the same body that had won universal praise during the coronavirus lockdown for the service it rendered to humanity, as well as during the time of natural disasters."Now, the same body is being vilified," he said. "The DSGMC will not be affected by such cowardly acts and will not step back from assisting peacefully-agitating farmer brethren."Badal said it was "strange" that a case had been registered against Sirsa and others with regard to a complaint that had been filed against the then DSGMC president, Manjit Singh G K, in 2018.Sirsa's name has been included now even though he was not named in the original complaint, while that of G K has been excluded, Badal said. "This shows how the police and other investigating agencies are being misused by the BJP against its opponents."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-supporting-farmer-protests-being-vilified-sukhbir-singh-badal-101611331376164.html

He asked, "Is the constitution even there? As per the constitution Schedule VII part-2, the government should have consulted the agrarian states like Punjab, Haryana, Himachal, Uttarakhand, UP and Rajasthan first in matters related to agriculture before passing the laws.""Why did Centre change it without discussion in Parliament? They passed it in Lok Sabha as they'd more members. In Rajya Sabha, it was passed in chaos as they sensed things can go wrong," the chief minister said.He said, the centre needs to understand Punjab is not the only state protesting, farmers from across India have united on the Delhi border to agitate against the laws imposed by the government. "Around 80,000 farmers have gone from Punjab to protest and around the same number of farmers have also come from Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, west Uttar Pradesh and even Delhi while farmers' representatives have joined in from the southern states of India, '' Singh added.Also Read | 'Will intensify protest now': Farmers issue threat as 11th round of talks failsThe 11th round of talks scheduled between farmers' union and government on Friday resulted in a stalemate yet again as the farmers stood their stance on complete rollback of the three contentious laws with the government also stern on stalling the implementation for two years.Farmers have been protesting at the Delhi borders against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, passed by the Parliament in September 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-announces-govt-jobs-to-kin-of-farmers-who-died-during-protest-101611330502012.html
22-01-2021||India||'Will intensify protest now': Farmers issue threat as 11th round of talks fails||Marking failure in negotiations, the 11th round of talks between farm union leaders and the government ended in a standoff again on Friday as the farmers hardened their stand seeking repeal of three contentious farm laws.The rift widened in the Friday's talks as the farmers sought a complete repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP, even as the Centre asked them to reconsider its proposal for putting the Acts on hold for 12-18 months.The government also showed a stern stance and said the next round of talks will only take place if farm union representatives accept the proposal of stalling the implementation of farm laws for two years."During the meeting, the government offered to put the implementation of the farm laws on hold for two years and said that the next round of meeting can take place only if farmer unions are ready to accept the proposal," Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) told news agency ANI.The government's approach was not right during the meeting, PTI quoted farm leaders as saying.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that the welfare of farmers was not at the heart of talks from the farm leaders' side."We asked them to reconsider our proposal (of halting implementation of laws for two years) as it is in the interest of farmers and the country. We asked them to convey their decision tomorrow," Tomar told news agency ANI."The talks remained inconclusive as farmers' welfare was not at the heart of talks from the unions' side. I am sad about it," Tomar said. The government has also sought alternatives, Tomar said. To the government's displeasure, the farmers reiterated their plan to carry out a Tractor Rally on Republic Day, before the talks began on Friday.Krantikari Kisan Union chief Darshan Pal on Thursday re-emphasised that the rally will take place only on the Outer Ring Road in Delhi, adding that the leaders will hold another meeting with the police after 11th round of talks with the governmentThe rally in the national capital will run at the same time as Republic Day celebrations on January 26.“Govt has said tractor parade on Republic Day can’t be conducted on Delhi’s Outer Ring Road, due to security reasons. We’re clear that we will conduct tractor parade there only. After tomorrow’s meeting with Centre, we’ll hold another meeting with police,” news agency ANI quoted Pal as saying.While the meeting lasted for almost five hours, the two sides sat face to face for less than 30 minutes. In the very beginning, the farmer leaders informed the government that they have decided to reject the proposal made by the government in the last round of talks on Wednesday, reported news agency PTI.Coming out of the meeting venue, farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said there was no headway in the discussions and the government asked unions to deliberate on its proposal again.The farmers have been camping out at several entry points to the capital New Delhi since late November in protest against the legislation that they say will hurt farm incomes and leave them vulnerable to big corporations. The government has defended the laws, saying the reforms will make agriculture competitive and bring prosperity to farmers.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The farmers claim these laws will benefit big corporate houses. The government has, however, tried to allay these fears and even said that it is ready to discuss changes to the law. The government has made it clear that it won’t scrap these laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-intensify-protest-now-farmers-issue-threat-as-11th-round-of-talks-fails-101611316271961.html

"The CWC demands that the Modi government should forthwith repeal the three anti-agriculture laws," the resolution read.Passed in the CWC meeting on Friday, the resolution noted that the laws did not pass the test of Parliamentary scrutiny as they were "bulldozed by muzzling the voice of the opposition". "Particularly in Rajya Sabha, the three laws were passed by Voice Vote in an unprecedented fashion as the Government did not have the requisite majority on the floor," it read.Also Read: CWC may hold organisational elections between May 15 and May 30According to the CWC, these laws, if implemented, would adversely affect all citizens as pricing of all food products would be at the mercy of a handful of people."There is only one demand of India's farmers and farm labourers — repeal the three objectionable laws. But the Government continues to side-step, malign, deceive and hoodwink the farmers by attempting to tire out, intimidate and divide the farmers. Let the BJP Government understand one unequivocal truth - India's farmers shall neither bow down, nor be cowed down," the resolution read.Thousands of farmers have been protesting against the three laws passed by the Centre in September last year. These laws, which according to the farmers would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, are- The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.Also Read: Farmers 'reject' Centre's proposal to put laws on hold for 1.5 years"Across the country, farmers and farm labourers have been protesting, taking out rallies, holding hunger strikes, conducting tractor yatras and extensive demonstrations, yet a tyrannical Government dismisses the angst of millions of farmers by branding them as 'anti-nationals' and worse," the resolution read, adding that according to the farmers' organisations, 147 farmers have lost their lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repeal-anti-agriculture-laws-cwc-passes-resolution-on-farm-laws-101611310239880.html

"We are determined to fight for the farmers," said Mishra. Former MLA from Padmapur and BJP leader Pradip Purohit said they are prepared to spend seven nights protesting for farmers.On Thursday, at least 10,000 farmers and BJP leaders had surrounded the RDC office in Sambalpur town, protesting ‘katani chhatani’ or deductions in farmers’ payments by rice millers alleging poor quality of paddy, non compliance to the FAQ fixed for paddy procurement, non-generation of token in time for farmers, lapsing of token and unnecessary laying of paddy bags at different market yards.The BJP leaders alleged that the government's ‘failure’ in buying paddy from the farmers had resulted in the distress sale of the grain, with farmers in districts like Keonjhar being forced to sell the crop at around ₹1200 per quintal against the MSP of ₹1868 per quintal.Facing political heat over the issue, Odisha food supplies and cooperative minister Ranendra Pratap Swain on Thursday suspended 15 secretaries of primary agriculture cooperative societies that act as agents of Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation and purchase from the farmers. The department suspended secretaries of primary agriculture cooperative societies in western Odisha districts of Bargarh, Sambalpur, Bolangir, Boudh and northern Odisha district of Keonjhar.BJD leader Srimoyee Mishra said BJP was resorting to such agitation to divert attention from the farmers' agitation in Delhi. "This Kharif marketing season, a record 37 lakh metric tonne of paddy have been procured by the government. The government would procure all paddy from farmers," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bjp-protests-shoddy-paddy-procurement-govt-suspends-15-officials-101611303266566.html
