23-01-2021||India||'Our march will have no effect on R-Day Parade,' says Yogendra Yadav||The Delhi police on Saturday granted permission to thousands of agitating farmers to enter the national capital, giving the tractor rally a go-ahead. "Farmers will take out 'Kisan Gantantra Parade' on January 26. Barricades will be opened and we will enter Delhi. We (farmers and Delhi Police) have reached an agreement on the route, final details are to be worked out tonight," Yogendra Yadav, Swaraj India founder told ANI. "We will take out a historical and peaceful parade and it will have no effect on the Republic Day parade or the security arrangements," Yadav said. Opening border points that have remained shut for two months now, Delhi police will allow farmers to enter Delhi from five entry points. "We have been allowed to cover 100 km distance on each route," farmer leader Darshan Pal told Hindustan Times. The tractor parades will start from the Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri border points of Delhi, but details will be finalised tonight, farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar said after attending a meeting between the unions and the police.Farm leaders, representing thousands of agitated farmers who are camping on the borders of Delhi in the bitter cold for nearly two months now, had told the police previously that it is the government's responsibility to maintain peace.The barricades set up at Delhi border points will be removed on January 26 so that farmers can take out their rallies, Pal said. The farmer unions have been adamant about taking out their tractor parade on Delhi's busy Outer Ring Road on January 26, even as the Delhi Police urged them to hold it outside the national capital, a request that was publicly rejected by the unions.The meeting was held between a group of farm leaders and police officers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to discuss alternative routes for the tractor parade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-march-will-have-no-effect-on-r-day-parade-says-yogendra-yadav-101611410525486.html
23-01-2021||India||Cavalcades of tractors from Punjab, Haryana set out for R-Day tractor parade||Several batches of farmers from Punjab and Haryana set out on Saturday in their tractor-trolleys and other vehicles to take part in the proposed tractor parade on January 26 in Delhi.Carrying some ration, mattresses and other essentials, cavalcades of tractors left for Delhi to press the Centre to accept their demands.Tractors carried the flags of the unions, some sported the tricolour, and also posters with slogans of 'Kisan Ekta Zindabad', 'No Farmer, No Food' and 'Kaale Kanoon Radd Karo'.Farmer unions protesting the Centre's three farm laws had said they would go ahead with their tractor parade in Delhi on Republic Day.Farmer leaders said that the tractor parade would be peaceful."Over 30,000 tractors and trolleys today moved from Khanauri (in Sangrur, Punjab) and Dabwali (in Sirsa district, Haryana) to join the tractor parade in Delhi," said Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan on Saturday.They are expected to reach the Tikri border on Saturday night.Some farmers even mounted tractors on trailers and a few even towed their tractors in order to save diesel, said the farmer leaders."Some loaded their tractors in trailers and some even towed their vehicles in order to save fuel," said Kokrikalan.Similarly, a cavalcade of around 1,000 tractors left from Phagwara area and 150 tractors from Hoshiarpur in Punjab to become part of the parade, said the farmer leaders.A farmer leader in Barnala said they were getting a very good response to the call for joining the tractor parade."Youth and elders are going in their tractors towards Delhi in a peaceful manner," he said.A batch of tractors and other vehicles from Fatehabad in Haryana also left for Delhi to join the parade, they added.Many farmers from Karnal and other districts would leave for the national capital on Sunday.Independent MLA from Dadri in Haryana, Sombir Sangwan, who recently withdrew his support to the Khattar government over farmers' issue, told reporters on Saturday that the Centre will have to agree to farmers' demands.Sangwan, who had gone to meet protesting farmers at the Haryana-Rajasthan border near Rewari, also told reporters that farmers should be freely allowed to take part in tractor parade on January 26. Kirpal Singh Moosapur, Vice-President, Bharati Kisan Union (Doaba) in Phagwara, Punjab, said, "More farmers with tractors will leave tomorrow as well. We expect over 5,000 tractors from Doaba region (in Punjab) alone to reach Delhi for the parade."Moosapur slammed the Centre for not accepting farmers' demands."Farmers have been agitating at Delhi borders for the last several weeks but the Modi government has turned a deaf ear to their demands," he said.Before heading for Delhi, many farmers got their tractors inspected from mechanics for any fault so they can have a hassle-free journey, said the farmer leaders.At many places in Punjab and Haryana, tractor marches were taken out on Saturday to mobilise more people for the tractor parade.Meanwhile, some women in Bathinda said they have asked their male members who are at the Delhi borders not to worry about homes."We are taking care of the farm and other works. We have told our male members to stay put until the demands are met," said an elderly woman in Bathinda.Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at Delhi's borders for several weeks, demanding the repeal of the farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops. They claim that the new laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system. But the Centre says the MSP system will remain and the new laws only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cavalcades-of-tractors-from-punjab-haryana-set-out-for-r-day-tractor-parade-101611411393119.html
23-01-2021||India||Farmers' Republic Day tractor march in Delhi allowed, claim union leaders||After days of deliberations between farmers' unions and the Delhi Police, the proposed tractor rally by farmers on the occasion of Republic Day has been allowed by the police on Saturday, farmers leaders have said, while Delhi Police said farmers have not given them anything in writing regarding the proposed route of their march. Farmers have been allowed to enter Delhi and travel up to 100km distance on each route, farmer leader Darshan Pal said.The tractor march on Republic Day was planned for a long time but it hit a roadblock after the Centre approached the Supreme Court through Delhi Police against the march, claiming that it would dishonour country's pride if protesters attempt to disrupt Republic Day parade. The unions said that they would not disrupt the Republic Day parade.Police proposes route map for tractor rally, farmers to respond todayThe Supreme Court left the decision on whether to allow farmers' tractor march or not on the Delhi Police which held several rounds of discussion with union leaders on the issue of the tractor march.Farmers, as they have been preparing for long, plan to enter the Capital on that day displaying their tableaux of tractors belonging to different states. But Delhi Police initially did not agree to allow them to enter the Capital apprehending disruption in law and order situation. Instead, the farmers were asked to hold their tractor march on the Kundli border, which the union leaders didn't accept and remained stuck to their plan of holding the march on the Outer Ring Road.On Friday, the Delhi Police proposed a route map for the tractor march on which discussions were held on Saturday following which farmers have been allowed to take their march up to 100km inside Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-republic-day-tractor-march-in-delhi-allowed-unions-urge-for-peace-101611409236771.html

Police are yet to give them permission for that. Police are meeting the farmers' groups on Saturday evening for a meeting related to the march.A police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that until Republic Day, the security at the interstate borders will continue to be high as the farmers have threatened to enter the national capital."Unlike previous years, the security is more this year because of the protests. There are chances that criminal elements may try to disrupt Republic Day preparations by posing as protesting farmers. The idea was to ensure that such groups do not get to mobilise and disrupt the dress rehearsal or the preparations in Delhi," an officer said.The farmers on Friday alleged that the Haryana police have planted some men among the protesters to fuel violence at the protest site during the tractor rally on January 26. Also, on Friday afternoon, a farmer vandalised his vehicle when police refused to allow it into the Vigyan Bhawan for the talks with the Centre as his name and vehicle were not mentioned in the list of farmers representatives.
