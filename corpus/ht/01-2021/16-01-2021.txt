But, we don't have much hope. The intention of the government is anti-farmer, negative and there is a mindset to cater to the corporates. Our issue will not be settled by amendments. We are against the objectives of the laws," he said.Mollah said protesting farmers have decided to hold "kisan parade" on January 26 to highlight their issues including demand for repeal for three farm laws and they were holding their protest in a peaceful manner.He took exception to use of term "tractor rally" for their proposed programme on Republic Day and said it should be called "kisan parade"."The farmer unions had declared almost a month-and-a-half ago that if our grievances are not addressed properly, we would take out a kisan parade after the National Parade on the Republic Day. It would be an appeal to people to pay heed to our issues," he said."There is no question of struggle. We have been protesting for two months now and not a single instance of violence has happened and this is proof that we want a peaceful parade. There is a conspiracy to malign the farmers by calling it a struggle," he added.Asked about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi supporting the protest by farmers, he said it is an opinion of a political party."We have never invited any political party to our protests neither have we let a political leader represent us. Farmers are the only leaders of this protest against the farm laws," he said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting on borders of Delhi against three farm laws and have held nine rounds of talks with the government so far. The next round of talks is scheduled for January 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-said-no-to-dialogue-with-govt-but-do-not-have-much-hope-farm-union-leader-101610809041574.html
16-01-2021||Patna||Bihar Congress vows not to let farm laws take effect; march to support farmers||Hundreds of Congress workers took out a march in Patna on Friday to support the farmers’ agitation against the three controversial farms laws passed by the Central government.All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Tariq Anwar, Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha, chairman of BPCC campaign committee Akhilesh Prasad Singh, AICC media panellist Prem Chandra Mishra and BPCC working president Shyam Sundar Singh Dheeraj led the procession, which had to be terminated near Rajapur chowk, about one kilometre away from the BPCC office.The party workers had planned to march up to Raj Bhawan in support of the protesting farmers’ demand for repeal of the farm laws but were prevented by the police from proceeding further after they had reached near Rajapur chowk.The party workers carried the party flag and shouted slogan against the Central government over its reluctance to repeal the laws, which protesting farmers fear would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporates.Addressing the party workers near Rajapur Pul on Boring Canal Road, where they were stopped by the police, AICC general secretary Anwar said, the party would not let the BJP-led government enforce the new laws at any cost. “The Congress is with the farmers and it would continue to support them without any political motive,” said Anwar.BPCC chief Jha thanked the leaders for turning up in large numbers and said no force could make the farmers bow. MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said the farmers from Bihar were standing in solidarity with those agitating around the national capital.“The new laws, if implemented, would make farmers sell their produce at throw away prices to the corporates,” said Mishra.Senior leaders including former MLC Ajay Kumar Singh, former BPCC vice president Pravin Kushwaha, state Intuc president Chandra Prakash, MLA VS Dubey, et al, also addressed the gathering and called upon party workers to sensitise people about the implications of the newly passed farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-congress-vows-not-to-let-farm-laws-take-effect-march-to-support-farmers-101610772232095.html

16-01-2021||India||‘We are not in the game of greed for power’: Kumari Selja||Haryana Congress president, Kumari Selja said on Friday that she sincerely hopes that Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) MLAs and Independents supporting the Manohar Lal Khattar regime in Haryana would vote against the government in the state assembly. In an interview, the former Union minister said that many of these MLAs have openly opposed the three farm laws and people hope they will support the no confidence motion in the assembly. ExcerptsQ: What’s your reading of the farmers versus government standoff over the farm laws?Ans: The government has led the farmers up the garden path. While the patience of the farmers is laudable and they have maintained peace, the Central government has refused to understand their pain and pay heed to their demands. The government has decided to go ahead with the three farm laws and this will only lead to cartelization. These laws only favour big business houses and not the farming community.Q: Assuming you were to take a decision to resolve the standoff and pacify protesting farmers, what would’ve been your action plan?A: My action plan would have been to repeal the three laws. The Congress would have never enacted such anti-farmer legislation. We listen to the people first and give them what they want. The decisions taken by the BJP-led NDA government always work to the advantage of the big business houses. In fact, their actions are autocratic rather than democratic.Q: A number of JJP MLAs and Independents supporting the state government have spoken against the three farm laws. Do you think they would vote against the state government in case there’s a trust vote in the assembly?Ans: We would urge upon them to listen to their conscience and the woes of the farmers. I hope they would vote against the government in the assembly.Q: Does the Congress see any hope of forming the government with the support of disgruntled MLAs?Ans: We are not in the game of greed for power. But there can never be a vacuum in the political space. However, whatever happens has to happen in tune with the Constitution. Whenever a situation arises, the Congress will act as per the Constitution.Q: Who is the bigger loser in the entire episode – the BJP or the JJP?Ans: Unfortunately, kisan and mazdoor have been the biggest losers during the BJP-JJP rule. This is an opportunistic alliance formed merely to grab power. The JJP contested assembly elections against the BJP but in their hunger for power, the two came together. People will hold them accountable. They are already facing opposition from the public across the state. People will extract political price from them during the elections. Any government that does not have its ears to the ground and is insensitive to the people’s concerns will face consequences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-not-in-the-game-of-greed-for-power-kumari-selja-101610762819896.html

The ninth round of discussions between the government and farm unions on Friday ended in a deadlock with the next round set for January 19.During the meeting, union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar urged the farmers to be flexible and asserted that the government has been accommodative and has already accepted several demands.The government also proposed that the 41-member farmers’ delegation form a “smaller group” with “people who have expertise on laws”.“There were discussions on the three laws but we could not arrive at any decision. We suggested that the farmers form a smaller group with outside people who have expertise on the issue, but the unions rejected our suggestion,” Tomar said. Like several earlier rounds of discussions, the farm unions demanded that the government commit to complete rollback of the laws.Follow all the updates here:Bihar Congress vows not to let farm laws take effect; march to support farmersHundreds of Congress workers took out a march in Patna on Friday to support the farmers’ agitation against the three controversial farms laws passed by the Central government.

His comments were in reaction to a sit-in staged by Congress workers here against recent farm laws of the Centre and the rising fuel prices. Describing it as "political hypocrisy", Poonia said the frustration of power slipping out of the Congress's hand is visible on the faces of its leaders, adding that "they should get used to sit in the opposition". The BJP leader also said the Congress has no moral right to talk about farmers as it did no good to them even after being in power in the country for 50 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-ninth-round-of-talks-inconclusive-next-meeting-on-jan-19-101610759791438.html
16-01-2021||India||Will march in strength to Delhi, say farmers||Farmer groups camped at Singhu border said more agitators were joining them daily to strengthen their protests and their plan to march to Delhi in tractors on January 26.Farmers said on Friday, the ninth round of talks also failed with the government and every failed negotiation had only further strengthened their spirit and has fuelled the ongoing agitation. Nothing less than repeal of the three contentious farm laws were acceptable to them, they said.Dr Darshan Pal, member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, who is also the president of Krantikari Kisaan Union, Punjab, said farmers are coming in large numbers to all the border points of Delhi.“In Uttarakhand and Rajasthan, there are frequent tractor marches and a large number of farmers are reaching Delhi. The enthusiasm of farmers has increased due to the huge support we have received…this movement is fanning out across the nation. Under the banner of ‘Mumbai for Farmers’, the Maharashtra farmers’ organization, along with other progressive groups, are organizing a huge rally,” he said.Pal said, farmers in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are continuing with an indefinite sit-in strike. “Kisan Delhi Chalo Yatra started from Odisha on January 15. The march will reach farmers at Delhi borders on January 21 after travelling via West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh. Kisan Jyoti March was started from Pune on January 12 and will reach Delhi on January 26,” the farmer leader said, adding that more than 500 farmers from Kerala have already reached the Shahjahanpur border.On Thursday, protest at Singhu border continued to be peaceful with farmer groups raising slogans, carrying out marches, cooking and distributing food at langars and delivering speeches.Manmeet Singh, a farmer from Jalandhar, who has spent almost ten days camping at Singhu border, said more people known to him have joined the protest since he left home.“Whoever I talk to, back home, say they are ready to come. Some, who had come left for their homes in December are again planning to come with more ration and cloths. They all plan to be here before Republic Day. Not everyone will march. We plan to support them from here by continuing the movement,” Singh said.Delhi Police continued to maintain their usual deployment with senior police officer ensuring round the clock presence at the posts that have been set up temporarily since the protests began. A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said the deployment remained same as usual and will be stepped up as and when required. “The situation is being monitored continuously. We are also using drones for surveillance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-march-in-strength-to-delhi-say-farmers-101610754493435.html
16-01-2021||India||Farm bills have potential but cannot ignore those adversely affected: IMF||The International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes the farm bills passed by the Indian government have the potential to represent a significant step forward for agricultural reforms, a spokesperson of the organisation said here.There is, however, a need to strengthen the social safety net for those who might be adversely affected by the transition to the new system, Gerry Rice, Director of Communications at IMF, said at a news conference in Washington on Thursday.“We believe the farm bills do have the potential to represent a significant step forward for agricultural reforms in India,” Rice said.“The measures will enable farmers to directly contract with sellers, allow farmers to retain a greater share of the surplus by reducing the role of middlemen, enhance efficiency and support rural growth,” he added.“However, it is crucial that the social safety net adequately protects those who might be adversely impacted during the transition to this new system,” the spokesperson said responding to a question on the ongoing protests by farmers against the laws in the country.This can be done by ensuring that the job market accommodates those that are impacted by the reforms, he said.“And of course, the growth benefits of these reforms will depend, critically, on the effectiveness and the timing of their implementation, so need to pay attention to those issues as well with the reform,” Rice said.The Congress on Friday vowed to continue their protests till the farm laws are repealed by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-have-potential-but-cannot-ignore-101610748030759.html

The BJP government will have to take these black laws back,” news agency PTI quoted him as saying.Reacting to this, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh said: “The Congress manifesto in 2019 itself had promised these reforms and therefore, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi should tell us whether they were lying then or are lying now.”Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have launched a mass agitation on the borders of the national Capital, demanding the repeal of the laws. While several of them marched towards Baijal’s residence, the Delhi Police stopped the protestors by barricading the route. This also led to a face-off between the two sides, during which senior Congress leader Alka Lamba was allegedly injured.However, Anto Alphonse, DCP (north), said that Lamba was not assaulted by the police. “She had a string entwined in her hand. The string was tied to balloons and a placard. In the melee that happened in the crowd, she may have got injured by the string tied to her hand. We have video evidence for this,” he said.Meanwhile, in Chandigarh, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and in Uttar Pradesh, Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and other workers were allegedly taken into custody during the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-won-t-relent-till-centre-repeals-black-laws-says-rahul-101610746892474.html
16-01-2021||India||Ninth round of farm talks inconclusive||The ninth round of discussions between the Union government and farm unions protesting three agricultural laws failed to make any progress on Friday, but both sides agreed to meet again on January 19 despite the stalemate.The farm unions representing tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, who have launched a mass agitation on the borders of the national capital, are demanding that the government scrap three laws approved by Parliament in September.The laws are aimed at freeing agricultural markets from government restrictions, which the farmers say will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.Like several earlier rounds of discussions, the farm unions demanded that the government commit to complete rollback of the laws.At Friday’s talks, the government, which has ruled out a repeal of the laws, proposed that the 41-member farmers’ delegation form a “smaller group” with “people who have expertise on laws”.“There were discussions on the three laws but we could not arrive at any decision. We suggested that the farmers form a smaller group with outside people who have expertise on the issue, but the unions rejected our suggestion,” agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said.There was a discussion on Essential Commodities Amendment Act 2020, said Kavitha Kuruganti, a farm leader who represents the unions at the talks.At the talks, which were attended by two other Union ministers — Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash — Goyal defended the new amendments in the act but signalled the government’s willingness to make changes.Goyal told the unions that “some changes can be made in the Act too without quite saying that (what specific) amendments will be made,” according to Kuruganti.The Essential Commodities Amendment Act 2020, one of the laws farmers want scrapped, allows traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales. The government argues that the changes were necessary to attract private investment in warehouses and food-processing plants.According to an official, the government suggested that it could review the stock limits proposed under the amended law.“We have said that the amendments should be removed and earlier Act restored because the new changes will allow hoarding and black-marketing of essential items,” said Hanan Mollah, a senior farm leader.The agriculture minister said the government suggested that the farm unions form a smaller, focused group that should evaluate specific issues in the laws and “present them before the government so that these could be discussed”.The government also repeated its proposal that farmers should go through the three laws “section by section” and list their objections. The farmers rejected both the suggestions.The Supreme Court on January 12 kept the three contentious laws in abeyance to “assuage the hurt feelings of farmers” and also formed a committee to look into the farmers’ grievances over the laws.The farmers have rejected the court’s offer, saying they want a full repeal of the laws, not a temporary ban on their implementation.“The government welcomes the Supreme Court’s decisions. We will present our point of view before the committee appointed by the court,” Tomar said.At the opening of today’s talks, the farm unions raised the issue of alleged harassment and arrest of their colleagues on trumped up charges in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. “Farmer unions wanted the Centre to address and prevent it,” said Kuruganti, the lone woman representative of the farm unions at the talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ninth-round-of-farm-talks-inconclusive-101610739200773.html
