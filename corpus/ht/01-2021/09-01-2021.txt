The government is sold out to few capitalists. The Congress party has decided to celebrate 'Kisan Adhikar Diwas' on January 15 while holding protest and demonstration at district headquarters. We will also organise rallies and after the rallies, we will march towards governor houses across the country. Now, the time has come to listen farmers' voices," said Congress' General Secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala.This comes a day after the eighth round of talks between the government and the farmer unions remained inconclusive. The government asked farmer unions to "give an option other than repealing" and the next round of talks is proposed for January 15.While addressing a press conference here, Surjewala alleged that government is playing the games of meetings instead of repealing "black laws"."Instead of repealing the black laws, Modi government is playing meeting-meeting, giving dates for talks. Farmers have been protesting for the last 40 days and 60 farmers have died. Prime Minister has not spoken a word condoling the demise of those farmers. This is the fight against the attrocities of government by farmers," he added.The Congress party will also run a campaign on social media with *SpeakUpForFarmers on January 15, Surjewala said.This comes after a meeting, which was charied by Congress general secretary KC Venugopal, with party general secretaries and in-charges in connection with the ongoing farmers' agitation at the borders of Delhi.According to sources, in the virtual meeting discussion was held on the situation and to chalk out a strategy to support farmer's protests. Congress has been in support of the farmers in their movement against the newly enacted farm laws by the Centre in September.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had on Friday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party is anti-farmers while Congress works towards their betterment. He said Congress will fight with the farmers to get the three farm laws repealed.The Congress party has time and again slammed the Union government over the farm laws. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi met with President Ram Nath Kovind to discuss the laws and the issues faced by protesting farmers.With concerns that farm laws would weaken the minimum support system and mandi systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, farmers have been protesting at different borders of the national capital for over a month against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Maintaining that the apprehensions are misplaced, the government has ruled out repealing the laws and asked farmer leaders to hold a discussion on clause by clause of the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-congress-to-protest-outside-governor-houses-across-country-on-jan-15-101610198435593.html

The man was rushed to a local hospital in Sonipat where he died, said Sonipat's Kundli police station's inspector Ravi Kumar.Farmers from various parts of the country, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at different border points of Delhi for over a month now demanding repeal of the three agri laws, which were voted through in Parliament in September amid strong protests by opposition parties.The three laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and Mandi systems will stay and has accused the opposition of misleading the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/40yearold-punjab-farmer-dies-after-consuming-poison-at-singhu-border-police-101610211046719.html

But, the leaders of the farmers are not ready. Therefore, I request all the leaders...on 15th (of January), there is a meeting with (Union agriculture minister) Narendra Singh Tomar," he said."I have confidence that leaders of the farmers... they should accept the proposal of the Government of India...," he told reporters here.It is not good for democracy if the laws are repealed as there could be more demands to abolish the laws made by Parliament, he said.The Centre is ready to make amendments with regard to the laws on the points raised by the leaders of farmers, he said.Farmers from Punjab are active in the ongoing agitation and those from other states are not so active, he claimed.He appealed to the TRS government in Telangana to provide five acres of land to landless poor, irrespective of caste affiliations, for their uplift.Athawale, president of Republican Party of India (RPI-A), favoured extending reservations to people from economically backward classes in the society.Referring to the demand by Maratha community in Maharashtra for quotas, he said the Reddy community in Telangana should be given reservation and the TRS government should take such a decision like the Maharashtra government did, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-leaders-should-discuss-with-govt-and-resolve-stir-ramdas-athawale-101610210676406.html
