I think the agitation will continue... Protesting farmers will not return to their homes till the new farm laws are repealed," he said adding that more than 550 farmers unions of the nation have joined the movement.In response to the Agriculture Minister's request to have a clause-wise discussion, the farmer leader said that the farmers would not have a clause-wise discussion. The next meeting between farmers demanding the repealing of the farm laws and representatives of the government is scheduled for January 19.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-forced-to-agitate-as-opposition-in-country-is-weak-tikait-101610889935423.html
17-01-2021||India||Apex Court appointed panel on farm laws to meet on Jan 19 for first meeting||The Supreme Court-appointed committee on the three new farm laws is scheduled to hold its first meeting on January 19 at Pusa campus here, its member Anil Ghanwat said on Sunday.The Supreme Court had on January 11 stayed the implementation of the three laws, against which farmers are protesting at Delhi borders for over 50 days now, till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann, however, recused himself from the committee last week.Apart from Ghanwat, agri-economists Ashok Gulati and Pramod Kumar Joshi are the other panel members."We are meeting on January 19 at the Pusa campus. Only members will meet to decide the future course of action," Ghanwat, President of Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra), told PTI."One of the four members has backed out of the committee. If the apex court does not appoint a new member, the existing members will continue," he said.The Supreme Court may take into account the matter of recusal of the member from the panel on Monday when it is scheduled to hear the pleas relating to the controversial farm laws and the farmers protests.Ghanwat said the committee has received the terms of reference and will begin its work from January 21.Asked about the government holding parallel talks with protesting farmer unions after the setting up of the SC panel, he said, "We have no issue if a solution is found and the protests end from either (efforts of) our panel or from the government's separate talks with the protesting farmer unions.""Let (Government) them continue the discussion, we have been given a duty and we will focus on that," he added.So far, the government has held nine rounds of formal talks with 41 farmer unions but has failed to break the logjam as the latter have stuck to their main demand of a complete repeal of the three Acts.In the last meeting, the Centre had suggested that the unions constitute their own informal group to prepare a concrete proposal on the three farm laws for further discussion at their next meeting on January 19 to end the long-running protest at various Delhi borders.The top court would also hear on Monday the plea of the central government, filed though the Delhi Police, seeking an injunction against a proposed tractor march or any other kind of protest by farmers that may disrupt the Republic Day celebrations on January 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apex-court-appointed-panel-on-farm-laws-to-meet-on-jan-19-for-first-meeting-101610885652620.html
17-01-2021||India||Thousands of tractors will enter Delhi for disciplined Kisan Republic Day parade, say farm union leaders||Protesting farmers will enter Delhi on thousands of tractors for a ‘disciplined’ Kisan Republic Day parade, farm unions leaders said on Sunday. They will cover around 50km and pass through the national capital’s Outer Ring Road, they added. “No disruption will be caused to the official Republic Day ceremony,” Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Farmers from Punjab have left from Ludhiana for Delhi to participate in the tractor parade on Republic Day as a mark of protest against the three contentious farm laws, ANI reported. "We are leaving for Delhi with our tractors and will continue to do so till January 24. Around 11 thousand tractors will be making a move to Delhi from Ludhiana itself. In total, one lakh tractors will participate in the Republic Day tractor parade from Ludhiana, Amritsar, Faridkot, and Bhatinda districts," a farmer was quoted as saying by the news agency.Farmers’ leaders had earlier said that they will hold their tractor march on January 26 on one side while the Republic Day parade is underway. However, they later said they won't march to the Red Fort and will only take out tractor marches at Delhi's borders with Haryana where they have been camping since November last year.Meanwhile, the Centre has moved the Supreme Court through Delhi Police against the proposed tractor march by farmers. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde will on Monday hear the plea seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor rally. This is a separate plea than the one which the top court was hearing regarding farmers' protests.Earlier in the day, farmers' unions said notices are being served by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on supporters of their ongoing agitation, which they say could be a hurdle in ongoing talks. Labelling it as “harassment” by the government, the unions have decided that no farmer who has received such notices will appear before the agency as a mark of protest, Balbir Singh Rajewal, a senior leader of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of unions, told HT.Parallel to this, consultation between farmers and the Centre is going on with the 10th meeting scheduled on January 19.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against three farm laws—Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020— enacted by the Centre in September last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-union-leaders-say-thousands-of-tractors-will-enter-delhi-for-disciplined-kisan-republic-day-parade-101610885855649.html
17-01-2021||India||Will farmers be allowed to hold tractor march on January 26? SC to hear plea||A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on Monday will hear the Centre's plea seeking an injunction against the tractor rally proposed by the protesting farmers on the Republic Day.Farmers who have been protesting against three farm laws since November 26 had earlier announced their plan of a major tractor rally at Republic Day celebrations. Farmer leaders earlier said that on January 26, there will be Republic Day parade on one side and the tractor march on the other. But later, they said they won't march to the Red Fort and will only take out tractor march at Haryana-Delhi borders where they have been camping since November last week.The Centre moved the apex court through Delhi Police against the proposed tractor march, which the Supreme Court agreed to hear on January 18.This is a separate plea than the one which the Supreme Court was hearing regarding farmers' protests. On January 12, the top court passed an interim order and stayed the implementation of the new farm laws. It has also set up a four-member panel to suggest solutions to the impasse. The committee comprised Bhupinder Singh Mann, national president of Bhartiya Kisan Union; Dr Parmod Kumar Joshi, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices; and Anil Ghanwat, president of Shetkari Sanghatana. The committee was given eight weeks' time for consultation. However, Bhupinder Singh Mann recused himself from the committee. It is likely that the court may take note of this and suggest another member for the panel.Parallel to this, consultation between farmers and the Centre is going on with the 10th meeting scheduled on January 19.Meanwhile, a farmer union moved the Supreme Court on Saturday requesting to remove the remaining three members of the committee.Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Balbir Singh Rajewal has claimed that rumours are being spread about the proposed tractor march. In an open letter to farmers, he reiterated that the march will be conducted at borders, and will be a peaceful protest, though it has been rumoured that the protesters will head towards the Red Fort or Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-supreme-court-hearing-on-january-18-tractor-march-rumours-101610882100948.html
