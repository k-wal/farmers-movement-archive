According to several media reports, nearly 57 farmers have lost their lives and hundreds have fallen sick. The Central Government is acting insensitively by not listening to the farmers’ legitimate demands which has been going on for more than a month”, Priyanka Gandhi tweeted.On December 28, 2020, Priyanka Gandhi had said, “Central Government is answerable to farmers. Government should listen to them and take back these laws.” In December, no permission was granted to Congress’ march to Rashtrapati Bhavan and only three leaders, who had appointments were allowed to go there.Also, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was scheduled to lead Congress MPs’ protest march from Vijay Chowk to Rashtrapati Bhavan to submit a memorandum containing 2 crore signatures to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking his intervention over farmers’ protest.Farmers have been protesting at different borders of the national capital for over a month against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-acting-insensitively-by-not-listening-to-farmers-legitimate-demands-priyanka-gandhi/story-wahLXCcP34g4x2El1bQvKL.html
02-01-2021||India||Protesting farmers to hold tractor parade on Jan 26 in Delhi if demands not met||Tens of thousands of protesting farmers will enter the national capital on Jan 26, Republic Day, and carry out a tractor parade if their demands for a repeal of three farm laws and a law guaranteeing minimum prices for crops are not met by then, leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions, said on Saturday. Addressing a press conference in the capital, a seven-member team that is coordinating the over one month-long protests, spelt out a fresh agitation agenda spanning 15 days from Jan 6, which includes picketing Raj Bhavans, onward marches from six blockade sites on Delhi’s borders and a “rehearsal” for the Jan 26 tractor parade. The farm leaders said they would wait for the outcome of January 4 talks with the government and the Supreme Court’s hearing on January 5 on a clutch of petitions related to the three farm laws. “This is our ultimatum. If all issues are not resolved and our demands are not met by Republic Day, then we will start entering Delhi. The government is saying that 50% of the demands have been met. But the government has shown no signs of meeting our biggest demands,” said Yogendra Yadav, a leader of the platform leading the protests. Farm unions have launched one of the largest strikes in recent years to demand that the Centre revokes the three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September last year. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Also Read: Confident ongoing farm stir will end’: MoS Kailash Choudhary ahead of Jan 4 meetingTogether, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed rates. “Tractors from all neighbouring states will begin rolling into Delhi if matters are not resolved. Contingents from all current blockade sites will start moving. We will continue with our blockade of goods and services of Ambani (Reliance group) and Adani (group), including their products, malls and petrol pumps,” Darshan Pal, a senior farm union leader said. The leaders were addressing their first press conference in the national capital since their agitation began. The leaders slammed what they called the government’s propaganda. “The government doesn’t want to withdraw the laws because it has become an ego issue for them. They have tried to tarnish our agitation in countless ways, sometimes calling us Maoists and Khalistani (a reference to Sikh separatists),” Balbir Singh Rajewal said. Asked what the farm unions would do if the Supreme Court were to uphold the validity of the laws, he said: “We are not a party to the case. But we will make a decision when the appropriate time comes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesting-farmers-to-hold-tractor-parade-on-jan-26-in-delhi-if-demands-not-met/story-4YqXsNX59nEMmcWfTi6Q1K.html

The supply of goods to Delhi from Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and other states of the country has also been adversely affected, they added.Bhartia and Khandelwal said that every day about 50,000 trucks come to Delhi carrying goods from different states and about 30,000 trucks carry goods outside the Capital.

The tractor parade with the national flag will be called ‘Kisaan Parade’,” Krantikari Kisan union president Darshan Pal said, according to news agency ANI.“We were peaceful, are peaceful and will be peaceful, but will stay at Delhi borders until new farm laws are repealed,” said one of the leaders of the protesting farmers’ unions, according to PTI.Farmer groups continued to block traffic from Ghaziabad and Noida to Delhi on Saturday. The Singhu and Tikri border crossing points from Delhi to Haryana have also remained completely blocked since last month when the farmer agitation against three laws enacted to liberalize the sector started. At the Ghazipur border, the service lane of National Highway-24 continued to remain closed for traffic.Meanwhile, Union minister of state (MoS) for agriculture Kailash Choudhary said a solution would come up during the talks to be held on January 4 with the farmers and that the ongoing deadlock would end. “I am confident that in the next round of talks with farmers, a solution will be reached and the ongoing protest will come to an end. The three farm bills are in favour of farmers. They used to demand to get rid of the middleman and sell their produce at a rate of their choice,” the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The first five rounds of talks between protesting farmers and the government failed to resolve the deadlock. On December 30, the farmers’ unions decided to meet the ministers for the sixth time. The government only agreed to address two of the four issues raised by farmers, which were sparing heavy fines for stubble burning and continuing the current mechanism of giving subsidised power for agricultural use. The farmers have said they will intensify their stir if their demands are nor met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-hold-tractor-parade-in-delhi-on-jan-26-say-protesting-farmers/story-MopzXZr3m9aRfCkVbKjiNL.html
02-01-2021||India||Government’s commitment to welfare of farmers ‘unparalleled’: Prakash Javadekar||A day after over 850 academicians came out in support of three agricultural laws, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that the central government’s commitment to the welfare of farmers is ‘unparalleled’.“More than 850 academicians across the country have come out in support of the new farm laws, saying that they will change farmers’ fortune and will free farming from all wrong practices. Our government’s commitment to the welfare of farmers is unparalleled,” Javadekar tweeted.On Friday, over 850 academicians from different parts of the country came out strongly in support of the agricultural reform laws brought by the government, saying these Acts seek to free farm trade from restrictions and enable farmers to sell their produce at competitive prices.In a statement, the academicians who also include a few Vice-Chancellors, said that union government has repeatedly assured the farmers that these three farm laws will not do away with Minimum Support Price (MSP) “but rather free the farm trade from all illicit market restrictions, open the market beyond ‘mandis’ and further assists the small and marginal farmers to sell their produce at market/competitive prices”.“The new laws also provide full autonomy for farmers to sell their produce. We strongly believe in the government’s assurance to the farmers to protect their livelihoods. The government is still firmly committed to delivering the principle of minimum government, maximum governance,” the statement said.“We stand in solidarity with both the government and the farmers and salute their intense efforts. We all will live, progress, and develop together and peacefully,” the academicians said.The statement comes amid continued protest by farmers on Delhi borders against the three laws - The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The government and farmers have held six rounds of talks so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-s-commitment-to-welfare-of-farmers-unparalleled-prakash-javadekar/story-QCN3xyasAddIoXBhGSlIdO.html

Yadav’s statement comes just a couple of days before the seventh round of discussion between the Centre and the farmers’ representatives to break the deadlock over the three farm laws.“It’s a plain lie that the government has accepted 50% of farmers’ demands. We’ve got nothing on paper yet,” Yadav was quoted as saying by PTI.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said earlier this week that after the round of talks between the Centre and the farmers’ representatives on Wednesday, the two had reached a consensus on two out of four issues. The Swaraj India leader, however, rubbished these claims. “Our two main demands — three farm bills should be scrapped and legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price (MSP) are still pending,” he said.Yadav said that if the farmers’ demands were not met after the meeting with the Centre on January 4, a march would be held on January 6. “The next round of talks with the government will be held on January 4 and if our demands are not accepted, we will hold a march at Kundli-Manesar-Palwal on January 6. We will announce a date about when and move forward from Shahjahanpur border,” he said.Farmers across the country, especially from Haryana and Punjab, have been protesting around Delhi against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws that were passed in September. These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. The demonstrators have made it clear that they would not accept anything less than a complete rollback of the three laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/still-pending-yogendra-yadav-over-centre-s-claims-of-resolving-50-of-farmers-issues/story-oV49hndi1Qkco1xpPN6LkO.html
