The ministry of external affairs on Wednesday in response to international celebrities tweeting about the farmers’ protests launched two hashtags #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda and claimed that vested interests were working towards maligning India’s international image.Sonakshi Sinha in her Instagram Story shared statements that said that the issues of suspension of internet and basic amenities for farmers at Delhi’s borders have now attracted global attention and one should not view the criticisms with an anti-India lens. “Journalists are being harassed. Internet has been banned. Protesters are being vilified through state and media propaganda. Hate speech (desh ke gaddaro ko, goli maro sardaro ko resurfaced) is flourishing. That is the issue that's taken global centre stage,” the statement said. The statements were posted by a handle @storysellercomics, which the Bollywood actor shared.Her Instagram story further added that the tweets made by international celebrities are to reiterate their support for human rights. “To reiterate, (the) news tonight will try to paint a picture that 'outside forces' are trying to meddle in the functioning of our country. Please don't give in to that narrative. It's human, standing up for other humans. THAT'S the narrative,” it said.“The voices raised are about the violation of human rights, suppressions of free internet and expression, state propaganda, hate speech and abuse of power,” it added.After pop artist Rihanna tweeted an article demanding a conversation of the ongoing farmers’ protests, Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg, Meena Harris, an American lawyer and niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris, actors Amanda Cerni, singers Jay Sean, Dr Zeus and former adult star Mia Khalifa also tweeted in support of farmers' protest.Delhi Police on Thursday registered a case against unknown persons for fomenting ‘disaffection and ill-will against the Indian government’ under the guise of supporting farmers’ unions. Union minister Prakash Javadekar also said that the tweets by international celebrities show that there are ‘vested interests at work’ trying to malign the nation’s image at an international level.Actor Tapsee Pannu, filmmaker Onir, actor Arjun Mathur and few other celebrities also criticised the show of solidarity shown by major celebrities on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-farmers-protest-sonakshi-sinha-says-don-t-give-in-to-that-narrative-101612459286266.html

Farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are also massed at Tikri and Singhu on the Delhi-Haryana border.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at the Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farm-laws-protests-delhi-police-commissioner-shrivastava-nsa-doval-meet-shah-101612454635526.html

It contained a social media plan on farmers protest. Later, Greta deleted that link and uploaded a new toolkit.What is a toolkit?A toolkit is a document explaining the basic points of an issue. For example, the toolkit that Greta uploaded later asks people to tag Prime Minister Narendra Modi, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar.'Propose Greta's name for child bravery award': Meenakshi Lekhi on toolkit rowWhat Delhi Police saidThe Delhi Police on Thursday said the initial probe has suggested that the document is linked with a pro-Khalistan group. The document has a proper action plan about a digital strike on or before January 26 and tweetstorms on January 23, Delhi Police Special CP (Crime) Praveer Ranjan said.What Union ministers saidNot many ministers have spoken on the toolkit, though several tweeted MEA's statement on Wednesday denouncing attempt to hurt India's democracy. Information and Broadcast minister Prakash Javadekar said it is a serious issue. "It clearly shows that some foreign elements are conspiring to defame India," he said."We knew that a conspiracy was being hatched outside the country. But we did not have any proof of that. Greta Thunberg has given us the proof and in her naivety, she has done a huge service," BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi said.Greta Thunberg, on the other hand, reiterated her support to the protesting farmers and said no amount of hate, threat will change that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serious-matter-what-bjp-leaders-said-on-greta-thunberg-s-toolkit-101612454956807.html

Those following it should have an informed and objective view. We are making sure through our activities that this is what happens," spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. He also referred to the Capitol violence and drew a parallel between that with the event that unfolded in Delhi on Republic Day.US wants India to resolve farm protest through dialogueOn Thursday, the US administration issued its first reaction to the ongoing farmers' agitation in which it said it encourages dialogue to resolve any differences between the parties. It also extended support to steps that can improve the efficiency of India's markets and attract greater investment. Peaceful protests and unhindered access to the internet are hallmarks of a thriving democracy, it said."The incidents of violence and vandalism at the historic Red Fort on January 26 have evoked similar sentiments and reactions in India as did the incidents on the Capitol Hill on 6 January and are being addressed as per our respective local laws," the spokesperson said adding that both India and the United States are vibrant democracies with shared values."The temporary measures with regard to internet access in certain parts of the NCR region were therefore understandably undertaken to prevent further violence," Srivastava added.The MEA spokesperson said the US state department has acknowledged the steps being taken by India towards agricultural reforms.The press conference comes a day after the ministry issued a statement condemning comments of international celebrities on farmers' protest.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taken-note-mea-refers-to-capitol-violence-reacting-to-us-statement-on-farmers-protest-101612448704663.html

There was an outpouring of global support for the agitation after pop singer Rihanna, teen activist Greta Thunberg and others drew attention to it.Gauahar disagreed with the view held by many that people from outside India should refrain from commenting on its internal matters.

"I don't know them personally, but they are supporting without any expectation," Tikait said. On Wednesday, Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of the protesting farmers, acknowledged the international support and said it was a matter of pride.The tweets of American pop singer Rihanna and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg in support of the protest have opened a debate as the ministry of external affairs condemned the support and linked it with an international attempt to hurt India's democracy.Union ministers, including Amit Shah, Nirmala Sitharaman, Hardeep Singh Puri, tweeted supporting India's unity and action against any propaganda. The farmers' protest, which was going on peacefully since November at Delhi borders, got derailed after their proposed tractor march on January 26 resulted in a violent stand-off between protesters and Delhi Police. Over 300 policemen were injured in the clash in which a group of protesters climbed the Red Fort and hoisted religious flags.Since then, police have launched a crackdown on protesters and internet connection was snapped at the protest sites several times.

04-02-2021||Editorials||The power of nationalism | HT Editorial||After tweets from a set of global figures expressing solidarity with the farm protests, and a strong ministry of external affairs statement defending the farm laws and rebuking “vested interest groups”, the battle over the narrative on the farm protests escalated on social media. The hashtag wars, in essence, saw those who oppose the government and its perceived crackdown on liberty leverage global support to push a narrative of India’s democratic backsliding. On the other side, those who were sympathetic to the government’s views framed it as an issue of national sovereignty and expressed their opposition to any external view on the matter. The Twitter battle actually throws up a larger question for India’s liberal political stream and critics of the government. At a time when they — rightly or wrongly — feel that the rules of the game have become skewed in favour of the ruling regime domestically, they end up seeking or leveraging international support as a way to enhance pressure on the government. This can be viewed in two ways. For those who believe in the idea of absolute national sovereignty, the prospect that external players should be participants in a domestic issue is unacceptable. For those who believe that democracy and human rights are universal values and override sovereignty, the idea of external participants raising their voice is entirely acceptable. This is a tricky terrain. Yes, international support — even if it is from private citizens, irrespective of whether it is spontaneous or encouraged — can help in magnifying internal weaknesses. And yes, in these times of interconnectedness, despite the anarchy that exists in the international system, any State, including India, has to take into account global conventions and norms. At the same time, as the social media pushback against this external display of solidarity showed, it is easy for this to become a tool of nationalist mobilisation for the government. Once again, irrespective of whether the tweets by Indian celebrities backing the government’s narrative were orchestrated or not, it adds to the narrative that a “foreign hand” is out to weaken India — which suits the political regime just fine in consolidating its domestic base and deflecting blame. The bottomline is simple. There are limits to external engagement, and India’s internal battles will have to be fought internally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-power-of-nationalism-ht-editorial-101612446250118.html
04-02-2021||Editorials||In states, don’t curb the right to protest | HT Editorial||The Bihar government has decided that those who engage in “criminal activities” during law and order incidents, protest demonstrations and blocking of roads and have been named in chargesheets will not get government jobs, government contracts, assistance for grants and bank loans and passports. This comes soon after the state government said that “offensive” social media posts against the government, ministers, parliamentarians and legislators will be treated as a cyber crime. Separately, the Uttarakhand government has said that the process of police verification before passports are issued will take into account comments made on social media, with an eye out for “anti-national posts”.This is disturbing. It is, of course, the duty of the State to maintain order. But, the State also has a duty to abide by the democratic Constitution — a key tenet of which is the right to free speech and assembly, including the right to dissent and protest peacefully. In both cases, the states seem to be backtracking on this democratic commitment.At a time when criticism of the government is often interpreted as being “anti-national”, there is a high risk of Uttarakhand’s move being used to silence inconvenient voices and impose an arbitrary punishment on them. Bihar’s case is even more striking. This is a state with a long history of political mobilisation, and an entire generation of the state’s leadership was socialised during the Emergency. For this state to then create legal room for any protest to be criminalised, and any protester to face a series of excessive and disproportionate government actions in the form of denial of rights and services, will have the impact of curtailing the space for dissent. Both state governments must step back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-states-don-t-curb-the-right-to-protest-hteditorial-101612445947510.html

He said that the people who will be stuck in it would be provided food and water and will know what the government was doing to the farmers."There'll be a three-hour-long 'chakka jaam' on February 6. It won't take place in Delhi but everywhere outside Delhi. The people that will be stuck in it will be given food and water. We will tell them what is the Govt doing with us," Tikait said as quoted by news agency ANI.Farmers' unions have called the 'chakka jaam' as a protest against the government's decision to shut down internet services at protest sites, the police barricading and the Centre's three farm laws that the protestors want repealed.The RSS-affiliated farmers' body, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), said that they would not support the 'chakka jaam', citing that the protests had become political propaganda."Now, the protest at all the borders of Delhi is very much political and it is clearly visible that this has become political propaganda," BKS General Seceratery Badri Narayan Choudhary said as per ANI.Choudhary also noted the international support the protests had garnered and called it 'propaganda against India'.The farmers' protests had recently been shot into the global eye after pop icon Rihanna tweeted about it. The story was then shared by several eminent personalities like climate activist Greta Thunberg.Thousands of farmers have been protesting against the Centre's contentious farm laws for several weeks around the national capital. They had organised a tractor rally on Republic Day that ended in violence, after which the government cut the internet and the Delhi police set up barricades at the protest sites.Several rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmers have ended unsuccessfully with the farmers demanding a complete rollback of the three laws and the Centre refusing to do so.The three laws are Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chakka-jam-not-to-be-held-in-delhi-confirms-rakesh-tikait-101612441576279.html

It means spreading disaffection against the government of India and creating disharmony among different social, religious and cultural groups. 120(b) for the conspiracy of executing such a plan,” Ranjan said.“Delhi Police has also registered several cases against those social media handles which have been pushing either fake news or spreading rumours among citizens with the purpose of spreading disaffection and ill-will,” Ranjan said while speaking to reporters.“In the process of social media monitoring, we have come across one particular document which was uploaded on one of the social media handles on one particular platform. This ‘toolkit’ has a particular section in the document titled ‘Prior Action Plan’ and says digital strikes have to be conducted using hashtags before January 26,” he further added.Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg had tweeted a document which talked about the farmers’ protest and how one can support the agitating farmers. She later deleted the tweet and shared a link to a new document saying that the previous tweet had an outdated document.“If you go by the unfolding of events on January 26, including the violence which unfolded, it reveals a copycat execution of the action plan mentioned in the toolkit,’ Ranjan said. He also highlighted that the toolkit aims at ‘waging social, cultural and economic war against the government of India.' He also said that the Delhi Police’s Cyber Crime cell will be conducting further investigation into the case.Several celebrities like environmental activist Greta Thunberg, pop artist Rihanna and model Amanda Cerny among others have tweeted voicing their support for the ongoing protests against the farm laws by farmers’ unions representatives at Delhi’s borders. The farmers who have been protesting for more than two months are demanding a repeal of the the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The farmers’ groups believe that these three laws will affect the procurement under the Minimum Support Price system and allow private and multinational companies to make profits off farmers as it will encourage corporate farming.The government has claimed that the laws will increase farmer incomes and said that the recent social media uproar in social media claiming to support the ongoing protests are being done by entities with vested interests and aimed at maligning India’s image at an international level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-registers-fir-against-unknown-persons-for-sharing-toolkit-in-social-101612443175197.html

Though Kubbra did not directly name Kangana, she made a reference to her National Award-winning film, Queen.“Queen Queen bula bula ke beda gard kar diya hai (You referred to her as ‘queen’ and created trouble)!” Kubbra wrote in a tweet. In her follow-up tweet, she corrected a typo and wrote, “Sorry it’s apparently gark.”Kangana made disparaging remarks about singer Rihanna and Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg for tweeting about the farmers’ protest. Suggesting that Rihanna was paid for her tweet, Kangana asked what was special about her. “...Well... she can shake her bum cheeks and expose her a** crack right in to the camera lens while singing..ya that’s all. Nothing else,” she wrote.

But we have no proof. She has given us proof. I am grateful to her for that. In her naivety, she has given us proof. We should acknowledge that. I don't despise her for this," the BJP MP said."What I despise is that her name has been prosed by some elements for Nobel Peace Prize and she is known to be an environmentalist. Now an environmentalist who does not understand sustainable farming practices, an environmentalist who doesn't understand the kind of problems that stubble burning can give, an environmentalist who doesn't understand how much water is needed for farming and an environmentalist who doesn't even understand the diversification of crops, can't be even named for Nobel Peace Prize. The prize will lose its credibility if such people are named for it. I despise that," she added.Greta Thunberg is in news for extending support to the ongoing farmers' protests. Her tweet came soon after American pop singer Rihanna tweeted a CNN article on farmers' protest and partial internet suspension. The "international support" has drawn flak as an international conspiracy to attack India's democracy. The ministry of external affairs drew a link between this with the recent desecration of Gandhi statues at various places in the world and said both are attempts to hurt India's democracy.Union ministers, BJP leaders, Bollywood and cricket personalities put their weight behind the message of India's unity and urged their follower to not believe in rumours.Meanwhile, Greta Thunberg tweeted a document which had Rihanna's name mentioned. This apparently proved that getting international figures to tweet for farmers' protest is a "bigger" plan. Greta, however, deleted the link and tweeted a fresh link of an action document which too lists similar actions but it does not mention any name.Meenakshi Lekhi said the earlier document made it clear that there have been elaborate plans to "destabilise" India since January 1.Delhi Police filed an FIR against the creators of the toolkit for criminal conspiracy.

The Congress leader also attended the final prayers organised for the deceased.Priyanka said that the government is choosing to look at the agitation against the three laws as a political conspiracy. “The three farm laws are crimes (being committed) against the farmers and should be rolled back, but the bigger crime is calling martyrs ‘terrorists’ and viewing the farmers’ protests as a political conspiracy against (the government),” Priyanka was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.She also said that the Congress will stand by the farmers and voiced her support to the family’s demand for a judicial inquiry into the death of the farmer. She said, “Family members of the deceased want judicial inquiry. We are with the farmers and their families. The government is yet to identify this movement as a real struggle. There is no politics behind it. It is painful for our farmers.”The Congress, Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party, Trinamool Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and BJP’s ex-ally Shiromani Akali Dal along with other opposition parties have expressed their support for the farmers’ agitation.The farmers have been protesting since November last year against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The farmers’ unions representatives came under criticism after the January 26 clashes but they claim that outsiders had infiltrated the movement in a bid to malign the agitation. They continue to claim that the laws will lower the incomes of farmers and pave the way for multinational corporations to earn profits off the agricultural sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/govt-needs-to-stop-viewing-protests-as-political-conspiracy-says-priyanka-101612436286233.html

04-02-2021||India||LJD MP MV Shreyams Kumar criticises govt handling of farmer agitation||In a scathing attack on the government over its handling of the ongoing farmer agitation, Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) MP MV Shreyams Kumar on Thursday said the government has remained a mute spectator while democracy is being "butchered" just a few kilometers away from the Rashtrapati Bhavan.Participating in a discussion on a motion thanking the President for his address to the joint sitting of Parliament at the start of the Budget Session, Kumar alleged that none of the constitutional values are being upheld by the current dispensation and that the country is being mortgaged to private entities."Rashtrapati (President) can see how democracy is butchered just a few km away from the Rashtrapati Bhavan -- the Singhu border (the epicentre of the farmer agitation). Our annadatas, the kisan, on whom the Rashtrapati showers praise in his speech, is silenced and traumatised with multi-layered barricading, iron nails on road, barbed wires and iron rods between cemented barricades, reminding one of the horrific Tiananmen Square," he said in Rajya Sabha.He noted that the President denouncing farmer protests was a disrespect to constitutional values.Referring to the violence during the farmers' tractor rally on January 26, Kumar said it was the BJP government which dishonoured the national monument -- the Red Fort -- by handing it over to a private party for ₹25 crore for a five-year period in the garb of adopting a heritage site."The Red Fort is today in private hands. Rashtrapati has no qualms about this. The BJP dispensation does not know that under Article 51-A (of the Constitution), it is the fundamental duty of every citizen to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture," he added.The government does not know the difference between a national monument and a commercial property, Kumar said."However, when some hooligans entered into the Red Fort, the dispensation first allowed them to enter and create mayhem only to raise the jingoistic fervour later," he noted.He further said, "Unfortunately, the President has not seen the sufferings of his fellow brethren, the kisan, the annadatas who are protesting just a few km away from the Rashtrapati Bhavan. They are today insulted by the BJP dispensation by terming them as anti-nationalists."The Internet is banned at the sites of farmer protest strike and this is draconian and unheard of in a democratic setup. Several international personalities have started raising their voice against this, Kumar noted.He said that Parliament is "no longer sovereign" and bills are passed for private ends.He added that the president's speech says the government holds in high esteem the values of democracy and sanctity of the Constitution and that the government has always respected freedom of expression and holding of peaceful agitations."In the 2020 World Press Freedom Index, India is ranked abysmally low at 142 out of 180 countries. Even the military junta Myanmar is ranked above India at 139. Palestine is at 137. Monarchies like Oman and UAE are ranked at 135 and 131 respectively. It is a shame for this government that no democracy is ranked as low as India at 142," Kumar said.The LJD member also attacked the government over its economic policies and said that in the name of a free market economy, the current dispensation is selling all its assets. "Rashtrapati speaks a lot about Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India). This is nothing but a catchy slogan aimed at hoodwinking the citizens. From computers to fabrics and from aircraft to toys -- everything is imported," Kumar said."Let this government know that roti cannot be downloaded from Google. It is the farmers who feed us. The rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer," Kumar said while opposing the Motion of Thanks to the President's address.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi's border points with a demand that the Centre repeal the new agri-marketing laws enacted last September.The protesting farmers have expressed the apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljd-mp-mv-shreyams-kumar-criticises-govt-handling-of-farmer-agitation-101612434904659.html

04-02-2021||India||BJP shattered India’s global image: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Wednesday that India’s international image has taken a “massive hit” and the country’s biggest strength, its soft power, has “been shattered” by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) because of the manner in which the government has “crushed basic rights of farmers” in the course of the ongoing farmers’ agitation.In response, the BJP accused Gandhi of instigating farmers and using the agrarian stir for his political gains. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said Gandhi was using the farmers’ cause to stoke fear in the country.Gandhi said, “Today, Delhi is surrounded by our farmers. They are the people who give us sustenance... the people who work for us. Why is Delhi being converted into a fortress? Why are we threatening our farmers, beating our farmers, killing our farmers?” He also said that the country is “lacking leadership”.Also read: Government fends off global clamour on farm stirDemanding a restart to the talks with farmers, Gandhi said: “PM (Narendra Modi) is saying that the offer is still on the table to postpone these laws... what does that mean? Either you believe that you need to get rid of the laws or you don’t.”In counter, the BJP said the Congress leader was inciting people. “He (Gandhi) is trying to incite people. This is a farmers’ agitation and they are saying they are not associated with any political party, and that this is not a political movement, so why are you speaking on their behalf?” BJP’s Patra said.The Congress leader, however, refused to comment on international celebrities, including international pop star Rihanna, extending support to the farmers’ protest, saying “this is our internal matter”.“They (the government) have messed up the economy, they have messed up the harmony, they have messed up the defence and they want to keep distracting India with non-events. I am saying that the country is in a dangerous position,” Gandhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-shattered-india-s-global-image-rahul-gandhi-101612395906322.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Protest, blockades: Locals have to take long way home||On Wednesday, Pooran Singh, 32, a resident of Sonipat’s Biswamil area, about 10 kms from Singhu border, was walking with his wife Sapna and two children, precariously on the nearly two-foot-wide dirt track near the farmers’ agitation spot, which runs adjacent to a large drain.The dirt track, which widens to up to five-foot as one moves closer to the Singhu border protest site, is one of the two routes that locals have been using for the past one week to cross the protest site. Residents are also using another route via Narela and Singhu village, which means a detour of several kilometers.Heavy barricading by police near the protest sites at Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri is inconveniencing the local residents, who are now taking detours to cross the intercity borders.“Earlier, we could take shared vans to reach Azadpur where I work. But due to the increase in police barricading, there are only a few routes left. The shared vans have also hiked their fares. The nearly 30km journey from my home to work has become difficult. So, I am bringing my family and will stay at temporary accommodation in Azadpur till the barricades are removed,” Singh, a mason, said.Also read: MHA says blockade of borders causing inconvenience to localsE-rickshaws and other last-mile connectivity options ferrying people between Sonipat, Panipat, Bahalgarh to Kundli have doubled their fares. Vehicles stationed at the first police barricade — around 1.5km away from the main stage — were charging people ₹160 instead of the earlier ₹80. Arun Nishkarma, 40, who drives a van, said he increased the fare from ₹30 to ₹50 to ferry people between Sonipat and Kundli border.Along with six-layer concrete barricades set up on both carriageways of GT Karnal Road, police have also installed iron nails, made concrete walls, set up concertina wires, put containers filled with cement, and blocked most of the alternative routes. Locals said the move has heavily affected their movement – more than the agitation did in the past two months.Sonipat resident Sanjay Sharma, 40, who procures material from a garments’ factory in Kundli industrial area and supplies it to different parts of Delhi and Haryana, had been facing problems while commuting on his motorcycle since December.“The police barricades make it look like the people here are living in jail. It used to take around 30 minutes to travel from Kundli industrial area to my home in Sonipat. Now it takes me around two-and-a-half hours,” he said.Sharma said, “The farmer volunteers had ensured smoother movement of vehicles during the agitation. They do facilitate movement. But the police barricades and the personnel posted here do not let us cross these barricades and they have also blocked alternative routes.”On Wednesday, police officials used iron frames to block another dirt track leading to the main highway barely a kilometre from the main stage.No one except police personnel was allowed to go beyond the second barricade installed at this spot. Until Wednesday, media persons were allowed to walk till the Singhu toll border around 400 metres away.At Tikri, local residents are forced to take longer route for their daily commute.“My shop is near the main (Rohtak) road but because of the protests and the police closing off the entire area, now my workers and I have to take the longer route,” said Sisupal Singh Channa, who owns a garments shop near Baba Haridas Park.Hathram Pal, who owns a mobile repair and recharging shop near the protest spot at Tikri, said his business had taken a major hit because of the internet services being cut-off by the administration.“These farmers have been here for nearly two months and we have not faced any problem, the issue started when the government started getting involved and cut off electricity and internet,” Pal said. Mobile internet services were suspended at the protest spots following the Republic Day violence.Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson, said, “The barricades are set up as a preventive measure. We are trying to ensure as little inconvenience to the public as possible in the given circumstances.”Senior farm leader Darshan Pal said the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has taken note of the transport-related problems He said, “SKM intends to resolve the problem as far as possible.”(With inputs from Shiv Sunny)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/protest-blockades-locals-have-to-take-long-way-home-101612390052542.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Govt will help find missing farmers: CM||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday released a list with names of 115 persons who have been arrested and kept in different jails across the city over the past few days in connection with the Republic Day violence, and said the move will be a step in tracing those who, according to various farmers’ unions, have gone missing from protest from over the past one week.Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said the Delhi government will extend all possible help to trace these farmers, and, if the need arises, he will approach Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and the central government for their help.“We are releasing a list of 115 protesters who were arrested by police in relation to the Republic Day incident and are in different jails in the city. Our government will make every effort to trace the protesters who are missing and I will even speak to the Lt Governor and the Central government if the need arises,” Kejriwal said.Also read: Shashi Tharoor, Rajdeep Sardesai file plea in SC to quash FIRsThe move comes a day after a delegation from the legal team of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella platform of about 40 farmer unions protesting against the farm laws at Delhi borders for over two months, met Kejriwal and gave him a list of 29 missing farmers.“I can understand the pain and suffering of these people, who are unable to connect to their family members and children, are going through. It is the responsibility of every government to find the missing people and intimate their families regarding the same. Many farmer unions have also reached out to the Delhi government and me,” Kejriwal said.On Sunday, SKM said that more than 100 people were missing since the tractor parade on Republic Day that descended in. The union has formed a committee to look into the issue, which seeks to compile information on the “missing persons” to able to initiate formal action with the authorities. The six-member committee has urged people to share information on missing persons on the phone number 8198022033.“The people whose family members are missing can look at this list to know if their family members are among those arrested. If yes, they will get to know the jail that they have been put in. I hope that many people who have gone missing will be traced through this list,” Kejriwal added.Since the beginning of the farmers’ protest, the Delhi government has show support to farmers’ protest. It also provided basic facilities of water, sanitation and food at almost all the major protest sites in Delhi. In December, Kejriwal had visited Singhu border thrice to meet the farmers. In January, Kejriwal announced that the AAP will be fighting elections in six states in the coming two years. These states include Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh from where a majority of fame era have come to protest against the farm laws.Kulwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha in Punjab, said, “We welcome that Delhi Chief Minister has promptly acted on our request for locating the missing farmers. We requested him in his capacity as the CM and not as a political leader.”“We have already uploaded a list of all the 122 people arrested in the cases on our (Delhi Police) website, which is a public platform. The list has names of the arrested persons, their residential address, age, name of the police station and the FIR number in which they have been arrested. Any individual can access the list by visiting our website. In case, anyone still has any doubts about the arrested persons, they can directly seek assistance from the concerned district control room number or visit the police stations concerned,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-will-help-find-missing-farmers-cm-101612381793544.html
04-02-2021||India||Opposition, Centre spar in Rajya Sabha over farm laws; Lower House still stalled||Opposition MPs stood united in the Rajya Sabha on their demand that three contentious farm laws be repealed, during a debate on the President’s speech on Wednesday, with Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad telling the government that the “might of the farmers is the biggest force in the country and we cannot reach any conclusion by fighting with them”.Speakers from the treasury benches, meanwhile, said that those opposing the laws were spreading “misinformation” among the farmers and “stoking fears”.After a day of protests and disruptions in both Houses on Tuesday, the debate on the President’s speech started relatively smoothly in the Upper House on Wednesday, with all parties agreeing to suspend Question and Zero Hours to allot 15 hours for the discussion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to reply to the debate in the Upper House on Monday.Also read: Government fends off global clamour on farm stirLok Sabha proceedings, however, were washed out for the second day as the Congress stuck to its demand for a separate debate on farm protests even as the government wanted to address the issue in the all-encompassing debate on the President’s speech. The opposition leaders held a meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss their strategy. According to two Congress MPs who asked not to be named, party leader Rahul Gandhi also held a separate discussion with some Congress leaders on the floor strategy.Demanding repeal of the laws and restoration of statehood in Jammu & Kashmir, Azad said PM Modi, who was present in the House, is the only person who can find a solution to both the problems of Jammu & Kashmir and the farmers’ agitation.“The logjam between the farmers and the government is not for the first time; it has been going on for hundreds of years that farmers have had to struggle for their rights — sometimes against feudalism and zamindari and sometimes against the government,” Azad said.He condemned the violence and chaos during a tractor rally on January 26, when a section of farmers raised a Sikh religious flag at the Red Fort. “The whole Opposition and the Congress condemn the incident. It should have never happened; it is against democracy; it is against law and order. Those who were involved in this should be given strict punishment but at the same time those who are innocent should not be implicated,” Azad said, while also urging the PM to set up a committee to find out who are the people who had gone missing on January 26.Initiating the discussions, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Assam, Bhuwaneswar Kalita, said the farm laws were passed after extensive discussions in Parliament and the Opposition “should not make the farmers agitation another Shaheen Bagh”. His reference was to an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest that began last year in the heart of Delhi and escalated into an occupy movement that lasted for over 100 days, cutting off an important arterial road in the Capital.The ruling party has been alleging that the opposition parties have “stoked fears” about the new farm laws just as they did with CAA. The BJP leader reiterated an earlier speech by Modi and said “the benefits of these important farm laws have started reaching more than 10 crore people and small farmers” and told the House that “the doors are always open for farmers for discussion so that the issues can be resolved”.Watch | ‘Fight China & Pakistan, not our farmers’: Ghulam Nabi AzadThe government has offered that the laws be put on hold for 18 months to facilitate discussions but farmers — tens of thousands of whom are camped at three Delhi entry points for over two months — have rejected the demand. Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav criticised the government for showing “insensitivity” towards the farmers. He said had the government agreed to send the bills to a standing committee, the crisis would have been averted. He also questioned why there was tight security on the Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri borders, and said that security there was tighter than at Parliament and the India-Pakistan border. “Are the farmers going to attack Delhi?” he asked.BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, who seconded the motion, said those criticising the farm laws are spreading misinformation as the new laws only stand to help small and marginal farmers. He said the laws were passed after extensive deliberations and there have been 12 expert committees in the past two decades on farm reforms.Biju Janata Dal MP Prasanna Acharya said the role of the police and the local administration and the farmers’ leaders needed to be questioned in the context of what happened on January 26, while DMK’s Thiruchi Siva said that the government came to power with a slogan of “minimum government, maximum governance” but what we have experienced is “minimum governance and maximum mishaps”.Telangana Rashtra Samithi MP K Keshava Rao pressed for minimum support prices to be written in law, which is one of the demands of the farmers, while Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP Elaram Kareem said the government policies were only intended to appease corporate firms. He also said that farmer leaders were booked under fake charges for the incidents of January 26. Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu agreed to suspend question hour on Wednesday and Thursday, and private member’s bills on Friday, to make time for the discussion. In the Lok Sabha, Speaker Om Birla was forced to repeatedly adjourn the House as MPs trooped to the Well, raised slogans and flashed placards, and demanded that the farmers’ issue be given top priority. Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the farmers’ agitation was harming the image of the country.The Speaker insisted that the Question Hour must go on but Opposition members refused to relent, leading to the House being adjourned for the day after three attempts to begin proceedings. Modi, who customarily replies in the Lok Sabha first, is scheduled to address the Lower House on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-centre-spar-in-rajya-sabha-over-farm-laws-lower-house-still-stalled-101612380700484.html
04-02-2021||India||Government fends off global clamour on farm stir||India on Wednesday said criticism by foreign celebrities and attempts to “mobilise international support against India” on the government’s handling of the farmers’ protests without ascertaining facts were “neither accurate nor responsible” after comments by musician Rihanna and environmental activist Greta Thunberg, lawmakers in the US and UK, and several actors, activists and influencers sparked global clamour over the issue.A statement from the external affairs ministry contended that “vested interest groups” were trying to enforce their agenda on the protests to derail them, and have tried to mobilise global support against India. In this context, the statement referred to “sensationalist social media hashtags and comments” by “celebrities and others” but didn’t name anyone.It is rare for the external affairs ministry to respond to tweets by foreign celebrities critical of events within the country, though it has, in recent weeks, pushed back against comments by leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and lawmakers in the UK and other countries supporting the farmers’ protest.The ministry’s statement, for the first time, included two hashtags - #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda.As protests against three contentious farm laws have snowballed, they have attracted attention around the world, including among celebrities and lawmakers. Though some celebrities who aren’t well known in India have made social media posts on the issue over the past few days, singer Rihanna was the most high-profile personality to take up the issue on Twitter on Tuesday.Rihanna, who has 101 million followers on Twitter and is among the highest-selling recording artistes in history, triggered a storm on Tuesday by tweeting “why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest”, along with a link to a CNN article about the farmers’ protest that was also part of a subsequent tweet on Wednesday by 18-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg.Thunberg tweeted: “We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India.” The tweet was both supported and criticised by sections within India. Author Meena Harris, the niece of US vice president Kamala Harris, too, joined those criticising the government’s handling of the protests on Wednesday, drawing a link between the demonstrations in India and the assault on the US Capitol by supporters of former president Donald Trump.“It’s no coincidence that the world’s oldest democracy was attacked not even a month ago, and as we speak, the most populous democracy is under assault. This is related. We ALL should be outraged by India’s internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters,” Harris tweeted.India’s foreign ministry said in response to these statements that it “would like to emphasise that these protests must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity, and the efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse”.“Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken. The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” it added.Union home minister Amit Shah wrote on Twitter: “No propaganda can deter India’s unity! No propaganda can stop India to attain new heights! Propaganda cannot decide India’s fate only ‘Progress’ can. India stands united and together to achieve progress.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted: “Motivated campaigns targeting India will never succeed. We have the self confidence today to hold our own. This India will push back.”James Costa, a Democratic congressman who serves on the influential US house foreign affairs committee, too supported the farmers’ right to protest. “The unfolding events in India are troubling. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am closely monitoring the situation. The right to peaceful protest must always be respected. #FarmersProtest,” he tweeted.Since last month, US actor John Cusack, a group of 36 lawmakers in the UK and a spokesperson for UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres have backed the farmers’ protest and taken up the matter on social media and other forums.Indian celebrities Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, Karan Johar and Suniel Shetty said citizens should focus on the government’s efforts to resolve the ongoing farmer crisis rather than paying attention to “half truths” and those creating differences. While Kumar said that efforts by the government to solve the issue were “evident”, Devgn urged people to be wary of “false propaganda against India or Indian policies”. Johar and Shetty, too, supported the Indian government’s statement.Watch: Akshay Kumar vs Rihanna as Bollywood backs government on farm rowFormer Indian cricket star Sachin Tendulkar too tweeted: “India’s sovereignty cannot be compromised. External forces can be spectators but not participants. Indians know India and should decide for India. Let’s remain united as a nation.”India cricket captain Virat Kohli tweeted: “Let us all stay united in this hour of disagreements. Farmers are an integral part of our country and I’m sure an amicable solution will be found between all parties to bring about peace and move forward together.” The farmers’ protest began on November 26, and after several rounds of negotiations with the government failed to end the impasse over the three farm laws, farmer unions backing the agitation decided to intensify their stir.They organised a tractor rally in the national capital on Republic Day that descended into violence and chaos. Authorities responded by shutting down the internet at border points, digging ditches, driving spikes into roads and topping barricades with razor wire to prevent farmers from entering Delhi again.The farmers have been protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, and the external affairs ministry said these “reformist legislation” were passed by Parliament after a “full debate and discussion”. “These reforms give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers. They also pave the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming,” it said, explaining the government’s position on the laws.It said “a very small section of farmers in parts of India” had reservations about the reforms and the government initiated a series of talks with their representatives. Union ministers were part of the negotiations in 11 rounds of talks. “The government has even offered to keep the laws on hold, an offer iterated by no less than the Prime Minister of India,” it said.“Yet, it is unfortunate to see vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda on these protests, and derail them. This was egregiously witnessed on January 26, India’s Republic Day. A cherished national commemoration, the anniversary of the inauguration of the Constitution of India, was besmirched, and violence and vandalism took place in the Indian capital,” the statement said.The ministry said “some of these vested interest groups have also tried to mobilise international support against India”. Instigated by such “fringe elements”, Mahatma Gandhi statues were desecrated in parts of the world, and this is “extremely disturbing for India and for civilised society everywhere”.The BJP hit out at “propaganda and fake narratives” and also attacked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, alleging that he conspires with anti-India elements during his trips abroad. Gandhi, meanwhile, said India’s reputation has taken a “massive hit” and its biggest strength, its soft power, has been “shattered” by the BJP and the RSS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-fends-off-global-clamour-on-farm-stir-101612379873466.html
04-02-2021||India||Motivated campaigns targeting India will never succeed: EAM S Jaishankar||Motivated campaigns targeting India will never succeed, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday, in comments that came on a day his ministry hit out singer Rihanna and climate activist Greta Thunberg for their support to farmers agitating against the new agricultural laws.A tweet by Rihanna extending support to protesting farmers triggered a wave of support for them by a number of global celebrities, activists and politicians."Motivated campaigns targeting India will never succeed. We have the self confidence today to hold our own. This India will push back," Jaishankar said on Twitter with hastags #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda.In a strong response to the remarks made by Rihanna and other celebrities and activists, the Ministry of External Affairs earlier said the "temptation" of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments is "neither accurate, nor responsible".Besides Rihanna, Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, Meena Harris, an American lawyer and niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris, actress Amanda Cerni, singers Jay Sean, Dr Zeus and former adult star Mia Khalifa too voiced their support to the protesting farmers.Rihanna on Tuesday became the first global name to voice her support to the ongoing farmers agitation while criticising the Internet shutdown at the protest sites at Delhi border.In its reaction, the MEA also said some "vested interest groups" are trying to enforce their agenda on the protests and that a very small section of farmers in parts of the country have some reservations about the farm reforms which were passed by the Parliament after a full debate and discussion."Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken," the MEA said in the statement on 'recent comments by foreign individuals and entities on the farmers' protests'.Tens of thousands of farmers have been protesting at three border points on the outskirts of Delhi demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/motivated-campaigns-targeting-india-will-never-succeed-eam-s-jaishankar-101612378516214.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt orders DTC to withdraw buses given to police on special hire||The Delhi government has directed the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) to seek prior approval before allowing any of its buses to be taken on ‘special hire’ by the Delhi Police or any other entity for that matter, senior transport officials said on Wednesday.The government order comes in the wake of at least 40 DTC and cluster buses getting damaged on Republic Day when protesting farmers clashed with the police during their tractor rally. At several points, including near Akshardham and ITO, the Delhi Police had placed buses, besides barricades, to stop farmers from moving beyond the routes approved for the rally.The directive was issued late Wednesday night to suspend direct issuance of DTC buses on special hire came with the approval of transport minister Kailash Gahlot, senior officials said.Also read: Delhi CM says government will help find missing farmersAfter the order, all DTC depots issued notices to the area SHOs of the Delhi police recalling buses with immediate effect.“It has been decided by the competent authority to withdraw all buses deployed on special hire with immediate effect. It is, therefore, requested to relieve buses immediately and any further requisition of buses shall be considered after the approval of the competent authority,” read the electronic messages sent to the area depot managers and the SHOs.Gauging the urgency of the matter, this communication was made through emails as well, said a member of the DTC Ekta Karamchari Union - a body of DTC employees.“The Delhi police has been taking state-run buses on special hire since a long time. But, the basic idea was to transport police personnel for mass deployment in specific areas,” said a senior government official.“But, over the years it was noticed that the police started using these buses for other reasons such as using them as barricades to block roads to putting them up as shields to protect forces from potential violence during riots. The damage ultimately is borne by the DTC which is already running under loss,” said a transport official.“At least 35 DTC buses were damaged in the Republic Day incident and this count is likely to increase as the assessment is still going on. As for cluster buses, a total of five buses were damaged throughout the day on January 26,” said a senior transport official.Each bus costs about ₹50 lakh at least, the official added.The damages were mostly on the windscreen, gate glasses, bumper and window glasses.“Ever since February 1, hundreds of state-run buses are now being used as barricades to block roads. At least 6-7 such buses were deployed to block the Delhi-Meerut expressway alone,” said a senior DTC official.Another official recalled how DTC drivers and depot managers had to face the brunt in the form of police cases when migrants started returning to their hometowns during the coronavirus pandemic-induced lockdown in April-May last year. “Even during that time, those buses were taken on special hire by the police. But all the blame and FIRs were faced by DTC employees,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-orders-dtc-to-withdraw-buses-given-to-police-on-special-hire-101612376996583.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Police register cases against social media users for peddling ‘misinformation’||Delhi Police on Wednesday said they have registered four cases against several social media accounts as part of their action against the “massive misinformation campaign being undertaken on social media to incite violence in the name of farmers’ protests and cause large-scale disturbance in the national capital”.They said requests for the removal of the “offensive and unlawful posts” has been sent to the service providers.The police did not name the Twitter handles against which the Cyber Prevention Awareness and Detection (CyPAD) unit of the police registered the cases for allegedly sharing or posting fake posts over violence during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day.Also read: Police announce reward for info on R-Day violence suspectsLast week, the police arrested a 29-year-old man from Rajasthan’s Churu and apprehended a minor boy from Rajasthan for allegedly posting an old video with fake message about resignation by 200 Delhi Police personnel, said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.“Several other accused persons indulging in such activities have been identified and efforts are underway to affect their arrests. Notices to join the investigation have been issued to four persons. Further action against them will be taken on the basis of their deposition,” said Biswal.Among those who were issued notices was Yogita Bhayana, founder of NGO, PARI, for two tweets that she posted around the time of the clashes. Bhayana was booked by the police for the two tweets and in the notice issued to her, she was asked to “inform the source and reason for uploading” the two posts.While the two tweets couldn’t be found on Wednesday, Bhayana said they were in reference to the alleged shooting by police — a charge denied by the police.“I stand by what I tweeted. They were not done with an intention to cause riots. I just shared my concern about police’s atrocities against farmers and in the hope that it would stop instead of aggravating,” said Bhayana.Ahead of the farmers’ tractor march on Republic Day, which turned violent, Delhi Police reported over 300 Pakistan-based Twitter handles trying to vitiate farmers’ protest.On January 30, the Union ministry of electronics and IT (MEITY) directed Twitter to block around 250 tweets and Twitter accounts which were using offensive, inciting hashtags which have been making fake, intimidatory and provocative tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-register-cases-against-social-media-users-for-peddling-misinformation-101612376995413.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Increased police blockades cut protesters off from toilets, water||The rampant fortification of farm protest sites in Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur has restricted access to toilets, sanitation facilities, and water, agitators at the three border spots have said, alleging that the Delhi Police are intent are cutting off basic facilities to quell the stir.Since January 29, when a group of persons, claiming to be locals, entered the Singhu border agitation and clashes with farmers despite police presence, the number of barricades at the spots has been increased and alternate routes have been cut off. This means farmers spread across the eight-kilometre-long protest area have to now often travel long distances to reach toilets or access drinking water.While supplies coming from Punjab and Haryana at Singhu have not been affected so far, since the barricading and blockades are on the Delhi side, access to toilets and water tankers provided by the Delhi government has been severely disrupted.Also read: Police announce reward for info on R-Day violence suspectsJasvir Singh, a farmer at Singhu border from Punjab’s Tarn Taran district said, “By installing barricades, the police are trying to cut off supplies and intimidate us. Older farmers are being forced to relieve themselves in the open or take a longer route to reach the toilet near a petrol pump. The Delhi government toilets, which are installed only a few metres from here, are now beyond reach.”Earlier, farmers could access the various mobile toilet facilities around the entrance to the Singhu border agitation site and washrooms set up at the nearby Guru Tegh Bahadur Memorial. Farmers spread over the eight-kilometre-long protest spot had access to mobile toilet stations set up by NGOs, welfare groups as well as Haryana authorities.A senior police official, requesting anonymity, said, “Not all routes have been closed. We have kept one side open for them and farmers can move between the two stages using inner lanes and use toilets which have been moved in that area.”Sukhwinder Kaur (44) a disabled person from Punjab’s Jalandhar district protesting at Singhu, uses a wheelchair, and said her family members now have to carry her till the toilets. “It is difficult, but I wanted to come here and protest with the farmers as the government has done every possible thing to break the spirit of the movement,” Kaur said.Protestors at Tikri said after the security forces shut off access to the site, basic amenities such as access to toilets have been an issue, especially for women protestors. However, local residents and several NGOs and startups have pitched in with makeshift facilities.On Sunday, Basic Shit, a start-up that has been installing low-cost urinals across Delhi, conducted a do-it-yourself workshop for protesters, to help them build toilets and urinals around the agitation areas. The first batch of these has been installed near gate number three of Pandit Shriram Sharma Metro station.Local residents have also been providing access to the toilets in their houses and shops for farmers.“The people around us have been extremely supportive. They have allowed women and senior citizens to use their personal toilets. We are also contacting NGOs and startups to help us raise money to build makeshift toilets. The public toilets have been blocked and that is a problem,” said Chaudhary Ranjit Singh, one of the organisers at Tikri border.At Ghazipur border, farmers had access to toilets, some of which have been set up by the local administration and some of their own. Here, none of these basic amenities fell on the Delhi Police’s side of the barricades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/increased-police-blockades-cut-protesters-off-from-toilets-water-101612376936074.html
04-02-2021||India||SC refuses to order probe into violence during tractor rally||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to order a probe into the violence and chaos that engulfed the national capital during the tractor rally by farmers on Republic Day, citing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that “the law will take its own course”.An SC bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde declined to entertain a bunch of three petitions that demanded an investigation either by a committee under a retired Supreme Court judge or by an agency such as the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, expressed confidence that with the government looking into the matter, the apex court did not need to wade into the issue at the moment.Also read: Govt will help find missing farmers, assures Delhi CM“We are sure the government is inquiring into it. They are investigating into it. We also read the Prime Minister’s statement on the incident that the law will take its own course, which means that the government is investigating into it and will take appropriate action,” the CJI observed.At an all-party meeting on January 30, PM Modi had referred to the violence at Red Fort on Republic Day when groups of farmers protesting against three laws aimed at opening up agricultural markets clashed with the police.He asserted that “the law will take its own course.” The PM was responding to opposition demands for a special probe of the incidents at the Fort.On Wednesday, advocate Vishal Tiwari, one of the petitioners, urged the court to order a probe by a judicial committee. He pleaded that the bench ensure the probe was not conducted in a one-sided manner.The bench retorted: “Should we assume it is going to be one-sided. Obviously, they will investigate everybody.”Another petitioner in the case, advocate Shikha Dixit, sought to highlight the problems of commuters and those who were not connected with the protests.“There is a sense of insecurity among the people. Policemen were brutally beaten up. How will a common man feel safe?” she questioned.“Sense of insecurity need not be there. We are not condoning anything, but there is already an investigation taking place. Let there be an investigation first,” added the CJI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-order-probe-into-violence-during-tractor-rally-101612376878857.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Students groups, activists held citizen march in solidarity with farmers||Members of several student organisations and activist groups gathered at Mandi House on Wednesday for a march in solidarity with the farmers protesting at Delhi borders against the new farm laws.Carrying placards and posters with slogans that read “Dilli ke log kisano ke sath” and “no farmers, no food”, and shouting slogans against the legislations, nearly 200 protesters gathered at Mandi House around 12.30pm.They wanted to march till Jantar Mantar, but were stopped by police personnel who then installed barricades across Barakhamba Road.Also read: S Jaishankar says Motivated campaigns targeting India will never succeedThe protesters refused to disperse immediately and instead carried out a sit-in protest at Mandi House till late evening.The protest saw at least 21 organisations participate, including the All India Students’ Union (AISA), Students’ Federation of India (SFI), All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU), and National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), among others.Prasenjeet Kumar, AISA national general secretary, said the Centre should accept the farmers’ demands instead of “waging a war” against them.“The government should immediately retract the complaints filed against the farmer leaders and release those who have been arrested,” Kumar said.Another protester, Sandeep Kumar, a Delhi University (DU) student, said, “Not only has the government not been listening to farmers, they have instead put in place several layers of metal and concrete barriers, fixed iron spikes on the road and built concrete walls to stop them. What kind of behaviour is that? We won’t have food to eat if farmers stop working.”Protesters criticised the Delhi Police for not allowing them to march till Jantar Mantar.Sucheta De, a member of AICCTU, said, “Why have Delhi Police installed so many barricades and deployed riot-gear to stop some students, women, labourers, and activists from carrying out a peaceful march in support of our farmers? Why don’t the police deploy such security when violence actually happens in the city?”Eish Singhal, DCP (New Delhi), said the protesters were not given permission to carry out a march because the area is a “non-designated protest spot” as per the Supreme Court’s directions, apart from the fact that Section 144 is in place as well. “The organisers were duly conveyed about the same. Adequate arrangements were made to avert any untoward situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/students-groups-activists-held-citizen-march-in-solidarity-with-protesting-farmers-101612376875394.html
04-02-2021||India||Global tweets energise rural, tech-savvy social media team||A surge in global support for the months-long farmers’ agitation against three agricultural pro-reform laws, led by popstar Rihanna and Swedish climate-change icon Greta Thunberg, has energised a small, rural, tech-savvy team behind the agitation’s international outreach. It has also brought fresh challenges: internet clampdowns and suspended social-media accounts.Social-media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have played a central role in the farmers’ protests going global, as supporters scattered around the world have amplified the protests.The government directed Twitter to act against about 250 Twitter accounts that posed a “grave threat to public order”.Also read: Government fends off global clamour on farm stirTens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Sikh-dominated Punjab and Haryana, have blocked entry points into New Delhi for more than two months, demanding the repeal of three pro-reform laws passed in September last year.Farmers say the laws will allow corporate giants to take control over a vast, antiquated agricultural sector that supports half of all Indians.Farmers have tapped an array of social-media and messaging platforms – SnapChat, Firechat, Signal and so on – to spread information and disseminate videos and photos from the protests in five sites around the national capital. Social media tools have given the protesters an edge in reaching supporters globally.The idea of a digital wing, alongside the physical protests, was not among plans of the farmers until “misinformation” and “propaganda” to tarnish the agitation went viral, said Baljeet Singh Sandhu, the head of the digital team and vice-president of the Majha Kisan Committee, a farm organisation.“We have been called Khalistani terrorists and what not? We knew that we had to counter it,” Sandhu said. Khalistani is a reference to supporters of a Sikh separatist movement.Early in December last year, a team of five tech-savvy farmers went back to their villages, brought their laptops and got going under a rain-slick tarpaulin tent, known as the “hub,” at the Singhu border, a major protest site north of Delhi.The digital arm of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions leading the protests, called the Kisan Ekta Morcha, has a five-member team --: two farmers are from Punjab, two from Haryana and one from Rajasthan.The team records videos, devises hashtags, takes photographs and streams press conferences. They tweet slogans and videos in their thousands every day.Its Twitter account by the same name, ordered to be shut down by the government, has 186,288 followers while its Instagram account has 219,169 followers. The farmers’ YouTube channel is subscribed by 1.2 million people.On December 21, the Facebook page of the Kisan Ekta Morcha was gaining followers so rapidly within a span of a few hours that Facebook’s internal algorithms mistakenly flagged it as spam, leading to a shutdown.A plethora of anti-Walmarters and opposers of big corporations in the US and elsewhere, apart from independent farm organisations, have also picked up the thread.Cities where demonstrations have been held include global financial hubs, New York, Sydney and London. Protests have also been organised in other overseas towns and cities including Leicester in the UK; Sacramento, California; Houston, Texas; Melbourne, Australia; and Ontario, Canada.In November, Ludhiana-based software engineer Bhavjeet Singh launched the @Tractor2twitr Twitter account to garner global protests.“Big corporations have common global policies that hurt interests of consumers and small growers,” said Anastasia Elliot of Walmart Watch, a Washington-based NGO.“So, anti-capitalists of the world must unite to protect larger interests of society whether in developed or developing countries. We support Indian farmers,” she said in an email.Mewa Singh, the head of Non-Resident Indian Council in Punjab’s Ropar, said his office constantly coordinated with Indians abroad on making the protests global. “My son, a resident of Houston coordinated the protests there,” he said.Sikhs make up 1.4% of Canada’s population, but their close- knit community is an influential voting block. “We stand by Punjab’s farmers because that’s who our ancestors were,” said Banda Singh, a resident of Brampton, Ontario.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-tweets-energise-rural-tech-savvy-social-media-team-101612376816143.html
04-02-2021||India||Govt notice to Twitter over restored handles, warns firm of action||The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) has served notice on Twitter Inc. to again block over 250 accounts and posts to which the microblogging site restored access after blocking them briefly for using a false and controversial hashtag in connection with the ongoing farmers’ protest on the capital’s borders, officials said.The notice states that Twitter, by unblocking the accounts and posts, was in violation of Section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act that carries a maximum punishment of seven years’ imprisonment , officials familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. The notice, the officials said, was sent Tuesday evening.Twitter on Monday blocked access to accounts associated with the farmers’ protest to Indian users on the government’s demand.The blocks, which only applied for viewers based in India, came after the Indian government hit Twitter with a legal demand. Many of the blocked accounts used the hashtag “ModiPlanningFarmerGenocide,” Following criticism of the move, Twitter unblocked them by late Monday.“This is a clear violation of Indian law that Twitter is supposed to follow,” said one of the officials cited above.Also read: Government fends off global clamour on farm stirAmong the handles temporarily withdrawn in India on Monday were those of Kisan Ekta Morcha, an affiliate of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella group leading the ongoing farmers’ protest. Action was also taken again the Twitter accounts of media outlet Caravan, Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar (who was merely highlighting the hashtag to authorities) , activist Hansraj Meena, former Lok Sabha MP and Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Mohammed Salim, and actor Sushant Singh.MeitY, in the notice, a copy of which has been seen by Hindustan Time, said: “Having considered in totality, the contents of the interim order, the oral submissions of the advocate/representative of Twitter at the Committee meeting, and also the mail from Twitter expressing its disobedience of the legal blocking orders, the competent authority is satisfied that it is necessary and also expedient in the interest of public order and also for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to public order that Twitter, as an intermediary under section 2[1][w] of the act is once again directed to block for access by the public, the said Twitter handles and also the said hashtag with immediate effect (attached as Annexure-I).”The committee meeting refers to an inter-ministerial panel’s sitting that allows a third party to seek a review of government directions.Thousands of farmers have been camping on the borders of Delhi since November 26 to demand the repeal of three farm laws that cultivators say would potentially weaken their bargaining power, leave them and the mercy of big agribusinesses and lead to the dismantlement of a system of minimum support prices for foodgrains.“You are aware of the prevailing situation, which not only has the potential, but has in fact, resulted into a major public order issue on 26.01.2021,” the MeitY notice said, referring to the violence that took place in Delhi during a tractors’ rally on Republic Day. “The statutory authorities are doing everything possible to ensure that no adverse public order situation takes place and no cognizable offences are committed.”“In light of these developments and as apart of due process, and as per the settled practice, an order was passed under Rule 9 of the Information Technology [Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public] Rules, 2009,which have ensued in the exercise of powers under section 69A[2] of the Information and Technology Act, 2000.”.Under Section69(A) {2}of the Information Technology Act, the government can suspend accounts that pose a threat to public order.The notice also stated that Twitter has no “no constitutional, statutory or any legal basis whatsoever to comment upon the interplay of statutory provisions with constitutional principles or to unilaterally read down the scope of statutory provisions as per its own limited private understanding of the constitutional and statutory laws of India”.“This a is motivated campaign to abuse, inflame and create tension in society on unsubstantiated grounds. Incitement to Genocide is Not Freedom of Speech; It is Threat to Law & Order,” the notice said.The government added that it considered the submissions of Twitter but found that it is necessary to take down the accounts in public interest.Twitter declined to comment on the issue. The accounts, however, were accessible until late Wednesday night.Last week, the government wrote to the microblogging site to take down posts and accounts that ran the controversial hashtag. Twitter blocked the accounts but restored them and said that they constitute free speech and are newsworthy.“The farmer’s protest has been going on for months but the government has not blocked a single account before now,” said a second official familiar with the matter. “If such a decision was taken, it would have factored in the consequences of running a hashtag that alludes to senior people in the government planning being involved in some sort of conspiracy.”MeitY issued the directions to block the accounts under section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act after the ministry of home affairs (MHA) stepped in, the people quoted above said. “The home ministry said that the tweets could lead to an adverse law and order situation. The accounts have been withheld to prevent an escalation of violence,” an official familiar with the matter said on Monday.Raman Chima, Asia Pacific Director at Access Now, a digital rights organisation, said: “For initiating the imprisonment sentence, the government will have to take Twitter to court. Twitter can always challenge it by saying what is happening isn’t legal. This will open up a problematic can of worms because since 2005 governments have been cautious about not making tech company executives liable for content posted by users.”He added: “The government has not provided the actual 69(A) order. It is perverse in the Indian republic to censure somebody without providing the actual document. The SC, on internet shutdowns, has said that you cannot deprive anybody of their rights online without making the order public. There is no legal mandate for confidentiality with the government other than the rules they have framed themselves. These are not constitutional.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-notice-to-twitter-over-restored-handles-warns-firm-of-action-101612376755832.html
04-02-2021||India||Jind mahapanchayat adopts five resolutions on farm laws||Thousands of people thronged a mega rally of farmers in the heart of Haryana on Wednesday as leaders of the ongoing protest against three agriculture laws called on young people to join the stir and demanded the government remove restrictions around the agitation sites in Delhi and repeal the controversial legislation.The kisan mahapanchayat in Jind’s Kandela village, known as the political nerve centre of the influential Jat community, drew the participation of 50 khaps, or clan-based bodies, and more than 30 thousand people.The event ended with the adoption of five resolutions: repealing of the laws passed in September, legal backing to the minimum support price regime, implementation of the 2004 Swaminathan Commission recommendations, farm loan waiver and withdrawal of police cases against farmer protesters.The mahapanchayat was addressed by over two dozenpeople, including farm leader Rakesh Tikait, whose emotional appeal for support last week attracted thousands of people from western Uttar Pradesh to a protest site outside Delhi and rejuvenated the two-month-long stir.Also read: Increased police blockades cut protesters off from toilets, water“We have so far talked about “bill wapsi” (repealing the farm laws). The government should listen carefully. What will you do if the youth call for “gaddi wapsi” (removal from power)?” he said.Tikait, a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), also attacked the government over heavy barricading of the three main protest sites on Delhi’s outskirts: Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur. The sites have turned into fortresses with police digging trenches, putting up barbed wire fences, concrete barricades and hammering beds of nails on roads. The police action came after farmers ran riot during a tractor rally on Republic Day, storming the Red Fort and hoisting the Sikh flag from its ramparts. Since then, at least 115 farmers have been held by police.“Our khaps have decided to remove these nails and barbed wires,” he said. “Jab-Jab Raja darta hai, kilebandi karta hai (Whenever a king feels threatened, he fortifies),” he added, the crowd chanting the slogan with him.“I want to assure you that your turban will not bend before anyone and the government will have to repeal the farm laws. We are ready to protest till October and will observe this year as Yuva kranti [youth revolution],” he added, to loud applause.Tikait also called on young people to visit fields and bring soil and water to their houses. “ I urge you to visit your fields and touch the soil with your body. If you do this, no one will sell your land to anyone in extreme situations too in the next 50 years. We have to save our lands. You give me your anger and we will win this battle.”His speech was cut short when the main stage collapsed under the weight of the people standing on it. No one was seriously hurt.This was the first mahapanchayat in Haryana since the farm protests began last year and was held in the politically sensitive Kandela village, considered a rebel belt of Haryana farmers. The village shot to limelight in 2002 when nine farmers died in police firing during protests against the state government’s refusal to waive power bills. The farmers banned then chief minister OP Chautala and his family from the village, and only relented in 2019 current deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and his uncle Abhay Chautala of apologised.Tekram Kandela, head of the Kandela khap, said Tikait called him and asked to hold a mahapanchayat. “It was the people of Kandela, who blocked the Chandigarh –Hisar highway within an hour after seeing the weeping video of him on January 27 evening. Hundreds of farmers from our village reached the Ghazipur border that night. Rakesh Tikait took part in the meeting to thank the khaps and other farmers,” Kandela said in the meeting.Tikait’s brother, BKU chief Naresh Tikait, held a similar mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar last week when farmers -- many of whom hailed from the Jat community -- vowed to join the stir.In his speech, Tikait put to rest any speculation about a rift between the farm unions and said 40 leaders who are part of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body leading the agitation, will continue to hold negotiations with the government. “We will support the Punjab leadership. The Punjab leadership will head the delegation,” he added.“We will not change any of our 40 members, who are part of delegation. In this war, we will not change our horses but fight this battle with injured horses,” he added.The protest was set off by three laws passed September that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules.Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices. The government has refuted the concerns, and offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months, but talks are currently locked in a stalemate..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jind-mahapanchayat-adopts-five-resolutions-on-farm-laws-101612376755370.html
04-02-2021||Editorials||On global criticism, tread with caution | HT Editorial||The farm protests have captured global attention, with a set of political, cultural, and environmental figures — including the popular artiste, Rihanna, the fourth-most followed person on Twitter — tweeting their solidarity with the protests. This has led the ministry of external affairs (MEA) to issue a statement, blaming “vested interest groups” and pointing to the evolution of the farm laws, the need to see protests within the framework of India’s democratic structure, the efforts made to reach an agreement with farm groups, and the violence on Republic Day. This is unusual simply because the government usually ignores comments from non-State actors.There are two distinct issues here. The first is the international solidarity that the movement has been able to generate, either due to the Sikh diaspora’s network, the larger mobilisation by liberal, left, and human rights groups, or the nature of the international media’s coverage of the protests. At a time when it is not unusual for narratives to be controlled through influencer networks and IT cells — and India is no stranger to either — it is entirely possible (no matter what the probability) that at least some of these displays of solidarity have been engineered.But irrespective of the causes and the merits of the criticism (or the merits of the underlying protest), the fact is that it erodes India’s soft power and image as a democracy. The government will have to recognise the intricate ways in which domestic developments intersect with global politics, especially at a time when social media has disproportionate power in shaping perception. The most substantive and effective way in which the Indian State can respond is by strengthening its own democratic framework and reiterating its commitment to individual liberty and the right to dissent, in principle and practice. Rihanna, for instance, with over 100 million followers on Twitter is unlikely to be cowed down by a troll army, or fears of falling sales of her music in India.The second issue is the ability of this criticism — confined at the moment to private, even if influential, citizens in the West — to become a matter of inter-State deliberations. This is where the MEA’s statement comes in. It can be read as an attempt to both counter what the government sees as “propaganda” to discredit India, and an effort to pre-empt foreign governments from being guided by the social media storm. It is unlikely that foreign governments, particularly the US, will, even if they issue token statements, make it a top diplomatic issue. But what is clear is that India, because of the ideological and economic shifts underway in the country and the subsequent polarisation, will face questions.This requires ensuring that these transformations are democratically managed internally, and smarter strategic communication about the nature of these changes externally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-global-criticism-tread-with-caution-ht-editorial-101612363126065.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police announce ₹6 lakh cash reward for info on R-Day violence suspects||The Delhi Police on Wednesday announced cash rewards of ₹6 lakh for information leading to the arrest of eight suspects, including actor Deep Sidhu, allegedly involved in the violence and vandalism at the Red Fort during the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26.On Wednesday, the police also arrested one suspect, Dharmendra Singh Harman, a Delhi resident identified from several video clips of the clashes at the fort, a senior officer said.Police said they have identified more than 260 vehicles, including nearly 100 tractors, which were part of the rally and involved in the violence at the fort and other places in Delhi when protesters clashed with the police after breaking barriers and entering the city from Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri.Also read: Government fends off global clamour on farm stir“We have announced ₹1 lakh against Sidhu, Jugraj and two others because they appear to be the key conspirators. Raids have been conducted at many places in Punjab and other states, but the suspects are on the run. The family members of some of them are also untraceable,” said a senior officer.Investigators who declined to be named explained that the rewards were in two categories – ₹1 lakh and ₹50,000 – for different suspects even as teams of Delhi Police failed to locate these eight suspects despite multiple raids at locations in Delhi-NCR, Punjab and Haryana. A case was registered after the violence at Red Fort at the Kotwali police station and a special investigation team of the crime branch was handling the probe.Officers said the raids to arrest the suspects are still on.Among those who carry a reward of ₹1 lakh are Jugraj Singh from Punjab’s Tarn Taran, who has been identified as the one who hoisted a farmers’ union flag and a religious flag at Red Fort; Deep Sidhu, Gurjot Singh and Gurjant Singh.Police said that ₹50,000 reward each will be given for information leading to the arrest of four other suspects identified as Jajbir Singh, Buta Singh, Sukhdev Singh, and Iqbal Singh.All the eight men are wanted in the same case registered under sections pertaining to offences such as rioting, attempt to murder, attempt to commit culpable homicide, dacoity and criminal conspiracy, apart from vandalising the historic monument. Two cases were registered in connection with the violence and vandalism at the monument in which more than 40 police personnel were injured.The announcement has been made through separate order issued on Tuesday against each of the eight men by deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Chinmoy Biswal, who has now been transferred to the crime branch and appointed the spokesperson of the city police.Many video clips and photographs showed protesters clashing with the security personnel and hoisting the religious flag on the monument. In the videos, Sidhu was also seen among the protesters.A second police officer said that of the eight suspects, five belong to Tarn Taran from Punjab and the police have not ruled out the possibility that they “carried out the act of vandalism and violence” at the Red Fort as part of a “pre-planned conspiracy”. The other three suspects are from Haryana’s Karnal (Sukhdev Singh) and Punjab’s Muktsar (Sidhu) and Ludhiana (Iqbal Singh).Investigators said of the 260 vehicles identified so far, notices have been sent to many of their owners. Also, notices have been sent to nearly 200 people, including farm leaders, who were part of the farmers’ tractor rally. They were asked to record their statement or join the investigation “However, none of them have responded to the notices so far,” the officer added.A total of 44 cases have been registered in connection with the violence at Red Fort and other places in Delhi during the rally and an incident on January 29 when a group of persons, claiming to be locals, entered the protest site at Singhu border and clashed with farmers and police.Police said they have arrested 124 people in connection with the violent incidents that left 510 security personnel injured.On January 28, Sidhu denied the charges against him through a Facebook post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-announce-cash-rewards-for-info-on-r-day-violence-suspects-101612331690116.html
