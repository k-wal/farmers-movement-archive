16-02-2021||India||'Agitating farmers illegally tapping electricity, damaging roads': NHAI||The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has accused the agitating farmers of illegally tapping electricity from its streetlight connection to run their gadgets and appliances, including washing machines, heaters and TVs, besides damaging the road at the Ghazipur border on the under-construction Delhi-Meerut Expressway.The NHAI has urged the Uttar Pradesh government to get the road cleared in keeping with the terms and conditions of the State Support Agreement (SSA), which provides that barring reasons related to emergency, national security and law and order, no government agency or private individual will disrupt the highway project.The NHAI charges come amid the announcement by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait that he would set up an air-conditioned office at the protest site, giving indications about the agitators readying for a long haul.Tikait, who has been sitting on the UP-Delhi border with thousands of his supporters for more than two months now, is also a member of the State Advisory Committee (SAC) under the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC).The NHAI claims to have written several letters to authorities since December 16, 2020, bringing the issue to their notice and urging them to get the site vacated so that the expressway project could be completed as per the fixed timeline.“We have been regularly writing to the authorities for over two months now about the farmers having illegally occupied the expressway, stealing electricity from our street lights, damaging the road, etc. We have urged them to get the place vacated, but in vain,” said project director Mudit Garg.Also read: January meeting could have provoked PM Modi’s swipe at the IAS-led ‘babus’The state government, he argued, must order the site to be cleared as per the SSA entered into with it on May 5, 2015.One of the letters written by Garg to the Ghaziabad district magistrate, with a copy marked to UP’s chief secretary and regional officer, NHAI, on January 28, stated, “Farmers are making unauthorised use of the project’s streetlights for various purposes and things such as washing machines, heaters, tent lighting, mobile charging points etc.”“Tapping supply illegally from the streetlight,” he pointed in the letter, led to frequent damages of equipment like miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) etc, apart from causing fluctuations, damaging project’s high-quality streetlight lamps.The letter further said, “bitumen layer on around one-kilometre stretch from UP Gate/Delhi to Dasna had been completely burnt, because of farmers regularly burning bonfires on the dharna site. The road surface is in a very poor condition.”“Digging of roads to erect poles and put up tents and water flowing from the makeshift toilets set up on the site are also damaging the road,” the letter said.Garg said entry to the site has been completely blocked. “We do not know what is happening there on the project site. Protestors chased our men away when they managed to reach the place a few days ago,” he complained.Meanwhile, BKU state president Rajveer Singh Jadaun said, “We are not going to vacate the protest site, NHAI’s complaints notwithstanding, till the government withdraws the three laws.”“As for the charges about farmers stealing electricity from NHAI’s streetlight connection, our leader Rakesh Tikait has publicly said that government can always send its officials and give a separate power connection for the dharna site,” he added.UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) chief engineer, Ghaziabad zone, Pankaj Srivastav confirmed that farmers, or anyone else on their behalf, had neither taken a power connection for the protest site nor had anyone applied for one.“We are told that farmers are meeting their electricity requirements by tapping the streetlights line that is duly metered and causes no revenue loss to us,” he argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agitating-farmers-illegally-tapping-electricity-damaging-roads-nhai-101613480585803.html
16-02-2021||India||Delhi women's panel sends notice to police over Disha Ravi’s arrest||The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has sent a notice to the deputy police commissioner of the cybercrime cell over climate activist Disha Ravi's arrest, news agency ANI reported on Tuesday. The commission has asked the Delhi Police to provide a copy of the first information of report (FIR), reasons for allegedly not producing Ravi before a local court for transit remand and detailed action taken report, the agency added.Delhi Police commissioner SN Srivastava, whose force is under a firestorm of criticism from opposition leaders and other activists, had said earlier in the day that all procedures were followed in Ravi’s arrest for her alleged involvement in preparing a toolkit that details support for farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws."As far as Disha's arrest is concerned, it was done as per the procedures. The law does not differentiate between a 22-year-old and a 50-year-old. She was produced before a court which sent her to five-day police custody,” Srivastava told reporters.Also read | Delhi Police ask Zoom to share details of farm stir ‘toolkit’ meetingHe argued that it is incorrect to say that there were lapses in the arrest. The Delhi Police commissioner said that investigation into the ‘toolkit' document case is underway."I cannot divulge the details of the case as its investigation is premature. As things will be clear everyone will be notified." Srivastava said.A Delhi court on Sunday had remanded Disha to five days of police custody following her arrest from Bengaluru in connection with allegedly spreading a "toolkit" related to the farmers' protest. She was arrested last week. Delhi Police have said that Ravi is a key conspirator in the "toolkit" case as she had admitted during the initial interrogation to editing, adding some things in the online document and spreading it further.Also read | Toolkit case: Bail pleas of Nikita Jacob, Shantanu Muluk in Bombay HC todaySeveral political leaders have slammed the Delhi Police for Ravi’s arrest and said it was "unwarranted harassment, unfortunate and shocking".Congress leader P Chidambaram had said, "The Indian state must be standing on very shaky foundations if Disha Ravi, a 22-year-old student of Mount Carmel College and a climate activist, has become a threat to the nation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-women-s-panel-sends-notice-to-police-over-disha-ravi-s-arrest-101613468765828.html

Reddy said officers of Delhi Police showed remarkable restraint on January 26 when a planned tractor rally organised by the farmers’ unions representatives turned violent.The minister also said that the police thwarted the anti-national forces while exercising maximum restraint. “On January 26, we witnessed how anti-India powers used farmers' protest to disrupt the law and order situation in Delhi. Despite their anti-national activities and provocative behaviour, Delhi Police exercised restraint and tackled the situation responsibly,” the Union minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Reddy also highlighted the role of Delhi Police in controlling the riots in the national capital in February last year. Reddy said that Delhi remains the focal point for elements who want to destabilise the country. The Union minister said, “There are many anti-India elements that want to spread instability. Delhi remains their focal point. The riots and illegal protests that took place in February 2020 were a part of this scheme but the way Delhi Police handled it, is an example for other police forces.”Earlier in the day, Union home minister Amit Shah had also lauded the Delhi Police for its role during the past year. Shah, who as the home minister also heads the police force, had earlier in January highlighted that despite the difficulties due to the pandemic, the Delhi Police fulfilled their duties.On Tuesday, Shah tweeted, “Warmest greetings to all the workers and their families on the 74th foundation Day of Delhi Police. I salute the courage, restraint and determination of the brave soldiers of the Delhi Police who are fully dedicated to ensure the security and peacekeeping of the capital of the country even under adverse circumstances.”Delhi Police was part of the Punjab Police until 1947. Delhi Police appointed its first Inspector General of Police on February 16, 1948, when the national capital saw a huge influx of refugees post-Partition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-tackled-situation-during-r-day-violence-responsibly-says-minister-101613467824837.html

The Delhi Police have alleged that the duo along with another accused Shantanu Muluk attended the virtual meeting organized by Poetic Justice Foundation on Zoom.“Based on the course of action decided in the Zoom meeting, Nikita, Shantanu, Disha and others collaborated together to draft the Toolkit document. The document that they drafted had secessionist and pro-Khalistani content embedded into it through links and texts,” the police said in a statement.The police claim that it was Ravi who shared the toolkit with Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg and later asked the latter to delete the Twitter post carrying the document after its details accidentally got into the public domain.“The main aim of the toolkit was to create misinformation and disaffection against the lawfully enacted government. The Toolkit sought to artificially amplify the fake news and other falsehoods and also sought to precipitate action on 26th January,” the police statement read.Jacob admitted to participating in the Zoom meeting but she has denied sharing any information with Thunberg and asserted that the document was an “informational pack” and was not meant to incite violence.Ravi was on Sunday sent to five days in police custody by a Delhi court while non-bailable warrants have been issued against Jacob and Muluk. The two have filed anticipatory bail petitions and the Bombay High Court is expected to take up the matter later today.The Delhi Police has also written to messaging application WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) to get the details of the WhatsApp group created by Ravi on December 6, according to news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-ask-zoom-to-share-details-of-farm-stir-toolkit-meeting-101613465281015.html

16-02-2021||Delhi||Actor Deep Sidhu, accused in Republic Day violence, remanded to 7-day police custody||Actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu was remanded to seven-day police custody by a Delhi court on Tuesday. Sidhu, who is accused in connection with the violence on January 26 during farmers’ tractor rally, was produced before the duty magistrate’s at 8.30 this morning.The order comes three days after Sidhu and another accused Iqbal Singh were taken to the Red Fort by a special investigation team (SIT) to recreate the sequence of events that led to vandalism and clashes between the agitators and the police.The team probing the case will inspect the spot to ascertain the route taken by the demonstrators, their activities at the Red Fort and how things unfolded at the monument on Republic Day when the violence broke out, a senior police officer said.Police have alleged that the two were “prominent players” behind the violence and “instigated the mob” by delivering “provocative speeches.” They claim that Sidhu even congratulated the man who hoisted flags at the Red Fort apart from doing a Facebook live from the iconic fort.The police are also probing the link between gangster-turned-activist Lakhbir Singh alias Lakha Sidhana, after the latter recently released a video on social media, in which the latter sought support for Sidhu and others arrested and demanding their release.The police had also announced a cash reward of ₹1 lakh for information that can lead to the arrest of the actor, who was nabbed from in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur last week by the northern range of Delhi Police's Special Cell.Sidhu is among the 143 people so far arrested in connection with as many as 44 cases registered regarding the violence in the national capital on Republic Day. The actor was part of the group of protesters who stormed the Red Fort during the tractor parade by farmers, who have been camping at Delhi’s borders for over two and half months now to protest against three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September last year. At least seven of the arrested persons have already been released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/actor-deep-sidhu-accused-in-republic-day-violence-remanded-to-7-day-police-custody-101613453845423.html

However, she denied sharing any information with Thunberg and added that the document was an “informational pack” and was not intended to incite violence. She told the police that the toolkit was being prepared by XR India volunteers for presenting the whole picture with a simple breakdown for an international audience.The activist has sought protection from arrest for four weeks, interim protection from any coercive action and a direction to the Delhi Police to share her with a copy of the FIR registered against her.The Delhi Police have alleged that Jacob and Muluk created the Google toolkit in collaboration with another 22-year-old activist Disha Ravi, who was arrested from Bengaluru on Saturday and was sent to five days in police custody by a court in Delhi.The police claim the information about the duo was revealed by Ravi during her interrogation in Bengaluru. “The email account created by Shantanu is the owner of this doc and all others are editors,” Prem Nath, joint commissioner of police of the cyber cell, said.The officer added that information from Jacob’s phone shows that she and Ravi had sent it to Thunberg on the Telegram app.According to police, Ravi had later asked the Swedish activist to delete the post carrying the toolkit, which “indicates a copycat execution of a conspiracy behind the January 26 violence”, after the document’s details accidentally got into the public domain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-bail-pleas-of-nikita-jacob-shantanu-muluk-in-bombay-high-court-today-101613442510430.html

No weapons, no violence, no mention of anything remotely violent in the toolkit or any of our communication,” the 30-year-old lawyer from Mumbai asserted.The toolkit, she said, sought to only educate those interested to learn more about the broader perspective involved in relation to the farmers’ current situation and fears, besides other public information and resource links for similar campaigns.Jacob, who is a volunteer of global environmental movement Extinction Rebellion (XR), told the Delhi Police that to prepare an informational kit for an ongoing movement was “natural and perfectly legal in a democracy guarded by a constitution as strong as ours.”Facing a non-bailable warrant (NBW) issued by a Delhi court, Jacob said the toolkit was being prepared by XR India volunteers for presenting the whole picture with a simple breakdown for an international audience. She told the police that the draft toolkit was shared on the XR WhatsApp group for comments and feedback before it was finalised on January 22, and circulated within XR networks whilst it primarily focused on the farm issues, the right to express dissent and the larger democracy.Jacob’s statement read that one of the XR volunteer partners, Fridays for Future, shared the toolkit with Greta Thunberg, seeking her solidarity with the protesting farmers in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-was-only-to-educate-people-on-farm-stir-nikita-jacob-101613421378156.html
16-02-2021||India||Were informed about activist Disha Ravi's arrest later, says Bengaluru police||Senior officers in Bengaluru police on Monday said that they were informed about the arrest of 22-year-old Disha Ravi only after all procedures of the arrest were completed.HT spoke with three senior officers in the city, who said on condition of anonymity that Delhi police informed the local police about the arrest through officials of Karnataka cyber-crime cell, after the arrest was made.While addressing media in New Delhi, Prem Nath, Joint Commissioner, Cyber Cell, Delhi Police said that Disha Ravi was arrested in the presence of her mother and the Station House Officer from the local police station. He claimed that all procedures were followed.However, according to the city police, the information was passed on to the local police station and no officer was present during the arrest.The operation of Delhi police has come under scrutiny by legal experts and activists.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa cited the Criminal Procedure Code to state that when an accused is arrested in another state, it is incumbent upon the arresting police to take assistance of the local police and to produce the accused with the case diaries, before a nearest magistrate for a decision on custody and remand. “Criminal Justice System requires every arrest to be judicially scrutinised at all levels. In this case, the Delhi Police has circumvented the law and violated the fundamental rights of the accused by depriving her even of legal assistance,” said Pahwa.Read more: Disha Ravi, Nikita Jacob and Shantanu created toolkit, say Delhi PoliceBengaluru-based lawyer Vinay Srinivasa said that a group of city lawyers submitted a memorandum to the police, seeking explanation on the procedural lapses and the follow-up action by the police.“According to the guidelines provided by the Delhi High Court following a 2018 case, an officer should inform the concerned local police station of the purpose of his visit on arrival; the arrested person must be given an opportunity to consult his lawyer before he/she is taken out of state; and the police officer must visit the local police station make an entry in the daily diary specifying the name and address of the person(s) being taken out of the state. Delhi police have violated all these HC guidelines,” added Srinivasa.But some believe it hasn’t violated any norms.Former additional solicitor general and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra said that in a case of arrest without a warrant, the fundamental requirement is to produce an accused before a judge within 24 hours in keeping with Article 22 of Constitution.“A 2014 judgment by the Delhi high court in Sat Prakash’s case has also clarified this position in law. Besides, if there is a procedural irregularity in making an arrest, a subsequent order of remand can cure it as per the legal provisions,” he added.Criminal lawyer MS Khan said: “There is no illegality or infirmity in the Delhi Police arresting Disha Ravi from Bengaluru and producing her before a magistrate within 24 hours.” The advocate added that once an accused is produced before a magistrate, the judicial officer can allow custodial interrogation for a maximum period of 15 days if there is adequate reason.Read more: Greta toolkit: After Disha Ravi, arrest warrants against Nikita Jacob, ShantanuFollowing the arrest, NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR) issued a statement that Disha should have been produced before the competent court in Bengaluru for obtaining transit remand since she is being moved between states.“She was instead produced before the Duty Magistrate in Patiala House Court in Delhi – by no means the “nearest magistrate” as required by clause (2) of Article 22. She also did not have an opportunity to seek legal counsel nor was one provided to her, in breach of clause (1) of Article 22,” read a statement from CJAR.Disha was provided a legal aid lawyer before the Delhi court when she was sent to police custody for five days.The statement further added that the actions of Delhi police have made a complete mockery of the “procedure established by law” in depriving Disha Ravi of her right to life and liberty. “Such illegal actions by the Delhi Police would amount to kidnapping under the pretense of law.”“Disha was arrested without a warrant from the court since the FIR registered in this case disclosed cognisable offences. All procedures under the CrPC were followed and she was produced before the court of competent jurisdiction in Delhi within 24 hours,” said a Delhi Police officer on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-allege-lapses-demand-explanation-for-activist-s-arrest-101613420872783.html

It condemns the arrest of young environmental activist Disha Ravi without due procedures being followed. SKM demands her immediate release.”The group said that environmentalists like Ravi were aware of farmers’ issues. “India’s young environmentalists do understand and appreciate that unviable farming leads to unsustainable farming too...”On Saturday, Delhi police’s cyber crime unit arrested 22-year-old climate activist Disha Rai from her house in Bengaluru for allegedly sharing on social media the toolkit related to the farmers’ protest and brought her to Delhi.“...It is this inter-linkage between viability and sustainability that activists like Disha Ravi have understood in their extension of support for the farmers’ protests...

16-02-2021||India||Activists say toolkits aren't the problem, 'objectives should be constitutional'||The arrest of 22-year-old Disha Ravi in connection with editing a toolkit that offered suggestions on how to support the farmers’ protests has thrown light on a tool often employed by the non-profit sector, advocacy groups, and even the United Nations to carry out digital activism over a range of issues.Activists from various organisations said they routinely used toolkits or resource kits, which were a standard operating procedure for advocacy and media outreach and did not constitute a crime as it was entirely up to people whether or not to follow what toolkits suggested.“The toolkit is the means to get a campaign going. It is all about social media as that is the medium of the young… These paperless campaigns in the digital format grab attention. So if you are trying to warn people not to use toolkits that is absurd,” said Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares who has been part of the Save Mollem campaign which started after the National Board for Wildlife approved the felling of 59,000 trees for development projects in and around the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park last April.Goa Foundation also filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the High Court challenging these approvals.The campaign which began in June was conducted over several months — taking the shape of Facebook Live events, citizens’ letters to the authorities, signature campaigns, Twitter storms, artworks and performances, demonstrations and even a weekly documentary series on the wildlife of Goa.Toolkits were also created in the duration of the campaign, including one for citizens, which provided an overview of the proposed projects, a primer on the laws that governed protected forests, the official email addresses of the authorities to whom citizens could write to, and pointers on what their letters needed to address.Also Read: Effort to mislead global community- Pakistan on visit of foreign envoys to J-KAccording to Divya Narayanan, the campaigns director at Jhatkaa.Org, a digital platform to drive public engagement and volunteer movements on a range of issues, creating a toolkit is standard practice for running campaigns, especially social media campaigns.“A toolkit for a digital campaign is essentially a document that has information about the issue or a campaign and lays out ways in which people can lend support to the movement and solidarity online and offline. Social media posts are pre-drafted by campaigners/experts so that it’s easy for people to amplify the issue online without having to create content from scratch.”Also Read: Bengaluru counters Delhi Police on Disha Ravi’s arrest, say they were told laterNarayanan said that toolkits are often created in collaboration with civil society groups that come together for an issue. “We have co-created sample tweets, and other social media content with citizen groups to amplify issues like urban deforestation or air pollution in India,” she said.Meera Sanghamitra, an activist with the National Alliance of People’s Movements, said that movements utilised pamphlets and letters much before toolkits as a way to broaden their outreach and spread awareness over social justice issues.“Toolkits are a compilation of material available in the public domain. Oftentimes, everyone may not have the wherewithal to find the material and understand the issue, which is why campaigns and activists do the labour of putting together the material in an easy and accessible way, which is fact-based and verified,” Sanghamitra said.Also Read: In Kerala, protests against backdoor appointments in govt jobs intensifies“This criminalisation of ‘toolkit solidarity’ is outlandish. Primarily, it’s a clampdown on any form of solidarity between people,” she added.Asmita Ghosh, a communications specialist who has worked with both national and international non-governmental organisations over campaigns pertaining to gender and access to education, among other things, said that people are free not to comply with the asks in a toolkit if it does not speak to their concerns or align with their own values.“There can be a number of ways that a person can take part in any kind of activism. A social media toolkit may give sample posts or tweets, and this doesn’t mean that the integrity of a movement is compromised because, in today’s busy world, we campaigners need to make as easy for people to understand an issue and take action about it. Once they read and decide that they agree with what the message of the campaign is, we make it easier for them to take action by giving them sample tweets or Facebook posts that they can copy-paste to show their support for a movement,” Ghosh said.However, toolkits can also be used to spread disinformation and thus it is incumbent on a reader to be mindful of whether the toolkit is seeking participation in constitutional objectives, said Internet Freedom Foundation executive director Apar Gupta, who was one of the members of the Save the Internet campaign conducted some years ago on the issue of net neutrality.“It’s the objectives which define the desirability of a toolkit. For instance, if it’s towards a goal of climate justice or supporting the rights of farmers to protest, these are all constitutional objectives. If, on the other hand, a toolkit is advocating a high degree of disinformation or trying to create a fissure within society, then it’s not a goal that is not desirable for the proper functioning of a society,” Gupta said.Toolkits help unify the message which is necessary for any kind of amplification over social media platforms on account of their algorithms, Gupta added.“A social media platform prizes a certain level of conversation for it to then become visible to people who are not part of that conversation. It is important to unify in certain core ways through the use of hashtags, for instance, for the platform’s algorithm to prioritise it. If people tweet above a certain volume, it shows as a trend on Twitter, which then feeds the larger media ecology in which people can comment and participate in conversations… [and thus] become visible to constituencies which you want to sensitise to the cause you are espousing. In fact, the United Nations itself also communicates through toolkits that it has built around a range of issues like adolescent health care, access to education,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activists-say-toolkits-aren-t-the-problem-objectives-should-be-constitutional-101613416595416.html
16-02-2021||India||Cops claim man mentioned in toolkit associated with ISI||The Delhi Police on Monday said they were probing how the name of Pieter Friedrich, who they claimed was associated with a module of the Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), figured in the toolkit that was tweeted by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and is now being probed in connection with the violence during the January 26 farmers’ tractor rally.The police said the document aimed to spread misinformation, tarnish India’s image, and incite unrest.At a press briefing on Monday, police told reporters that the document that was tweeted and later withdrawn by Thunberg mentioned the name of Friedrich, who has been on the radar of the security agencies since late 2006 when he was associated with one Bhajan Singh Bhinder alias Iqbal Chaudhary, a leading proponent of the K2 (Kashmir-Khalistan) desk of ISI.Thunberg later posted an updated document.On Monday, an account that ostensibly belonged to Friedrich, tweeted: “‘Delhi Police on Monday unearthed the role of pro-Pakistan and Khalistan sympathiser Pieter Friedrich.’ For the record, not only do I not support Khalistan, but the Khalistan movement today appears to nothing more than a psy-ops project of the Modi regime.”On Saturday, Delhi Police’s cyber crime unit arrested 22-year-old climate activist Disha Rai from her home in Bengaluru for allegedly working on the toolkit related to the farmers’ protest, and brought her to Delhi.Top opposition leaders protested Ravi’s arrest, with some leaders directly accusing the Union government for muzzling dissent. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi quoted Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s famous couplet, “Bol ke lab azad hain tere...” to say that “Tell them that the truth is alive till now. They (the government) are scared, not the country. India won’t be silenced.”Activists from various organisations said creating a toolkit was standard operating procedure for advocacy and media outreach, and did not constitute a crime as it was entirely up to people whether or not to follow what toolkits suggested.“If you see the toolkit, it is a very carefully crafted document. It has sections on what hashtags to trend on a particular day, what action has to be taken, who is to be tagged, and who is to be followed. In the section - ‘ who is to be followed’ - there are certain names of established media houses, reputed fact-checkers, some NGOs and among those you’ll find one very incongruous looking name – Peter Friedrich,” DCP Manishi Chandra of the special cell claimed.“Bhinder’s name was also associated with arms and drugs smuggling,” he said, adding that they will investigate why Friedrich’s name was mentioned in the toolkit in the list of people who should be followed online.The police said that they were also probing if Disha Ravi and others contacted Friedrich through Mo Dhaliwal, the founder of Poetic Justice Foundation.Deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy said the toolkit is not a static document but a dynamic one. “It has a large number of hyperlinks. They are links to various Google drives, Google docs and websites. One of the important websites is askindiawhy.com. This website has a lot of pro-Khalistan content,” Roy said.He said the document in itself has an action plan. “The toolkit was a private document to be shared among a limited number of people who would then influence public opinion. Having global icons to follow it, was to propagate it further. False narrative and pro-Khalistani propaganda was also to be propagated through this.”Activists condemned the action.“A toolkit is the most ordinary and commonplace of resources...we believe Disha Ravi and youngsters like her ought to be celebrated, not harassed and demonised,” said environmental activist G Sundarajan in Chennai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-named-in-toolkit-linked-to-isi-cops-101613415291225.html
16-02-2021||Noida||SKM seeks ‘unconditional’ release of activist Disha Ravi, Tikait shies away||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of various farmers’ unions, on Monday demanded an “unconditional release” of 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi who was arrested by the Delhi Police from her Bengaluru house on Saturday for her alleged involvement in the ‘toolkit’ case.However, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait stayed away from the controversy, saying he didn’t know about the ‘toolkit’ case.“SKM is deeply concerned and anguished about the brazen misuse of police power by the government in its efforts to weaken the ongoing farmers’ movement. It condemns the arrest of young environmental activist Disha Ravi without due procedures being followed. SKM demands her immediate unconditional release,” the SKM said in a statement issued on Monday.The SKM in a statement on Sunday had “condemned” Ravi’s arrest and said that “she stood in support of the farmers”.However, Tikait, who is also the national spokesperson of BKU, said, “We don’t know why the girl (Ravi) who planted trees has been arrested. I don’t know what toolkit is. Messages nowadays are going to different parts of the world through social media and several arrests are being made. When talks will be held, all issues will be discussed,” Tikait said at the UP Gate on Monday, while reiterating that an inquiry should be taken up into the incident of hoisting of a flag at the Red Fort.Ravi was arrested as she was one of the editors of a toolkit that, according to the police, “indicates a copycat execution of a conspiracy” behind the January 26 violence during the farmers’ tractor rally in Delhi.Tikait visits ‘school’ at protest siteMeanwhile, Tikait also donned the role of a teacher when he went to one of the camps at the protest site where children from nearby slums are taught by some volunteers.“Soon after their birth, these children have to hold garbage in hands. It is not their fault but a result of faulty policies. It is unfortunate that they are at the border of Delhi but don’t know the alphabets,” Tikait said.During his interaction with the kids, he also called one of the children to come up and recite the alphabets written over a chart paper hung up as a blackboard.The volunteers teaching the children at the makeshift school said that most of the children belong to ragpickers’ families. “We started the school on January 22, and now we have about 100 children. We will teach them till the agitation goes on, and thereafter we will try that these kids get admission in nearby schools. We will speak to the administration as well,” said Dev Kumar, a volunteer who teaches children at the camp.“Tikait ji also visited our camp and told children about benefits of planting trees and also staying away from cold drinks. He also gave them lessons in moral science and told us to keep up the work we are doing,” Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/skm-seeks-unconditional-release-of-activist-disha-ravi-tikait-shies-away-101613413431579.html
16-02-2021||Noida||Government wants to prolong agitation, says Rakesh Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said on Monday that the central government wants to “prolong the ongoing farmers’ agitation” and hopes “it will die down in the next two months”.His remarks came as the stalemate between the farmers and the central government continues, with no talks held since January 22.Tikait, who was at Uttar Pradesh Gate on Monday, asked the members of the farmers’ committee to make arrangements for summer as small gatherings near the dais would otherwise send wrong signals.“It seems the government wants to stretch the ongoing agitation and hope that it will die down in another two months. They think low gathering means that the agitation is coming to an end. But they should not misunderstand this, it will continue,” Tikait said.He also asked farmers from different regions to be present at the site, according to respective harvesting work.During an all-party meeting on January 30, 2021, ahead of the Budget session on February 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that “the Centre stands by the offer to the farmers by Union agriculture minister Naresh Tomar”. As part of the offer, the government proposed staying the implementation of the three controversial farm laws for one and half years.However, there was violence in Delhi when farmers, many from Uttar Pradesh Gate, carried out a massive tractor rally on Republic Day (January 26). Many farmer leaders including Tikait were also booked by the Delhi Police.“With the present scenario, either the farmers will find a way out, or the government will. We told them to talk to the farmers for a solution. If we hold rallies in other states, questions related to political motives will be raised,” he added.“This agitation will continue, and we know that they (the government) will not understand so easily as they have got votes without even asking. They are asking for money in the name of temples, and we are asking for atta (flour) for our agitation. The temple will be constructed and if they want, they can get it constructed with the help of interest from our pending sugarcane payment which is about ₹12,000 crore,” Tikait said, adding that the fight now is to save their land, and not about any banner or flag (of the farmer unions).He also asked the farmer unions to apply for a 100-kilowatt electricity connection at the protest site, and if it is not provided, generators should be set up. The farmers will continue their protest by running desert coolers during the summer.When India got freedom there were many people who came out of jail when they opted for pardon on promise that they will not be part of any agitation, he said. “But this agitation has no such people. It has people who are fighting for their land and rights. They are protesting so that future generations do not have to hold any agitation,” he added.The farmers have been camping at the protest site near Uttar Pradesh Gate since November 28, 2020, demanding repeal of the farm laws, and a new law on minimum support price (MSP).Tikait, who has been spearheading the farmers’ protest at Uttar Pradesh Gate, grew in stature after he broke down in front of media persons on January 28 and made an emotional appeal to the people to bring food and water for him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/government-wants-to-prolong-agitation-says-rakesh-tikait-101613413311005.html
16-02-2021||Delhi||Families of those arrested for R-Day violence face backlash||Devender Singh, who runs an electrical fittings shop in Nehru Vihar area of north Delhi’s Timarpur, says customers have been avoiding to come to his shop ever since his brother, Satbir, was arrested by the police in connection with the violence during the tractor rally on Republic Day.“Our business is hit because customers have stopped coming to our shop. Our neighbours hardly speak to us. Even our relatives are not supporting us. They feel that my brother’s arrest in the Republic Day violence case has brought shame to our family. They all consider my brother a culprit, even though a court is yet to decide his fate,” says Devender. Satbir was arrested on February 8 in connection with the violence at Burari when hundreds of farmers clashed with the police after deviating from a pre-approved route for a tractor parade, part of the ongoing protest against the three farm laws passed in September.Read more: Farmers, Hindutva, businesses: The trinity of political economyPolice have registered at least 44 cases in connection with the January 26 violence that erupted at the Red Fort, ITO and many other places in the city during the farmers’ tractor rally and the incident of January 29, during which a group of people, claiming to be local residents, reached the protest site at Singhu border and clashed with farmers and police. More than a dozen farmers and 510 personnel were injured in the two incidents.Till February 13, police arrested 146 people in several cases, 33 of them are Delhi residents. Of these 33, 14 have been arrested for violence at Burari in which many security personnel, including an assistant commandant of central industrial security force (CISF) were injured.Families of many alleged suspects said they were finding it difficult to make ends meet because the person arrested was the only earning member. Many others, like Devender, also claimed that their neighbours and families have ostracized them, fearing harassment by police.Most of the Delhi residents arrested in connection with the January 26 violence come from middle-class families who live in working class neighbourhoods.Read more: 'So much truth': Mahatma Gandhi's granddaughter lends support to protesting farmersTwo more Nehru Vihar residents -- Surjeet Singh, a salesman in a footwear shop in Karol Bagh, and Ravi Kumar, a student preparing for staff selection commission (SSC) exams – were also among those arrested in the Burari case. Their families claimed that they were not part of the tractor rally but were caught in the jam caused by the rally, while going to a gurdwara in Chandni Chowk.“We do not belong to a family of farmers and we have no association with the ongoing protest. Since it was my son’s off because of the Republic Day, he left for the gurdwara on a scooter with his friend Ravi. He was not part of the violence. It’s just that they were stuck in a traffic jam,” said Surjeet’s mother Gurpreet Singh, adding that her family depends on his son’s job which he might lose because of the arrest.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said, “The arrests in the cases are being made after ascertaining the role of the suspects and the evidence collected. Any participant in the unlawful mob breaking law and causing violence is liable for prosecution.”The family of Dharminder Singh Harman admitted that he was part of the protest at Singhu border but clarified that he was not involved in the violence. They said Harman, who was arrested by the crime branch on February 5 in connection with the violence at Red Fort, was running a health camp at the protest site since November.Read more: Punjab civic body polls: Farmers protest against farm laws in Amritsar“Since he too is involved in farming, my husband supported the farmers’ cause. On January 26, he had gone for the tractor rally but caused no violence. Police arrested him just because he was part of the rally,” said Neha, Harman’s wife.A police officer who did not want to be named said, “Most of the arrested persons were seen at multiple locations where violence broke out. Why a west or south Delhi resident was present at the Red Fort with flags on his bike during the rally?”Police have said Harman is associated with the founder of a regional political party that supported last year’s anti-CAA agitation at Shaheen Bagh, an allegation his wife has refuted.The families of the arrested persons are being provided with free legal assistance by a team formed by Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC).“The FIRs are not being uploaded on the Delhi Police website despite Delhi High Court’s directions. Three-four people got police notice for their presence as witnesses but were arrested after they appeared before the police. The families of those arrested are not being informed by the police about the arrests or the offences they have been booked for,” said advocate Virinder Pal Singh Sandhu from DSGMC’s legal team.Police officers denied the allegations, saying all legal formalities were being followed in all cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/families-of-those-arrested-for-r-day-violence-face-backlash-101613412892018.html

Farmers’ unions representatives say that these laws will pave the way for MNCs in the agricultural sector to reap profits and pave the way for corporate farming.They also fear the system of procurement under MSP will be affected. The Centre has repeatedly assured farmers that the MSP system will remain unaffected and said the laws will ensure doubling of farmers’ incomes.Follow live updates here:Follow all the updates here:BKU leader Rakesh Tikait replies to Congress leader Vidya Rani's remarksWhat is the use of liquor here?

16-02-2021||India||Delhi Police ask Zoom to share details of farm stir ‘toolkit’ meeting||The Delhi Police has written to video conferencing application Zoom seeking details of participants who attended the virtual meet on January 11 regarding the ‘toolkit’ on farm laws stir, an official was quoted as saying by news agency PTI on Tuesday.The Zoom meeting came to light following the arrest of 22-year-old Bengaluru activist Disha Ravi and searches at Mumbai-based activist and advocate Nikita Jacob. The Delhi Police have alleged that the duo along with another accused Shantanu Muluk attended the virtual meeting organized by Poetic Justice Foundation on Zoom.“Based on the course of action decided in the Zoom meeting, Nikita, Shantanu, Disha and others collaborated together to draft the Toolkit document. The document that they drafted had secessionist and pro-Khalistani content embedded into it through links and texts,” the police said in a statement.The police claim that it was Ravi who shared the toolkit with Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg and later asked the latter to delete the Twitter post carrying the document after its details accidentally got into the public domain.“The main aim of the toolkit was to create misinformation and disaffection against the lawfully enacted government. The Toolkit sought to artificially amplify the fake news and other falsehoods and also sought to precipitate action on 26th January,” the police statement read.Jacob admitted to participating in the Zoom meeting but she has denied sharing any information with Thunberg and asserted that the document was an “informational pack” and was not meant to incite violence.Ravi was on Sunday sent to five days in police custody by a Delhi court while non-bailable warrants have been issued against Jacob and Muluk. The two have filed anticipatory bail petitions and the Bombay High Court is expected to take up the matter later today.The Delhi Police has also written to messaging application WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) to get the details of the WhatsApp group created by Ravi on December 6, according to news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-ask-zoom-to-share-details-of-farm-stir-toolkit-meeting-101613465281015.html
