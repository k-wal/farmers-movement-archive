This was the fourth such major gathering of farmers organised in the region in the last four days. The previous three were held in Muzaffarnagar on Friday, Mathura on Saturday and Baraut in Baghpat on Sunday. Like the other congregations, the Bijnor mahapanchayat also drew a huge crowd of farmers.“We would fight until our last breath to keep the farmers’ honour and respect intact,” said Gaurav Tikait and expressed his gratitude to the people of Bijnor and farmers for turning up in large numbers to attend the mahapanchayat.Barring Jayant Chaudhary, who spoke for a few minutes, other political leaders, including those of the Samajwadi Party, the Congress and the RLD, were not allowed to share the stage.Also read: Twitter restores 250 accounts blocked in India for a controversial hashtagWhile BKU chief Naresh Tikait was expected to attend the mahapanchayat, he sent his son Gaurav Tikait instead.Gaurav Tikait called upon farmers to support the movement, rising above caste and community, “because farmers have no caste”.He said, “Over 150 farmers have been martyred during the movement.”For his part, RLD leader Jayant Choudhary also said, “We need to unite and work together to break the ego of this government.”He advised farmers to remain patient during the battle against three contentious farm reform laws.Hitting out at UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, he said, "The state government has not declared the sugarcane price even after two months of the ongoing crushing season in the mills."Meanwhile, banners were put up at two more villages in Amroha district, banning the entry of BJP leaders over the new farm laws. These two new villages are Nareni and Baldana Heera Singh, Chaudhary Chatrapal Singh, pradhan of Nareni village in Amroha, said on Monday. A similar ban had been declared at Kumrala Bahadarpur village in the same district on Sunday.Chatrapal Singh said the police came to his village on Sunday midnight and took the banner away.“We were not against the police, but the government. Then, why are the police removing banners and boards?” asked Chatrapal Singh.Bijendra Singh, a farmer from Nirpura village in Baghpat district, had declared at Sunday’s panchayat in Baraut that residents of his village would not allow BJP leaders to enter the village. He had also demanded that Union minister Sanjeev Baliyan and Baghpat MP Satyapal Singh should resign in support of farmers.Meanwhile, support for the farmers' movement continued with villagers heading for the Ghazipur border in groups, carrying ration, vegetables, milk, curd and other commodities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naresh-tikait-s-son-says-will-fight-till-last-breath-for-farmers-honour-101612203337745.html
01-02-2021||India||Indian farmers' protest resonates with US agriculture||Images of thousands of farmers streaming into India's capital on tractors and carrying banners to decry potentially devastating changes in agricultural policy can seem a world away, but the protests in New Delhi raise issues that resonate in the United States and have led to dramatic change in rural America.Indian farmers have left their homes to march through New Delhi in a desperate effort to force the repeal of laws they believe would end guaranteed pricing and force them to sell to powerful corporations rather than government-run markets. Despite decades of economic growth, up to half of India’s population relies on growing crops on small parcels of land, typically less than 3 acres, and farmers worry that without guaranteed prices they will be forced to sell their land and lose their livelihoods.The dispute raises questions not only about agriculture but about dwindling populations in rural India where small communities are already struggling to survive — an issue mirrored in the parts of the US“These protests have gone way beyond the bills because this has spiraled into a larger conversation about the soul of rural India, which is something very familiar to those of us in the Midwest,” said Andrew Flachs, an anthropology professor at Purdue University who has extensively studied the experiences of cotton farmers in India. “We’re always talking about the spirit of American agrarianism and the soul of rural America and this has shifted into a conversation of those same dynamics in India.”The images of farmers marching through New Delhi recall similar scenes in Washington, D.C., during the farming crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when hundreds of trucks and tractors flooded the National Mall. Thousands of farmers lost their land, in part because of government policies that caused soaring interest rates as demand for their products plunged, leading to falling land values.In Iowa — one of the hardest hit states — there were about 500 farm auctions a month in 1983 when families had no choice but to sell.Decades later, those memories remain fresh for Rick Juchems, whose parents had to sell their 640-acre farm in Iowa. Just as feared by those protesting in India, the American farmers lost their livelihoods and sense of identity.“We were just trying to stay alive,” said Juchems, who later was able to continue farming thanks to his in-laws. “That’s what you work all your life for and then it’s gone.”Rural economies in the Midwest that had been declining for decades were devastated by the farm crisis. But while many farmers who survived emerged more prosperous, the communities near them continued to struggle. Researchers fear the same could happen in India if New Delhi refuses to repeal the law that favors corporate farming.Post-crisis, many Americans in rural areas were able to adapt, moving to cities and finding jobs, but Bengaluru, India-based social anthropologist Aninhalli Vasavi said farmers in India have few options. Even as economic realities force them to leave their rural homes, they often struggle in urban areas.“India has not had a substantial industrial base to absorb the large population into gainful industrial or urban employment,” Vasavi said via email. “Instead, vast number of rural migrants are ‘adversely integrated’ into the low-end urban and construction economy.”The challenges facing India are common to many developing countries in Asia, where farmland has been gobbled up, often for factories and property development, leaving legions of farmers without adequate compensation and bereft of their livelihoods.In countries including Myanmar, Cambodia and China, many end up on the fringes of fast industrializing cities, finding low-paid work in service jobs such as massage parlors and delivery services that provide no social benefits or security.Vasavi and others also worry about the environmental consequences of the shift from labor-intensive agriculture in India toward the large-scale farming familiar in the US. Such farming isn’t new to India, which implemented aspects of industrial farming — dubbed the Green Revolution — in the 1960s and succeeded in increasing production and reducing widespread hunger.Even as the many small plots make India less productive than in the US, researchers say Indian farmers are good stewards of their land and avoid some of the environmental consequences seen in US agriculture, such as fertilizer runoff and soil depletion.Peggy Barlett, an Emory University anthropology professor who studies agriculture and rural life, said that while a push for industrial farming might seem obvious to Americans accustomed to large-scale farming, it makes less sense in India, where there is plenty of labor but less money for expensive farm equipment.As more attention is paid to the role of agriculture in climate change, US farmers also will be confronted more in coming years with the environmental cost of petroleum-based fertilizer, rather than relying on organic methods used frequently on small farms, Barlett said.Ohio State University researcher Andrea Rissing said there has been a surge in young Americans growing vegetables on a few acres, in some ways more like in India than in the US Midwest. Those small holdings meet a growing demand for fresh, locally grown produce.Rissing said many of her students have no choice but to think small because farmland is so expensive, but they also are drawn to non-mechanized farming that improves soils and limits runoff into waterways. Others are building food hubs to market their vegetables locally, rather than send it to markets nationwide and abroad as is typical of large-scale agriculture in the USIt’s the kind of farming Rissing prefers, but she acknowledges: “Farming is hard. It’s hard for small-scale farmers and it’s hard for big corn and soybean farmers, too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-farmers-protests-resonate-with-us-agriculture-101612200220830.html

The Chief Minister said his cabinet colleagues had met the Union Home Minister on the issue and he would personally take up the cases of such missing persons and farmers with the Ministry of Home Affairs."Our hearts are with those fighting for their rights at the Delhi borders," said the Chief Minister, appealing to the people of Punjab to immediately dial 112 to report any case of a person missing during the tractor rally.He further added, "We will do everything possible to locate those who are missing. We are trying to get details and will ensure that they return to their homes".Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar urged the Chief Minister to help out the farmers facing legal cases in the national capital.It is learnt that the Delhi Police has arrested around 89 persons, hailing from UP, Haryana and Punjab, and registered 38 FIRs in connection with the Republic Day violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-announces-helpline-number-for-people-missing-after-r-day-tractor-rally-101612199659346.html
01-02-2021||India||Farmers announce nationwide agitation on Feb 6, issue calls to block roads||Barely a week after the violence in the national capital on India's 72nd Republic Day, a section of protesting farmers on Monday gave a call for a nationwide agitation on February 6. This comes even as thousands of farmers are protesting against the three contentious farm laws at the borders of Delhi for more than two months now."There will be a country-wide agitation on February 6. We will block roads between 12pm and 3pm," Balbir Singh Rajewal of Bhartiya Kisan Union (R) said, according to news agency ANI.The farmers made the announcement during a press conference at the Singhu Border that they will block national and state highways for three hours to lodge their protest. The road blockade has been called by farm union to reinforce their demands of the repeal of the farm laws, against the suspension of internet and barricading of roads, and against the budget announced on Monday.This announcement from farmers comes amid tight security measures by the Delhi Police near the protest sites where buses of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) are being used to seal main entry points amid other multi-layered security arrangements and checkpoints both by the police and farmers' union volunteers. Ghazipur, the new focal point of the ongoing farmers' agitation, also witnessed heightened restrictions on Monday even as it continues to aggrieve Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad commuters. The Delhi-UP border site, which is galvanising farmers from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand days after BKU leader Rakesh Tikait's emotional appeal, is a fortress in the making with security arrangements being amplified with every passing day.As the farmers alleged that they have been "ignored" in the Union Budget 2021-22, they also pointed out that water and power supply have been curtailed at their protest venues. The Samkyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of protesting unions, also alleged that the Twitter accounts of Kisan Ekta Morcha and a user named 'Tractor2Twitter' have been restricted. While the accounts on the social media site remained restricted in India for the whole day, they were restored slowly by Twitter around late evening.Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav alleged the action against the Twitter account was taken on the "request of government authorities". The Union government, Yadav said, has "reduced the allocation to agriculture sector" in this budget.This comes as the government claims that they have introduced a slew of measures to aid the agricultural sector. During her budget speech, Sitharaman said that there is a steady increase in the procurement of wheat, rice, pulses from farmers. The finance minister also said that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime has undergone a sea change to ensure the price that is at least 1.5 times the cost of production across all commodities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-announce-nationwide-agitation-on-feb-6-issue-calls-to-block-roads-101612190684503.html
01-02-2021||India||Farmers' protest: A fortress in making in Ghazipur||With parked DTC buses sealing main entry points, multi-layered security arrangements and check points -- both by police and farmers' union volunteers -- Ghazipur, the new focal point of the ongoing farmers' agitation, witnessed heightened restrictions on Monday.The Delhi-UP border site, which is galvanising farmers from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand days after BKU leader Rakesh Tikait's emotional appeal, is a fortress in the making with security arrangements being amplified with every passing day.Concertina wires -- a new addition in at least three points -- boulders in between the barriers. No major road is open for movement of vehicles and people which is proving to be a growing problem for many passing the stretch.Rakesh Tikait, the star farmer leader, while addressing a packed crowd from the main stage also mentioned the newly put barbed wires in his speech."They (the administration) have put these barbed wires, not us. They are not allowing people to come to Delhi. We are not the one blocking the roads. If we block roads, they ask us to vacate, but no action is taken when the same is done by these security forces," he said to a cheering crowd.Also Read | Farm laws: Agriculture minister has a suggestion and a warning for oppositionOn Wednesday night, the atmosphere was tense at Ghazipur. The Ghaziabad administration had issued an "ultimatum" to the protesters to vacate a stretch of the Delhi-Meerut expressway they were occupying as the January 26 clashes painted a not-so-peaceful picture of the peasant community.As security presence at the site escalated, fears grew that the protesters would be forcibly evicted, but the emotional outburst of Rakesh Tikait saved the day -- and possibly the whole movement -- and people in tens of thousands started converging at the protest site in support of the agitation.Many commuters complained that the heightened security measures and new restrictions on routes day after day are affecting their daily commute."Since December we were facing problems with this stretch, but the security and restrictions has been grown by leaps and bounds. The interior routes which they have not barricaded -- as of yet -- are not only congested but are in a pathetic condition, making them too dangerous to travel on," said Navdeep Kumar, a regular commuter of the National Highway-24.To keep at bay an unruly crowd and any possible plot to disturb the peaceful movement, the volunteers have taken the matter into their own hands. They are maintaining high vigil in the area by setting up multiple-check points."We don't allow locals to enter without any rhyme or reason. Even if you are media, you have to show your id-card for entry. The drill is applied round the clock," said a volunteer, standing next to a make-shift checkpoint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-a-fortress-in-making-in-ghazipur-101612191922016.html
01-02-2021||India||R-Day violence: Punjab Congress leaders raise concerns over 'missing' youths with Amit Shah||Congress MP Manish Tewari, and Punjab ministers Sukhjinder Randhawa and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria met Home Minister Amit Shah in the Parliament House on Monday to trace the whereabouts of people "missing" since January 26 in the national capital during farmers' tractor parade.The Punjab leaders and MLA Raj Kumar Chhabbewal expressed their concerns over the "missing youths" who were detained by the Delhi Police after the incident, and they demanded their early release.The Punjab government later provided details of 120 people from the state who have been arrested by Delhi police in various cases registered during the tractor parade.Randhawa and Sarkaria later said that in order to fight the legal cases of people arrested by the Delhi Police, the Punjab government has formed a team of 40 advocates who have already started their work.Also Read | Farm laws: Agriculture minister has a suggestion and a warning for oppositionHe said the advocates would meet the arrested persons and their families and fight the legal battle to provide justice to these persons free of cost.The ministers said at a press conference that they have also appealed to the central government for taking a lenient view towards those arrested.During the meeting, Shah stated that the list of arrested persons has been uploaded on the Home Ministry's website and if the state government provided any other list of missing persons, the central government would leave no stone unturned to find the whereabouts of such persons, Randhawa said.On the deadlock between the Centre and farmer unions over farm laws, Randhawa said the home minister stated that the central government is ready for talks and waiting for farmers' response in this regard."The chief minister has called an all-party meeting on February 2 to evolve a consensus on the way forward on the issue of farm laws and the farmer's agitation in the light of the recent developments in Delhi," the minister said.The Delhi Police has said it filed over 35 cases and arrested more than 80 people in connection with the violence and vandalism in the national capital during a tractor parade on January 26 by the farmers protesting against the three new central agriculture laws.Concerns have been raised in Punjab over some of the youths having gone "missing" after they were protesting at the Singhu border and having participated in the agitations at the Red Fort on Republic Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rday-violence-punjab-cong-leaders-raise-missing-youths-issue-with-shah-101612190222619.html
01-02-2021||India||Farm laws: Agriculture minister has a suggestion and a warning for opposition||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday urged opposition parties to not indulge in politics over the three farm laws, which have triggered protests by farmers who have been camping at Delhi borders for more than two months now. Several political parties announced to boycott the laws during the Budget Session of Parliament."I appeal to the political parties to not engage in politics every time. Those who play politics on every matter meet the same fate as that of opposing parties presently,” Tomar said, according to news agency ANI.Also Read | Budget silent on 'agricultural unrest', ignores 'entire north India': Punjab FMMany political parties, including the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Congress, Trinamool Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have announced to boycott the farm laws and support the farmers' agitation. Before this, as many as 16 political parties boycotted President Ram Nath Kovind's address to both the Houses of Parliament over the farm legislation. The leaders had also lashed out at the ruling-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), calling it arrogant, adamant and undemocratic.NCP chief Sharad Pawar criticised the latest reforms in series of tweets. A former agriculture minister, Pawar said that the new laws will adversely affect the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and it will also weaken the mandi system. The criticism was rejected by Tomar as he said that Pawar is not bringing out "correct facts" and is "misinformed" about the laws.Tends of thousands of farmers camping at Delhi's borders are demanding a repeal of the laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for the procurement of their crops. Agitating farmers claim that the new laws will weaken the MSP system, despite the Centre seeking to assure them in vain that the MSP system was here to stay and the new laws would only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.The government has held several rounds of talks with the leaders of the farmers but has failed to bring any resolution to the matter so far.Earlier in the day, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government is ready for talks with the protesting farmers as it is the "only solution." Sitharaman made the comments while responding to a question during the post-budget press briefing. "We can understand why farmers are sitting at the border. If any farmer has any question, agriculture minister (Narendra Singh Tomar) has never denied opportunities for talk," Sitharaman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-agriculture-minister-tomar-has-a-suggestion-for-oppn-parties-delivers-a-warning-101612187592653.html

01-02-2021||India||Farm stir, budget session likely to delay selection of next CBI director||With just three days left for incumbent Rishi Kumar Shukla’s two-year tenure to end, the process of choosing the next director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is likely to be delayed. The Centre is yet to call a meeting of the high-powered selection committee that chooses the chief of the country’s premier investigating agency, people familiar with the development said.The selection committee, comprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Justice of India SA Bobde and Leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, has to decide the name of the next CBI director from among a panel of officers belonging to four batches – 1984 to 1987 – of the Indian Police Service (IPS) on the basis of seniority, integrity and experience in handling vigilance/anti-corruption cases.Shukla’s two-year tenure as agency chief will end on February 3. He had joined the agency on February 4, 2019.However, the panel is yet to take a call on the crucial meeting and people familiar with the process said on condition of anonymity that the government may take a few more weeks to scrutinize the record of eligible officers because it is caught up in the farmers’ protests against the three farm laws, the Covid-19 pandemic and the budget session of Parliament.When contacted, Chowdhury confirmed to HT that he had not received any notice yet for the meeting to choose the CBI director. The Congress is the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha.The government is tight-lipped over the process, but an official who didn’t want to be named, said at least 25-26 IPS officers from 1984 to 1987 batches are in the fray for the coveted job. As per procedure, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) will prepare a list of probables in consultation with the Chief Vigilance Commission (CVC) for the selection committee to consider.Among the top contenders are 1984 batch officer of the Assam-Meghalaya cadre YC Modi (currently director general, or DG, of the National Investigation Agency); 1984 batch Gujarat cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana (currently DG of the Border Security Force); 1985 batch Maharashtra cadre officer Subodh Kumar Jaiswal (DG of the Central Industrial Security Force); 1985 batch UP cadre officer H C Awasthy (director general of police, or DGP, Uttar Pradesh); 1984 batch officer of Haryana cadre S S Deswal; and 1985 officer of Kerala cadre Loknath Behera (DGP, Kerala).Meanwhile, in another development in the CBI, the agency’s former spokesperson, deputy superintendent of police R K Gaur, who retired in December 2020, has been re-employed in the agency for one year on contract to handle the media. He will report to additional director general-media R C Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-stir-budget-session-likely-to-delay-selection-of-next-cbi-director-101612140388744.html

The PCCs {Pradesh Congress Committees} are requested to give instructions to the DCCs {District Congress Committees} to hold a massive padayatra in every district involving every Congress worker, leader and office bearer in the district.”Also read: Opposition leaders may raise the issue in Parliament, says TikaitThe proposed programmes across the states are the first organised, pan-India campaign by the Congress at the grassroots level and coincides with the ongoing farmers’ agitation at the border points of Delhi. A part of the Congress programme will also overlap with the budget session of Parliament where at least 18 Opposition parties are demanding withdrawal of the three farm laws.The laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, and lay down new rules for contract farming.Farmers fear the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations and pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at minimum support prices (MSPs).The letter, dated January 30, also asked for state-level‘Kisan Sammelans to be organised before February-end. “It has to be ensured that each and every worker/leaders across the state and all elected representatives including MP’s/MLA’s/ Congress candidates/ Party Office Bearers participate and ensure to make it a mass convention,” Venugopal said.Last week, the Congress Working Committee approved state-wise agitations against the farm laws, which the Congress says will only benefit a handful of industrialists.The government has refuted the Opposition claims and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday the Centre’s offer to protesting farmers of keeping three agri laws in abeyance for 18 months “still stands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-plans-campaign-against-centre-across-states-over-farm-laws-101612138984627.html
01-02-2021||India||Took political support for farmers' movement only after democracy was mocked: Rakesh Tikait||The Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) had not allowed political parties in the movement against new central farm laws but took political support "only after democracy was mocked" at protest sites, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said Sunday.         Tikait made the remark as hundreds of farmers reached a key protest site on the Delhi-Meerut highway in Ghazipur on the national capital's border with Uttar Pradesh where they danced to upbeat tunes, creating a festive atmosphere as more supporters continued to pour in.        Security measures were strengthened with multi-layer barricading that included iron and concrete structures, while barbed wires also came up on both sides of the highway stretch that has become the BKU's camping site since November 28 last year in a major farmers' stir over three new farm laws of the Centre.         Farmers reached the Ghazipur border from western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand as a turban-clad Rakesh Tikait led the charge for the BKU, the appeal of which coupled with a clarion call from a January 29 "mahapanchayat" of farmers in Muzaffarnagar has re-energised the stir, which was fast losing its sheen and momentum after the Republic Day violence in Delhi.         In response to a question, Tikait said, “the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) had not allowed political parties to enter the movement because our movement is apolitical. Support from political parties was taken only after democracy was mocked over the protests. But still, politicians are kept away from the stage of farmers' protest.”         On Sunday, Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal reached Ghazipur. Besides him, regional leaders of Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, Rashtriya Lok Dal, Samajwadi Party also met with BKU office-bearers, extending their support in the fight for their demand for rollback of the new laws.         “Modi saab nu kisaanan di mann di gal sunni chahidi hai (Prime Minister Narendra Modi should listen to the heart's talk of the farmers),” said Badal, whose party broke ties from the BJP-led NDA over the contentious laws last year.         Tikait said the farmer unions are hoping for a resolution of the deadlock through dialogue and if the prime minister wants to talk to the farmers, they will ensure dignity of the PM's post but also protect their self-interest.         On if and when will the farmers decide on talking to the government, Tikait said, “I am one of the 40 members of the farmers' delegation but the decision on talks would be taken by the SKM committee.”         According to the Ghaziabad administration, senior officials and police officers are regularly monitoring the situation at the Ghazipur border.         Vehicles proceeding towards and coming from the protest site are being checked while drones were deployed for aerial monitoring at the site, which had thousands of protestors on Sunday, according to officials.         "The situation is under control and is being regularly monitored," an officer of the district administration said.         The groups of farmers camping at the site braving the cold nights were seen dancing to folk tunes and songs eulogising the nation and farmers as some young protesters carried music systems to Ghazipur on their tractor-trollies.         Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.         The protesting farmers have expressed the apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.         However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/took-political-support-for-farmers-movement-only-after-democracy-was-mocked-rakesh-tikait-101612137665487.html

Our farmers are dying at the Delhi borders for more than two months now. They are being beaten by the police and assaulted by goons. They are being deprived of basic amenities,” he said.A large number of farmers from Punjab are at the receiving end, he added.“All political parties will put aside their differences to find a solution. This is the time to come together to save our state and our people,” he stressed.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi borders since November last year to demand a repeal of the three laws. The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-calls-all-party-meet-tomorrow-over-farmers-stir-101612129118712.html
01-02-2021||India||Saddened by insult to Tricolour on R-Day: PM||The country has been saddened by the “insult to the Tricolour” on Republic Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday in his monthly Mann Ki Baat radio address, referring to the hoisting of the Sikh religious flag and a farmers’ union flag next to the national flag by protesting farmers at Red Fort.In his first address to the nation in 2021, a day before finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the Union budget in Parliament, Modi celebrated India’s vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the Indian cricket team’s triumph against Australia in the Test series, and called for the infusion of a new hope.“This month, there has been very good news from the cricket pitch too,” the PM said in his radio address, which he delivers on the last Sunday of every month. ”Our cricket team, after initial setbacks, made a grand comeback, winning the series in Australia. The hard work and teamwork of our players is inspirational. Amidst all this, the country was saddened by the insult to the Tricolour on the 26th of January in Delhi.”He added: “We have to infuse times to come with new hope...Last year, we displayed exemplary patience and courage {in the fight against the viral disease}. This year too, we have to work hard to attain our resolve. We have to take our country forward at a faster pace.”Watch: India was shocked to witness insult of tricolor on Republic Day, says PM﻿A tractor rally by farmers to protest against three laws passed by Parliament in September to open up agricultural markets turned violent at Red Fort on Republic Day. In expressing his sadness at the insult to the Tricolour, Modi echoed the sentiment expressed by President Ram Nath Kovind, who said in his speech to Parliament on Friday that the “national flag and a holy day like Republic Day were insulted in the past few days.”Referring to India’s vaccination programme against the coronavirus disease that is currently underway, the Prime Minister said the country’s fight against the pandemic had been “exemplary” to the world.“My dear countrymen, the beginning of this year marks the completion of almost one year of our battle against Corona. Just as India’s fight against Corona became an example, our vaccination programme too is turning out to be exemplary to the world. Today, India is undertaking the world’s biggest Covid vaccine programme. Do you know what’s a matter of more pride?”PM Modi said India was vaccinating its citizens at a faster pace than anywhere else. “In just 15 days, India has vaccinated over 30 lakh Corona warriors whereas an advanced country such as America took 18 days to get the same done; Britain 36 days,” he said.And referring to India’s diplomatic outreach to other countries through shipments of the made-in-India Covid-19 vaccines, he said he had received messages from Presidents and Prime Ministers of countries around the world.“You must also have seen recently how the President of Brazil, in a tweet thanked India – every Indian was gladdened at that....Friends, in this vaccination programme, you must have noticed something more! During the moment of crisis, India is able to serve the world today since she is capable, self-reliant in the field of medicines, vaccines. The same thought underpins the Atmanirbhar Bharat {Self-Reliant India} campaign. The more India is capable, the more will she serve humanity; correspondingly the world will benefit more,” he added.In the backdrop of the country observing a Road Safety month between January 18 and February 17, the prime minister said road accidents were a matter of concern not just in India, but also the world over. He also said in the same context that the government’s FASTag programme had reduced idling time at toll plazas by more than half.FASTag is a radio frequency identification sticker typically fixed to a vehicle’s windscreen that allows the deduction of toll wirelessly and automatically without requiring a vehicle to stop at plazas.“Earlier, a vehicle used to take on an average seven to eight minutes to cross our toll plazas. However, since the emergence of FASTag, this time has reduced to around one and a half minutes to 2 minutes on an average. Due to this reduced waiting time at the toll plaza, fuel too is being saved. It is estimated that this will save approximately ₹21,000 crore of our countrymen,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saddened-by-insult-to-tricolour-on-r-day-pm-101612126387741.html
01-02-2021||India||Police cut off Singhu border from Capital||With increased deployment of security personnel, four-layered barricading on the main highway connecting Delhi with Haryana, and trenches dug up on the adjacent roads, the Singhu border protest site’s connectivity with the Capital remained snapped throughout Sunday, leading to disruptions in supplies and movement of people.As internet services remained suspended in and around the Singhu border protest venue – thousands are agitating against three contentious farm laws at the site – for the third consecutive day, farmers alleged that the step was taken to stop their voices from reaching the rest of the world.“It (the government) wants to spread its false spin around farmers. It is also fearful of the coordinated work of the farmers’ unions across different protest sites and is trying to cut off communication means between them. This is undemocratic and illegal,” Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of 40 farmers unions that are part of the agitation against the three contentious farm laws, said in a statement on Sunday.Also read: Ready for talks but not under pressure, says Rakesh TikaitAs per the government’s order, internet services at three borders points – Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur – were suspended from January 29 till 11pm on Sunday. The police denied allegations that the Singhu area was completely cut off, saying that movement and supplies of essential items continued through alternative routes.“As the police have blocked all the roads and sub-lanes and are not allowing us to cross over, we have not been able to use the portable toilets or the water tankers arranged by the Delhi government since yesterday (Saturday). We are now completely dependent on the toilets and water supplies of local residents,” said Dilbagh Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Sangrur, who has been running a langar at the border point, close to the police’s barricades.Questioning the cordoning off of the protest sites, the SKM said it was being done to disrupt basic supplies such as food and water. “All these various attacks of the government are recognised by us as such, and we condemn the same,” read the SKM’s statement.Apart from farmers, people travelling between Delhi and Haryana also faced problems because of the police blockade.“I have walked more than four kilometers in the fields and through the local villages just to cross the Singhu border. It’s the farmers and local residents who helped me with the alternative routes. There is police everywhere and barricades on every entry-exit point,” said Sunil Sabbharwal, who was coming to Delhi from Karnal and carrying his luggage on his head.Reacting to the farmers’ allegations, senior police officers said that while the connectivity between Delhi and the Singhu border was stopped through the main highway, they diverted the traffic and supplies of essential items through alternative routes.An officer said that the security and barricading was tightened following the conflict between the farmers and local residents witnessed on Friday and Saturday over the issue of clearing the roads, and the violence at the Red Fort and other places in Delhi on January 26.Also read: Delhi Police tracking owners of tractors that took wrong routeThe farmers’ protest at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders against the farm laws entered the 68th day on Sunday. On Republic Day, farmer groups broke through barricades, clashed with the Delhi Police and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, on its ramparts.“We have beefed up the security to avoid any further clashes between the farmers and the locals, who say that their businesses have been affected for over two months due to the agitation. Also, many protesters armed with sticks, swords, and other sharp weapons are roaming around. It is another reason why we have increased the police presence. The supplies of the farmers at the Singhu border from Delhi are being allowed through the alternative routes,” said Sanjay Singh, special commissioner of police (law and order, west zone).The crowd at the Singhu border continued swelling throughout Sunday as hundreds of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, arrived on tractors and other vehicles with ration, water, vegetables and other supplies. The protesters also ramped up vigil at the protest site and volunteers carrying sticks were seen taking regular rounds in the backdrop of Friday’s violence and Saturday’s protests by people claiming to be locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-cut-off-singhu-border-from-capital-101612125355962.html
01-02-2021||India||Ready for talks but not under pressure: Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait on Sunday sought the release of farmers who have been arrested in connection with the violence on Republic Day for a “conducive environment” to continue talks on the Centre’s three new farm laws.“We respect our Prime Minister and his initiative for talks with the farmers. But there won’t be any discussion on this issue without a conducive environment. We want our people to be released before anything else. There won’t be any agreement under pressure,” Tikait said, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that his government was just a “phone call away” for discussions with the protesting farmers.During an all-party meeting on Saturday, the PM said that the Centre’s offer to the protesting farmers of keeping the three laws in abeyance for 18 months “still stands” and that his government was “committed to reaching a solution through dialogue”.Responding over the PM’s remarks, Tikait said: “Farmers will honour the dignity of the Prime Minister, but we are also committed to safeguarding the self-respect of our brethren. The government should release them immediately to prepare a healthy environment for talks. The talks can only be held when both the government and the farmers will be on the same page. We will not hold talks under pressure.”Watch: ‘We honor PM, ready for talks but not under pressure’The Delhi Police have so far arrested over 80 people, including farmers, in connection with the violence and vandalism that took place during the farmers’ tractor march on Republic Day.On Sunday, the farm leader also met Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal at the protest site at the Ghazipur border. After the meeting, Dharmendra Malik, spokesperson of the Tikait faction of BKU, said: “Sukhbir Singh Badal had come to extend support but he was also not allowed to go on stage because our movement is completely apolitical. Many leaders from Tikri and Singhu border also came to meet him and assure him that they are with those protesting at the Ghazipur border.”Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year to demand a repeal of the laws that they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses.The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-for-talks-but-not-under-pressure-tikait-101612124776088.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||Journalist held for removing barricades at Singhu, sent to judicial custody||Delhi police on Sunday arrested freelance journalist Mandeep Punia for allegedly trying to remove barricades and obstructing officials on duty at the Singhu border. Punia, who contributes to the Caravan magazine, was sent to judicial custody for 14 days by a city court.The FIR was registered against Punia by an inspector of the city police, alleging that around 6.30pm on Saturday, a group of protesters tried to remove police barricades and reach the protest site. The FIR reads that the barricades were placed on the road after Friday’s incident, when a group of locals clashed with the farmers. Police put up the barricades to close pedestrian movement. The inspector alleged that when the protesters turned violent and mild force was used to disperse them, most of them fled but Punia assaulted a constable and then fell on the ground.Journalists’ associations criticised the police for arresting Punia, who was in Singhu to cover the farmers’ protest. A demonstration against the arrest was held at the police headquarters on Sunday. Delhi police did not issue any statement on the matter. Despite text messages and phone calls, no officer, authorised to issue a press statement on behalf of the police, offered a response.Also read: Police cut off Singhu border from CapitalSeparately, the Uttar Pradesh police registered a case at the Civil Lines police station, Lucknow, against journalist Siddharth Varadarajan for allegedly circulating a rumour regarding the death of farmer Navreet Singh during the tractor parade in Delhi on Republic Day. According to the complaint, Varadarajan, in a tweet on January 30, pointed to a article on the website he runs that claimed that the doctor who performed the post-mortem examination on Navreet told the latter’s grandfather that he saw a bullet injury. Authorities have denied the report. Varadarajan has been booked under Sections 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 505(2) (statements conducive to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code. The Uttar Pradesh police, echoing the Delhi police, said the farmer died when his tractor overturned and the post-mortem report said the cause of death was shock and haemorrhage due to a head injury.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella union of 40 farmer groups protesting at Delhi’s borders, condemned the arrest of Punia, saying the journalist and several others were held on “false and fabricated charges” and “out of fear of the rising strength of the farmers’ movement”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/journalist-held-for-removing-barricades-at-singhu-sent-to-judicial-custody-101612117464723.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||ASI files FIR in Red Fort violence, crime branch to probe the case||At 12.10pm on Tuesday, when Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials and CISF personnel were receiving the tableaux coming from the Republic Day Parade, the first group of about 200 protesters and 25 tractors tried to push their way into the Red Fort through the Lahori Gate, according to the first information report (FIR) filed by the ASI on Saturday in connection with the vandalism at the monument on January 26.On Tuesday, several groups among thousands of farmers who were camping at Delhi’s border demanding withdrawal of three new farm laws, arrived at the Red Fort without warning and in violation of the terms of their tractor rally, and clashed with police. They also allegedly inflicted extensive damage at the monument. Union tourism and culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel visited the fort on Wednesday along with the ASI director general and directed registration of an FIR.HT has seen the FIR filed by the Superintending Archaeologist of India. The FIR has been transferred to the crime branch for investigation. This was the second case filed in the incident at Red Fort, the first one was filed by the police.The FIR details the siege by the protesters, damage to the property and the response by the security forces at the Unesco World Heritage Site.According to the FIR, between 12.10pm and 1.10pm, about 300 protesters and 25 tractors tried to enter the fort thrice through the Lahori Gate but teams of Delhi police and CISF neutralised them by locking the gate.Around 1 pm, large groups of protesters on motorcycles and tractors started coming to Red Fort from the Subhash Marg. “…They then joined the mob gathered there and forced open the gate. The security personnel were completely outnumbered,” the FIR read, adding that the mob then damaged the ticket counter, door metal frame detector, and the baggage scanners.Also read: Similarities between probes into the Delhi riots, R-Day violenceThe ASI said that the mob then turned towards Lahori gate entrance, which had been “firmly secured with an iron chain and lock”.“The mob climbed over this iron door, jumped inside, and broke the chain lock with the help of iron tools they were carrying…the security personnel could not resist the mob. While doing so they broke the inner gate…Once inside a section of the mob broke the electrical fittings and the stone casing around them. A bus placed as a barricade by the CISF was also damaged,” reads the FIR.The ASI official said that three tractors managed to reach inside the fort. “…A section of the mob then charged towards the ramparts and forcefully hoisted a flag on the pole where the Prime Minister hoists the flag on Independence Day,” the FIR read.A police officer, who wished not to be named, said they have identified a man named Jugraj Singh from Tarn Taran in Punjab as the one who hoisted a farmers’ union flag and a religious flag at the fort’s ramparts. Investigators are identifying protesters from 1500 video clips.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/asi-files-fir-in-red-fort-violence-crime-branch-to-probe-the-case-101612117347073.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||The many similarities between probes into the Delhi riots, R-Day violence||As part of its case that the violence that erupted during the tractor rally by protesting farmers on Republic Day was a “pre-planned conspiracy” and not a spontaneous outburst, Delhi Police’s special cell has started probing the role played by many farmers’ leaders in the agitation against three laws passed in September to open up agriculture..Some facets such as the line of investigation, motive, the officers leading it, and the circumstances leading to the violence are strikingly similar to the probe the police launched after the Delhi riots in February 2020.At least 53 persons died, 627 were injured in the violence that started as clashes between protestors against and for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, and took a communal turn.With the Delhi riots investigation almost complete -- the police have filed charge sheets in all the cases and the cases are in court -- the officers and the units probing the 38 cases connected to Tuesday’s violence are also the same.Deputy commissioners of police from the crime branch and special cell – Joy Tirkey and Pramod Kuswah – who had led the riots probe are investigating Tuesday’s violence too.Also read: Delhi Police tracking owners of tractors that took wrong route In the Delhi riots, 698 cases of rioting and violence were probed by local police, the crime branch probed 57 cases (all 53 murders and a few cases of heinous rioting) and the special cell investigated one case of an alleged conspiracy behind the violence.In the Delhi Republic Day violence, of the 38 cases, 28 are of rioting and vandalism, which are being probed by the local police; ten cases in which the most violence took place, such as the incidents in Red Fort and the Income Tax Office area, are with the crime branch, and the one case of the alleged conspiracy is with the special cell.In both the special cell cases of the riots and Tuesday’s violence, the cases have been registered under stringent sections of the sedition law and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention_ Act).There is another similarity. In the Delhi riots case, the accused were some prominent Anti-CAA protesters who were on the streets in the weeks leading to the riots. In the riots charge sheets, police linked the role of the accused right from December 2019, when the citizenship law was passed.In Tuesday’s violence, the police are probing the role of prominent faces of the farmers’ protest – leaders such as Darshan Lal, Rakesh Tikait and Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu -- from September, when the three farm laws were passed by Parliament.The motive behind the pre-planned violence, according to a Delhi police statement on Thursday, was also similar to what police had said was the one for the Delhi riots.In the statement, the police said its preliminary assessment suggested that there was a “pre-conceived and well-coordinated plan” to engage in violence and “create an international embarrassment for the government on the occasion of Republic Day.”Similarly, police in their charge sheets filed in the riots cases said that the violence in northeast Delhi in February 2020 had been planned to coincide with then US President Donald Trump’s official visit to India to create an international embarrassment for India and defame the country.Arrested suspects such as former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Umar Khalid and student activist Devangana Kalita, currently in jail, have denied the allegations.On Friday afternoon, Delhi police issued a public notice asking journalists and citizens to come forward and submit statements or videos of the Republic Day violence. It was similar to the notice the police issued in the aftermath of the February 2020 riots.Also read: Thousands converge in western UP farmers' stirPolice had on March 11 issued a similar notice seeking videos of the riots, apart from many other types of evidence such as statements of protected witnesses and WhatsApp chat records.A Delhi police officer, privy to the investigation of the Republic Day violence. said on condition of anonymity: “Like the CAA protests, the mobilization at the anti-CAA protest sites happened over WhatsApp messages. Provocative statements were made at those sites after which the riots happened. In the farmers’ protest too, we have many people who heard the farmer leaders making such statements. In the riots cases, many protected witnesses had heard the accused persons making such provocative speeches. Such witnesses will be an important part of the investigation.”Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava had on Wednesday evening said that a night before the violence, police had an inkling that “aggressive and militant people” were taking control of the stage at the protest sites and giving provocative speeches. The top cop did not specify how police had the inkling or who had witnessed or heard the provocative speeches.A second Delhi police officer, not directly connected with the investigation of the violence, said: “Boss (Commissioner) did not specify who had heard or seen those leaders. Maybe it could be the police personnel at the protest sites, insiders from the intelligence wing, or insiders who work for the police and help pass on information. If police manage to get such witnesses, get their statements recorded before a judge, then it is crucial evidence in this case too.”Last week, the farmers’ leaders had caught a man and accused him of being a mole planted by the Haryana police.There is a coincidence too.On Friday afternoon, when a clash between two groups of protesters -- farmers and those protesting against the farmers -- led to stone-throwing and clashes -- many residents of villages around the Singhu border said they were reminded of the evening before the Delhi 2020 riots, when two groups of protesters -- one supporting the Citizenship law and those against it -- had clashed below the Jafrabad metro station. This clash was the start of Delhi riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/the-many-similarities-between-probes-into-the-delhi-riots-r-day-violence-101612117345393.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||Farmers leaders take steps to ‘revive’ agitation||Farmer groups leading the protests against the three contentious farm laws have taken several measures to keep the agitation going after the tractor parade on Republic Day ended in violence. These include district and village-level ‘mahapanchayat’, door-to-door visits, announcements in every lane and street, appeals from the loudspeakers at temples, mosques and gurdwaras and WhatsApp groups to disseminate information and curb rumours.The measures, farm leaders said, will help “revive” the protest, which met a rude jolt after the Republic Day incident.Several farmer groups joined the protesters at Ghazipur on Sunday where the Ghaziabad administration served an eviction notice to the protesters on Thursday. People from all age groups were seen arriving in the hundreds in convoys of cars and tractors throughout the day despite police blocking many routes leading to the site.Among them was Ranveer Rathi, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar who had arrived at the protest site after attending a mahapanchayat organised to garner support for Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait) leader Rakesh Tikait. “I have come here with a group of hundred farmers and a sea of people is on their way to the Delhi-UP border to avenge the tears of Rakesh Tikait… And, this time it’s a matter of farmers’ pride now. We are making sure that at least one person from each and every family in our village should come here and tell the government that they can’t pressure us to vacate this protest site. It is our home now,” he said.Also read: Punjab CM calls all-party meet tomorrow over farmers’ stirOn Thursday, Rakesh Tikait burst into tears while speaking to the media and accused the Centre of hatching conspiracy against the agitating farmers at the Delhi borders.Like Rathi, many others have arrived to support the movement after attending panchayats being organised in their villages. Vinod Gujjar, a farmer from Saharanpur, said that they are also organising door-to-door campaigns in their villages to mobilise maximum people. “We have divided farmers into small groups and assigned them to work to create awareness among farmers back home. With mics and speakers, they are going street-to-street, making announcements inviting farmers to the border. This is the time to show our unity,” he said.A large section of protesters, who have arrived in the last three days, are young. Robin, 26, who has come from Baghpat said, “I can’t forget the day when my uncle’s body arrived wrapped in a Tricolour from Kashmir a few years back. And they call us “anti-nationals”. The government had conspired the January 26 incident to break our protest but it has fallen into its own trap. Our movement is now stronger like never before.”Those who arrived on Sunday were also seen bringing food, water, ropes, and tents with them. Many new langars also sprung up at the protest site on Sunday. Puran Singh, who belongs to Udhham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand, said, “We have called five more cooks from our village to prepare langar since we have more people to feed .”With mobile internet connection continuing to remain weak at the protest site on Sunday, many protesters were seen walking miles in search of a network. Braham Chaudhary, a farmer from Meerut, said, “We have created WhatsApp groups to send correct real time information to our people back home. We can’t let them get wrong information from social media and get disheartened. We will have to keep them motivated.”Hukle Chawdhary, who claimed to be over 100 years old, from Loni district remained a centre of attraction at the protest site on Sunday. “I have not worked in the fields throughout my life to see my fellow farmer brother breaking down like that… Ab ladai aar-paar ki hai,” he said.‘100 missing’Samyukta Kisan Morcha leaders on Sunday said over 100 persons were missing after the Republic Day tractor rally. Even as 84 persons were arrested in connection with the violence, farmers alleged that many other protesters have been “illegally detained” by the police and information about them is not being shared with their families or the leaders.Special commissioner of police (crime) Praveer Ranjan said, “These allegations are not true. The details of every person arrested so far in the violence are available.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-leaders-take-steps-to-revive-agitation-101612117284749.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||Fresh fervour at Tikri, even as protesters keep watch for trouble||From early Sunday morning, dozens of tractors, trucks and buses lined up on the Haryana side of the Tikri border, unloading scores of supporters, mostly women, who came in to join the protesters in the Capital.Hundreds walked several kilometres to reach the protest site, singing folk songs, waving the tricolour and raising slogans to encourage the movement, which gained fresh impetus a few days ago, even as it looked like petering out after the violence in Delhi on Republic Day.However, the renewed show of support, mostly from villages in Haryana and Punjab, was tinged with tension, with farmer leaders on stage imploring participants to avoid crossing over to the Capital’s side of the border, as news began to spread of Delhi Police making arrests in connection with the January 26 clashes, when the protesters’ tractor rally descended into chaos, culminating in several farmers storming the Red Fort.“We request our farmer brothers to stay at the protest site and not cross over to Delhi. Many of our supporters have been arrested by the police blaming them falsely of inciting violence on January 26. We know our demands are valid and we will win this battle,” said Chaudhary Raman Singh Pradhan, a member of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a farmers’ union.Chandra Devi, 72, who reached the Tikri protest site on Sunday afternoon from Sundarpur in Haryana, said eight of her family members have been protesting against the three farm laws at Delhi’s borders for over a month. On Sunday, three women and eight children from her family also joined in.Also read: Police cut off Singhu border from Capital“Mothers from Haryana and Punjab have been sending their sons to fight for the country [in the armed forces] for years. We do not need to prove our patriotism and dedication for our country to this government or to anyone,” she said.Phoolvanti Devi, 88, from Bahadurgarh, said if the farmers had to cause unrest in Delhi, they would not have waited two months.“From teenagers to senior citizens, people across ages have been camping here for over two months. Why would we cause unrest now? If they agree to our demands and repeal the three farm laws, all of these borders will be empty the very next day. In our village, if children get stubborn and throw tantrums, mothers box their ears and punish them — this government also needs that,” said Phoolvanti.Protesters at the site have also stepped up vigil since Friday, after a group claiming to be “local residents” gathered near the protest site, demanding that the farmers be evicted. They have been taking turns to guard the entry to the main stage area throughout the day.“They said they [Friday’s counter-protesters] are locals, but how is it possible that all these locals from around Tikri, Ghazipur and Singhu suddenly decided to gather with the demand of evicting the protestors on the same day. It is clear this was organised by forces that do not want the farmers to continue their protests,” said Chaudhary Rohtas Singh, a farmer who joined the protests on Saturday from Sirsa in Haryana.Singh said that after watching Bharatiya Kisan Union (BJU) leader Rakesh Tikait break down before the media on Friday, he decided to take a bus to Delhi.“My mother saw the television and cried and said ‘Beta, kisan toh haar gaya’ (Farmers have lost). I told my mother we will not allow that to happen and took the bus the next morning,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fresh-fervour-at-tikri-even-as-protesters-keep-watch-for-trouble-101612117104866.html
