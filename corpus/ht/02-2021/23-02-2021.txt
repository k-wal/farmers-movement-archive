Ravi was arrested on February 13.Also Read | There is undeclared Emergency in India: Sanjay Raut on Disha Ravi arrestThe police sought her custody again yesterday saying they want to confront Ravi with other accused in the case - activists Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk.

23-02-2021||India||‘Actor on tractor’: Union minister Pralhad Joshi questions Rahul Gandhi over APMC, farm law||Union minister for parliamentary affairs Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday questioned Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over the absence of agricultural produce market committee (APMC) in Kerala and the new law concerting farmers in Punjab. Joshi also accused the Congress leader and Left parties of hypocrisy ahead of polls in five states and a Union territory.The senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader’s remarks come a day after Gandhi held a tractor rally in his constituency in Kerala’s Wayanad against the Centre’s three new farm laws. “Rahul Gandhi is trying to become 'actor on tractor'. If you are in favour of APMC, then, why is there no APMC in Kerala,” news agency ANI quoted minister Joshi as saying.Also read | Rahul Gandhi targets Centre, says it is imposing its will and power on judiciaryJoshi also pointed that a new law brought by the Congress government in Punjab can potentially send a farmer behind bars. “Rahul Gandhi, your government in Punjab has brought a law under which a farmer who breaks the agreement. He could be sent to jail,” the minister said during a press conference in Kerala’s capital of Thiruvananthapuram.Similar comments were made by Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on February 6 during his address in the Rajya Sabha. “Punjab Contract Farming Act provides for jail and fine up to ₹5 lakh for the farmers. In the act made by the government of India, the farmer can come out of contract farming at any time,” Tomar had said in the Upper House.Gandhi, busy with political rallies in poll-bound Kerala and Puducherry, had attacked the Centre on Monday. “These three [farm] laws are designed to destroy the agriculture system in the country and give the entire business to two or three friends of PM Modi,” he had said.Joshi also asked Gandhi to clarify his position on why the Congress party has a different alliance in different states and said politics is not just for grabbing power and having "some alliance here and some alliance there,"“The Left Democratic Front (LDF) and United Democratic Front (UDF) are fighting in Kerala. 'Kushti' in Kerala, 'dosti' in Delhi and other places. See the hypocrisy of these parties. TMC chief Mamata Banerjee is supporting Congress in Delhi but not doing the same in West Bengal as Congress has become a liability on various regional parties," Joshi.Also read | When will petrol and diesel prices drop? Oil minister Pradhan weighs in"Hypocrisy of the Left is that they are supporting Congress in Delhi, West Bengal. They (Congress and Left) are friends in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu also. You don't want to believe Politburo in Kerala but you choose to do in West Bengal: I ask Rahul Gandhi do you believe in democracy or hypocrisy,” he said.Kerala, along with West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, is scheduled to hold assembly elections in April-May. Leaders of the Congress and BJP have been paying visits to the southern state ahead of the polls. Gandhi is in Kerala to attend a programme to mark the culmination of padayatra being undertaken by state Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and other programmes on February 22 and 23.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has also visited the state and had flagged off the BJP's Vijaya Yatra from Kasaragod last week. Other BJP national leaders will also be in Kerala to attend the Vijaya Yatra rally in various districts. Union home minister Amit Shah will attend the concluding session of the rally on March 7 in Thiruvananthapuram.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-on-tractor-union-minister-pralhad-joshi-questions-rahul-gandhi-101614075036444.html
23-02-2021||India||In bail plea, Nodeep Kaur claims she was 'beaten and tortured' by police||Labour rights activist Nodeep Kaur in her bail plea before the Punjab and Haryana High Court has claimed that she was severely beaten up at a police station after her arrest by the Sonipat police last month.The 23-year-old activist, hailing from Punjab's Muktsar district, has also claimed that her medical examination was not conducted in violation of section 54 of the Criminal Procedure Code.Kaur is currently lodged in Karnal jail in Haryana.The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Monday had adjourned the hearing on her bail plea and posted the matter for February 24.In the bail plea filed through her counsels Arshdeep Singh Cheema and Harinder Deep Singh Bains, Kaur stated that she was falsely arraigned as accused in an FIR lodged under various sections, including 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC.In her petition, the labour rights activist claimed that she was "targeted and falsely implicated" in the case as she was successful in generating massive support for the ongoing farmer movement against the Centre's three new farm laws.Kaur, who is a member of the Majdoor Adhikar Sangathan, said they mobilized people for a protest at Kundli in Sonipat district against Centre's new farm laws.The plea alleged that the mobilisation of local labourers in support of farmers annoyed the administration and a plan was devised to stifle the protest.The bail plea stated that on January 12, the petitioner and MAS members marched towards a factory for demanding payment of pending wages of some workers.The high court was informed that they were manhandled by a group formed by the Kundli Industrial Area, an association of industrial owners.In the meantime, a team from Kundli police station led by the station house officer reached there and immediately on their arrival, they grabbed the petitioner by her hair and dragged to the side, according to the plea.This angered the protesters and the situation became worse when the police resorted to lathi charge on peaceful protesters. A scuffle ensued and the petitioner tried to pacify the situation but to no avail, it said.The petitioner alone was caught and arrested by police officials. She was beaten, tortured and suffered multiple injuries, it claimed.The petitioner was taken to the police station in the absence of any woman police official and was beaten up by police officials, the plea alleged.Kaur was arrested in Haryana's Sonipat on January 12, the Haryana police had earlier said.Sonepat police officials had also said that a police team was attacked with sticks when they reached the site and some policemen sustained injuries in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bail-plea-nodeep-kaur-claims-she-was-beaten-and-tortured-by-police-101614073439736.html

The condition of the farmers continues to deteriorate. It is Kejriwal who speaks the language of middlemen," said Lekhi.The BJP leader reiterated that Kejriwal wishes that the farmer keeps committing suicide, should never get a better price for their crops and their condition continue to worsen."The farm laws have been brought out to exclude middlemen and their corrupt practices. However, Kejriwal ji opts to speak in favour of these middlemen. I do not think that he is working in our country's interest or in the interest of the farmers.

23-02-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi targets Centre, says it is imposing its will and power on judiciary||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi once again targeted the central government on Tuesday and accused it of imposing its will and power on the judiciary in Delhi. Gandhi also said that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government is "not allowing the judiciary to be or do what it must." "Not just courts, they do not allow discussions in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha either and drop elected governments repeatedly," Gandhi said in Mallapuram."For the first time, winning the election means losing and vice-versa," the Congress leader, who is on a two-day visit to poll-bound Kerala, said.Gandhi’s comments come a day after Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy resigned after falling short of the majority in the assembly. The Narayanasamy government lost the majority after five Congress and one Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) legislators resigned. Since 2019, Congress has lost power similarly in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.It also comes in the backdrop of farmers' protests continuing for more than two months now. The farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are agitating against the contentious farm laws which were passed by the voice vote in Parliament in September last year amid uproar by opposition.The central government has projected the laws as "historic reforms" in the agriculture sector that will work in favour of farmers by removing middlemen and giving them the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, farmers fear that it will put them at the mercy of the big corporates and will remove the Minimum Support Price (MSP).Earlier in the day, Gandhi had slammed the government for its plans to privatise railways. Terming it as a "threat to millions of poor people who travel using our railways", Gandhi said, "It is also going to create a problem for millions of employees who work for the Railways.""Railways are a fundamental part of our country. Railways do not belong to one person, they belong to the whole country. It allows millions of people to travel cheaply...I noticed in the last Budget that the government is intent on privatising this Indian asset," he also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-targets-centre-says-it-is-imposing-its-will-and-power-on-judiciary-101614070974894.html
23-02-2021||India||Toolkit case: Delhi court to rule on Disha Ravi's bail plea today||A Delhi court is likely to pronounce its verdict on Tuesday on the bail plea of climate activist Disha Ravi, arrested by the Delhi Police in connection with the toolkit case. The Delhi Police allege that the online document was created to defame India and spread misinformation among people.Earlier in the day, Ravi was brought to the Delhi Police Cyber Cell office to be confronted with the two other suspects -- Shantanu Muluk and Nikita Jacob. Both are now out on transit bail and police say they may arrest them again if need be.On February 21, the court heard the arguments during which police have Ravi's bail plea vehemently, while her counsel has rubbished all the charges levelled against her.During the hearing, the judge asked the police whether there is evidence that proves the link between the tool kit and Republic-Day violence in Delhi. Additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju, appearing on behalf of the Delhi Police, replied that the document will have to be read along with the hashtags and links it contained, which were meant to "instigate people asking them to come on streets thus resulting in public disorder". The police further said that they have arrested seven people and an investigation is on."The toolkit says that people should join the march of Republic Day. Police gave permission for the march and if I call people to join the march, then can I be called seditious?" Ravi’s counsel asked while rejecting the allegations of instigating violence.The 22-year-old Ravi used to volunteer for Fridays for Future (FFF), an organisation founded by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. She used to help with the organisation's event management work in Bengaluru. The document was first publicised by Thunberg on Twitter.Ravi was arrested on February 13 night along with two other activists. The police have claimed that the toolkit was in support of the farmers’ agitation against the three contentious laws and created with an aim to spread misinformation and incite unrest. Police also alleged a link between the tool kit and the clashes that occurred in the national capital on Republic Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-delhi-court-to-rule-on-disha-ravi-s-bail-plea-today-101614065589425.html
