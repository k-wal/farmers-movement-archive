26-02-2021||Lucknow||No ‘ghar wapsi’ for farmers till farm laws are repealed: Jayant Chaudhary||Defying the ban on holding a large gathering, the leaders of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) held a 'kisan panchayat' (a farmers congregation) in Sampurnanagar in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district on Thursday. RLD national vice president Jayant Chaudhary hit out at the Central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing hundreds of farmers at the panchayat and claimed that farmers will not end protests unless the three contentious farm laws were repealed."If the government felt the farmers would retreat during summers or wheat harvesting season, it was mistaken. ...There will be no 'ghar wapsi' for farmers till the three anti-farmers laws are repealed,” Jayant said.Ravi Verma, national general secretary of Samajwadi Party and former Kheri MP and Congress leader Saif Ali Naqvi also shared the stage.Chaudhary also attacked Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh and alleged that the ruling party leaders were making a “mockery” of the farmers’ agitation with no sympathy shown to their “rightful” demands. Referring to PM Modi’s ‘andolanjeevi’ jibe on the “culture of protests”, he said, the statement indicated an insensitive approach of the government towards farmers.Jayant claimed that the agitation against the farm reform laws was the first grassroots movement of the farmers which was above any caste and creed and any attempt to divide the farmers will prove futile.Farmers have been protesting at the different borders of the national capital since November last year, against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They claim the laws will take away the ‘mandi’ system and the minimum support prices (MSP), guaranteed by the government for their produce, and also make them vulnerable to exploitation at the hands of the corporate. The government has, however, termed the laws as necessary reforms needed to unlock the sector’s potential for modernisation and growth while increasing farmers’ income.Also Read: Farmers union writes to President demanding end to 'repression' on protestersChaudhary said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat in 2011, he had written a letter to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, demanding a law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) to the farmers. “Now, when Modi is the PM, he has no intention to fulfil his own old demand,” Jayant said.Hitting out at Yogi Adityanath, the RLD leader said, “Around three and a half years back, Yogi government formed a Kisan Samriddhi Ayog but not even a single meeting of the Ayog had taken place so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-ghar-wapsi-for-farmers-till-farm-laws-are-repealed-jayant-chaudhary-101614310516383.html

They have also demanded a review of the provisions of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The traders’ body has said that all commercial markets across the country will remain shut following their ‘Bharat Bandh’ call.The All India Transporters Welfare Association (AITWA) has extended support to the nationwide strike and has said that it will hold a road blockade. Farm unions protesting against the Centre's agricultural laws will also participate in the strike peacefully, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) said in a statement.Apart from agitating against the rising fuel price, transporters have demanded the scrapping of e-way bill laws. It is the permit that they are required to carry while moving goods from one place to another. Following a recent amendment in the GST laws, the validity of the bill has narrowed and increased to 200km per day from 100km earlier. Penalties for a truck carrying a consignment with an expired e-way bill, or with an erroneous e-way bill amount to 200% of the tax value, or 100% of the invoice value under Section 129 of CGST act, 2017.The participants will stage sit-in demonstrations in more than 1,500 towns and cities across states. Several services across the country are likely to be affected as more than 40,000 traders' associations are taking part in the bandh. Private transport facilities may also be hit as the AITWA has asked all transport companies to park their vehicles between 6am and 8pm as a mark of protest. Booking and movement of bill-oriented goods will also be hit. Also, as a symbol of protest, no traders will log in to the GST portal.Chartered accountants and tax advocates’ associations have also backed the strike. Women entrepreneurs, small industries, hawkers, among others, will also join the bandh, CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal has said. Essential services like medical shops, milk, vegetable shops, etc are, however, expected to remain unaffected. Banks are also likely to operate without any disruptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transport-trade-unions-call-for-bharat-bandh-farmers-unions-to-join-101614307042309.html
