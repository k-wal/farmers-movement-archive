In early December, a few weeks into the agitation, Trudeau had backed the protests and said that Ottawa has conveyed its concerns about the protest by Indian farmers to New Delhi. Trudeau had said that Canada will always be there to defend the rights of peaceful protests and expressed concern over the situation. MEA was quick to dismiss his remarks as “unwarranted” as they pertained to the country’s internal affairs.Last week, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said Trudeau had made a comment on the issues related to the farmers and it was conveyed to Canada that such remarks pertaining to the internal affairs of India are "unwarranted" and "unacceptable"."On farmer protest, PM Trudeau commended efforts of the Government of India to choose the path of dialogue as befitting a democracy," MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in a weekly press briefing.The Canadian prime minister also acknowledged the responsibility of his government in providing protection to Indian diplomatic personnel and premises in Canada, the MEA spokesperson said.The statement from MEA comes two days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trudeau held a telephonic conversation on Wednesday and covered a range of issues including the coronavirus crisis. A readout issued by Trudeau's office on the telephonic talks mentioned that the farmer protests figured in the discussions, though the Indian statement had not mentioned it. "The leaders discussed Canada and India's commitment to democratic principles, recent protests, and the importance of resolving issues through dialogue," the Canadian readout said. It mentioned several other issues discussed by the two prime ministers.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at three border points on the outskirts of Delhi demanding the repeal of the three contentious farm laws cleared by Parliament in September last year.The talks between the farmers and the government have largely been inconclusive and remain in a state of deadlock as the farmers insist on a complete repeal of the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-farmers-protest-canada-s-trudeau-commended-india-s-efforts-says-mea-101613137835167.html

Gandhi, currently on a two-day visit to Rajasthan, also termed their protests as ‘agitation of India’ during his speech at Sri Ganganagar.“The day farm laws get implemented business of 40% people, of ₹40 lakh crore, of businessmen, vendors, farmers and workers, will go into hands of just two people. This isn't farmers' agitation but the agitation of India. Farmers have shown the light in the darkness,” news agency ANI quoted Gandhi as saying.Also read | Rahul Gandhi attacks PM Modi over China border pactThe Congress leader’s ‘just two people’ remark comes a day after he tweeted “A government of ‘Hum Do, Hamare Do (We two, ours two)’ !” on Thursday.Earlier in the day, the Congress MP made similar comments while addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Rajasthan’s Pilibanga. “Forty per cent of India’s population runs this business in the country. These include farmers, labourers, small shopkeepers, businessmen and arthiyas. Congress has always tried to ensure that the business is never controlled by just one person,” Gandhi said.He also urged the Centre to take back the three farm laws and then talk to the farmers over the issue. “Modi Ji says that we want to speak with farmers, what do you want to talk about? Repeal the laws, farmers will speak with you. You (PM) are taking away their land, future and then you want to talk. Take back laws first, then talk,” Gandhi said at Pilibanga, news agency ANI reported.Watch | Rahul Gandhi says ‘PM Modi gave Indian territory to China'Eleven rounds of negotiations between the farmers and the government have taken place but no agreement has been reached.

12-02-2021||India||Twitter blocks 97% of accounts, posts flagged by IT Ministry||Twitter has blocked over 97% of the accounts and posts flagged by the IT Ministry for provocative content and misinformation around farmers' protest, sources said.This followed a meeting between Twitter representatives and the Information Technology Secretary on Wednesday evening where the US-based microblogging platform was issued a stern warning to comply with local laws or be prepared for action.The Ministry had questioned Twitter's delay in taking action on its order to block provocative content that could impact public law and order, whereas the American company had been quick to crack down when a similar instance occurred at US Capitol Hill.According to the sources, Twitter has now complied with the orders and over 97% of the accounts flagged have been blocked.Twitter did not respond to queries on the matter.On February 4, Twitter was asked to take down 1,178 accounts with links to Pakistan and Khalistan supporters that were spreading misinformation and provocative content related to farmers' protest.Prior to that, the government had sought blocking of 257 tweets and handles in connection with the agitation by farmers over the new agricultural laws. Twitter had complied with the orders only to restore the accounts hours later.Twitter on Wednesday morning had said it has suspended over 500 accounts and blocked access to several others within India, but maintained that it would not block accounts of "news media entities, journalists, activists and politicians" as doing so "would violate their fundamental right to free expression" guaranteed under the country's law.It, however, yielded to the orders later after the crucial meeting on Wednesday evening.In a statement after the meeting, IT Ministry had stated that the microblogging platform had been asked to take strong action against "well-coordinated" campaigns "designed to create disharmony and unrest" in the country.Monique Meche, Twitter Vice President Global Public Policy and Jim Baker, Deputy General Counsel and Vice President Legal, had affirmed Twitter's commitment towards following Indian laws and rules.The executives had also requested for better engagement between the Indian government and the company's global team. Sources said Twitter's latest move to block the flagged accounts is itself a validation that the government's orders were backed by sound reasoning and logic.The government had made it clear that it will not negotiate with the platforms while insisting on compliance with its orders as it believed that a private commercial entity in India cannot unilaterally decide on public law and order, ignoring the democratic values of the country.IT Ministry was of the view that Twitter, being an intermediary, was required to take immediate action after receiving the government's notice to block handles, but did not move with haste to take down "atrocious" hashtags and "incendiary" content even amid a volatile situation.IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had recently emphasised that the government is all for freedom of speech and expression and that it remains investor-friendly, but disrespecting democratic values is not acceptable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-blocks-97-of-accounts-posts-flagged-by-it-ministry-101613121276706.html
12-02-2021||India||Rakesh Tikait warns farmers' protest will go on for indefinite period||Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait on Friday said the ongoing farmers' protest will go on for indefinite period as there is no planning regarding the duration yet."Farmers' protest will go on for indefinite period as there is no plan currently. It might continue till October," Tikait told ANI.He said this in response to the statement of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Gurnam Singh Charni that the farmers' protest will continue till October.Tikait had earlier warned the farmers' agitation will not conclude unless government repeals the three newly enacted agriculture laws and it may go on till October.On Friday he mentioned that the farmers do a protest every year on October 2 at the Ghazipur border."Tear shells and bullets were fired at the farmers on October 2, 2018, at the Ghazipur border. Every year we do a programme here at the Ghazipur border and will also do it this year," he said.Asked about the debates in the Parliament on the farmers' issues, Tikait said it is good that the issue is being raised and debated in the Parliament.He further said there must be a genuine reason that the country's farmers are protesting for so long."The entire nation's farmers are on streets protesting, there must be a reason to it. If the farm laws are not accepted by the farmers, then what is the compulsion of not repealing them?" Tikait asked.He agreed with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's remark of 'Hum do hamare do' as he believed that it truly seemed like only four people are running the country.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-warns-farmers-protest-will-go-on-for-indefinite-period-101613116200231.html
12-02-2021||India||Supreme Court issues notice to Twitter, Centre over regulation of content||The Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to Central government and Twitter on a PIL filed by BJP leader Vinit Goenka seeking regulation of content on social media platforms.Goenka has asked for directions for devising a mechanism to check fake news and instigative messages circulated via social media, especially Twitter. The plea also seeks a crackdown on ‘anti-India messages’ and those attempting to trigger violence in the country by spreading ‘venomous’ messages.The court has tagged Goenka's matter with a bunch of similar petitions already pending before the apex court.The SC notices come amid a continuing face off between Twitter and the Central government over more than 1,300 social media accounts or posts in connection with the farmers’ protest and the violence on January 26 deemed ‘inflammatory’ by the government.Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday warned social media platforms including Twitter of strict action for not cracking down on alleged inflammatory content, saying they have to fully comply with the country's law.He said differential treatment of incidents on Capitol Hill and the Red Fort was not justified. He added that while the government was committed to freedom of media and rights of individuals but it was equally concerned about safety, security, and law and order in the country."Please don't spread enmity, violence and misinformation. Please follow the Constitution of India and the law of the land," he said replying to a question in Rajya Sabha.On Wednesday, his ministry had expressed displeasure at Twitter for failing to remove all of the over 1,300 accounts and posts it had flagged. The government was riled after Twitter in a public blog post said it has taken down only half of the accounts and posts flagged by the government.The Constitution of India guarantees freedom of speech but Article 19 (2) also says that it is subject to reasonable restrictions because of the "sovereignty and integrity" of India.Prasad said that while social media platforms have their own self-regulatory mechanism to check and evaluate inflammatory content, that does not mean they will not follow the Indian rules.Asked about steps taken by the government to check the spread of misinformation on social media, he said "We have recently flagged Twitter" on the issue.His ministry officials are in talks with Twitter on the issue.Prasad also said that the government respected the good work and the foreign investment the social media giants bring into the country but the laws of the country had to be respected.On the protection of privacy of the individuals of the country on social media, he said the government is working on new guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-issues-notice-to-twitter-centre-over-regulation-of-content-101613113545544.html

12-02-2021||Delhi||Coolers, fans, shade: Protesters at borders prepare a summer plan||Tarpaulin tents at the Capital’s borders will soon be replaced with mosquito nets, fans and coolers will replace the braziers and fireplaces, while water coolers will outnumber water tankers as farmers protesting against the three new farm laws at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri began to chalk out plans for the summer, as concerns began to emerge among union leaders that the heat may force crowds away. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department had on Wednesday said winter was on its way out as temperatures in the Capital begin their steady rise.Mannu Tyagi, a member of the Bhartiya Kisan Union who has been camping at Ghazipur, said coolers and fans have already been ordered. “We expect them to arrive by the end of this month. Other items we may need for the summer are also being purchased. All arrangements will be made to minimise the discomfort to protesters, so that the agitation continues without any hurdle,” Tyagi said.Farmers unions at Ghazipur have also placed orders for water coolers, mosquito nets, plastic sheets and summer tents, protesters aware of the matter said.On Thursday, announcements were made from the stage at the Ghazipur border, assuring protesters that steps are being taken to prepare the protest site for summer. “All of us need to keep the movement going. Don’t worry about the weather —the Kisan Ekta Morcha is all set to make arrangements for summers. We faced problems in winters, but came together overcame it,” the speaker said.Mahender Pal Singh, 44, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar, who came to Ghazipur border after January 26, said they are planning to remove the tarpaulin covering their tent. “These sheets can be replaced with mosquito nets and we will sleep under the sky. During the day, desert coolers and fans will keep us cool. We are planning to go home and return with pedestal fans and coolers. We will also bring our summer clothes,” Singh said.Rajbir Singh, a farmer from Baghpat said a shade will be erected to protect protesters from the sun. “Water coolers and ice will be so that everyone gets cold water. Drinks will be served to keep the agitators hydrated. More water will also have to be arranged,” he said.The organisers said they are also in touch with gurdwara committees to arrange for the amenities needed to keep the movement going during the summers.Farmers at Singhu border also said if the government does not repeal the farmers, they will make arrangements for summers from March.Daniel Moosa, an independent farmer from Patiala, Punjab, said if they need to continue the protest longer they are planning to set up shades. “We cannot have a sit-in protest under the sun. We will need shades. We are also planning to bring in more get generators to run the fans and coolers uninterrupted, in case the government disconnects the power supply. Our farmer leaders keep holding meetings. They are also planning to install solar panels to save cost of running generators,” said Moosa, who has been camping at Singhu border November 26 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/10000-coolers-5-000-fans-water-coolers-and-sunshades-to-keep-the-agitators-cool-101613067260877.html
