When crowds gather governments get changed," he told the farmers' gathering.Farmers, mostly from Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at Delhi's borders since November 28 last year demanding rollback of the laws."They (the government) should know if farmers can destroy their own produce, then you are nothing before them," Tikait said."There are many questions, it is not only the farm laws, but the electricity (amendment) bill, the seed bill… what kind of laws do they want to bring?" he asked and slammed the government for rise in prices of diesel and petrol.Tikait said that this agitation is not just of farmers, but also of the poor, daily wagers and other sections."These laws will destroy the poor. This is not just one law, many more laws like these will come," he said.Referring to the farmer leaders spearheading the agitation, the BKU leader also reiterated that the government will have to talk to the same committee of 40 members.The government has held 11 rounds of negotiation with protesting unions and these have remained inconclusive with regard to rollback of the laws.The agitation against the laws at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is being led by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which is an umbrella body of 40 farmer unions. Tikait said this stir will go on and farmers will work in their fields simultaneously.Demanding a law on minimum support price (MSP) for farmers, he said, "When a law on MSP will be framed, farmers will be protected. This stir is about that, this is about rights of farmers." Tikait had recently said farmers will not return home till the farm laws are repealed and had added that farmers should be ready to sacrifice their standing crop for it.The unions are protesting against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The three farm laws, enacted in September last year, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-crowds-gather-governments-get-changed-bku-leader-rakesh-tikait-101613998443175.html

22-02-2021||India||BJP resolution lauds agri laws, Covid fight||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday passed a political resolution hailing the passage of the new agriculture laws, which it said are aimed at improving the lot of farmers and increasing their income even as the Opposition has rallied around an agitation demanding the legislation’s repeal.The resolution, passed at the end of a daylong national office bearers’ meeting addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, also praised the Union government’s response to the Covid pandemic, its economic management amid a global slump and efforts at ensuring the passage of new farm and labour laws.The resolution also made a pointed reference to the India-China standoff along the LAC and said, “India will not let any expansionist strategy succeed on its borders. Under the leadership of PM Modi, India has proved this at every given opportunity.”Also Read | BKU Ugrahan appeals to Punjab farmers to reach Delhi border in large numbers for February 27 rallyEarlier, addressing the national officer bearers and state unit presidents, Modi said the party’s mission and organisation were not only aimed at securing power but at ensuring development for all.National general secretary Bhupendra Yadav told the media, “He (the PM) said there is a positive mood in the country, so work should be undertaken keeping in mind the mantra of nation first.”The party commended the government’s Covid-19 response, and in the resolution said while the world was “speculating over how India with its vast population and limited health care infrastructure” would face the challenge, it can be “said with pride that India not only defeated Covid under the able, sensitive, committed and visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, but also infused in all its citizens the confidence to build an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.”While the Opposition had questioned the nationwide lockdown announced on March 24 and accused the government of announcing it without any preparation, the resolution referred to the government’s call as a “decision that will be remembered in history as the prime example of the sensitivity of a welfare government committed to public good.”The resolution also made a specific mention of the Gareeb Kalyan package of ₹1.70 lakh crore announced within 48 hours of the imposition of the lockdown, efforts made to develop indigenous vaccines, and the government’s resolve of building an Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India).The passage of the agriculture laws, drafting of the national education policy, merger of public sector banks, and curbs on financial irregularities were described as reformative steps undertaken by the government.The BJP, gearing up for electoral battles in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry, blamed the Congress and the Left parties of “trying to mislead the farmers about the farm laws”.The party’s performances in local body elections in a clutch of states and the Bihar victory were hailed.A specific reference was made to the local elections in Jammu and Kashmir. “…In the first local elections held after the removal of Article 370 it was democracy that won. The first District Development Council elections held in J&K shattered many myths. Ignoring terrorists and separatists, people fearlessly reposed faith in democracy,” the resolution said.The meeting was attended by national office bearers, state unit presidents, in-charges of election-bound states and national and state general secretaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-resolution-lauds-agri-laws-covid-fight-101613953911657.html
