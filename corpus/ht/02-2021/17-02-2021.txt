Speaking at an interaction with students of Bharathidasan Government College for Women in Puducherry, Gandhi reacted to climate activist Disha Ravi's arrest and said that the nation's character was being destroyed as people were not being allowed to talk."Maybe I'll get arrested for saying this... if you're shutting up the nation and frightening people and not allowing them to talk, you're destroying the nation's character," he said.The 22-year-old Ravi was arrested by the cyber crime unit of Delhi Police for allegedly sharing on social media a toolkit related to the farmers’ protests against the Centre’s contentious agricultural laws. According to the police, it was Ravi who had shared the toolkit document with Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg. She was booked for sedition, promoting enmity and criminal conspiracy, among other offences and was produced at a city court on Sunday, after which she was sent to five days in police custody.“Disha Ravi, arrested by CyPAD Delhi Police, is an Editor of the Toolkit Google Doc & key conspirator in document’s formulation & dissemination. She started WhatsApp Group & collaborated to make the Toolkit doc. She worked closely with them to draft the Doc,” a tweet by Delhi police read. “In this process, they all collaborated with the pro-Khalistani Poetic Justice Foundation to spread disaffection against the Indian State. She was the one who shared the Toolkit Doc with Greta Thunberg,” another tweet read.The police further claimed that the call was to wage an economic, social, cultural and regional war against India. Thunberg, who had shared the toolkit on Twitter, later deleted the original tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-might-get-arrested-for-saying-this-rahul-gandhi-on-disha-ravi-s-arrest-101613567587520.html
17-02-2021||India||All you need to know about farmers' 'Rail Roko' call||Protesting farmers’ have called for a four-hour long 'Rail Roko andolan' (rail blockade) across the country from 12 noon to 4pm on Thursday. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a representative body of protesting farmers, announced the rail blockade last week, in a bid to amplify the voices of agitating farmers.Here’s all you need to know about tomorrow’s 'Rail Roko' protest:The movement is being held all over the country but the Railway Protection Force (RPF) has tightened security in four key states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The RPF has deployed 20 additional companies across these states. “Railways has appealed for peace. We will have additional security focus on Punjab, Haryana, UP and Bengal. 20 additional companies of RPF have been deployed. We appeal to everyone to maintain peace calling for peaceful protests so as not to inconvenience passengers,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.The Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) is also planning to hold a Kisan Mahapanchayat in poll-bound West Bengal. BKU leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni told PTI that farmer unions will hold meetings in poll-bound West Bengal and will be asking people in Bengal not to vote for those who are "snatching our livelihood".This is not the first railway blockade launched by farmers; last year in September, before farmers set off for Delhi, they held a state-wide rail blockades in Punjab, resulting in total suspension of train services in the state for nearly two months. Many passenger trains were later re-routed as the state and central government sparred over allowing passenger trains to traverse through the state.The railway ministry informed Parliament during last week’s budget session that the railways suffered a loss of ₹1,462.45 crore in Financial Year 2020-21 due to “various agitations/strikes including dharnas at platforms and near tracks”.Along with 'Rail Roko', Mahapanchayats are being organised all over the country. Both BKU and SKM have made it clear that farmers will not stop protesting until the three contentious farm laws are repealed by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-farmers-rail-roko-call-101613567304355.html

The outfit has members based in various countries like Canada, United Kingdom, Belgium and Pakistan.Also read| Farmers installed CCTV cameras, toilets at Ghazipur border protest siteA senior government official said there was a plan to eliminate a farmer leader, regarding which reliable input has been received.

Many in the mob held so-called 'Khalistan' flags and raised slogans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorist-from-belgium-uk-plan-to-eliminate-farmer-leader-intelligence-bureau-101613549717612.html
17-02-2021||Delhi||Farmers installed CCTV cameras, toilets at Ghazipur border protest site||As the protest against the Centre's three new farm laws entered 84th day on Wednesday, with no breakthrough in the standoff between government and farmers in the sight, protesters at the Ghazipur border have installed CCTV cameras and temporary toilets for their convenience.Talking to ANI, Dinesh Sharma, one of the protesters said toilets are installed to keep up with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of Swachh Bharat."Our Prime Minister always talked about cleanliness, so as farmers we are taking all precautions to maintain cleanliness at Ghazipur border. That is why we have also installed toilets here," he said.He said in the past goons had misbehaved with the protesting farmers and that is why CCTV cameras have been installed in the area to identify such anti-social elements in the future.Sharma added that farmers are also planning to grow vegetables on the border too."There is an empty land to grow vegetables on both sides. We will stay here for a long time as we have a long fight with the government. Concrete preparations have to be made for the long fight. There is wilderness around, we will clean the area and make it suitable for farming. The government may take as long as they want. We want to make it clear that farmers will not go without taking their rights," he stated.Another farmer Virender Singh who is also part of the protest at the Ghazipur border echoed similar concern."Farmers have been attacked many times here, and the government is not ready to take any action against attackers. Now with CCTV cameras installed, farmers will know how these attacks are being conducted and who are the people conspiring against farmers," said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-installed-cctv-cameras-toilets-at-ghazipur-border-protest-site-101613548297119.html
17-02-2021||Chandigarh||Rail Roko: Railways deploys 20 additional RPSF companies, focus on Punjab, Haryana, UP||The railways has deployed 20 additional companies of the RPSF across the country, with focus on Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, in the wake of the "rail roko" called on Thursday by farmer groups protesting against the Centre's new agri laws.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions which is spearheading the protest, last week had announced the rail blockade to press for its demand to repeal the legislations.Director General, Railway Protection Force, Arun Kumar on Wednesday said, "I appeal to everyone to maintain peace. We will be liaisoning with district administrations and will have a control room in place.""We will gather intelligence. States such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and some other areas will be our focus. We have deployed 20 companies of the Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF) in these areas," he said."We want to persuade them to not cause inconvenience for passengers. We have a four-hour window and we want it (rail roko) to get over peacefully," Kumar said.The SKM had said that the rail blockade will held across the country from 12 pm to 4 pm.Sources in the northern railways said they are expecting that 'rail roko' agitations will be concentrated in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh."No decision has yet been taken on train movement in the backdrop of the rail blockade. Once we get a better picture of the status of the protests and have identified sensitive spots, we will put in place a plan of action. We have around 80 trains which run through potentially sensitive areas and most of them would have passed through them before 12 pm," an official said.The announcement of the rail roko movement came amid the ongoing protests against the laws at Delhi's borders by farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and 'mahapanchayats' that are being organised in these states to garner support for the movement.On Tuesday, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni had said that farmer unions will hold meetings in poll-bound West Bengal as well and indicated that they will ask people there not to vote for those who are "snatching our livelihood".Railway unions which had earlier supported the farmers' movement have distanced themselves from the 'rail roko' protest.Sources indicate that the unions are not in favour of such "short protest" calls.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rail-roko-railways-deploys-20-additional-rpsf-companies-focus-on-punjab-haryana-up-101613538900793.html

The blatant targeting of a young woman citizen expressing her support with the nation’s protesting farmers is horrifying and completely unacceptable.

17-02-2021||India||Explain activist’s arrest: Women’s panel to cops||The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) on Tuesday sent a notice to the Delhi Police, seeking information and explanation on the arrest of 22-year old climate activist Disha Ravi, who was arrested in connection with a toolkit that was circulated on social media in support of the farmers’ protest.The letter, addressed to the deputy commissioner of police (cybercrime cell), sought reasons for (allegedly) not producing Ravi before the local (Bengaluru) court for a transit remand and for (allegedly) not providing a lawyer of her choice when she was later produced before the Patiala House Courts in Delhi.Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava has said on Tuesday that all procedures were followed in Ravi’s arrest.The commission also asked the police to provide a copy of the first information of report (FIR) and sought a detailed action taken report to be submitted to it by February 19 (Friday).The panel said it took suo motu cognisance of the matter on the basis of media reports.Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava on Tuesday said all procedures were followed in Ravi’s arrest for her alleged involvement in preparing a toolkit that details ways to support the farmers who are protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws.“As far as Disha’s arrest is concerned, it was done as per the procedures. The law does not differentiate between a 22-year-old and a 50-year-old. She was produced before a court which sent her to five-day police custody,” Shrivastava said on the sidelines of an event to mark Delhi Police’s 74th Raising Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explain-activist-s-arrest-women-s-panel-to-cops-101613508705411.html
17-02-2021||India||Students protest outside Delhi Police HQ, demand Disha Ravi’s release||Students from various universities on Tuesday gathered outside the Delhi Police headquarters to demand the release of climate activist Disha Ravi and others arrested in connection with the farmers’ protest. The protesters, affiliated to All India Students’ Association (AISA) and other student organisations, also submitted a memorandum to the commissioner demanding the release of persons associated with the farmers’ ongoing protest against the Centre’s farm laws.“In a highly condemnable act, Delhi Police has arrested Disha Ravi, a 22-year-old Bengaluru-based environment activist for supporting the farmers’ movement. All activists such as Shiv Kumar and others arrested for merely supporting the farmers’ movement must be released,” Prasenjeet Kumar, national working general secretary of AISA, said in the memorandum.The students said toolkits have been “a common tool for agitation” and the malicious ploy to term it an ‘international conspiracy’ is the BJP’s way of defaming the mass farmers’ protest. Activists also raised their voice against the vilification of Ravi on social media.Madhurima Kundu, JNU student and AISA activist, said it was shameful that “a dedicated propaganda machinery” was focussed on “maligning” Ravi’s image. “The false links to ”international conspiracy” is a prime toolkit of fascist politics,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-protest-outside-delhi-police-hq-demand-disha-ravi-s-release-101613508745322.html
17-02-2021||India||Will ask ‘toolkit’ suspect why he was at Tikri on R-Day: Cops||Delhi Police on Tuesday said it will ask Maharashtra engineer Shantanu Muluk, who allegedly created a social media toolkit on the ongoing farm protests, to explain why he was present at the Tikri border on January 26 when violence broke out at many places in the Capital during a tractor rally by farmers.“Our technical probe to ascertain Muluk’s phone location shows that he was present in Delhi between January 21 and 27. And, that he was at Tikri border protest site on January 26. We will ask him to join the investigation and tell us what was he doing at Tikri border when farmers were taking out the tractor parade,” an officer associated with the investigation said on condition of anonymity.The Bombay high court on Tuesday granted transit anticipatory bail to Muluk while reserving the order on a similar appeal by Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob, another accused in the case, for Wednesday.Read more: Disha Ravi can get warm clothes, masks and books in police custody, says Delhi courtOn Saturday night, Delhi Police arrested 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi from Bengaluru on charges of sedition, intending to riot and criminal conspiracy, for editing and creating a toolkit, essentially a Google document.The police alleged that the toolkit was created to spread misinformation and incite unrest. They also alleged that Ravi shared the document with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg who tweeted it but later removed it.Muluk has been accused of similar charges as Ravi.Investigators said that Ravi created a WhatsApp group, International Farmers Strike, on December 6. Police said Jacob allegedly joined the group on December 11 while a few members of pro-Khalistani group, Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF), also joined it.Muluk was added to the group on December 6, the police alleged, adding that the group was created to discuss the modalities of the Google toolkit document titled Global Farmer Strike and Global Day of Action, 26 January, backing the ongoing agitation by the farmers against the three laws passed by Parliament in September.Read more: Disha Ravi's arrest: 'False to say there were lapses', says Delhi Police chiefThe three suspects also attended a meeting organised on video conferencing platform Zoom by the PJF on January 11 this year, investigators said.The police said they have written to Zoom and WhatsApp, seeking details such as the identities of the participants, the creator and administrator of the group, the meeting coordinator, apart from the deleted chats, videos and documents.“These details will help us ascertain the sequence of events leading to the creation of the Google toolkit documents and the role each participant played in it. Disha deleted the WhatsApp group soon after Greta Thunberg accidentally posted the entire toolkit document on Twitter and later deleted it,” said a senior police officer associated with the case, requesting anonymity.The police’s decision to arrest Ravi and charge the activists has drawn sharp criticism from activists and Opposition politicians.On Tuesday, Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar attacked the Centre. “Arrest of Disha Ravi is an attack to weaken the moral strength of India’s Youth and make dissent illegal. Police action against her, using a concocted ‘Toolkit’ conspiracy violates legal norms. Why not approach a competent court before arresting a young woman?” Shivakumar tweeted.Read more: Delhi women's panel sends notice to police over Disha Ravi’s arrestActivists from various organisations say creating a toolkit was standard operating procedure for advocacy and media outreach, and did not constitute a crime as it was entirely up to people whether or not to follow what toolkits suggested.The Left-wing All India Students’ Association (AISA) staged a protest at the Delhi Police headquarters on Tuesday, demanded Ravi’s immediate release and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of running an “anti-democracy campaign”.Police said Ravi’s interrogation, and examination of her laptop and mobile phone showed that she deleted a series of emails related to the toolkit. Efforts to retrieve those emails are being made, they said.A second police officer, who did not want to be named, said their investigation so far has shown PJF founder Mo Dhaliwal contacted Ravi, Jacob and Muluk through a Canada-based woman named Puneet.“Puneet got in touch with Jacob in the first week of December and was told about the PJF’s ‘bigger plans’ pertaining to the farmers’ agitation. We have reason to believe that after Jacob agreed to be part of the plan, she roped in Muluk and Disha. Muluk is the common link between Jacob and Disha. Disha’s direct link with Thunberg could be the reason why she was included in the toolkit plan,” the second officer said.Police said their probe pointed to the alleged involvement of another PJF member, Anita Lal.“We have found that Disha, Jacob, Muluk and others communicated each other through an email created on PJF’s domain apart from other secured messaging apps,” the second officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-ask-toolkit-suspect-why-he-was-at-tikri-on-r-day-cops-101613508449542.html
17-02-2021||India||Sedition can’t be used to quieten disquiet: Delhi court observes||A Delhi court has said that sedition charges should not be invoked to quieten disquiet under the pretence of muzzling miscreants, making the observations while granting bail to two people arrested in connection with the tractor rally violence during farmers’ protest on this year’s Republic Day.Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana made the observation while granting bail to Devi Lal Burdak and Swaroop Ram. The two were arrested by the Delhi Police for alleged sedition and circulating rumours by posting videos on social media.“The law of sedition is a powerful tool in the hands of the state to maintain peace and order in the society. However, it cannot be invoked to quieten the disquiet under the pretence of muzzling the miscreants,” the judge said on Monday. The court said the invocation of Section 124 A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code was a “seriously debatable issue” in the case.Read more: Karnataka police yet to file charge-sheets in 3 sedition cases filed a year agoBurdak and Ram, both aged 25, were booked under sections 124A (sedition), 505 (spreading rumors), 468 (forgery) and 471 (fraud) of the IPC. While Ram, a labourer, was arrested from Mahisagar in Gujarat, Burdak was arrested from Nagaur in Rajasthan. The police alleged that both the accused circulated a video on social media that showed a senior police official briefing other personnel during the farmers’ protest. It alleged that though it was an old video of September 2020, it was being projected through social media posts as being connected with the farmers’ agitation and the violence son January 26 in an effort to project that there was unrest within the police forces.“In the recent violence that occurred on Jan 26 at Red Fort, near ITO and other areas in Delhi, a large number of police personnel were injured and these posts have been released on social media at a strategic time deliberately in an attempt to excite disaffection towards the government established by law and with an intent to cause any officer or soldier in the Armed Forces to mutiny or otherwise disregard or fail in his duty as such,” the police told the court.Read more: Kangana Ranaut seeks quashing of FIR for sedition, tells court her tweets did not incite violenceThe investigating agency also said that the accused circulated fake videos and also charged them for forgery. The court, however, rejected both the contentions and said that the invocation of sedition in this case was a “debatable issue”.“Evidently, law proscribes any act which has a tendency to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence. In the absence of any exhortation, call, incitement or instigation to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence or any allusion or oblique remark or even any hint towards this objective, attributable to the accused, I suspect that Section 124 A IPC can be validly invoked against the accused,” the court said.It also said that “it had personally seen the video in the courtroom where evidently a senior police officer of Delhi Police is raising slogans, in a very agitated tone, and a group of Delhi Police personnel are seen standing beside him. The background voices also suggest a very charged up atmosphere”.Read more: JNU sedition case: Delhi court takes cognisance of chargesheet against Kanhaiya Kumar, othersThe judge also rejected the charges of forgery and said that the video in question was not created by the accused and was merely forwarded by them.“Consequently, since the prosecution has failed to point out the creation of any false document in the instant case, I fail to understand as to how come the offence u/s 468/471 IPC (forgery) can be invoked in the instant case,” the judge said.Advocate Surender Chaudhary, the counsel representing the accused, said that it was complete injustice on the part of the police to arrest the two young men who had no connection with the farmers’ protest. He said that his clients had not even visited the Red Fort or any of the protesting sites and they were arrested from their homes.“This is complete travesty of justice. The career of the young boys is at stake now. This is also suppressing the right to protest envisaged under the Indian Constitution,” he said. Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra said sedition has a high benchmark and the SC has said that unless there is an incitement to violence, the act will not constitute sedition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sedition-can-t-be-used-to-quieten-disquiet-delhi-court-observes-101613501393189.html
17-02-2021||India||Toolkit case: Some relief for activists as police defend action||Activists facing prosecution for allegedly creating and editing a social media toolkit on the farmers’ protests received some relief from the courts on Tuesday, even as Delhi Police defended its arrest of a 22-year-old woman in the case that has triggered widespread criticism from free speech advocates.The Aurangabad bench of the high court granted Beed resident Shantanu Muluk protection from arrest for 10 days on a personal bond and surety of ₹50,000. His co-accused, Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob, also asked for anticipatory bail and the high court will give its decision on Wednesday.In Delhi, a magistrate’s court allowed Disha Ravi, who was arrested Saturday night and is facing a sedition charge for allegedly helping edit the document, access to a copy of the FIR, remand application, meetings with her lawyer, calls with her family, warm clothes, books, masks and home-cooked food.Read more: Disha Ravi’s arrest in 'toolkit case' unprecedented attack on democracy: Arvind KejriwalPolice said it asked Zoom to share details of a virtual meeting in January where Jacob, Ravi, Muluk and roughly 70 people allegedly fixed details of the document and protest with pro-Khalistani members. Investigators sought help from WhatsApp over a group where the document was allegedly discussed.Jacob and Muluk, who face non-bailable warrants, said they were targets of political vendetta. “Such vendetta is the dark face of authoritarianism and the real tool kit for devastation of not only democracy but also basic human rights,” Muluk’s petition read.Delhi Police say the document, first publicised by Swedish Nobel laureate Greta Thunberg in support of the farmers’ agitating against three laws, aimed to spread misinformation, incite unrest and was linked to clashes that rocked the Capital on Republic Day.Read more: Toolkit case | Zoom meet held before Republic Day to create Twitter storm: ReportBut the police’s decision to charge Bengaluru-based Ravi, a member of Thunberg’s Fridays For Future movement, with sedition, criminal conspiracy and inciting to riot, stoked allegations of muzzling dissent and procedural lapses.On Tuesday, police commissioner SN Shrivastava denied any lapses. “Disha Ravi’s arrest has been made in accordance with the law which doesn’t differentiate between a 22-year-old or a 50-year-old,” he said.Police said their investigation revealed Muluk was in Delhi between January 20 and 27. Investigators focused on a WhatsApp group named “International Farmers Strike” allegedly created on December 6 by Ravi. Police said Jacob joined the group on December 11 while pro-Khalistani group Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) members joined it the following day.Muluk was added on December 6 and the trio allegedly attended a virtual meeting by PJF on January 11. The modalities of a “Global Day Action” were allegedly worked out in the meeting attended by 70 people, police said. Police wrote to Zoom and WhatsApp seeking details on the identities of participants and administrators, apart from chats, videos and documents.Read more: Toolkit case: Disha Ravi first to be arrested, many others involved, say Delhi Police“These details will help us ascertain the sequence of events leading to the creation of the Google toolkit documents and the role each participant played in it,” said a senior police officer requesting anonymity.A second police officer, who did not want to be named, said PJF founder Mo Dhaliwal contacted Ravi, Jacob and Muluk through a Canada-based woman named Puneet.“Jacob was the first one to be contacted by Puneet in the first week of December and was intimated about the PJF’s ‘bigger plans’ pertaining to the farmers’ agitation. We have reason to believe that after Jacob agreed to be part of the plan, she roped in Muluk and Disha,” the officer said. He added that the first toolkit that Thunberg posted and deleted contained the name of a man identified as Pieter Friedrich, who police claimed was associated with Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Read more: Disha Ravi can get warm clothes, masks and books in police custody, says Delhi courtThe activists rejected the charges. Senior counsel Mihir Desai, representing Jacob, said the toolkit meant to provide digital support for the farmers’ protest. “It does not talk about any violence or about the January 26 incident at the Red Fort,” Desai argued.Advocate Hiten Venegaonkar, who appeared for Delhi Police’s cyber crime unit, said Jacob was part of a larger group formed to support the protest and added the toolkit was prepared and authored by Jacob and Ravi.Muluk’s advocate said it would take him time to reach New Delhi and file an application for anticipatory bail. The petition states that he and others were only supporting the dissenters, who are farmers. The plea said the applicant was 34, had done well in his field, had a bright future, and that police action would be destructive for his life and family.In Delhi, chief metropolitan magistrate Pankaj Sharma allowed seven applications moved by Ravi. The judge allowed her to speak to her mother and family members for 15 minutes over telephone after her counsel told court that five minutes were not enough. The court also permitted Ravi’s counsel to meet her for 30 minutes every day. Besides the FIR, the court also directed the police to provide her copies of the arrest memo and remand documents used to seek her custodial interrogation.Read more: Delhi women's panel sends notice to police over Disha Ravi’s arrestPolice action in the case has come under sharp criticism from activists and experts, who argue that Delhi Police violated procedure by not informing Bengaluru police in time, producing Ravi in a local court or providing her with a lawyer. The toolkit first hit the headlines two weeks ago when Thunberg shared it on social media along with a post in support of the agitating farmers. Shortly afterwards, Delhi Police registered an FIR on charges of criminal conspiracy and sedition, but did not name any individual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-some-relief-for-activists-as-police-defend-action-101613501021410.html
