30-11-2021||The recruitment process of the Haryana Government lies in tatters. All kinds of exams for jobs have been under the scanner over the past couple of decades||Haryana's job scams||The BJP-led government, too, is seeing its record sheet tainted with malpractices. The busting of the scam following a complaint by an aspiring candidate who was allegedly approached for appointment as dental surgeon is the latest one. With over Rs 1 crore seized, under the Vigilance Bureau scanner for the offence till now are some touts and HCS officer Anil Nagar, deputy secretary in the Haryana Public Service Commission. Consequently, the recent HCS exam has also come under a cloud. Earlier, the police recruitment test was cancelled following paper leak.Even as the due process of law is under way, the young candidates are suffering as their fate hangs in the balance. The wait is painful for many meritorious people with financial constraints or domestic responsibilities to fulfil or age going against them. The efforts to rein in the abhorrent goings-on lack the sting or strength required. For a state having an unemployment rate of 30 per cent, a more foolproof method that instills the fear of the certainty of law catching up at once needs to be devised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/haryanas-job-scams-344320
30-11-2021||The honour killings took place in 1991||Honour killings||The number of honour killings may be a tad less than before, but it is high time the civil society reacts and responds with strong disapproval, the top court has said. A pointed reminder that the constitutional objective of equality remains elusive in the absence of a strong backing of the law and order machinery. The police action is swift in most cases. The accused giving themselves up, in the name of ‘family honour’, is a common occurrence, too. ‘Casteism has not been annihilated even after 75 years of Independence, inter-caste marriage is one remedy’ are wise words, but the perpetuation of bigotry in its ruthless form is the scary truth.The Bench has hit the nail on the head by highlighting the harsh reality that the right to testify in courts without any pressure and threat is under serious attack. It would do well to actively follow up on its reiteration that the State has a definite role to play in protecting witnesses, at least in sensitive cases involving those with political patronage, to avert the trial getting tainted and ‘truth becoming a casualty’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/honour-killings-344319
