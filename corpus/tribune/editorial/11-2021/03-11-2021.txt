03-11-2021||THE Punjab Congress seems to be a house divided with PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi differing even as the state government has been taking decisions to stem anti-incumbency months before the Assembly elections. As the CM slashed power tariff||Discord in Punjab Cong||Sidhu has been the stormy petrel of Punjab politics ever since he was in the BJP, frequently taking on even the Shiromani Akali Dal, its coalition partner at that time. He is credited with playing a major role in getting the high command to replace Capt Amarinder Singh. The Congress high command has attempted to take along both the CM and the PPCC chief, with Channi even accompanying the Gandhi scions to Lakhimpur Kheri to register protest over the tragedy that took place there. The AICC in-charge of Punjab Harish Rawat has now been replaced by Harish Chaudhary, seemingly to rein in Sidhu.The factionalism gets compounded with Amarinder Singh resigning and floating Punjab Lok Congress, hoping to poach disgruntled Congressmen. For the Congress to retain power in the state, both the CM and the PPCC chief will have to overcome their trust deficit and work together, the joint visit to Kedarnath on Tuesday a good indication in this respect. The young Congress leadership will need both sagacity and perseverance to steady the government in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/discord-in-punjab-cong-333484
03-11-2021||THE results of the October 30 byelections have stung the BJP government in Himachal Pradesh||Bypoll verdict||In Haryana, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) candidate Abhay Singh Chautala retained the Ellenabad Assembly seat. The victory offers a ray of hope to the INLD, which has been reduced to a fringe player in the state. Resentment against the BJP-led state government and the prolonged unrest over the three Central farm laws seem to have influenced the result.The verdict in Himachal and Haryana is at variance with the general trend in most other states, where the ruling party/alliance fared well in the byelections. The BJP and its allies gained ground in Assam and other northeastern states, while the Trinamool Congress swept the board in West Bengal. The Congress came up trumps in Rajasthan, even as the BJP had the upper hand in Madhya Pradesh. On the whole, it’s a mixed bag of results that hasn’t given the BJP much to gloat over.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/bypoll-verdict-333483
