27-08-2021||The irony is not lost on anyone. At a time when the Congress is trying to bring together diverse political parties with the aim of forming a cohesive Opposition||Congress mess||In Chhattisgarh, Health Minister TS Singh Deo is snapping at Baghel’s heels. Deo claims that according to a rotational arrangement worked out after the Congress came to power in December 2018, he should be given the CM’s post for the second half of the present term. The high command is backing Baghel, but it has failed to clear the air about Deo’s contention. An uneasy calm prevails in Rajasthan, over a year after rebel leader Sachin Pilot was removed both as the Deputy CM and the state party chief.The BJP has repeatedly vowed to make India ‘Congress-mukt’. The least the Congress can do is to avoid scoring own goals that may help the saffron party move closer to achieving its goal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/congress-mess-302499

Even as the Congress-ruled state has been crying foul over the distribution of vaccines by the BJP-led Centre, its own district-wise skewed ratio of inoculation provides little protection from the dreaded virus. The widely swinging pendulum — from Mohali’s 71 per cent population coverage to Ferozepur’s 11.71 per cent (either single or both doses) — begs course correction. Free movement of people between districts and states increases the hazard of contracting the infection. Only universal coverage can act as a shield.The poor show in Punjab is also bound to particularly impact its neighbouring states, even though they rank high in the vaccination order. Interestingly, Himachal Pradesh tops the country and is poised for 100 per cent coverage by October, provided it maintains the daily deliverance of one lakh doses. Similarly, Chandigarh is aiming for full immunisation of adults in October. Currently, 100 per cent of its 18-plus population has received the first dose and 34 per cent both doses. Haryana, which received more vaccines than Punjab, has jabbed nearly 51 per cent residents with one dose and 14 per cent fully.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/all-is-not-well-302495
