20-08-2021||Having failed to make recommendations for the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court for two years||Collegium clears 9 names||With 69,476 cases awaiting adjudication, the Supreme Court is currently functioning with only 24 judges against a sanctioned strength of 34, including the CJI. Once these nine appointments are made, its strength would go up to 33. However, the problem of judicial vacancies is far from over as more than 41 per cent judges’ posts in high courts remain vacant. According to the Department of Justice, 455 out of 1,098 posts of judges are vacant in 25 high courts that have 57.7 lakh cases pending. Many of the high courts have 50 per cent or more vacancies — Patna High Court (34 posts vacant out of 53); Calcutta High Court (41 of 72); Orissa High Court (14 of 27); Rajasthan High Court (27 of 50); Telangana High Court (29 of 42); and Delhi High Court (30 of 60). Similarly, in the Allahabad High Court, 60 posts out of 160 are vacant; Bombay High Court, 31 of 94; Gujarat High Court, 24 of 52; Andhra Pradesh High Court, 18 of 37; Punjab and Haryana High Court, 39 of 85; and Madhya Pradesh High Court, 24 of 53.The Collegium needs to prepare a calendar of judicial vacancies and recommend names three months in advance so as to ensure that litigants don’t suffer due to insufficient judicial strength. Else, pendency would become unmanageable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/collegium-clears-9-names-299552
20-08-2021||IN a heartening reaffirmation of the hard-fought gender equality that is being increasingly felt in the defence forces||Girls to take NDA exam||Excluding women from taking the test is a grave violation of the broad intent of last year’s orders of the SC that allowed permanent commission to women officers. To prevent the irreparable damage that this miss would have caused to women’s rights, the SC direction to the UPSC to issue a corrigendum is timely. The new rule must be widely publicised so that all eligible and aspiring women candidates could compete for recruitment as cadet officers.The SC directive should goad the policymakers to take heed and shed their resistance to gender equality. As the SC noted, it is indeed regretful that the Army has been more reluctant than the Air Force and the Navy to fully accommodate women officers in its ranks. It is prone to dithering till ordered to act by the courts. The forces would do well to accept that women officers are very much here to stay and soar to heights and that gender neutrality is non-negotiable. It is time for the forces to adapt themselves towards a compatible co-educational ethos and infrastructure for women in all their institutes of training, and tweak the system, keeping in mind the technical intricacies peculiar to their work culture.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/girls-to-take-nda-exam-299553
