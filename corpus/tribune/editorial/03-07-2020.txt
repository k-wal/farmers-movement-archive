Any lapse on this count is a recipe for disaster. The death of the groom, who had symptoms of the disease at the time of the wedding in Bihar, and over 100 guests testing positive is a tragic sequence of completely avoidable events. The stark negligence on display should serve as a reminder. Self-restraint is a moral obligation, adhering to rules a sovereign duty, for your own health and of everyone around. Life as we know it has decided to take a break, a long one. Respect the changed situation. Normalcy will return, for sure, but in a new form. Respect that too. The onus lies squarely with each and everyone.The period since mid-March has been particularly tough for those entrusted with the task of governance and physical and mental well-being. There is little likelihood of any reduction of the daily grind. Where we can help is by simply following what we have been asked to do: take precautions. And, crucially, to not make the pandemic an excuse to do what is not right, what is inhuman and undignified.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/life-unlocked-107844

The idea to restore health and immunity by going back to the basics is fine and the ministry is well within its rights to promote alternative systems of medicine, but claims of a cure should be made only after controlled clinical trials. Clarity should take precedence over confusion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/misleading-brand-name-107840
