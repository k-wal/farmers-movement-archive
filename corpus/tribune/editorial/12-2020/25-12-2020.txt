25-12-2020||Colonial Christianity had ushered in modernity by setting up some of the best schools||A Christmas gift||Worse, when a CBI court in Kerala this week concluded the trial in a 28-year-old case of murder of a nun and pronounced the verdict of guilty against a priest and a nun, the Church responded claiming that the charges against the priest and nun were “unbelievable”. One of its own was killed and the court, after several hurdles thrown at it by the accused, has delivered its much-delayed judgment, yet all that the Church has to say is that it is unbelievable. Also for the Church, the priest and the nun are still merely the “accused”, not convicts, despite the sentences of double life imprisonment in one case and life imprisonment in another. Instead of hailing the verdict as divine justice to a miserably poor 21-year-old bride of Christ, the Church reaffirms the right of the convicts to appeal against the trial court’s order.The Sister Abhaya verdict is a Christmas gift to believers and non-believers alike; a testament to the divinity of truth against the evil of lustful untruth, upheld by the patriarchal priestly class over three decades. Be it Asaram, Ram Rahim, Franco Mulakkal or the murderers of Sister Abhaya, believers should not allow religious leaders to manipulate them to defend the unspeakable sins of the soulless men in saintly garb nor should the laity fund their expensive litigation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/a-christmas-gift-189055
25-12-2020||As the first-ever cricketer-president of the Indian cricket board (BCCI)||Ganguly & conflict of interest||Ganguly is in a position of serious conflict of interest that is crying for immediate attention — he endorses My11Circle, a fantasy gaming company which is a rival of Dream11, the title sponsor of IPL 2020; this month, he also signed up to endorse Classplus, an educational coaching management company which is a rival of Byju’s, a major sponsor of the Indian team. Typically, Ganguly brushes off questions about his commercial interests being in conflict with the interests of BCCI. This attitude is reminiscent of the methods of the discredited old guard, which had to step back after the Supreme Court intervened to clean up Indian cricket.It is ironical that the BCCI under Ganguly is petitioning the apex court to water down the Lodha Committee’s recommendations: It is these very reforms that allowed a great cricketer such as him to become BCCI’s president, instead of the usual suspects — politicians or businessmen! Ganguly’s efforts to remain BCCI’s chief for longer than mandated by the court-approved reforms show that excellence on the field is no guarantee against desire for power. His endorsement of commercial entities that are rivals to BCCI’s sponsors is against all principles of good corporate values, and it shows that even the greatest of cricketers, already fabulously wealthy, are susceptible to avarice. At BCCI’s AGM on Thursday, Ganguly’s conflict of interest was not raised by anyone — no one wants to antagonise the bearers of power. The court’s efforts to cleanse cricket would become ineffectual unless it renews its interest in BCCI’s reformation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/ganguly-conflict-of-interest-189052
