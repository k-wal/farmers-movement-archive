24-12-2020||IN the absence of an Assembly||DDC polls in J&K||The perceived sense of injustice has deepened and the trust deficit has widened during the past 16 months. The largely peaceful electoral exercise is unlikely to bring about any immediate transformation. What it does offer is a positive turn towards samvad and vishvas — democratic concepts made dormant by those in charge. The reactivation of the constitutionally-mandated processes of governance may have come late in the day, but is still a constructive development. The test for the administrative and political leadership now is to stay committed to forging a working relationship that has public welfare as the overarching goal.The disturbingly confrontational tone of the campaigning left a sour note, but elections of late have seen decibel levels go past all parameters of acceptability, unchecked. Neither does the model of detention and raids fit into the blueprint of a functional polity that allows opposing views and seeks accountability. A fresh start demands better.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/ddc-polls-in-jk-188537
24-12-2020||THE Centre just can’t stop gushing about the new farm laws||Problem of plenty||It seems the government is bent on staying put in its ivory tower. Late last month, PM Narendra Modi, in his Mann ki Baat address, narrated how a Maharashtra farmer, Jitendra Bhoi, used the new legislation to get his dues back from two traders. Ironically, Bhoi later came out in support of the protesting farmers and insisted that there should be a legal provision for ensuring payment at the MSP.The proof of the pudding, of course, is in the eating. The much-touted laws are certainly not flawless if they don’t provide a shield to the farmers against market volatility and price fluctuations. Making growers go from pillar to post to sell their produce without offering them adequate storage facilities does not qualify as giving them ‘freedom’. Rather, it amounts to abdication of responsibility by the State. The new Acts are no panacea for all ills plaguing the agriculture sector. It’s high time this realisation dawns on the Centre, prompting course correction.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/problem-of-plenty-188536
