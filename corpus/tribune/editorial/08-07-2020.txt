08-07-2020||With over 7 lakh cases and more than 20||Hassle-free R&D||The development comes two months after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) inexplicably disbanded an expert panel, headed by Kang, that had been tasked with Covid vaccine/drug research and was part of the National Covid-19 Task Force. The arbitrariness with which the move was effected had showed the ICMR in a poor light. Last week, the country’s premier body for biomedical research stirred a hornets’ nest by setting a deadline of August 15 for the launch of Covaxin, an indigenous Covid vaccine. Though the ICMR claimed that it only wanted to cut red tape, the undue pressure apparently being put on research professionals to produce ‘quick results’ has not gone down well with the scientific community.With all eyes on medical institutions and hospitals, the government should lay stress on transparency and accountability. The focus ought to be on fast-tracking administrative approvals, not on taking short cuts at various stages of the scientific process. Providing an environment conducive to quality research can herald a new dawn for Covid-hit India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/hassle-free-rd-110030
08-07-2020||The disruption in academic calendars was on expected lines||Students on edge||Since the lockdown in March, educational aspirations and goalposts have gone through revisions in several homes. The answers keep changing to questions like where to study, what to study, whether going abroad makes sense in this changed world, or why not consider this a gap year and put off plans. Already, keeping their wards suitably engaged as entrance test dates are postponed yet again is presenting itself as a huge challenge for parents. The going has been tough for decision-makers too amidst health and safety concerns, but adding to the confusion and stress in such an unusual situation can only be considered a poorly thought out response. No one is having it easy, but why make it more difficult?The global extent of Covid-19’s blow to education is best exemplified by President Trump’s inordinate decision that those pursuing degrees will have to leave if their universities switch to online-only courses. The move could affect thousands of foreign students who go to the US to attend universities or participate in training programmes. The pandemonium wrought by the pandemic is only expanding. The education sector remains on edge. The test for parents and educators is to keep the flame burning. Let there be light, right.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/students-on-edge-109993
