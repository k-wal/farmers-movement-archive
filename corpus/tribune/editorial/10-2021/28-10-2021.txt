28-10-2021||With the formation of a three-member committee of experts||Pegasus probe||France had promptly ordered a probe after Amnesty International revealed that President Emmanuel Macron may have been among the leaders targeted for hacking. The French authorities zeroed in on the key issues: fraudulent access; invasion of privacy; interception, diversion, use and disclosure of correspondence; and sale without authorisation of a technical device aimed at capturing data. However, in India, the Centre repeatedly brushed aside the Opposition’s demand for an investigation. Even Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, whose party (JDU) is an ally of the BJP-led NDA, joined the chorus for an inquiry, but to no avail.It’s hoped that the committee will conduct a free and fair probe to get to the bottom of the murky matter. Cooperation from government agencies will be a prerequisite for an in-depth inquiry. The spyware is dangerously invasive, whether it is used by the State or unscrupulous elements. In the interests of national security as well as an individual’s privacy and freedom of speech, the Pegasus scandal can no longer be swept under the carpet. The truth, no matter how unpalatable and scarily Orwellian, must come out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/pegasus-probe-330629
28-10-2021||That development still has to reach villages close to the national Capital and be inclusive is evident from the case of Bhurwas village of Nagina block in the Mewat region of Haryana. Around 30 homes in the village||Village sans electricity||Mewat’s neighbouring districts of Gurugram and Faridabad have a large number of malls, hotels and restaurants which consume a lot of electricity. The commercial consumption of electricity should not result in the rural areas lagging behind despite efforts being made to increase electrification there. With malls and shopping centres taking steps to install solar energy and other alternative sources of power, efforts are being made to make commercial establishments more energy efficient.Mewat was listed by the Niti Aayog for the ‘Aspirational districts programme’ because of its backwardness and to improve the physical and financial infrastructure therein. Mewat is testimony to the uneven growth in rural Haryana. Educational institutions sans electricity do not bode well for the state. The area needs a push on the pedal for progress.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/village-sans-electricity-330627
