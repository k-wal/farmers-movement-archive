26-10-2021||FOR a hill state like Himachal Pradesh with limited air and rail connectivity||Road accidents in rural HP||Under the Central Road and Infrastructure Fund, the government has sanctioned road projects for Himachal Pradesh. The state government should see to it that these projects are expedited to improve roads and boost connectivity in the rural areas. The construction of roads and undertaking other development projects also entail environmental damage in the shape of felling of trees and levelling of forest land. The impact of all this should be factored in.Needless to say, roads need safety infrastructure like crash barriers and parapets along with proper signages. Bad roads and the negligence of drivers result in death and disability which need to be ruled out by undertaking special initiatives. While agencies such as the Border Roads Organisation, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, National Disaster Response Force and District Disaster Management Authority are involved in ensuring safety, more coordination is called for to prevent road accidents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/road-accidents-in-rural-hp-329577

Against this backdrop, the conference of top commanders of the Indian Army offers a platform to review the country’s combat readiness, particularly in eastern Ladakh, which is witnessing a protracted standoff between Indian and Chinese troops. Hopefully, the brainstorming at the conference will lead to decisions that can help the Army handle the border situation more effectively.The establishment of an aviation brigade along the LAC is a step towards gaining a strategic edge in airpower, with the Rudra helicopter well equipped to storm the enemy forces and hunt them down. While fortifying its border defences, India has to be on the alert for any misadventure from the Chinese side, especially amid tough conditions during the harsh winter ahead. Provocation from the enemy must evoke a measured and proportionate response.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/chinas-new-border-law-329576
