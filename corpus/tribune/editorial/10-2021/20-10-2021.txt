20-10-2021||India’s main Opposition party||Same old drift||The Congress has only itself to blame for its diminishing national footprint. The gradual erosion of the party’s mass base in the past seven years has coincided with the BJP’s rampant ascendancy. The party has also failed to consolidate its gains in the states, allowing things to spin out of control before getting into the firefighting mode. In Punjab, the drift continued for far too long, and remedial action was taken barely five months before the Assembly elections. There are rumblings of discontent in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan as well, even as the party has helplessly watched power slip out of its grasp in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in recent years.It’s noteworthy that the Congress has decided to undertake regular training programmes for its leaders and workers, besides holding a fresh membership drive. The CWC’s decision to conduct elections for every post — at the block, district, state and national levels — will pose a slew of challenges. Merely criticising the BJP-led Centre won’t take the grand old party very far. Reconnecting with the grassroots and strengthening the organisational setup in the states should be top priorities. There is no denying that the Congress’ turnaround is vital to build a strong Opposition which can offer a healthy contest in the 2024 General Election.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/same-old-drift-326770

It has also meant having a relook at the priorities. The changeover back to the offline mode of examination will also entail gauging the learning gap in students and trying to bridge it accordingly.Covid-19 affected regular studies and also prevented the students from carrying out lab experiments and reduced social interaction and physical activity amid uncertainty. While the board exams will mean a return to the traditional method, it might also indicate the change that has come among the students, throwing up new prospects and challenges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/cbse-exam-dates-326769
