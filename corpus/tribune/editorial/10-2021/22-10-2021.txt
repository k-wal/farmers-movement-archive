22-10-2021||The instance of farmers forcibly taking away bags of DAP (diammonium phosphate) from the shop of a private dealer at Ateli grain market in Mahendragarh district of Haryana is a serious matter requiring the attention of the state government. Such incidents have been reported from other parts of the country too||DAP shortage||Nearly a third of the country’s DAP requirement is met through domestic production while the rest is through imports, making the government face up to the reality of changing global prices and meeting the shortfall by providing subsidy to the companies to offset the impact on the farming community. A follow-up of the methods adopted by the fertiliser companies to ensure adequate supply to the farmers and the roadblocks therein is needed to prevent an artificial scarcity and panic among the agricultural community.The DAP shortage follows the coal shortage that resulted in power outages. While this may provide an opportunity for diversification as in the case of Himachal Pradesh that remained unaffected because of its reliance on hydro electricity, the change has to be studied and gradual in the case of fertilisers, to ensure the efficient use of plant nutrients to minimise their adverse impact on the environment. Scarcity should be an exception, not the rule.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/dap-shortage-327716
22-10-2021||Arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in a drugs case on October 3||Aryan awaits bail||It had taken film actor Rhea Chakraborty a month to get bail in a drugs case allegedly linked to Sushant Singh Rajput’s death last year. The High Court had imposed stringent conditions while ordering her release: she was told to surrender her passport to the investigating officer; she could leave the jurisdiction of the special NDPS court in Mumbai only after submitting her itinerary; and she had to report to the NCB office on the first Monday of every month for six months. It’s reasonable to argue that Aryan can be set free with similar riders. If he thumbs his nose at the rule book, his bail can obviously be cancelled.Bail, not jail — this basic rule of legal proceedings was set forth in the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in State of Rajasthan vs Balchand (1977). The order had also cited exceptions to the rule: cases ‘where there are circumstances suggestive of fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences…’ Aryan’s case does not fit the bill for denial of bail.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/aryan-awaits-bail-327714
