16-12-2020||Phase one of the National Family Health Survey-5||Malnutrition in kids||That our children should be going hungry despite the granaries overflowing with foodgrains smacks of a criminal lack of synergy between various agencies and sectors connecting food with fork. The shameful cases of grains rotting in godowns should not go unnoticed any longer. Agricultural practices concentrating on wheat and rice have impacted the consumption of traditional millets, fruits and vegetables, leading to malnutrition. Diversification of food production is the key to a better tomorrow. Not only will it put a more nutritious variety on the table, but also help prevent soil degradation and water depletion.The lacunae in policies designed to provide wholesome meals to children must be addressed in right earnest. With the UN’s goal of achieving zero hunger by 2030 just a decade away, India, faring poorly on the hunger index — 102nd out of 112 countries — cannot afford to be lax. Even nearer is the ambitious aim of the Modi government’s Poshan Abhiyan, launched two years ago, that seeks to ensure a malnutrition-free India by 2022.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/malnutrition-in-kids-184843
16-12-2020||CITING a surge in Covid-19 cases||No winter session||The irony is not lost on anyone: during the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the new Parliament building last week, PM Narendra Modi had underlined the importance of dialogue and hailed Indian democracy for its vibrancy. Holding the House sitting at this time would have affirmed the government’s intent to encourage deliberations on thorny matters and look for solutions through consensus. However, it now seems that the ruling party is shying away from a debate with the Opposition. Such evasiveness does not augur well for a democratic set-up.The grim portents were visible during the Monsoon Session, when the government had rammed legislations through both Houses amid walkouts and boycotts by Opposition parties. The reluctance to take everybody on board is again evident now. And it doesn’t really matter whether Parliament operates from an old building or a new one, or whether it is circular or triangular in shape. What matters is to create space for a healthy dialogue in the ‘temple of democracy’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/no-winter-session-184841
