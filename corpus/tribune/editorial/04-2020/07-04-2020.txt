07-04-2020||ISIS||ISI at it again||The Kabul incident, which claimed the life of an Indian citizen as well, is the first overseas case being probed by India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA). Under the amended NIA Act, which came into effect in August last year, the agency has the power to probe terror acts against Indians and Indian interests in other countries. With the NIA zeroing in on an ISKP member from Kerala’s Kasaragod district who was among the gurdwara attackers, India has more reasons than one to be wary of the Islamic State’s potential to foment trouble.The IS currently has only a skeletal presence on the ground in Central and West Asia, but it has been effectively running a cyber caliphate, propagating its virulent ideology and indoctrinating the youth through social media and other online platforms. In recent months, the IS has tried to exploit developments such as the Kashmir lockdown, the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the communal violence in Delhi to spread its anti-India propaganda in this country. The IS-ISI nexus is a telling reminder that India can’t afford to drop its guard.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/isi-at-it-again-66553
07-04-2020||Listing several challenges in the gargantuan fight against Covid-19||Ending the stigma||Illness is a fundamental fear humans deal with, and the instinct to protect oneself and family from catching a potentially fatal disease can bring out unpleasant reactions. There is an understandable fear of the unknown, but the tendency to mark out and castigate those who get sick needs to be called out as unacceptable. Political and community leaders ought to take the lead and counsel their constituents on the desirability of holding on to compassion, a virtue extolled in great detail in religious texts.There is no denying a commonplace proclivity to harbour negative attitudes towards individuals afflicted with a wide range of illnesses, and HIV/AIDS often topping the list. Bringing about a change in mindsets takes a long time, but small acts can make a lot of difference. Credit is due to actors Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson for publicly discussing their Covid infection, easing the rebuke quotient and mental isolation for others going through a similar health crisis. As a doctor on the frontline remarked, ‘Patient zero did not create the virus. He never knew he had it.’ Humankind can afford to be more kind.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/ending-the-stigma-66525
