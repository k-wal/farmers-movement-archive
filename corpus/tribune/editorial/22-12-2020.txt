22-12-2020||The novel coronavirus continues to pose new challenges||Mutating coronavirus||This development has put the spotlight on the Covid vaccine and its efficacy against all mutations. Inoculations are already underway in England and are expected to start sometime in January in India. Scientists who are monitoring the situation, fortunately, are confident that with all guns blazing at the virus, we may yet get the better of it. They see the immunity developed through vaccination as the best shield against the mutating virus.Thus, it is imperative that vaccine trials are carried out smoothly so as to meet the aim of their rollout next month. The PGIMS, Rohtak, which is conducting clinical phase III trials of the indigenous Covaxin, has hit a bump. Some volunteers are reluctant to take the shots as one participant got infected after taking one of the two doses required. Meanwhile, the UK experience also underpins the importance of strictly following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Complacency can hamper the fight against the formidable microscopic adversary that is continuously adapting itself.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/mutating-coronavirus-187726
22-12-2020||EVEN as the Centre is reaching out to the protesting farmer unions in a renewed bid to end the stalemate over the farm laws||Pressure tactics||The agitation has also been under threat from the trolls and mischief mongers who are spreading fake news and vilifying the protesters on social media. Equal to the challenge, the farm unions have established an information technology cell to counter negative propaganda. The importance of effective and timely communication is not lost on the farmers. The tech-savvy ones have not only been active on popular cyber platforms but are also keeping tabs on the malicious campaigns being conducted to undermine their cause. In an obvious cyber attack, the social media handle of the farmers’ forum was blocked on Sunday evening. Following widespread outrage over the ‘blackout’, the handle was restored a few hours later. It was a small but significant victory for the protesters.With the Supreme Court acknowledging the farmers’ right to stage a peaceful protest, the government is well advised to confine itself to the negotiating table. Coercion or vendetta can do untold damage to the credibility of the powers that be and worsen the situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/pressure-tactics-187725
