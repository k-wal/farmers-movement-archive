20-02-2020||The coronavirus outbreak has sharply brought into focus the Indian pharmaceutical industry’s overdependence on China for the import of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)||Coronavirus challenge||In its report submitted in 2015, the VM Katoch committee had recommended that the government should facilitate API production in India by setting up mega parks and special economic zones to reduce reliance on imports. The report had suggested that such parks should have common facilities managed by a special purpose vehicle, including common effluent treatment plants, assured power supply, testing laboratories and accommodation. It had also called for ensuring single-window clearance to the manufacturers so as to cut the red tape, besides tax-free status for 15 years for cluster developers. However, efforts to implement these recommendations have been half-hearted at best.The Centre’s immediate goal should be to control the spiralling costs of imported APIs or make cost-effective alternatives available. In the long run, the government needs to treat the coronavirus crisis as an opportunity to handhold the API industry. The suggestions of stakeholders, such as the creation of an independent ministry for pharmaceuticals, should be given due consideration. Affordable healthcare will remain a distant dream unless the hyped ‘Make in India’ mission gets a booster shot in the pharma sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/coronavirus-challenge-44186
20-02-2020||Once a batch of a drug is detected to be hazardous to the health and lives of potential patients||Death of infants||It was partly because of a loophole in safety regulations that the Indian recipients of faulty Johnson and Johnson hip implants were at a disadvantage vis-a-vis those of Australia and the US. While the J&J recalls took place in 2010 in these countries, our controllers took notice only in 2017. And, sadly, the Indian patients got a paltry sum in compensation; many of them even lost out on it and the revision surgeries as they were ignorant of their entitlement or could not be traced. It reflects poorly on our system and procedures.India is the largest provider of generic drugs worldwide and the expanding industry is bound to throw up safety concerns. Stringent quality standard regulations and consumer protection laws are in place to deal with them. The remedy lies in strong enforcement of rules aided by hi-tech mapping of data. The offenders must be administered the bitter pill.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/death-of-infants-44174
