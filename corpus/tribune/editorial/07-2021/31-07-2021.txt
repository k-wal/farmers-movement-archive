31-07-2021||Over the past year and a half||Rev up medical education||The government is hopeful that the move — expected to benefit around 5,000 students every year — will ‘create a new paradigm of social justice’, while Opposition parties are seeing it as a belated step aimed at achieving electoral gains, particularly in Uttar Pradesh which goes to the polls in early 2022. The primacy being finally accorded to healthcare and medical education can be gauged from the fact that the UP Government is all set to open nine more medical colleges (one each in nine districts). A decent headcount, however, is only half the battle won.While there is no denying that reservation is a key step towards the uplift of underprivileged sections of society, the Central and state governments must not lose sight of the overarching objective — providing affordable quality healthcare to all citizens. Every nook and cranny of the country needs well-equipped medical colleges that can produce good doctors. Proportionately increasing the student intake should go hand in hand with addressing infrastructural shortcomings in these institutions. And of course, ensuring the affordability of medical education is another challenge that has to be taken up on priority.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/rev-up-medical-education-290765
31-07-2021||The Supreme Court has rightly taken suo motu cognisance of the death of a district and sessions judge in Dhanbad||Dhanbad judge case||The district has some of the largest coal mines and has been a hub of both mafia activity and trade unionism, testing the mettle of the administration in checking the spiralling crime graph. The state minister in charge of the district has cautioned about reaching a conclusion about the incident — whether it was pre-planned or an accident — and the responsibility will lie on the investigating team to rule out foul play and ascertain the truth to ensure that justice is dispensed. Nothing could be a travesty of justice more than the suspicious death of a judge.While the Supreme Court has expressed its concern over the environment in which judicial officers work, steps need to be taken to ensure that they are provided with the necessary wherewithal like security and their protection is taken care of. It is not unusual for judges, or for that matter, members of other services to face threat to lives in the discharge of their duty, more so while taking action against criminals with political patronage. But the cause of justice is the cause of humanity and the court should ensure that the police inquiry reaches its logical conclusion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/dhanbad-judge-case-290766
