If this were an attempt to gain a tactical advantage for a stronger bargaining chip before the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting of the foreign ministers in Moscow today, it would seem the Chinese are looking towards a negotiated settlement. But it is more likely that the Chinese are running on several parallel tracks: diplomatic initiatives to appear reasonable in the international arena; use of media to cry wolf to shake off the aggressor’s tag; and simultaneously continuing the military push to gain territory.The Indian Army’s military manoeuvre on the intervening night of August 29-30 seemed to have made a difference in terms of a resolute response to naked Chinese aggression. It needs to be followed up with a reassessment of India’s view on the status of Tibet, the stature of Dalai Lama and the future of the Tibetan refugees in India and their national aspirations. Until China forsakes its designs on Daulet Beg Oldie and Siachen and begins to see reason and profit in comprehensively delineating the LAC from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, India has to plan its defence in Ladakh with an offensive edge, to be one step ahead of the treacherous neighbour.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/offensive-edge-139039
10-09-2020||Film star Sushant Singh Rajput’s death was undoubtedly a tragedy. The blossoming career of a talented artiste||A tragic farce||The private lives of two actors have come under glaring scrutiny at a time when Indian economy is in a tailspin, there is no let-up in Covid cases, and the country’s troops are locked in a tense standoff with China. Amid such pressing issues, sensationalism has taken centre stage, dividing public opinion between two hashtags — #JusticeForSushant and #JusticeForRhea.As if things were not bad enough, political parties have joined the despicable bandwagon. In poll-bound Bihar, the state Sushant hailed from, opportunists have latched on to the case in the hope of reaping electoral dividends. The media, above all, can’t escape culpability for having reduced an actor’s death to a sordid spectacle. The onus is on the probe agencies to find the truth expeditiously and bring down the curtain on this tragic farce.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/a-tragic-farce-139038
