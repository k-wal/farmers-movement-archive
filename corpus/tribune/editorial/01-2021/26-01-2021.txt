26-01-2021||This is a special Republic Day||Tanks and tractors||The contradictions do not end with the two parades. As we celebrate our vaxi-diplomacy offering Covid-19 vaccines to the world, the Republic has not yet inoculated its citizens against the greatest affliction of this nation — poverty — or has attempted to cure and rehabilitate the migrant masses, which walked hundreds of kilometres after having lost their jobs in the cities. Over one crore people still remain jobless in the manufacturing sector and nearly a crore more are yet to get re-employed in the services segment. Yet, the Sensex has conquered Mount 50K, while the economy is contracting at a rate of 7.5 per cent. The disconnect between marketcap and unemployment; tanks and tractors; Rajpath and the national highway could never have been greater than it is today.On this auspicious day, we need to remind ourselves that agriculture employs about 36 per cent of the country’s labour force and that figure rose to 40 per cent in 2020, while all other sectors declined. This sector and the farmers deserve greater respect.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/tanks-and-tractors-203649
26-01-2021||A 39-year-old man||Groping case||In another case from Maharashtra, a special POCSO court recently sentenced an autorickshaw driver to rigorous imprisonment for life for sexually assaulting a five-year-old girl. For the record, Maharashtra accounted for 8,503 of the total cases — the maximum among all states — registered in India under the Act during 2017-19, according to three-year data released by the National Crime Records Bureau. Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat are the other states with a high rate of registration of sexual offences targeting children, even as many such cases go unreported due to familial and societal pressures.There is no denying that kids are vulnerable to sexual crime, particularly at the hands of people known or related to them. Such an experience can leave a child psychologically scarred for life. While there is a case for making provisions of the POCSO Act more stringent so as to leave no lacunae that offenders can exploit, the courts should show zero tolerance for the abominable acts and not let technicalities weaken judgments. A relatively mild punishment will only embolden the predators and discourage the little victims.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/groping-case-203646
