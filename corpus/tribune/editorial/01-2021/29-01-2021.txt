29-01-2021||The go-ahead from February 1 to increase the occupancy in cinema halls and theatres from the earlier 50 per cent||The show goes on||The government decision to remove the restrictions comes riding on the gains derived from its efforts to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic as the number of daily infections has dipped over the past couple of months and the national recovery rate of the disease inched up to a heartening 96.91 per cent. Giving wind to the graded opening is also the vaccination drive that is on, with frontline workers getting the jabs first. Another pointer for cheer is the sero survey which indicates that Delhi is nearing herd immunity. Add to the optimistic scenario the IMF projection of a robust growth rate of 11.5 per cent in the next financial year for India, and things look up.A big push to this growth in economy is expected to come from the film industry. Its loss due to the lockdown in 2020 has been pegged at a whopping Rs 5,000 crore, with virus-wary viewers staying away from movie halls. Equally impactful will be the revival of the exhibition industry, which as per the Indian Exhibitions Industry Association, has a size of Rs 23,800 crore with over 550 events conducted annually. CAPA India forecast in October that the Indian aviation industry will lose a combined $6-6.5 billion in FY21. The push button to restart these multi-crore segments is indeed vital to propelling the all-round optimistic outlook.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/the-show-goes-on-204880
29-01-2021||More than five years after the Supreme Court struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission to safeguard judicial independence||Vacancies in High Courts||As on January 1 this year, there were 668 judges against a sanctioned strength of 1,079 and 411 posts remained vacant. The situation doesn’t appear to have improved since January 2020 when judicial vacancies in high courts stood at 401. The Supreme Court has sought to put the blame on the government. More than 100 names sent to the Union Ministry of Law and Justice by various high courts to be forwarded to the Supreme Court collegium for approval are hanging fire, many of them for more than a year. There are 56.57 lakh cases pending in 25 high courts. Of this, 92,085 are more than 30 years old; 1,51,853 cases have been awaiting disposal for over 20 years.The Memorandum of Procedure that governs the process for judicial appointments requires the Centre to give its feedback on the names recommended. Having been forced to play second fiddle, successive governments have used their feedback as a ‘pocket veto’. But the judiciary can’t be absolved of its responsibility either. If there are 411 vacancies in high courts, why can’t an equal number of names be recommended in advance? It’s time to fix the lacunae in the judicial appointment system in the interest of justice.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/vacancies-in-high-courts-204877
