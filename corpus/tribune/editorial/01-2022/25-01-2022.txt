25-01-2022||The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG)||Community transmission||Being a foregone conclusion, community transmission should not trigger panic or chaos as long as the fatality rate remains low. Instead, it has raised hope that the third wave of Covid-19 might peak sooner than later. As per a preliminary analysis by IIT Madras, the national peak is likely to come early next month, while other predictions say it may happen by mid-February. The developing scenario might prompt the Election Commission of India to consider extending the ban on physical rallies beyond January 31 in the five poll-bound states. While most Omicron cases so far have been asymptomatic or mild, the importance of home isolation and staying away from crowded public places cannot be overestimated.With the next fortnight or so being crucial, the authorities should go all out to fast-track the vaccination drive. It was on January 10 that India started administering booster or precaution dose to healthcare workers, frontline workers and people aged above 60 (with comorbidities). In two weeks, over 80 lakh such doses have been given. This inoculation rate needs to be improved drastically. It’s also worrying that there are around 6 crore adults whose second dose is still overdue. Even as the Centre recently told the Supreme Court that there were no guidelines to force people to get vaccinated, it is imperative to assess the efficacy of national and state-level awareness campaigns and do course correction wherever required. Though it may be premature to say that the virus is on its last legs, major relief might be on the cards if it quickly runs its course through the bulk of the population, thus heralding herd immunity.                                      #Omicron||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/community-transmission-364077
25-01-2022||The horrifying freezing to death of a family of four Gujaratis||Frozen to death||Unfortunately, in a stark pointer to India’s criminal justice delivery system, not only does the heart-wrenching Malta case still continue to languish in courts, but also many more with ‘foreign dreams’ have since fallen victim to unscrupulous agents’ greed. It is well known that lakhs of youngsters in India, especially from Punjab and Haryana, are ready to stake everything for a passage abroad. A chilling spinoff of the craze is the rising numbers of ‘abandoned NRI wives’. Hardly a day passes without someone complaining of fraud in these matters. Yet, the business of fake travel agents continues to thrive.The law enforcers and investigators have rarely caught the culprits even as the courts are clogged with cases that drag on for years. The victims and their families sink deeper into despair and poverty as they fight a system reeking of corruption and the power of the mighty and the moneyed. An urgent plugging of loopholes in the law allowing the fraudsters to go scot-free is needed to curb this crime. Observing that the incidents of villagers being duped were more than a few in Punjab, the anguished Punjab and Haryana High Court on Saturday called for the unearthing of the entire racket run by bogus travel agents. Till then, this deathly trap will keep netting people into its darkness.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/frozen-to-death-364076
