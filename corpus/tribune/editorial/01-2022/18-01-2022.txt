18-01-2022||The unregulated import of apples from Iran is causing heavy losses to orchardists in J&K and Himachal Pradesh. J&K is by far the biggest producer of apples in the country||Save apple industry||With the cheaper variety flooding the Indian market, local apple growers are struggling to compete in view of rampant under-invoicing of the imports. Some orchardists are demanding a blanket ban on these imports, while others are seeking the imposition of 100 per cent duty. The growers are also apprehensive that Iranian apples may trigger pest infestation, even as the National Plant Protection Organisation of the Agriculture Ministry recently banned the import of kiwis from Iran as the fruit did not meet India’s safety standards.Apple is a popular fruit that remains in demand throughout the year. It’s ironical that the indigenous apple industry is finding it tough to stay afloat in India, which is not only one of the world’s leading producers of a wide range of fresh fruits but also a major exporter. The country exported fruits (mainly grapes and mangoes) worth around Rs 5,000 crore during 2020-21. The Centre should intervene to regulate the import of apples after making an accurate assessment of the demand-supply gap. Modalities for the imposition of sizeable import duty can be worked out with Iran in order to prevent loss of revenue to the exchequer. What’s needed is a level playing field which can help local growers of this fruit — highly vulnerable to the vagaries of the weather — get remunerative prices.                                     #HimachalPradeshApples                                     #Iranapples                                     #JKApples||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/save-apple-industry-362160
18-01-2022||The first anniversary of the Indian vaccination drive against Covid-19 is a moment to honour all health workers who fought the pandemic and walked the extra mile to help protect people. The result is an impressive achievement of 70 per cent of the country’s total adult population getting fully inoculated with 156 crore doses. A postage stamp was released on the occasion||Mindless counting of cases||This cycle of helplessness needs to be broken. We should stop counting the daily cases and active caseload only to despair. What matters are the hospitalisation figures and the death rate. If these two indicators do not show an alarming spike, there is no real cause for concern or need for night curfew, weekend curfew or curbs that kill livelihoods. Administrators should understand that every restriction they impose is an act of curtailment of economic activities, immediately resulting in loss of jobs, and thereby the meagre earnings of the most vulnerable sections of our society.The world media should heed American news agency Associated Press’ decision ‘to avoid emphasising case counts in stories about the disease’. Mindless counting of the dead is also counterproductive as the fast-spreading Omicron variant may not necessarily be the cause of death, even when a dead person tests positive. Dr Angelique Coetzee, the chairperson of the South African Medical Association, who spotted the Omicron variant first, has told newspersons not to look at positivity rate or daily cases, but to focus on patients in Intensive Care Units and those who die after getting admitted solely for Covid infection. Governments should immediately lift curbs to mitigate the crippling economic impact of the third wave, for far fewer people are dangerously sick now than they were during the Delta wave.                                      #Covid                                     #Omicron||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/mindless-counting-of-cases-362162
