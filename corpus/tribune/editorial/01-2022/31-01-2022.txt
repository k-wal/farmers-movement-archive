31-01-2022||THE government’s decision to set up a ‘bad bank’ ahead of the Union Budget for the resolution of stressed assets||Go-ahead for ‘bad bank’||Banks and NBFCs have had a number of reasons for the increase in cases of loan default. The liberal lending to the individual borrowers and corporates to accelerate development without adequate assessment in any case is fraught with risks. Bank runs and big borrowers defaulting on loan repayment have not brought credit to the banking sector either. The loss of income and livelihoods amid the pandemic only worsened the situation with moratoriums and write-offs being resorted to in order to improve the situation. The banking sector has seen major changes, including the merger of public sector banks which was aimed at increasing capitalisation and competitiveness.The proposed ‘bad bank’ will have a structure for asset reconstruction and debt resolution in which both public sector and private sector banks will have a role to play. Banks cannot do away with lending for without that economic activity and entrepreneurial spirit will suffer. But the onus of managing their own capital and making the lender accountable also lies on them. Loan recovery should not slacken due to the lure of higher interests. While checks are performed, loan defaults point to the fact that proper credit rating and risk assessment are required. Lending in the aftermath of the pandemic will be required to boost economic activities but safeguarding the capital and assets of banks, individuals and companies will also be a must for the economy to flourish without hitches.                                     #BadBank                                     #BUDGET                                     #NPAs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/go-ahead-for-bad-bank-365619
31-01-2022||THE Modi government needs to come clean on the latest media revelations that it bought Israeli spyware Pegasus in 2017 as part of a $2-billion package for sophisticated weapons and intelligence gear. It also needs to set the record straight on insinuations linking the deal with India voting in June 2019 in support of Israel at the UN’s Economic and Social Council to deny observer status to a Palestinian human rights organisation. Sidestepping the issue||Pegasus row||The government has, in the past, dismissed allegations of any kind of surveillance, saying there is ‘no concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever’. While setting up a three-member independent panel in October to probe the alleged targeted and unlawful surveillance, however, the Supreme Court’s observations were terse, as it deemed unacceptable the Centre’s refusal to shed any light on the controversy. The court said the State could not get a ‘free pass’ every time the spectre of national security was raised and that its mere invocation could not render the judiciary a ‘mute spectator’.Under fire for providing the means for nations to spy on their own people, Pegasus maker NSO Group claims that it only sells the technology to foreign governments and has no role in or responsibility for targeting specific individuals. Various instances have been given of how the spyware has been quietly used the world over to thwart terrorist plots and fight organised crime through technology that can decrypt communications. However, it is the abuse of Pegasus that is at the centre of the row. If India has established robust protocols when it comes to surveillance, as the government claims, stonewalling the damning revelations only adds fuel to the fire.                                     #Pegasus||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/pegasus-row-365618
