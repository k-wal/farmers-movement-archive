19-01-2022||The Election Commission of India (ECI) deserves praise for accepting a genuine demand by the state government and various political parties to postpone the Punjab Assembly polls in view of Guru Ravidas Jayanti. Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and other leaders had appealed to the poll panel to reschedule voting||ECI's gesture||Unanimity among political parties is rare, especially during the election season. What has made all stakeholders speak in one voice in this case is the importance of the Ravidasia community as a vote bank. Doaba, which sends 23 MLAs to the 117-seat Punjab Assembly, accounts for lakhs of followers of Guru Ravidas. No party can afford to ignore the interests of this influential group, considering that this is apparently a ‘no wave’ election which might throw up a hung House. The bottom line is that every seat counts.However, amid the electoral compulsions, various parties have conveniently chosen to ignore the fact that the celebrations in Varanasi will witness a huge congregation under the shadow of the pandemic. The event could become a coronavirus superspreader if the third wave does not subside by mid-February. Varanasi is represented in the Lok Sabha by PM Narendra Modi, who has been repeatedly urging citizens of the country to follow Covid protocols. It will be a big challenge for the BJP government in poll-bound UP to make large crowds toe the line, particularly since cancellation of the festivities is not an option in view of the religious sentiments at stake. Last year, the Kumbh Mela in Uttarakhand was one of the contributory factors to the massive surge in infections during the devastating second wave. It remains to be seen whether adequate steps will be taken this time to ensure a Covid-safe pilgrimage.                                     #GuruRavidas                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/ecis-gesture-362433
19-01-2022||A two-member Bench of the Supreme Court has been left so utterly bewildered by the language used in a judgment by the Himachal Pradesh High Court that it remarked||Court language||In March 2021, too, a two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court was completely mystified by a HP High Court judgment, observing: ‘We are at our wits’ end. This is happening repeatedly.’ In 2017, the apex court had set aside a judgment passed by the HP High Court due to the convoluted language used in it, noting: ‘After hearing learned counsel, it is not possible to comprehend the contents of the impugned order passed by the High Court.’ The common man is almost invariably left befuddled by mysterious legal jargon used in the police and court documents, but it’s a telling comment on the state of the system when even the highest court of the country finds high court judgments incomprehensible.As Mahatma Gandhi, one of the most effective mass communicators of the 20th century, discovered, the most powerful ideas become accessible to the common man if they are presented in a simple, direct and concise manner. In the matters of the courts, the language must be specific, direct and precise — verbosity, ambiguity and obscure allusions must be eschewed so that a litigant could understand at least the essence of a judgment with ease. The focus must be on the poor litigant. This aspect must be emphasised upon at law schools and judicial academies. Lucidity must be the soul of court judgments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/court-language-362431
