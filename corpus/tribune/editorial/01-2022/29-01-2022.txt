29-01-2022||There are several takeaways from the first-ever summit involving India and five Central Asian countries — Kazakhstan||Central Asian outreach||New Delhi’s Central Asian outreach assumes significance amid China’s efforts to strengthen ties with these nations that are part of the eight-member Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which also includes India. What gives Beijing a geopolitical edge is the fact that it shares borders with three of the five countries. Two days before the India summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping interacted with Central Asian leaders and announced an assistance of $500 million to support livelihood programmes in these former Soviet bloc countries. He also listed several big projects of strategic importance that had been completed, including the China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline, the China-Kazakhstan crude oil pipeline, the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan highway and the China-Tajikistan expressway. In a bid to counter the Chinese challenge, India has extended a $1-billion line of credit for infrastructure development projects and offered to provide more training slots and scholarships to meet the requirements of Central Asian countries.New Delhi would have to go the extra mile on the diplomatic and economic fronts to ensure that these countries remain all-weather allies, even as Russia is not averse to making decisive interventions in the region. After the recent unrest in Kazakhstan, Russia sent troops there as part of a peacekeeping mission to restore order, while China firmly backed the beleaguered nation’s efforts to curb violence. India needs to adopt a proactive approach to further its interests and make its presence felt in the extended neighbourhood.                                     #IndiaChina                                     #NarendraModi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/central-asian-outreach-365084
29-01-2022||The series of videos gone viral||Punish barbaric criminals||For, what else would motivate a family, including its women members, to take such horrifying revenge on another woman? The 21-year-old married woman was abducted and confined to a room full of men and women of the accused family. Ignoring her pleadings for mercy, she was assaulted, her head tonsured and face blackened. She was even allegedly gangraped in that room. Then, she was paraded in the streets with a garland of shoes around her neck. What was her fault? That she had rebuffed the unwanted overtures of their teenaged son and was thus responsible for the scorned son taking his own life? What a barbaric thought! Justice for the victim demands quick and exemplary punishment for the criminals.Children must be raised into men and women who respect one another. The boys, especially, should be ingrained with the value of treating girls as respectable equals. But, sadly, the impressionable youngsters are exposed to the culture of patriarchy, both within and outside homes. This becomes the root cause of relationship problems and reduces the woman’s body to being a tool of abuse and exploitation. The gender sensitivity theme must be played out in schools, colleges and the media and on influential platforms like religious places and political bodies. Coupled with progressive ideas practised in homes, it will make a dent in India’s shameful gender crime statistics.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/punish-barbaric-criminals-365082
