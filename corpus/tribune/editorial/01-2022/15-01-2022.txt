15-01-2022||The 17th edition of the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) offers us some good news||Loss of natural forests||Now, the worrying part: 1,643 sq km of dense forests have been destroyed since 2019. There still is a net gain in green cover because 549 sq km of non-forest areas, with a canopy density of under 10%, have been converted to dense forests, with a canopy density of over 40%. Alarmingly, five Northeastern states — Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland — have lost significant forest cover, aggregating to 1,020 sq km. Nagaland has lost 1.88% of its forest cover, followed by Manipur (1.48%), Mizoram (1.03%), Meghalaya (0.43%) and Arunachal Pradesh (0.39%). In the northern region, Punjab is the only loser, shedding 2 sq km of forest cover, and now only 1,847 sq km of the state is under forest cover; at 3.67%, it is a fraction of the national average of 21.71%.Forests are not merely precious natural treasures, they are also the lungs of a nation and repository of flora and fauna. Their absence, coupled with overpopulation and industrialisation, can lead to terrible levels of pollution and climate change, which can have devastating consequences. Our forests are menaced by fires — over 3.98 lakh fires reported in the fire season in 2020-21 — and timber mafia. ‘Progress’ too leads to encroachment, as seems to be happening at an alarming rate in the Northeast. Striking a balance is not easy, but we must do it for the sake of the coming generations. For that, an urgent and effective policy must be formulated and enacted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/loss-of-natural-forests-361292
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Free-for-all at railway station||The railway authorities have challaned 870 people — mostly autorickshaw drivers and cabbies — in the past six months for not having the platform ticket. However, a mechanism to deal sternly with repeat offenders is conspicuous by its absence. The fact that the menace persists clearly shows that checking is lax, making it easy for some auto/taxi drivers to reach the platform without paying the fine. The sealing of all unauthorised entry points is the least that can be done, even as the possibility of a nexus between some officials and drivers-cum-touts cannot be ruled out.Cleanliness at railway stations is no doubt important and makes for good optics, but an obsessive focus on this aspect under the Swachh Rail mission is leading to gross neglect of passengers’ post-arrival safety and comfort. The Railways should spare a thought for people who are unable to utilise or access app-based auto/taxi services. A world-class railway station will continue to elude the Smart City of Chandigarh as long as the authorities turn a blind eye to the harassment of passengers. It’s high time the operations at this busy railway station are streamlined to prevent all the chaos, which is not only an eyesore but also a poor advertisement for the City Beautiful.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/free-for-all-at-railway-station-361294
