28-01-2022||The escalation of violent protests and arson in Bihar over alleged irregularities in recruitment in the Railways is yet another symptom that shows the Indian economy is going through a terrible churn||Rising unemployment||Clearly, the surge started well before the Covid-19 pandemic came to India in February 2020 — in fact, data from a survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) in 2017-18 showed that India’s unemployment rate was 6.1%, the highest since 1972-73. The dire situation of the employment sector is confirmed by the numbers released by the Ministry of Statistics. On the basis of the number of subscribers to the EPF, ESI and NPS schemes, it can be calculated that there has been no significant rise in jobs available in the formal sector in the last three years. The effects of the coronavirus pandemic have only worsened the situation, with firms contracting and shedding workforce to reduce costs. But India seems to have done worse than other emerging economies, such as Bangladesh.While the Finance Ministry has been highlighting the emergence of the green shoots in the economy, rising joblessness presents a massive challenge to the NDA government, which came to power in 2014 with the promise of multiplying the incomes of every segment of society. The annual income of the poorest 20% households dropped by 53% between 2015-16 and 2020-21. In this duration, the income of the top 20% rose by 39% and that of the upper middle 20% by 7%. Clearly, the richest Indians are succeeding in carving out an ever-increasing share of the income pie for themselves.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/rising-unemployment-364750
28-01-2022||With five states going to the polls next month||Politics of freebies||The competitive populism makes it amply clear that various parties don’t want to look beyond the upcoming election. What matters to them is coming to power — or retaining it — at any cost, even as the pressing issues of public interest are put on the backburner. Fund-rich parties get an unfair advantage as they have much more to offer as allurements to the electorate. The telling impact of sops was visible in the 2021 Kerala Assembly elections. Two years after being routed in the Lok Sabha polls, the ruling Left Democratic Front got elected for a second straight term with a thumping majority. What worked for the CPM-led front was the distribution of free food kits. Though the ECI had suspended the controversial exercise after getting complaints, the Kerala High Court had stayed the poll panel’s order, while directing the state government not to give the impression that the doling out of food was aimed at influencing voters.There is no denying that freebies vitiate the poll process and undermine democratic polity. The ECI needs to frame rules that prohibit or restrict populist announcements during the last six months of a government’s tenure, and not just after the model code of conduct is enforced. Only with firm resolve can the sop opera be discouraged and eventually discontinued.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/politics-of-freebies-364751
