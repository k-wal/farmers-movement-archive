21-02-2020||Amid concern over the state of water resources in Punjab||Water audit in Punjab||In rural and semi-urban areas, groundwater is a major source for irrigation and drinking. But the situation gets compounded because the quality and level is not even across the state. While the south-west parts of Punjab have shallow water level, as also the presence of fluoride and nitrate, water level is deepest in central and north-east parts of the state. Constructing structures involves expenditure and the state and Centre should be clear about their liability.Prudent measures are required to arrest the slide and the need is to conserve what is there and build on it. This will need a relook at the present agricultural and water policies, involving subsidy, which discourage thrift. Subsidy should be restricted to the genuinely needy, which again will require tremendous political will.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/water-audit-in-punjab-45003
21-02-2020||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath has given a clean chit to the state police over the death of at least 20 anti-CAA protesters||Clean chit to cops||The CM has been steadfastly backing the cops, who have been under fire from opposition parties and human rights groups for allegedly using excessive force to quell the protests. The National Human Rights Commission recently issued a notice to the state government on the Congress’ petition seeking action against police personnel who committed atrocities on protesters. Among those at the receiving end of police excesses was SR Darapuri, a retired IPS officer, who was accused of instigating violence during an anti-CAA protest in Lucknow. He was arrested, but later released on bail due to lack of evidence against him. The police lodged FIRs against 883 people on the charges of rioting and destroying public property, but 561 of them were granted bail.The police’s reluctance to investigate the cases of fatal violence was exposed last month when the Allahabad High Court rapped the government for denying autopsy reports to the families of those who had died during the disturbances. Rather than promising action against the erring cops, the CM is busy making irresponsible statements, equating protesters with traitors who would die an anonymous death. An independent, court-monitored probe is needed to reveal the truth, considering the loss of credibility of the UP Government as well as its police.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/clean-chit-to-cops-45002
