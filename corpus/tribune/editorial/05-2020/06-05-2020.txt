06-05-2020||The prolonged lockdown has derailed the Indian economy||Reach out to migrants||The authorities also need to ensure that the workers get full wages for the entire lockdown period and there are no layoffs. It’s understandable that MSME units are struggling to stay afloat due to lack of economic activity and are hard-pressed to pay their employees. The situation is so grim that MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari has stopped short of specifying the ‘big’ amount the government owes to these small units.Cutting across party lines, the Centre and the states should be open to ideas put forth by noted economists like Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee, who favours a cash dole for the bottom 60 per cent population to help reboot the economy. Apart from a major stimulus package, the governments should work in sync to protect the interests of the workforce as well as the employers. The workers’ return and rehabilitation ought to be the top priority as of now. Once that is done and the lockdown is largely lifted, the next challenge would be to bring them back to the factories so that industrial operations can resume with a semblance of normalcy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/reach-out-to-migrants-80958
06-05-2020||The exposure of some teenaged boys of posh Delhi schools luridly talking of raping schoolgirls||Beastly banter||For long, the condoning of such behaviour of boys with the excuse that ‘boys will be boys’ has played a major role in why rape culture is still largely prevalent in our society. The onus is wrongly put on girls to not dress up or act in ways that tempt men. It just victimises the girls and exonerates the culprits. This mindset is harmful. For, while terrifyingly illegal actions generally do spring from crass and crude words and thoughts, social sanction to a stereotypically coarse behaviour only makes the march towards a gender-equitable society that much harder. How a rape can scar a victim for life, how it can mentally torture her with disastrous consequences for her life cannot be emphasised enough. No man should be allowed to believe otherwise.However, even as the casual, expletive-laden banter of the boys in the ‘locker room’ reignited the need for sensitising men towards a harmonious relationship with women, it also gave a peep into a deeper and wider malaise: that some female friends came out in support of the boys’ behaviour is fodder for thought and concern.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/beastly-banter-80923
