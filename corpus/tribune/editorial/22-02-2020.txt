22-02-2020||Only a few days back||Nagaur narrative||Incidents of caste-based violence serve to remind that while much has been achieved in terms of empowerment and advancement of the socially deprived sections, safeguarding their rights is a task fragile in nature and that the inadequacy of governance in reaching out to such people remains. The Villupuram incident will remain a blot on the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and the drive to make places open-defecation-free.The Nagaur tragedy points to the need for tying up the loose ends in the administration, coming as it does on the heels of the Kota infant deaths at a hospital in the government sector and almost three years after the lynching of cattle trader Pehlu Khan. In the case of Pehlu Khan, the accused were acquitted by the court and there has been no plausible action in the Kota case. Rajasthan should ensure justice in the Nagaur incident.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/nagaur-narrative-45288

The state’s earnings from excise duty have been rising steadily in recent years. The collections expected in the current financial year are to the tune of Rs 6||Hitting the bottle||It’s not uncommon for a government to justify a liberal excise policy on the plea that greater revenue translates into more resources to fund development projects.

It’s important to factor in the social cost of increased consumption, besides the threat to law and order owing to drunken brawls, particularly at odd hours, and a possible spurt in the number of drunken driving cases.By its own admission, the Haryana Excise and Taxation Department has to ‘give due weightage to the health and well-being of the citizens of the state’, but at the same time ensure that ‘revenue interests of the government are not compromised’. The new policy fails to strike a balance between these two considerations, raising doubts about the government’s commitment to curbing alcoholism and drug abuse.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/hitting-the-bottle-45287
