23-06-2021||Months before the Assembly elections||Jobs to MLAs’ sons||In a 2019 judgment, the Supreme Court had stated that the policy of compassionate appointment in public service was not a right, but a benefit held out by the state to rescue the family of a deceased employee from penury. The sound financial condition of the Bajwas and the Pandeys and their political clout do not make them ‘needy’ by any yardstick. Moreover, the state government should tell us how many third-generation candidates have been given jobs in similar cases.The Congress dispensation had also been accused of arbitrariness in appointments in 2017 when former CM Beant Singh’s grandson Guriqbal Singh was recruited as a DSP. A party that was voted to power on the back of promises such as ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ (one job per household) needs to convincingly counter allegations of favouritism. Otherwise, the ruling Congress, already beset by infighting, will only do more damage to its credibility with such controversial moves.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/jobs-to-mlas-sons-272467
23-06-2021||On the first day of the Union government’s new Covid-19 vaccination policy||A dose of hope||The new policy was announced five days after the Supreme Court made stinging observations about ‘arbitrary and irrational’ pricing under the previous policy, and asked the Centre to explain how the sum of Rs 35,000 crore earmarked for procuring vaccines in 2021-22 was being spent. The vaccination drive had been moving at a snail’s pace even as the second wave of the pandemic wreaked havoc across the country. India’s previous daily vaccination record was 45 lakh doses on April 5, but the numbers declined sharply after that. By the fourth week of April, the pace of vaccination was such that, with around 13 crore people given at least one dose, it was estimated it would take over eight years to vaccinate enough people to acquire herd immunity.Monday, summer solstice, saw a record in vaccinations; but for India to achieve the target of inoculating 950 million adults by the winter solstice, the rate of vaccination needs to rise further — experts say that India must administer 10 million doses daily. As of now, around 5% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated. Thus, while it is heartening that India administered vaccine doses equalling Switzerland’s entire population in a single day, we must remind ourselves India’s population is 160 times Switzerland’s. India must maintain this pace for months to come.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/a-dose-of-hope-272476
