05-06-2021||Noting that it was happy with the cancellation of the Class XII board exams in view of the pandemic||CBSE conundrum||The government may have had a point in cancelling the exams because of the concerns over the health and safety of children amid fears of a possible third wave. Panchkula boy Hiteshwar Sharma told PM Modi during an interaction with the students that he was happy that the PM had considered the well-being of the students more than anything else during the pandemic, but felt bad when he came to know about the cancellation of exams because he expected to be a topper.States like Punjab and Tamil Nadu have so far not cancelled the exams amid allegations that it was an attempt by the Centre to implement the New Education Policy through the backdoor. Also, how the state boards will reconcile grading of their students with that of the CBSE and CISCE remains to be seen. With the pandemic affecting the education system drastically, some of the changes could well be here to stay with even the entrance exams for major competitions making changes in schedule and pattern. The challenge for the student community will be to stay safe and continue to prepare to attain future goals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/cbse-conundrum-263510
05-06-2021||IN two judgments this week||Bogey of sedition||The Supreme Court and the High Courts have been repeatedly harking back to the 1962 verdict to specify what amounts to sedition and what doesn’t, besides taking a serious note of the misuse of the draconian law to stifle the citizens’ freedom of speech and expression, guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. It’s disturbing that sedition cases slapped against journalists and activists are on the rise in recent years. However, most of these cases don’t have a leg to stand on in a court of law as these are largely coercive tactics aimed at silencing dissent and criticism. No wonder their conviction rate, which was 33 per cent in 2016, dropped to just 3 per cent in 2019.It is hoped that the latest judgments will encourage mediapersons to do their job fearlessly and at the same time deter law enforcement agencies from lodging sedition FIRs at the drop of a hat. The verdicts should also serve to caution the powers that be to avoid reducing the law to a terrorising tool.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/bogey-of-sedition-263495
