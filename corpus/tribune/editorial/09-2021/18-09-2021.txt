18-09-2021||THE problem of drug abuse is an acute one and overcoming it requires efforts both at the individual and community levels. For a state like Himachal Pradesh||De-addiction centres||Himachal Pradesh’s geography and contiguous border with Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir, besides the illegal cultivation of banned substances and the inflow of international tourists on a large scale, render the state vulnerable to drug trafficking. While setting up facilities to help people recover, it also has to be borne in mind that long-term treatment to recover from the habit is an expensive affair.Deaths at these centres due to shortage of funds as the number of patients declined is a serious charge and such negligence should not go unpunished. De-addiction centres are not money-minting ventures, and while their viability is important, things should not be allowed to come to such a pass that casualties occur for want of resources. Sensitising the staff, besides dealing with their inadequate numbers, should be a priority, despite it being a tough call.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/de-addiction-centres-312679
18-09-2021||A RESPONSE to China’s expansionist drive in the South China Sea||The AUKUS deal||America’s apprehensions about China have been clear for quite some time, Australia has not shied away from expressing its concerns, and now UK’s presence presents a whole new challenge to Beijing. A line is being drawn to counter the Chinese Communist Party’s aggressive and assertive moves. The geopolitical shift fits in with the growing participation of the world’s biggest democracies to deter China from using its power. Beijing, as expected, has hit out strongly, accusing the countries of a ‘Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice’.For New Delhi, having its closest strategic partners stitch a substantive defence cooperation deal and the opportunity to shore up ties with London can only be reassuring, despite the snub to India’s strong defence partner France, which has now lost a deal with Australia to build submarines. The prominence of the Quad grouping also came through, with the Australian PM calling up Prime Minister Modi and the Japanese premier to keep them in the loop on the new arrangement. While the treaty does hold potential to emerge as a decisive factor in ensuring a stable balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region, China’s insatiable hunger for causing disruption would be the real test.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/the-aukus-deal-312668
