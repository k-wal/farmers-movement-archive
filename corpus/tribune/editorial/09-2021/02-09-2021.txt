02-09-2021||STRINGENTLY upholding the right of the existing residents of a group housing society built by Supertech in Noida||Protecting home buyers||However, as the SC has pointed out the nefarious builder-authorities complicity, justice demands that those responsible for allowing the illegal towers also face the axe. An exemplary punishment to the guilty officials is needed to send a strong warning message to the corruption-ridden real estate sector. Most victimised consumers, even if aware of their rights and rampant wrongdoings, are unfortunately, too weak to fight. But this hard-fought legal victory of the RWA comes as a beacon for the umpteen victims of fraud by builders, as is evident from the courts being clogged with cases that reek of dubious dealings indulged in by conniving developers. It is also heartening to note that the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked the Noida authorities to initiate an inquiry and take strict action against the officials involved in the revision of the original plan.Incidentally, this verdict also promises to be a test case for another foolproof precedent: how to best demolish a built-up, tall structure in a bustling neighbourhood with least hazard to the residents from pollution. The January 2020 razing of towers in Kerala shows some way, but not all, as they stood along the backwaters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/protecting-home-buyers-305269
02-09-2021||THE April-June quarter of the ongoing financial year saw the second wave of Covid-19 wreaking havoc across the country||Expedite GDP growth||Amid localised lockdowns during the second wave, the recovery has been spearheaded by nearly 50 per cent year-on-year rise in manufacturing, 68.3 per cent jump in construction activity and 34.3 per cent growth in services such as trade, hotels and communications. These impressive-looking figures will inevitably come down as the base effect weakens.The ongoing quarter and the following one are crucial for the economy in view of the upcoming festival season, even as the prospect of the third wave looms large. Healthy buying in banking and finance stocks has spurred BSE Sensex and Nifty50 to touch new highs, but the bull run in the overheated stock market is not a benchmark for economic revival. This trend simply indicates that investors are banking on equities rather than once productive sectors that are now in the doldrums, such as real estate, a major source of employment generation that has immense potential to lift the economy. The government needs to support such sectors by restoring demand and consumption to pre-pandemic levels and attracting big investments to usher in sustainable growth, notwithstanding the potential impact of Covidâ€™s future waves.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/expedite-gdp-growth-305268
