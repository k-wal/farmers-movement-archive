27-06-2020||AS the ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement found traction the world over||Towards a fair world||A couple of weeks earlier, Johnson and Johnson, another global cosmetics giant, had decided to pull out the Neutrogena Fine Fairness line from the Indian market on the same grounds. The craze for paler skin types manifests itself most in the matrimonial arena as dark and dusky dames are often made to feel unacceptable. Influential conversations around the unfairness of it made the matrimonial website, shaadi.com, remove its filter for the skin colour after a petition called out the racial bias inherent in it.However, these changes are merely cosmetic and just a small step towards that ideal fair world in which the diversity of the human race is celebrated. Such million-dollar businesses are likely to continue to flourish as their wares, though tweaked a bit in deference to popular sentiment, will not be starved of celebrity endorsements and gullible customers. This prejudice is too deeply embedded in our attitudes and approaches for it to vanish so soon. The ultimate game-changer lies in nurturing a mindset that is rid of the fetish for fair skin.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/towards-a-fair-world-104964
27-06-2020||Acomplete lockdown was enforced at the onset of the pandemic||Lockdown & livelihood||Restrictions notwithstanding, crowding and mingling are fast touching routine levels, precautions are being given the go-by. In such a scenario, should re-imposing a lockdown and confining people to their homes once again be the way forward? Looks like an unaffordable option, though a handful of cities are going ahead with the tough decision. Guwahati is one, while Gurugram studied the Dharavi model of Covid management, with a limited lockdown in containment zones. A three-day window to allow people and industrial units to put things in order was proposed. Not an unreasonable one considering how, looking back, a timeframe to return home and manage affairs could have prevented the chaos and misery that Lockdown 1.0 induced.Gurugram, by the way, is also planning to open its much-touted malls — a curious combine of lockdown and livelihood. Such is the paradox confronting the decision-makers. For the janata, the day starts and ends with an endless flurry of pronouncements on travel curbs, tests and quarantine policies. Instead of reposing public trust in the capacity and capability of the state in ensuring well-being, these manage just the reverse. Clarity of purpose even at this late stage could be a life-saver.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/lockdown-livelihood-104966
