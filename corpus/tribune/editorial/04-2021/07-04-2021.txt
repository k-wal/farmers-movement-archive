07-04-2021||The resignation of Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh||Maharashtra morass||The fact that Param Bir Singh accused Deshmukh of setting extortion targets for police officers only after he was relieved of the post of Police Commissioner can’t be overlooked. The politician-police nexus has been laid bare and the onus is on the investigating agencies to collect airtight evidence against the offenders at various levels in the pecking order.It’s apparent that Waze not only enjoyed political patronage but also had the blessings of his seniors in the police force. More skeletons are likely to tumble out of the cupboard as the investigation progresses. With its credibility hitting a new low, the Maharashtra Police should not shy away from taking tough decisions to cleanse the force. Similarly, the Shiv Sena-led state government needs to show zero tolerance to the criminals in khaki. The Central probe agencies must adopt a no-nonsense approach, uninfluenced by political pressure. The truth, no matter how unpalatable, must come out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/maharashtra-morass-235542
07-04-2021||The French investigative news portal||Middleman, again||According to this online journal, French anti-corruption watchdog Agence Francais Anti-corruption in its routine audit of the contract found that Dassault had agreed to pay an Indian company — middleman Sushen Gupta’s Defsys Solutions — one million euros for producing large replicas of the Rafale jet. But, according to Mediapart, the audit did not find any proof of the replicas being actually made and that ‘the head of the French Public Prosecution Services’ financial crimes branch, Eliane Houlette, shelved investigations into the evidence of corruption behind this deal despite the contrary opinion of her colleagues’.US national Sushen Gupta was arrested for his involvement in the UPA-era VVIP chopper kickback case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and is now out on bail. His name getting linked to the Rafale deal brings to focus the omnipresence of middlemen in India’s defence sector and exposes the hollow claims of successive governments. Whether as brokers routing billion-dollar bribes or as puny go-betweens pocketing million-dollar facilitation fees, Indian taxpayers cannot afford these shadowy characters of the netherworld of defence contracts. The Mediapart allegations should be investigated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/middleman-again-235541
