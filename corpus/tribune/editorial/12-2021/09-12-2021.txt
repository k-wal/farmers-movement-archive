09-12-2021||THE havoc wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic on India’s poorest has devastated millions of households||Unequal Nation||To be sure, the rising inequality in India is consistent with the global trends, with the world’s richest 10% population controlling 76% of the world’s wealth in 2021, according to the World Inequality Report. In terms of incomes, the global top 10% corner 52% of the global income and the bottom 50% get only 8%, while the middle 40% receive 39% of it. Global inequality, however, is driven by the under-developed and developing nations and regions, such as South America, South Asia, China and Russia. In Latin America, for instance, the gulf is the biggest — the top 10% control 77% of the wealth while the bottom 50% own just around 1% of it.In India, since the 1980s, the gulf between the richest and the poorest people has increased alarmingly. In 1982, the top 50% had a 30.9% share of the total income, but this increased over the last 35-odd years. India’s case is complicated by chronic inequalities rooted in religion, caste and superstition. With several unequal educational systems in place, opportunity of social and financial mobility based on education are governed by the accident of birth — rural households are more likely to remain in poverty, and the situation is exacerbated by factors such as caste or religion. Millions of families are caught in a poverty trap. Policy-makers and politicians must address such anomalies on an emergency footing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/unequal-nation-348093
09-12-2021||THE 63-year-old Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA)||Revisit AFSPA||In 2016, the Supreme Court had told the Centre that due process needed to be followed while dealing with civilian complaints reported from areas under AFSPA, adding that the Act didn’t provide blanket immunity to Army personnel in anti-insurgency operations. Indeed, as observed by the court, the continuance of the Act in any region for extended periods underlines the failure of the civil administration as well as the armed forces. The Justice BP Jeevan Reddy Committee and the Administrative Reforms Commission, headed by Veerappa Moily, had recommended repeal of AFSPA a decade and a half ago.In the absence of checks and balances, the Act continues to unleash terror among civilians in several parts of the Northeast, even as it was withdrawn from Tripura in 2015 on the basis of a sensible risk assessment. A review of AFSPA every three months or so is a must to ensure that it is done away with in the states where it has outlived its usefulness. At the same time, violations of the special operating procedure for counter-insurgency operations should invite exemplary punishment. The law enforcers must not be allowed at any cost to become a law unto themselves.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/revisit-afspa-348092
