31-12-2021||Uttar Pradesh’s hall of shame continues to expand||UP shockers||Each day weighs disturbingly heavy as every other corner is a potential spot of doom for unsuspecting girls going about their daily chores. Among those falling prey to trigger-happy goons ready to wield the gun and take the law into their hands at the slightest pretext are girls going out to study with the aim of bettering their parents’ lives. With their 16-year-old girl having been murdered on her way to a coaching class in Bulandshahr, a Dalit family’s hopes lie shattered. Earlier, July saw the barbaric beating to death, allegedly by the grandfather and uncles of a 17-year-old girl, as she had chosen to wear jeans in Deoria district.While the Amethi case has come into the limelight as the viral video of the incident became fodder for the Opposition to take on the authorities in the poll-bound state, most monstrosities perpetrated go unreported and unnoticed. The abysmally low rate of deterring punishment meted out to the guilty only perpetuates the culture of the rule of the might rather than that of the rule of law. The system has failed to ensure a safe environment for the girls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/up-shockers-356455
31-12-2021||Sounding a note of caution||Media's credibility at stake||Such distortions and subjective interpretations are frequently seen in the run-up to various elections. With five states going to the polls in a month or two, the credibility of the media — and the integrity of newspersons — faces the acid test. The CJI, who himself worked for a newspaper back in 1979-80, has stated that he understands how difficult it is for journalists to fulfil the immense responsibility of speaking truth to power, considering the enormous pressure and stress they face every day. It’s commendable that he regards journalism no less noble a profession than the legal vocation, requiring ‘a strong moral fibre and moral compass’.The CJI’s words should spur the Fourth Estate — a key stakeholder in democracy — to introspect and do course correction for the sake of free and fair journalism. This is all the more important in the age of social media, with the hydra-headed menace of fake news spreading its tentacles alarmingly. Mahatma Gandhi, who swore by the sanctity of facts, once said that newspapers were meant primarily to educate the people. That still holds true amid the (mis)information explosion we are grappling with today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/medias-credibility-at-stake-356454
