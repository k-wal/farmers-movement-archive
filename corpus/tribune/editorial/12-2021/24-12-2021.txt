24-12-2021||The Centre has informed the Rajya Sabha that 4||UAPA conviction rate||Though the number of nationwide arrests under UAPA has dropped considerably from 1,948 in 2019 to 1,321 in 2020, the law remains prone to abuse. The three states/UTs with the highest number of arrests last year were Uttar Pradesh (361), Jammu and Kashmir (346) and Manipur (225). It’s not surprising to find UP at the top of the table. The ruling dispensation has been under fire for its high-handed approach to quelling protests, particularly the anti-CAA demonstrations held between December 2019 and March 2020.It’s a citizen’s constitutionally guaranteed right to stage a protest peacefully or express one’s opinion responsibly. Labelling it as a ‘terrorist activity’ is nothing but the State’s desperate ploy to suppress dissent and stifle free speech. No wonder most of the UAPA cases don’t stand judicial scrutiny. The courts have been performing reasonably well as the custodian of people’s rights. The onus is on the governments to desist from vindictive and arbitrary use of UAPA and other such stringent laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/uapa-conviction-rate-353796
24-12-2021||The Lok Sabha clocked 83 hours and 12 minutes of work through 18 sittings in 24 days of the winter session of Parliament||Stormy winter session||Who manages a higher scale in crying foul is of little consequence when a ruling dispensation’s belief systems are conditioned to sidestep norms. Hence, the Opposition should invest in the opportunity of flooding the treasury benches with sharp queries and objections, instead of merely walking out. The responsibility requires an in-depth study of issues and sound preparation. That has not been forthcoming. The residue of the session, adjourned sine die a day early, is sure to resonate in the election arena. Poll duty, in fact, was cited as the reason behind the low attendance of MPs, even of the BJP that makes presence a discipline attribute. The priorities could not have come out more clearly.A steady stream of campaign issues is likely to crop up following the hasty passage of the electoral reform Bill, that throws up several unanswered questions, or the legislation on increasing the age of marriage for women, referred to a panel when that too could have been allowed to sail through. And decidedly over the demand for resignation of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/stormy-winter-session-353797
