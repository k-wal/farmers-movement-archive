11-12-2021||The decision to call off the farmers’ agitation at the Delhi borders is an occasion for celebration and collective relief. As a symbol of social cohesiveness and equanimity||End of farm protests||Economic activity across the region has taken a huge hit owing to the protests, the toll plazas have been lying shut, frequent roadblocks and ‘rail roko’ calls have disrupted life in towns and cities. Yet, despite the prolonged inconveniences, the support for the farmers’ cause has been overwhelming. It’s a triumph of the people, by the people. Their voice has been heard. Victory celebrations are but expected, but it falls upon those at the helm to make sure that the decorum and composure seen at Singhu and Tikri through the year are reflected here too. Over-zealous or rowdy behaviour should have no place.Now that the laws have been repealed, the momentum that the protest generated provides a unique opportunity for a pragmatic approach on the urgent issues that confront the crisis-ridden agriculture sector. Change is difficult, but cannot be ignored any longer, Reform is required, in what form or shape is the question. Projecting MSP as the sole saviour is unrealistic. Tough challenges such as moving away from paddy crop, considering the huge ecological costs that accrue for water-starved Punjab, need to be tackled head-on.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/end-of-farm-protests-348838

Be it the cow slaughter ban or the prohibition of liquor or the then Chief Minister Vijay Rupani’s declaration to convert Gujarat into a ‘vegetarian state’ in his Budget speech of 2017, they have all spurred angry protests. Incidentally, a number of petitions challenging prohibition as an invasion into privacy are pending before the state HC.Earlier in March, the Gurugram MC’s decision to close all meat shops on Tuesdays, allegedly in deference to the religious sentiments of a particular community, had sparked concerns of undue interference. The local bodies must refrain from biting off more than they can chew.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/food-choices-sacred-348839
