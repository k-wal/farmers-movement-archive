22-12-2021||A Madras High Court judge’s suggestion to amend the Constitution mandating that every citizen also has a duty to laugh comes as a whiff of fresh air — something the country has been gasping for||Duty to laugh||The petitioner, a CPI-ML leader, tried tongue-in-cheek wordplay while captioning photographs after a sight-seeing trip with family: ‘Trip to Sirumalai for shooting practice’. For the police, it appeared as a threat to wage war, though the Judicial Magistrate refused remand. ‘Laugh at what?’ is a serious question, the judge said, using the ‘holy cow’ as a metaphor, which varies from person to person, region to region. ‘A real cow, even if terribly emaciated, shall be holy in Yogi’s terrain. In West Bengal, Tagore is such an iconic figure that Khushwant Singh learnt the lesson at some cost. In Tamil Desh, the all-time iconoclast Periyar is a super-holy cow. In Kerala, Marx and Lenin are beyond criticism or satire. Shivaji and Savarkar enjoy a similar immunity in Maharashtra,’ he wrote. And topped it off with what should only attract a good laugh, but could make some see red too: all over India, however, ‘there is one ultimate holy cow and that is national security’.Being funny is one thing, the judge righty states, and poking fun at another is different altogether. Those who have been at the receiving end for their attempt at humour can draw strength from the ruling, but then, a creative process facing combative opposition because of its very nature is anything but funny.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/duty-to-laugh-353128
22-12-2021||THE Election Laws (Amendment) Bill||Electoral reforms||A project to connect biometric data with voter cards was initiated by the Election Commission in March 2015 with the aim of identifying and removing duplicate and bogus voters. The process was halted in August that year by the Supreme Court, which imposed restrictions on the use of Aadhaar data. In all, the names of around 55 lakh voters in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were struck off, some of them erroneously. The deletions were reportedly carried out without undertaking the mandatory door-to-door verification.Database mismatch, possible violation of privacy and other issues which cropped up during the flawed execution of the project need to be addressed to make the new law achieve its purpose. It is also imperative to ensure that the sacrosanct secrecy of the ballot is not compromised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/electoral-reforms-353125
