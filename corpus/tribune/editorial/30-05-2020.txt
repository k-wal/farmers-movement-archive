30-05-2020||Developing a safe||Covid vaccine||Even as the current focus worldwide is on lowering the mortality rate and testing potential drugs to combat Covid-19, vaccine development is posing a major challenge to governments as well as scientists and researchers. A vital factor here is speed: how quickly can the vaccine be developed so as to rein in the virus? America’s Operation Warp Speed intends to compress 10 years of vaccine development and testing into just a few months. The US Department of Health and Human Services and AstraZeneca, a multinational pharma company, are on the job promising to make available at least 300 million doses of a vaccine, with the first ones likely to be supplied as early as October this year.The pressure to fast-track the process, however, should not override the considerations of safety and ethics. A misfire would not only bring the developers back to the drawing board but also trigger potentially disastrous complications. Cooperation between nations would be put to the test as the race for the vaccine hots up in the coming months. Due diligence can help India emerge among the pioneers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/covid-vaccine-91883
30-05-2020||Relatively unscathed in Europe||Inhospitable terrain||As the punishing heat scorches the plains, it is the hill states that are bearing the brunt. Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are looking at a summer with near-zero business. For the Kashmir valley, under lockdown since August 5, 2019, it could well end up as a year without tourists. The huge impact on livelihoods is not difficult to fathom. Job losses are being predicted for 70 per cent of the estimated direct and indirect workforce of 5.5 crore in the country. As hotels shut down because of the credit stress, RBI’s six-month debt-servicing holiday is of little help, given the expected duration of demand decline. Any start of recovery is being seen as three to four quarters away.The Centre’s package had barely anything for this critical GDP and foreign exchange-earner industry. There are no easy answers to the crisis, but an immediate bailout and assistance is necessary. For a start, the government can have a relook at the demands for interest and collateral-free funds for paying salaries and operating costs, and a part waiver of liabilities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/inhospitable-terrain-91882
