16-11-2020||BARELY three months after it held activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt of court||Test of magnanimity||It’s nobody’s case that the Supreme Court is always right and can’t be criticised at all. Some of the issues raised by Kamra are legitimate. But it appears that while attempting to push the boundary, the comedian has crossed it. He should know freedom comes with responsibility. The Supreme Court has two options available to it. First, it can hold Kamra guilty of contempt of court and send him to jail. Second, it can follow the House of Lords, which in the Spycatcher case spared Daily Mirror that had published an upside-down picture of three law lords with the caption, ‘You Old Fools’. The House of Lords said if one was a fool or not was a matter of perception.In a democratic set-up, the dynamics of the relationship between citizens and institutions need not be governed by letters of law alone. Given the fact that Kamra is a comedian, expected to prick and provoke to elicit a good laugh, showing magnanimity is a far better option as it would enhance the court’s credibility as an institution. In any case, nobody takes a comedian seriously. Why should the Supreme Court?||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/test-of-magnanimity-171001
16-11-2020||A ban is only as good as its implementation. The National Green Tribunal’s ban on the sale or use of firecrackers in the National Capital Region till November 30||Bang eclipses ban||The performance of states such as Punjab, which had declared a two-hour window for the use of green crackers, also left a lot to be desired. If you give law-breakers an inch, they will take a mile. With the cops shutting their ears to all the noise, it was child’s play for revellers to keep bursting crackers — green or otherwise.Both the governments as well as the public are responsible for the fiasco. All the anti-cracker awareness campaigns seem to have yielded little. Even the surge in Covid-19 cases amid worsening air pollution did not deter people from defying the ban. Despite the NGT’s scathing observation that ‘celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases’, there was blatant disregard for the law as well as public health. Action against the violators should not be mere tokenism. Accountability of officials who didn’t bother to enforce the ban should also be fixed. The chalta hai attitude has to be stopped — if we want to breathe once the festivities are over.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/bang-eclipses-ban-171002
