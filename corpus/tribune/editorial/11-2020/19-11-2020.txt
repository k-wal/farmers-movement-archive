19-11-2020||INDIA’S electronic media has been in the news this year mostly for the wrong reasons||Regulating TV channels||The News Broadcasters’ Association and the News Broadcasting Standards Authority, both private bodies, are dealing with complaints against the electronic media. If they are not doing their job properly, as noted by the apex court, it is the Centre’s responsibility to intervene and ensure compliance with provisions of the 1995 Act. The government needs to issue advisories and warnings from time to time to make errant channels mend their ways. The feedback from viewers should also be factored in while contemplating action in such cases.Earlier this year, the Supreme Court had observed that ‘governments do not act till we direct them to’. If the authorities handle situations in a decisive and timely way within the existing legal framework, judicial intervention would no longer be required. Nor would there be any need for a repressive, intrusive regulatory mechanism.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/regulating-tv-channels-172413
19-11-2020||Wednesday saw Kapil Sibal lashing out at Amit Shah over his ‘Gupkar gang’ remark||Congress confronts itself||Sibal and the other 22 ‘letter writers’ have done precious little for the Bihar campaign or for the party as a whole other than repeating ad nauseam that the Congress is not an effective alternative. Electoral losses bear that out. He does find himself on the wrong side of the high command with remarks that if for six years the Congress has not introspected, ‘what hope do we have now?’ Frustration borne out of insignificance and inaccessibility is a common injury in the political arena. No party is immune from the dynamics of infighting. What is hurting the polity and should be of great concern to the Congress is its growing inability to inspire confidence even as the principal Opposition party, forget about being regarded as a serious substitute. Another ‘letter writer’ criticising the government for staying away from RCEP, which the Congress wanted, points to the crisis the party is staring at.Sibal, who considers himself a poet, has been offered couplets of Bahadur Shah Zafar to make amends. The advice he has been given is to look within for flaws and be prepared for a long struggle. Sibal and his comrades would do well to make a difference in their own constituencies as an example to the rest of the party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/congress-confronts-itself-172414
