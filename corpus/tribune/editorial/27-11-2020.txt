27-11-2020||Diego Maradona||Matchless Maradona||Maradona can perhaps be understood as the product of the time and place of his origin: A poor boy from the shanties of Buenos Aires, for whom football was an escape from poverty, who came of age in the 1970s, when it was not strange for sportspersons to live like rockstars, in an unending cycle of playing, partying and playing. And could he play! A teenaged genius, he couldn’t get into the national team which went on to win the 1978 World Cup because the coach thought that at 18, he was too young. His time came eight years later when he powered Argentina to their second World Cup crown. Four years later, at 30, he was slower but still clever enough to manoeuvre his team to the final.In the 1994 World Cup, he tested positive for dope and thus began a spiralling descent. He became a parody of himself, fat and unfit, a regular resident of hospitals from which, almost by miracle, he continued to come out alive. Maradona lived life on his own terms and never became part of the ‘system’. Sadly, his rebellion was without a cause. But such is the nature of genius sometimes, and thus we mourn the loss of a colossus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/matchless-maradona-176484
27-11-2020||INDIA has been in the throes of the Covid-19 pandemic for the past about nine months. The two-month-long nationwide lockdown||Stick to Covid protocol||It’s inexplicable that the authorities are again opting to restrict public movement even though these steps have largely failed to contain the virus and have even been counter-productive at times. What purpose would be served by the night curfew when residents are thronging markets and other places in the daytime? The Covid protocol — wearing a mask, practising social distancing, no spitting — is being blatantly violated. That’s where lies the nub of the problem.At a time when the economy is making steady recovery, the laxity of the law enforcement agencies and the irresponsible behaviour of the people are threatening to undo the gains. In Delhi, which recently quadrupled the fine for not wearing a mask in public, the police are issuing 1,000-1,500 challans daily — a paltry number considering that the Capital is reporting over 5,000 cases and 100-odd fatalities every day. Most of the other states are not even doing this much to deter violators. The vaccine will arrive sooner or later. But there’s not a minute to lose for abiding by the protocol — in letter and spirit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/stick-to-covid-protocol-176485
