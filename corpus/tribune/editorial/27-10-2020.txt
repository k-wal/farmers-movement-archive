27-10-2020||When Michael Schumacher retired from Formula-1 racing||Driving a fast car||Hamilton’s achievements are extraordinary — he has won 92 of 262 races he entered in, for a success rate of 35.11%, a record vastly superior to Schumacher’s (91 wins in 308 races, 29.55%). Hamilton also owns the record for being the top qualifier in 97 races, 29 more than Schumacher. Hamilton was lucky to be at the right place at the right time, for Mercedes have put together the most dominant car ever in Formula-1 history. After finishing second in 2013, Mercedes will clinch the team title for the seventh time in a row this season. Hamilton has won 71 races and qualified in top position 71 times since moving to Mercedes. It's a union made in Formula-1 heaven.Some experts believe Hamilton enjoys an unfair advantage due to the quality of his car, and that he is such a great champion only because he drives an extraordinary car. All other things being equal, the fastest and steadiest car always wins — the skill of the driver is irrelevant if he’s driving a bad car. Hamilton takes umbrage at such opinions, but it’s accurate to say of his partnership with Mercedes that the most dominant Formula-1 car ever is being driven by a truly great driver, and the numbers reflect that.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/driving-a-fast-car-161526
27-10-2020||Winds of change are blowing through Indian homes long stuck in patriarchy and preference for son||Hoshiarpur, now||What every political functionary and member of the civil society should feel outraged over is the normalisation of criminality. Instead, the slugfest is reserved for who expressed what extent of rage over which rape or murder and in which state. Expecting the BJP not to react to the Hoshiarpur rape-murder would have been political naivety, but comparisons with the Hathras case are imprudent. The police in Punjab at least did not force the victim’s family to undergo a narco test. There was, unlike in Uttar Pradesh, no delay or obfuscation. But a heinous crime was committed. The trauma the child was subjected to and what the family will live with is indescribable. That should be the talking point, the trigger for winds of change.The 2012 Nirbhaya case led to a host of reforms, but partial implementation and under-utilisation of the safety fund are huge drawbacks. The low conviction rate for rape cases, the increase in crimes against women, and insensitive-untrained first-responders are major problem areas. These ought to be subjects of every debate on such crime and punishment. The change that is sought is too slow, and too less.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/hoshiarpur-now-161525
