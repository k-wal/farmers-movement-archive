15-12-2020||Don’t call our farmers names. So far||Stop the name-calling||Instead, if they are tarred with the brush of separatism, it will stick longer than is desired. It is a dangerous ploy to corner those who are not even political opponents of the Union government. Most of them would hail Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a saviour, if their apprehensions are allayed. Farmers know what is best for them more than any bureaucrat or entrepreneur. They are worried because the promised investment in the farm sector should have ideally happened in Bihar or Uttar Pradesh, where there are no legal hurdles nor adequate procurement. Or else, innovations in cold chain and price assurance could have been introduced to save vegetable farmers. Our horticulture, pisciculture and poultry segments are not world class yet. Still, corporates are setting up silos in Punjab and Haryana, focusing on the well-oiled foodgrain business.Paternalistic condescension and dirty tricks can only radicalise harmless protesters who celebrate the agitation as an idealistic pilgrimage for a common cause or a mela that they ought not to miss. There is nothing sinister in this festival of democracy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/stop-the-name-calling-184403
15-12-2020||INDIA has borne the brunt of terrorism in recent decades||UN Convention on terror||Naidu’s statement coincided with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s remark that cross-border terrorism is a ‘perennial problem’ for India. The role of the Pakistani deep state in terror attacks on Indian soil has been repeatedly established. The prospect of being blacklisted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global terror financing watchdog, has forced Pakistan to crack down on ‘global terrorists’ like Hafiz Saeed. However, such desperate measures have failed to convince India and the international community of Pakistan’s sincerity about stamping out terrorism emanating from its territory.As India occupies its seat in the UN Security Council next month for a two-year term, drumming up support for the CCIT should be among its top priorities. In June this year, India had asserted that streamlining the sanctions against terrorists and terror entities would be one of its focus areas at the global high table. With extremist violence becoming a worldwide phenomenon, India should impress upon the UN the dire need to close ranks against countries that aid or abet terrorism.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/un-convention-on-terror-184404
