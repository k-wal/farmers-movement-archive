29-07-2020||Covid-19 is spreading thick and fast in India||Prioritise treatment||Numbers tell only half the story, more so when the government chooses to highlight only the favourable figures. It’s true that India’s mortality rate is falling gradually, but the number of deaths is as high as 600-700 per day — over 10 per cent of the current daily toll worldwide. In terms of overall fatalities, India is at the sixth place, but it will inevitably move up the ladder in the next few weeks.Ramping up testing is welcome, but it alone does not guarantee a solution. The focus, as of now, should be on treatment, while ensuring adequate supply of approved drugs such as dexamethasone and remdesivir. Some Covid care centres in the country have thousands of beds at their disposal, but do all these have proportionate health staff to handle the ever-rising caseload? Considering that the systemic inadequacies have not yet been addressed, it’s hardly surprising that most states can’t think beyond reimposition of the lockdown to check the spread of the virus. But, as the WHO has said, there are no shortcuts out of the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/prioritise-treatment-119335
29-07-2020||The education sector is one of the most impacted by the pandemic. It is faced by challenges that have no easy answers as the academic year pans out||Education in disarray||Naturally, these dire circumstances have also shaken the institutions of education — schools, colleges and universities — as they grapple with the trying times. With no government aid or relief forthcoming, many a private college and school have been forced to shut shop. Some schools have the onerous task of forcibly collecting fees from parents to remain in the reckoning. In the process, it is the teachers who have had to bear the brunt. The educators have been expected to rise to the occasion by mastering the science and art of taking classes online even as they suffer pay cuts rampantly. Then, to secure their jobs, some private schools have put the onus of enrolling children and collecting fees on the beleaguered lot. It speaks a lot for their distress as they venture out at risk of catching the virus.It is time the government looked into the catastrophic financial stress that Covid-10 has dealt on the private education sector and think of ways to save it from ruin. At stake are millions of educators and students as well as their parents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/education-in-disarray-119301
