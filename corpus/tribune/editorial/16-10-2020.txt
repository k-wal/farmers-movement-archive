16-10-2020||The much-awaited meeting between the Union agriculture secretary and representatives of farmers’ organisations from Punjab turned out to be unproductive||Stark disconnect||It’s clear that the Centre has so far failed to convince farmers about the potential benefits of the new legislations. The ploy of passing off the stir as being Punjab-centric — even though there is growing resentment across the country — has also come a cropper. The all-important exercise of engaging with the stakeholders is being carried out now, over four months after the contentious laws were introduced as ordinances during the lockdown.With farm unions deciding to lay siege to the houses of BJP leaders, the ruling party will find it harder to turn the tide. Merely reiterating that agriculture is the government’s top priority won’t help. Vilifying farmers’ leaders or Opposition parties will only defeat the purpose of holding a meaningful debate. The powers that be should be open to suggestions, recommendations and if required, course correction. On their part, various farmers’ organisations need to work cohesively to achieve common goals. A middle ground has to be found at the earliest; otherwise, the normally resilient agriculture sector might struggle to spur India’s economic recovery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/stark-disconnect-156508
16-10-2020||In a move that promises to empower women by giving them a socio-economic uplift||Job quota for women||It will also go a long way in correcting the skewed gender statistics of Punjab. As per a government report, women account for just a quarter of the staff. This, despite the 50% reservation for women in the teachers’ cadre. Reflecting the patriarchal mindset — that holds back women from going all out for financial liberation — is the fact that less than one-third of the job seekers in the employment exchange are women. It is a pity, given that there is no dearth of meritorious women candidates. The percentage of girls passing out of colleges and universities — and, with distinction — is steadily increasing as compared to boys. Punjab needs to work harder to catch up with the national average in the female workforce, too. A sixth Economic Census document released in 2014 shows that the percentage of female workers in the total persons employed is 18.21% in Punjab as against the 25.56% at the national level.Even as the government provides ‘ghar ghar rozgar’, it needs to introspect why, as per a Niti Aayog study, fewer women are stepping out to earn their livelihood in the past decade. Evidence points at patriarchy and the non-congenial atmosphere for women at most workplaces. The problem must be fixed. For, the economy cannot improve until 50% of the population feels safe to contribute its mite.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/job-quota-for-women-156507
