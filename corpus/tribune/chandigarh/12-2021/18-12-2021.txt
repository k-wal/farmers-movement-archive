18-12-2021||Kolkata||Khushi walks away with maiden golf title||Jaipur golfer Khushi Khanijau turned in a stunning birdie-birdie finish to emerge as a deserving winner in the 15th and final leg of the Women’s Pro-Golf Tour at Royal Calcutta Golf Club. Khushi (21), who turned professional in 2018, broke into the winner’s circle for the first time.Khushi’s previous best was tied second, (alongside Tvesa Malik) and behind Amandeep Drall, in her rookie year in 2018 at the Boulder Hills in Hyderabad. Khushi became the fifth first-time winner in 2021 after Jahanvi Bakshi, who added three more wins, Seher Atwal and Lakhmehar Pardesi and amateur Avani Prashanth.Khushi shot an even-par 72 on the strength of three birdies in the last four holes, during which she also had a bogey on 16th. Her round of 72, the best of the day, got her to a total of 229, one better than the trio of amateur Smriti Bhargava (77), Shweta Mansingh (77) and overnight leader Seher Atwal (80), all of whom tied for second.As Khushi played in the second last group, she finished at 229 and waited for the final group. A birdie for any of the three, Smriti, Seher and Shweta, playing together, would have sent the tournament into a play-off. However, all three parred and stayed one behind to share the runner-up spot.While Khushi landed four birdies, three of them in the last four holes, neither Smriti Bhargav nor Seher managed to find any birdies on the final day.Khushi, starting the day seven shots behind the leader Seher, had a spotless front nine with one birdie on the par-4 sixth and eighth pars. She, however, suffered a setback on 10th and 11th, which she bogeyed. However, the lead group behind her were having problems of their own.Khushi got an unexpected chance as the lead group started dropping a lot of shots. Smriti was two-over for the back nine, Shweta was three-over and Seher suffered with six-over 42 on the home stretch. In contrast, Khushi was just one-over and that helped her to become the clubhouse leader. She kept that lead as the final trio was unable to make any gains on the 18th.Amateur Jahnavi Prakhya was fifth, while Lakhmehar was sixth and Oviya Reddi seventh. Saaniya Sharma, Neha Tripathi and Jyotsana Singh completed the top-10 in the final event of 2021. Amandeep Drall managed to stay ahead and win the Hero Order of Merit, which has been combined for 2020 and 2021. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/khushi-walks-away-with-maiden-golf-title-351639

The training programme is a mandatory condition for the promotion of constables to the post of head constable.Constables Jagjit Singh and Jagjinder Singh have approached the Chandigarh Bench of CAT through their advocate, Dr Sumati Jund, after their names were not included in the list of the constables named for the programme.They said they had been serving on the post of constable in the Chandigarh Police for many years. Both of them are facing regular departmental enquiries. Due to the pendency of these regular departmental inquiries, the DGP excluded their names from List-B issued by its office order dated November 30, 2021, for the training programme .The List-B is released by the DGP after every few years for the purpose of filling the existing vacancies (total 329 posts of head constable) in accordance with Rule 13.7 of the Punjab Police Rules, 1934, for the purpose of selecting constables for admission to promotion course/lower school course at Police Training College.The course is one of the basic prerequisites for promoting the constables to the post of head constable.On the other hand, the counsel for the respondents said their names had not been excluded from the list, but kept in the sealed cover subject to the outcome of the departmental inquiries pending against them. In case they are exonerated in the departmental/criminal proceedings, they will be eligible to be deputed for Lower School Course in the next batch after the exoneration and will be eligible to be given a deemed date of List B retrospectively.After hearing the arguments, the CAT Chandigarh Bench, comprising Suresh Kumar Monga, Member (J) and Rakesh Kumar Gupta member (A), said the stage of selection of constables for their nomination to the Lower Training Course couldn’t be considered to be a part of the selection process for promotion to the rank of Head Constables. It only makes them eligible for being considered for selection for promotion to the post of head constable, once they have passed the requisite Lower School Course.“In view of this, the respondents are directed to reconsider the case of the applicants, and to include them in List “B” and depute them to attend the lower school training programme, forthwith, if eligible otherwise. It will only be at the time, when their actual promotion to Head Constable rank is considered, that the guidelines, prescribed by the DOPT regarding sealed cover procedure, may be followed, if they have any departmental inquiry pending against them, at that time,” says the order issued by the Bench.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/departmental-probe-no-bar-to-attending-promotion-course-cat-bench-351598

The former Army Chief stressed that justice should not only be done but should also be seen to have been done.Justice Rajive Bhalla, former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, who moderated a panel discussion on aspects relating to military law, said liberty as enjoyed by the common citizen is not available to military personnel because of provisions of Article 33 of the Constitution. The article empowers Parliament to place restrictions on the rights of armed forces personnel and certain other categories of employees.Prof Eugene R Fidell from Yale School of Law, US; Justice Maria Elizabeth Rocha from the Superior Court, Brazil; Maya Heller, judge in Israel; Prof Shruti Bedi, from the University Institute of Legal Studies, Chandigarh, and Pascal Levesque, former legal officer, Canadian Armed Forces, participated in the discussion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/military-justice-must-adapt-to-legal-social-changes-gen-vp-malik-351596

In 2017, our client brought this fact to the various departments concerned but nobody paid heed.”Kothari subsequently filed a criminal complaint u/s 156(3) to the CJM, Panchkula.“Going through every fact and record given by the Health Department, the court has ordered the registration of an FIR against the company and its officials,” the complainant’s advocates added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/court-orders-registration-of-fir-against-company-351593

The traffic on the Zirakpur flyover was also moving at a snail’s pace.Harvinder Singh of Mayur Vihar in Delhi said he had reached Dera Bassi after driving continuously for four hours and now he had been stuck in the jam for more than two hours. He said the police should have taken steps to divert the traffic so that people were not stuck in the jam.The Mohali police had already made elaborate arrangements for diverting the traffic from the Chhat village traffic lights to other routes to prevent a traffic jam but long queues of vehicles could be seen on the highway from Chandigarh to Zirakpur. The protesters had parked a truck diagonally at the crossing in Zirakpur to block the traffic movement towards the Chhat village.Amandeep Singh, district vice-president of the All-India Truck Ekta Union, said they would continue to hold protest and block the traffic movement daily till their demands were not fulfilled. He said they demanded from the Channi government that these truck unions be revived besides increasing the rates of transport as truck operators were already suffering due to the economic shutdown.Leader threatens state-level stirAmandeep Singh, district vice-president of the All-India Truck Ekta Union, said if their demands were not met, then they would intensify their protest by holding a state level protest. The step to abolish the truck unions had created a syndicate which had monopolised the transport business, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/truckers-continue-protest-commuters-bear-the-brunt-351592
