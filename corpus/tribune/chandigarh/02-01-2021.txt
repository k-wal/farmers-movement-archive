He claimed the centre was not mentioned even in the application form.The commission has directed the PGI to treat the order as Admit Card for the test to be held on January 3. To make sure that the career of the complainant does not get affected, the commission passed the order the same day the case was listed, without issuing notice to the PGI.Aditya Sahni approached the commission after he was allotted the examination centre at Hisar by the PGI. He said despite the fact that he gave the option of three centres for examination, the PGI issued him Admit Card wherein he was surprisingly allotted the centre at Sumit Dhariwal Memorial Group of Institutions, Hisar, Haryana, which is 300 km away from his native place of Chandigarh. He said he preferred the examination centres at Chandigarh (tricity), Ambala and Patiala in the application form.He said the Hisar centre was not even mentioned in the option. Sahni said he had no personal conveyance to approach the centre allotted to him in this situation of Covid 19. He also pleaded that even the bypass roads had been blocked by the agitating farmers.After hearing the petition, the commission said the complainant is residing in Sector 23B, Chandigarh, at present. The commission, comprising Rajan Dewan (president) and members Priti Malhotra and BM Sharma, passed the order.“The examination is scheduled to be held on January 3, 2021. Therefore, in this short span of time, it is not possible to first issue notice to the PGI. Thus, keeping in view the peculiar circumstances of the case and urgency of the matter concrete, directions are required to be issued.”The order further says that it is apparent from the record that as per the recruitment notice issued by the ICMR, there is no mention of Hisar as centre. It is very surprising how the PGI allotted Hisar as examination venue to the complainant.“To make sure that the career of the complainant may not get affected, we direct the PGI to allow the complainant to appear for the examination for the post at any examination centre in Chandigarh which have been chosen by them for conducting the examination for the post. This order be also considered as an admit card for the complainant for appearing for the examination at the Chandigarh centre of the PGI. The PGI is also directed to comply with the order in letter and in spirit. In case the order is not complied with by the PGI, then the complainant would be at liberty to file execution application.

However, when he reached the hotel around 10 pm, he was refused accommodation by the hotel on account of some issues.Hakam Chand Sharma, a resident of Mohali, approached the commission after the hotel also failed to refund the booking amount despite repeated requests.Sharma lodged a complaint that he had booked one room through Oravel Stays Private Limited, Gurugram, at Hotel Ashoka Regency, Ambala (Haryana), for a night in 2019 by paying an amount of Rs650.The complainant said the booking was confirmed by the opposite parties — Oravel Stays Private Limited and Ashoka Regency — vide an SMS dated July 17, 2019.
