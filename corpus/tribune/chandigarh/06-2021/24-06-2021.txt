Our government is fully committed for the welfare of our sportspersons," Singh tweeted.Talking to the media, para-athlete Sanjeev Kumar said they were not given jobs by the state government despite assurances.Kumar said he had won many medals and awards, including the Punjab government's prestigious Maharaja Ranjit Singh Award.Another para-athlete, Veena Arora of Amritsar, also asked the Punjab government to provide jobs to them.Taking a dig at the government, the protesters said if it could offer jobs to the sons of two Congress MLAs on compassionate grounds, then there is no reason why it cannot give jobs to them.They were referring to the Punjab cabinet's decision to appoint Qadian MLA Fatehjang Singh Bajwa's son Arjun Partap Singh Bajwa as an inspector in the Punjab Police and Ludhiana MLA Rakesh Pandey's son Bhisham Pandey as a naib tehsildar in the Revenue Department on "compassionate" grounds.AAP legislator Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said the special athletes were more qualified and fit for government jobs than the sons of Congress MLAs and leaders.The Amarinder Singh-led Congress government made a lot of announcements for sportspersons, but most of them are living in poverty now, he said.The AAP leader added that para-athletes had staged a 'dharna' last year as well to remind the government of its promise of jobs to them.

However, the authorities are positive about conducting championships from August. “Yes, we will surely try to conduct championships this year. Our sportspersons have already faced a huge loss as there was no tournament in the last session.

However, the process was delayed by 15 days due to the extension of the admission process. Later in December, the plans were further postponed due to the online exams. The first lot of inter-college competitions was scheduled for the first week of November 2020 and entries were invited till October 15. In July, the department had released their annual sports calendar for all affiliated colleges of Punjab and Chandigarh.Meanwhile, authorities are also expecting some announcement from the Associations of Indian Universities (AIU) in terms of conducting championships.“The Panjab University follows AIU’s schedule of intervarsity championships for conducting their inter-college championships.

He said the centres were being operated by organisations in a highly professional manner with qualified doctors and nurses and provided food, medicines and other required services to Covid patients free of cost.“Since the number of Covid patents has reduced sharply and presently, there are only seven patients in the mini-Covid care centres, we need to decide about the future of these centres,” he said.With the threat of third wave looming large, two options with regard to the centres were given to the organisations — closure of the centre after all patients are discharged and vacation of the premises or temporary closure of the centre and retaining the premises with own security arrangements up to September 30 this year.Garg requested the organisations to communicate the preference in the next three days. As many as seven organisations were given the permission to run mini-Covid care centres. However, one organisation had already closed down its centre due to lack of patients.As the caseload on hospitals increased with a sudden surge in Covid cases, the UT Administration gave a clarion call for setting up mini Covid care centres in the City voluntarily by any individual, association, organisation, NGO, religious body, corporate, firm or trust for asymptomatic Covid patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/shut-mini-covid-care-units-or-retain-premises-till-sept-30-chandigarh-to-operators-273011
