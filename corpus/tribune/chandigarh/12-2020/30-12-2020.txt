The parents are veterans of many counter-terrorist operations and other high-profile security duties.The names of the pups are Ane-la, Galwan, Sasoma, Chip-chap, Saser, Srijap, Charding, Rezang, Daulat, Sultan-chusku, Imis, Rango, Yula, Mukhpri, Chung-Thung, Khardungi and Shyok. "By giving these K-9 Indian names, that too from the areas guarded by the Force, it is for the first time since Independence that the K-9 wing of the country will acknowledge its own legacy and ethos," an ITBP officer said.The Force plans that the next batch of pups will be named after other prominent names of the icy frontiers where ITBP is deployed, covering the entire 3,488-km-long border with China from Karakoram to Jechap La.The ITBP has also received requests from other Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) for these pups to be used for their security duties.The ITBP was the first force to deploy Malinois dogs in left-wing extremism-hit areas a decade ago, and now it has also started scientifically breeding K9s to meet its own demands and also provide pups to other CAPFs and state police forces as mandated by the Ministry of Home Affairs.The 90,000-strong ITBP was raised in 1962 in the aftermath of the Chinese aggression and apart from its primary duty to guard the China border, it is also tasked to carry out various internal security duties, including anti-Naxal operations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/new-itbp-pups-named-after-flashpoints-in-ladakh-191448

In Chandigarh on Christmas Eve for a live performance, Sunil says his affair with the city goes long back.“I look forward to visiting Chandigarh at this time of the year, when winter is at its peak. You miss this weather in Mumbai. And going by the pandemic changing a lot of plans, I am happy at least I could pay a visit and feel the cold in my bones. I missed being on stage and having that interaction with the audience. Their love is what makes us who we are,” he says.Chandigarh daysRecalling his days at Chandigarh, as he studied in GGDSD College, Sector 32, and afterwards completed postgraduation from Theatre Department, Panjab University, he says students loved this time of the year when they could crash into many parties! “Students are always good at enjoying free treats.” And if he would get some time post his show, he would definitely savour the paranthas outside General Hospital, Sector 16!Testing timesAs 2020 is nearing its end, his expectations from 2021 are the same. He adds, “There is not much to add in the list of expectations. Entertainment industry suffered this year. I cannot comment on how stand-up scene in the country or other comedians got affected by the sudden standstill Corona brought along with it, but I suffered for sure.”Positive noteHowever, one good experience for him was shooting at Pataudi Place for the upcoming series, Tandav, which also happens to be his digital debut. The political drama, which will release on January 15, also stars Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia, Mohd. Zeeshan Ayyub, Kritika Kamra and Amyra Dastur. Sunil adds, “Politics and power is the crux of the web series. I enjoyed playing the character of Gurpal Chauhan and Ali Abbas Zafar has been a great director. It was a beautiful break where we got to play cricket together at Pataudi Palace.”So, does he understand politics post the show? “I would not say that I know it all, but I have started to get a fair idea about politics and how things are twisted in our country. A little more understanding and I think I would be able to comment more.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/actor-comedian-sunil-grover-says-he-misses-the-good-old-days-spent-in-city-beautiful-191415

The 3D visualisation is guided by a scope from outside, compared to the usual 2D visualisation from inside in the endoscope. Many centres in India have 2D exoscopes, but 3D exoscope at the PGI is the first in India.This technique is helpful to deal with problems on the surface of the brain, spine and orbit.

She was initially appointed as the member (women) of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, UT, on a whole-time basis for a period of five years vide order dated March 24, 2015. She completed her tenure on March 26, 2020. She was re-appointed on the same post on a whole-time basis w.e.f. March 27, 2020. She was allotted a government house in September 2015 by the Administration. She made requests to the Administration to allow her to retain the same house in her second tenure also.The Chandigarh Administration, vide its notification in July 2019, has amended Government Residences (Chandigarh Administration General Pool) Allotment Rules, 1996. The amended rules say only chairpersons of Human Rights Commissions, Lokayuktas, Chief Information Commissioners, State Election Commissioners and Chief Commissioners of Right to Service/Transparency and Accountability Commissions as established by the State Government of Punjab, Haryana and UT Chandigarh Administration will be entitled for government accommodation. The application of any other commission/authority constituted by state government/UT Administration will not be considered irrespective of any provision in their appointment letter. They can be provided financial compensation for securing accommodation by their appointing authority.The UT has also amended another rule in March 2020 by which the rate of penal rent has been enhanced manifold.Malhotra contended she continues to hold the post of the member, District Commission, right from 2015 without even a day’s break and as such, no change in allotment of government accommodation could be made in her case as her terms and conditions of the service remain the same as in her earlier tenure in the office. In view of this, she has sought quashing of the orders issued by the Estate Office cancelling her accommodation and levying the penal rent as per the amended rules.After hearing the arguments, the CAT Bench noted that the appointment of the applicant is not in continuation. Re-appointment is different from continuation as it involves going through a process of selection resulting in fresh appointment. The Consumer Protection Act as well as the rules do not provide for continuation. They only provide for appointment and re-appointment of president and members. So, she was obviously to be governed by the notification of July 2019 issued by the Administration.The Bench said the July 2019 amendment to rules was a general amendment and reflected a policy decision taken by the government. It was not for this Tribunal to interfere in the policy decisions of the government.“In view of clear provisions of the amendment notification, the applicant is not entitled to government accommodation. She has no vested right for claiming government accommodation and the same is not part of her appointment letter or terms and conditions of her service as provided in the relevant rules. As such, I do not see any reason for interfering in the executive order cancelling her government accommodation,” says the order passed by Ajanta Dayalan, member (A) of CAT.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/tribunal-refuses-to-interfere-in-house-allotment-rule-amendments-by-chandigarh-191281

However, the next process for delimitation of wards, which was to be held in 2015 on the basis of the 2011 Census, could not be conducted as the issue of merger of the villages with the MC was still pending.The Delimitation Committee for wards had received several objections and suggestions against the draft notification issued by the Local Government Department, UT Administration, on December 9.However, in the final report submitted by the committee, boundaries of several newly proposed wards, including Sector 13 and Sector 38 (West), were altered. But, the total number of wards increased in the draft notification from the existing 26 to 35 would remain the same.In an objection filed with the committee, Col Gursewak Singh (retd), president, Resident Welfare Association (RWA), Modern Housing Complex (MHC), had submitted that the notification on delimitation of wards had caused a great deal of anguish and resentment among residents of 3,353 dwelling units of the MHC in Sector 13. It was noticed that the ward proposed defied logic and thus rejected by all residents of the MHC, he had stated.He had submitted that the main objection was that the proposed ward number 4 would be divided into three different pockets with no contiguity. Moreover, clubbing of high-revenue generating MHC with faraway Basti Kishangarh, having large rural voters, would be counter-productive, he had stated.The department had invited views, comments or suggestions, if any, from the general public and other stakeholders on the draft notification within seven days. The process was necessitated as the MC is going to the poll in December 2021.On the basis of the 2001 Census, the last delimitation of wards was held in 2006. However, the next process for delimitation of wards, which was to be held in 2015 on the basis of the 2011 Census, could not be conducted as the issue of merger of the villages with the MC was still pending.At present, there are 26 wards in the MC, which include sectors and nine villages. The 13 new villages that were included in the MC last year only are Bahlana, Raipur Khurd, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra, Daria, Mauli Jagran, Kishangarh, Kaimbwala, Khuda Ali Sher, Khuda Jassu, Khuda Lahora, Sarangpur and Dhanas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/delimitation-report-gets-nod-with-minor-changes-191279

The NIV will find out whether any new mutation of Covid-19 has taken place in the country or not. In the UK, the new variant of coronavirus took place in September and it is very much possible that a new strain may have been introduced here as well.”The development comes after a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus was reported by the UK to the World Health Organization. This variant is estimated by the European Centre for Disease Control to be more transmissible and affecting the younger population.So far, all UK returnees in the city, who were sampled for Covid-19, have tested negative. As per the protocol established by the government, if any UK-returnee tests positive with the RT-PCR, then genetic sequencing will be done to see whether the results are consistent with current circulating SARS-CoV-2 or new variant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/pgi-sends-covid-samples-to-check-virus-mutation-191271

30-12-2020||Sandeep Rana||Hourly parking fee in phased manner soon in Chandigarh||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 29Hourly fee at 89 paid parking lots in the city will be introduced in a phased manner from January onwards as smart features have not been implemented in all facilities.At parking spaces where such features have been introduced, the MC would allow contractors to start charging in a phased manner, said a senior official of the parking wing of the civic body.Parking wing officials said they would conduct an inspection at all parking lots in a week’s time to check the ground reality.A senior MC official said one of the parking lot firms had claimed that he had implemented smart features. Thus, he would be able to introduce hourly parking charges in a phased manner in different parking lots.Earlier, November 30 was the deadline regarding the same. It was approved in the MC House meeting that hourly parking charges will be introduced from December 1 if the company is able to make its parking lots smart.However, it could not be implemented. Since smart features are yet to be provided at various parking lots in the city, the MC is now going ahead with the hourly fee in a phased manner.RK Garg, president, Second Innings Association, a senior citizens’ body, said, “The MC should make its contracts public. Why are they doing it even in a phased manner when the firms failed to make all lots smart? The corporation has grossly failed in ensuring civic services.”Vikas Pandey, parking contractor of zone 2, said, “We are yet to get a direction in this regard from the MC. Perhaps, a meeting will be held on Thursday.” Lack of parking attendants to manage vehicles, no boom barriers, haphazard parking and no proper display about the 10-minute free parking facility are some of the issues which have not been resolved yet in several parking lots.The parking contract of 89 lots was awarded to two agencies in January this year. At present, parking rates for two and four-wheelers are Rs5 and Rs10, respectively. It was agreed that after the parking lots are made smart in May, the rates would be doubled after the first four hours. In the third slab, after 12 hours, the parking fee would be doubled again till 24 hours. There would be no charges for the first 10 minutes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/hourly-parking-fee-in-phased-manner-soon-in-chandigarh-191268
