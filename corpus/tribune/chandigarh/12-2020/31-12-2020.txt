They had then set off for arranging sweets and flowers. As a half an hour passed, the campaign office witnessed an exponential rise in the number of workers. The ‘karyakartas’ (workers) broke into celebrations – dancing to the dhol beats, celebratory sloganeering, clicking selfies and flaunting victory signs.Then came the big moment when newly elected Panchkula Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal, Haryana Speaker and local MLA Gian Chand Gupta and party’s election in-charge and former Haryana Minister Captain Abhimanyu turned up at the election office after parading in an open-top jeep from the counting centre in Sector 14.Hundreds of party leaders and workers gave a rousing welcome to the party leaders as they showed victory signs and waved at them.The morning sceneAround 10.30 am, a few Congress workers were seen sipping tea at their campaign office in Sector 14 as they watch the live telecast of the election results on their respective smart phones.

But to her surprise, Goyal registered a comeback in the very next round, reducing the already minimal marginal lead to 5-odd votes.After taking a narrow lead by reversing the trend in the third round, the BJP’s mayoral nominee didn’t look back from there.At the end of the sixth round of counting, Goyal’s margin over his nearest rival Ahluwalia was already over 1,000 votes.He continued to consolidate his lead in the ensuing rounds, giving no chance to Ahluwalia to bring down the rapidly rising gap of votes.On the completion of the eighth round, Ahluwalia was trailing behind by a margin of almost 2,200 votes. The BJP took a big leap in the next two rounds and its mayoral candidate’s lead reached over 3,300.As the counting progressed, BJP’s Goyal maintained his lead round after round. It was the 17th round when the BJP started smelling the victory.Though the Congress still had hopes from EVMs from villages, it was indeed a herculean task to cover high-margin lead.As 22nd round began, the Congress showed signs of recovery, but it came too little too late. In the last 10 rounds of counting, Ahluwalia managed to bring down the difference of votes between her and Goyal. However, she could only do so up to 2,057 votes and Goyal sealed the victory after the completion of 32 rounds of counting.While Goyal polled 49,860 votes, Ahluwalia got 47,803 votes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/ahluwalia-fails-to-sustain-early-leads-191741

31-12-2020||Amit Bathla||Goyal in the saddle||Tribune News ServicePanchkula, December 30BJP’s Kulbhushan Goyal was today elected the new Mayor of Panchkula. He defeated Congress candidate Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia by 2,057 votes.While 49,860 votes were polled in favour of Goyal, Ahluwalia got 47,803 votes.Four more candidates for the mayoral post – Anil Pangotra from the BSP (2,378 votes), Padam Garg as an Independent (887 votes), Shyam Singh Negi as an Independent (667 votes) and Sudershan Bansal fromthe Janral Samaj Party (840 votes) – lost their security deposits.As many as 1,333 voters opted for NOTA.The BJP-JJP alliance secured a majority in the Municipal Corporation House by winning 11 councillor seats.Nine seats were won by the BJP, while the JJP, which contested on four seats, won two. The Congress managed to grab seven seats.Two Independents were also elected councillors – one from ward number 11 and the other from ward number 19.A total of 89 candidates – six for the mayoral post and 83 for the posts of councillor – were in the fray for the Panchkula Municipal Corporation elections.However, the posts of Senior Deputy Mayor, Deputy Mayor and the Vice-President will be filled as per the previous practice — indirect election.Of the 1,85,708 registered voters in Panchkula, 1,03,768 (55.88 per cent) had exercised their franchise on December 27. More than two years after a row over the bifurcation of the Panchkula civic body began in 2018, the Haryana Government, in July this year, had given its approval for the separation of the Kalka and Pinjore areas from the limits of the Panchkula Municipal Corporation and the constitution of the Kalka Municipal Council.The first elections to the Panchkula Municipal Corporation were held in 2013, when Congress-backed Independent candidates won a majority of the seats.In the previous MC elections, only three BJP candidates — CB Goel, Sunil Talwar and Ravi Kant Swamy — had won. Later, Swamy had also joined the Congress. However, the party got its tally back to three after Krishna Lamba, a Congress councillor, switched to the BJP. Back then, the selection of the Mayor used to be indirect unlike now.Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia was chosen as the Panchkula’s first Mayor and she completed her five-year term until the MC House was dissolved.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/goyal-in-the-saddle-191739
