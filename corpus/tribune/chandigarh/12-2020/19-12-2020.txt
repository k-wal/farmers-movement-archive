19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Focus on multilateral partnerships to check challenges posed by China, say experts||Pointing out that China believing that its power based on its impressive economic growth gives it a position of pre-eminence in the Asian region and hence it need not adhere to any kind of a multi lateral arrangement, Shyam Saran, former foreign secretary, said that If this is China’s approach, then there is no alternative but to have a strong coalition to push back against such aggressive behavior.Stating that India should have less hesitation in taking this forward while speaking at a session on ‘The QUAD: Emerging Indo-Pacific Naval Alliance’ at the Military Literature Festival here today, he said: "The QUAD is an alliance formed by India, United States Australia and Japan"."The QUAD is emerging because there is a feeling that a very aggressive and assertive China, which has built up considerable naval power, particularly in the South China Sea, poses an increased challenge," he said. "Further, with the security relations among the four countries having become much deeper, the building blocks were already in place, while the major European powers like Germany, France and the UK also have an interest in working with other partners for security of the Indo-Pacific region, he added.Saran said that India’s approach towards maritime security is that the security architecture should be open, transparent and inclusive so that it keeps open the door for China too to join provided that it adheres to various norms and rules that are necessary for sustaining such a maritime security architecture. If we are able to convince China that its interests are better served by being part of this inclusive architecture rather than pursuing unilateral dominance then we would be making some progress," he added.Former Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba said that that there has been a great deal of aggressive behaviour by China."They are signatories to the majority of international agreements but they have been changing the rules and regulations to suit their own interests," he added. Vice-Admiral Pradeep Chauhan, former Chief of Staff, Western Naval Command, said that China considers India as one of its target of military assertion, a challenge which our establishment has so far not been familiar and comfortable dealing with it."We need to have a nimble asymmetric strategy and must maneouver our strengths to best of our capabilities in thwarting China," he added.Pointing out that China has been weaponising its economic prominence to saddle other countries, he added that India need bold steps across the board to counter rising China and it cannot be choosy while entering alliances. He said that India’s decision to stay out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership was incorrect and not in line with keeping the high ambitions to match geo-strategic goals.Stating that India faces growing threats and it needs more partnerships globally than ever before, Prof. C Raja Mohan, Director Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore added that in the changed global scenario India cannot remain neutral anymore and it will have to move fast on multiple fronts while strengthening QUAD and enhancing other regional mechanisms. "The way China threatens India today requires it to dynamically improve national economic capacity along with military capability, in partnerships with intensive international coalitions for which QUAD could be the central fulcrum for the time being," he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/focus-on-multilateral-partnerships-to-check-challenges-posed-by-china-say-experts-186636

19-12-2020||Chandigarh||India’s forgotten victory over China in 1967 surfaces at Military Literature Festival||India’s little known victory over China in 1967, which had a significant impact in the future course of events South Asia on Saturday, took the centre stage with a discussion on a recently published book, ‘Watershed 1967---India’s forgotten Victory Over China’ by Probal Dasgupta at the ongoing Military Literature Festival here.The author spoke about the purpose of writing the book during the Doklam stand-off in 2017, when he realised that much of the ongoing discourse in India’s public domain was fixated around India’s 1962 debacle against China. He said that It struck him as odd that India’s victory of 1967 over its arch rival had been buried and forgotten. Speaking about the China-Pakistan nexus in 1965, which forms the beginning of the book, he also discussed the involvement of the US Central Intelligence Agency and a think tank in Arlington, Virginia, which knew of a Sino-Pakistani plan to capture Kashmir alongside with making inroads into Sikkim that would to force India in to a defensive negotiating position resulting in taking Kashmir in exchange for Sikkim, then a protectorate state.Former GOC-in-C, Western Command, Lt Gen KJ Singh, who had earlier commanded the Corps at Sikkim where the battles of 1967 had taken place, spoke of the nuances around these battles and the area.Elucidating how the Chumbi valley presented a similar vulnerability to the Chinese like the narrow Siliguri corridor posed to India, he spole about Lt Gen Sagat Singh’s leadership and his leadership, including placement of artillery guns, ensured that a difficult situation could be salvaged and turned into India’s favour quickly. The artillery used at Nathu La changed the course of the battle.He also raised senior leadership’s perplexing decision in 1965 to withdraw from Jelep La, which gave Chinese the psychological edge, even though India now occupies the heights around the pass and stressed the need for a deeper analysis of that decision. He added that decision making at the senior level needs to be bolder to turn critical, decisive moments in a battle to our advantage.Lt Gen JS Cheema spoke about the happenings in the aftermath of 1967, wherein various geopolitical events rather than the battles of 1967, ensured that China didn’t interfere with India’s campaign in Bangladesh. He said that the victories of 1967 had swung the psychological advantage in India’s favour and also felt that the book rightly brought out the parallels between India’s actions in 1967 and similar boldness during the Sumdoring Chu standoff with China in 1987. He added that such alacrity and confidence were also witnessed during the 2017 Doklam stand-off.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/indias-forgotten-victory-over-china-in-1967-surfaces-at-military-literature-festival-186604
19-12-2020||Chandigarh/Shimla||Delhi, Chandigarh colder than Shimla||Chandigarh, Amritsar, Karnal and national capital Delhi were colder than 'Queen of Hills' Shimla on Saturday.Likewise, many places in the plains of north India such as Ludhiana, Patiala and Hisar were colder than the popular hill station, the Met office in Shimla said.READ: Cold wave conditions in Punjab, HaryanaChandigarh, located in the Shivalik foothills, recorded a minimum temperature at 4.3 degrees Celsius, while Shimla, located around 7,000 feet above sea level, saw a low of 4.4 degrees Celsius.Amritsar, Ludhiana, Karnal and Hisar recorded a low of 0.6 degrees Celsius, 2.8 degrees Celsius, 2.3 degrees Celsius and 2.8 degrees Celsius, respectively. Delhi's minimum temperature settled at 3.9 degrees Celsius, 0.5 notch lower than in Shimla.Hill stations across Himachal Pradesh have been experiencing long hours of sunny weather for the past few days, while the plains are largely foggy. The maximum temperature in Shimla is hovering around 13 degrees Celsius.Manmohan Singh, director of Shimla's Meteorological Office, told IANS that the Himachal capital is witnessing high night temperatures compared to the plains. "This is a normal phenomenon and occurs mainly due to settling of inversion layer on mountain tops," he said.Generally, the air becomes cooler as elevation increases. The warm air lifted from the plains overlaid the existing cold air in the mountains. Singh said since Shimla is near the plains, the impact of inversion layer is more there. However, the picturesque tourist resort of Manali was in the grip of bone-chilling minus one degree Celsius.At minus 12.1 degrees Celsius, Keylong in Lahaul-Spiti district was the coldest place in Himachal Pradesh.The weather in Himachal's popular destinations like Kasauli, Chail, Kufri, Narkanda and Palampur is expected to be sunny till December 31."It is really pleasant in Shimla owing to long sunny days," Ritika Bhatnagar, a tourist from Delhi, said. Her husband Nakul added: "Even the nights are cosy." The weatherman said this trend would continue in the hills till the western disturbances -- storm systems originating from the Caspian Sea and moving across the Afghanistan-Pakistan region -- become active in the region."There is no chance of rain in the entire region till December 31," Singh added.---IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/delhi-chandigarh-colder-than-shimla-186590

As the matter came up for hearing through videoconferencing, the Bench verbally observed that the most important question for determination was: “What was the catchment area and who would be the competent authorities to demarcate such area?”The riderThe order, providing a major relief to the residents of Kansal, Kaimbwala, Saketri and some other adjoining areas, would remain in operation at least till March 18 — the next date of hearing in the case.The Bench of Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Harinder Singh Sidhu also made clear its intent to examine the catchment area of the lake. As the matter came up for hearing through videoconferencing, the Bench verbally observed that the most important question for determination was: “What was the catchment area and who would be the competent authorities to demarcate such area?”The High Court, in its March 2 orders, had also declared Sukhna Lake a legal entity and imposed unprecedented costs of Rs200 crore on Punjab and Haryana, relying primarily on the 2004 Survey of India’s Sukhna Lake map.Taking up four petitions seeking a review of the judgment, the Bench made it clear that today’s order was subject to assurance by the states of Punjab and Haryana that further construction would not be undertaken in the catchment area.The Bench also made it clear that the stay would stand vacated in case of non-adherence to the assurance. Even renovation work would not be undertaken in the existing structures without the prior permission of the court.The directions came after the Bench heard Advocate-General (AG) Atul Nanda, Additional AG Rameeza Hakeem and Vikas Mohan Gupta, along with Assistant AG Diya Sodhi, for the state of Punjab; counsel Rajeev Anand and Nikhil Anand for the Kansal Enclave Residents’ Welfare Association; senior advocate Gurminder Singh, along with counsel Gurnoor S Sandhu and RPS Bara for the Kansal Residents’ Protection of Rights and Welfare Association and senior advocate Manjit Singh Khaira along with counsel Surya Prakash and Ripudaman Singh Sidhu for Kansal village residents.Among other things, the Bench was told that the accuracy of the 2004 map was never finally adjudicated upon by the High Court. The order, dated September 24, 2004, clearly stated that the map was taken on record subject to objections. Rather, the objections raised by Punjab and other parties to the writ proceedings remained open.The accuracy of the map and the demarcation of the catchment area were called to question by the amicus curiae. The issue was duly recorded by the court vide an order dated December 13, 2011, whereby a committee was constituted to decide on the issue regarding the demarcation.It was added that the High Court wrongly concluded that the map was accepted in the May 7 committee meeting. On the contrary, the committee categorically and unanimously adopted the position that a fresh map was required in view of the manifest errors. A sub-committee was constituted and entrusted with the demarcation responsibility. These and other issues were duly raised during the proceedings. But the questions were neither dealt with nor considered and determined in a proper manner. The same were crucial to resolve the present controversy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/hc-stays-demolition-in-sukhna-catchment-186420
