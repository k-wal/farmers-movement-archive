12-12-2020||Mohali||Vaccine rollout likely by Jan 1st week: Mohali DC||Mohali is all geared up for the smooth rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine, which is “likely to reach the district by December-end or the first week of January 2021”.In the wake of this development, the district administration has identified adequate vaccinators and cold chain points.Girish Dayalan, Deputy Commissioner, said 9,515 registered beneficiaries (health workers) from government and private institutions would be vaccinated in the first phase. He said as per preliminary information, they were expecting the vaccine to be delivered to the district by December-end or by the first week of January. “Training of the staff involved in the administration of the vaccine has been planned and session sites — the places where the vaccine will be administered — have been earmarked,” he said.Dayalan said primarily, the vaccine would be administered at health institutions since every beneficiary had to be kept under observation for about half an hour to monitor adverse event following immunisation (AEFI), if any. “If need be, schools, community halls, gram panchayat/municipality buildings can also be put to use with dedicated vaccination teams,” he added. The Deputy Commissioner said the vaccine administration site or the session site would be ventilated with three dedicated rooms/areas — the waiting room, the vaccination room and the observation room.“We are designing a foolproof methodology so that each beneficiary gets requisite, timely and proper dosage of the vaccine as per the directions of the health authorities,” said Dayalan.He said the vaccination of registered health workers was their priority and no other government official, including him, would be administered the vaccine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/vaccine-rollout-likely-by-jan-1st-week-mohali-dc-183125

City officials were expecting a vaccine to arrive by January first week, but following the recent recommendations of the subject expert committee on December 9 regarding examining the vaccine under anaccelerated approval, the process may get delayed by a few weeks.Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang said: “Keeping in mind the momentum at which we have been directed by the ministry to upscale the work of cold chain logistics, the vaccine was expected to be rolled out by the first week of January. However, a specific time period is yet to be intimated by the Centre as the authorisation of a Covid vaccine is also awaited.”The Covid subject expert committee asked the Serum Institute of India to update the safety data of the phase II/III clinical trial of the Oxford vaccine in the country and immunogenicity data from the clinical trials in India and the UK.While Bharat Biotech was also asked to present the safety and efficacy data from an ongoing trial, Pfizer requested more time for making a presentation before the committee.Meanwhile, a meeting of the Central Government with the district task force and block task force is likely to take place in the coming days to discuss the progress on multi-level coordination for the distribution of the vaccine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/25k-to-get-vaccine-in-1st-phase-in-chandigarh-183127

12-12-2020||Chandigarh||Wheelchair cricketers protest relocation||Empower, an NGO for special children, and a few other NGOs, along with cricketers of the Wheelchair Cricket Society, held a demonstration at Sector 17 against the move of the Social Welfare Department of Chandigarh Administration to relocate wheelchair cricketers staying at Cheshire Home, Sector 21.Captain’s takeVeer Sandhu, captain, Wheelchair Cricket Society, who is also a member of the Indian Wheelchair Cricket Team, said: “We have been asked to shift to EWS flats at Maloya at a monthly rent of Rs3,000, excluding the water and electricity bills. We don’t have any source of income and despite our contribution to bringing laurels to the country as well as Chandigarh through our performance in sports, we are being treated like this. The other accommodation of Sector 42 stadium is also not wheelchair friendly.”The department is mulling sending these wheelchair cricketers, who have brought multiple accolades at the national and international levels, from Sector 21-A to EWS Colony, Maloya, without their consent and proper facilities — the accommodation at Maloya is in a dilapidated state. Another option being given is relocation to Sector 42 stadium, but here, too, many areas are inaccessible to the physically challenged players.It is to be noted that the administration has decided to convert Cheshire Home into a home for the mentally ill without taking any of the stakeholders into confidence.The administration’s move has come under fire from the wheelchair cricketers and the NGOs aligned with them, as questions are being raised as to why a rushed declaration in the newspaper calling bids from NGOs has been made at a short notice, without providing any information to the wheelchair residents of Cheshire Home. Eyebrows are also being raised as all this is being done amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It is to be noted that bids have been invited from NGOs before December 15 for involvement in the creation of a Home for mentally ill at Cheshire Home.Sharmita Bhinder, founder of Empower, said: “Our NGO and other like-minded and helpful citizens and philanthropists have been supporting these residents in maintenance and provision of essential items such as food etc since 2015. The UT Administration has shown apathetic and inhuman attitute towards these occupants with this one-sided decision.“They are being asked to vacate the building without any prior notice or consultation. We had been waiting for a dialogue and a solution since our last letter dated September 24 was sent to the administration. However, instead of resolving the impasse, the authorities are trying to bulldoze the wheelchair cricketers’ opinions.”Till January, the only effort made by the Social Welfare Department for the welfare of the occupants was getting electrical repairs done. From 2015 till January 2020, the Wheelchair Cricket Society, with the help of the local NGOs Chandigarh Friends, Rotary Club, Baba Rode Shah and others, has spent their own money to take care of food, clothing, bedding, cleaning, whitewash and repairs. The UT Administration provided no funds for the same.Bhinder added: “The residents have been funding most of the things themselves and with the support of a few NGOs. An amount of over Rs 6 lakh donated by people has been used to make the dilapidated building livable. In case the department is hell bent on making this an ego issue and go ahead with the relocation, then it should pay back the wheelchair cricketers what they have spent on the building and also provide alternative wheelchair-friendly accommodation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/wheelchair-cricketers-protest-relocation-183132

He has moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking directions for protection of his life and liberty from “danger at the hands of his son”.UT SSP told to take appropriate actionTaking up the matter, Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi directed the UT Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) to look into the petitioner’s grievances and take appropriate action for the protection of his life and liberty “as may be warranted by the circumstances”.In his petition filed through counsel RS Bajaj, the petitioner submitted that sweets are traditionally distributed on a male child’s birth and they were no exception. “The petitioner and his wife distributed sweets and celebrated the arrival of a male child in their home. But, the petitioner had little inkling in his mind that his said son only will run after his blood at a later point of time,” Bajaj added.He submitted the petitioner and his wife were having a smooth life. Their problems started once the son shifted to his house and started living with them. Initially, he shifted to the first floor. Subsequently, he shifted to the ground floor and started harassing him. “Since he was not doing any job, he used to steal the money of the petitioner and other belongings in his absence. When confronted with the same, he used to pick up fight with the petitioner”.Bajaj added the veteran was thrown out of his own house in July. “On account of serious threats to him, the petitioner is living elsewhere along with his daughter. He cannot afford to disclose particulars as there is a serious threat to his life and liberty at the hands of the respondent-son and his accomplices because he is extending regular threats to end the life of the petitioner and also his daughter as he is eyeing to grab the property of the petitioner”.Taking up the matter, Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi directed the UT Senior Superintendent of Police to look into the petitioner’s grievances and take appropriate action for the protection of his life and liberty “as may be warranted by the circumstances”.Justice Tyagi also added the presence of the petitioner’s other son and daughter was considered necessary in view of the facts and circumstances of the case for just and proper decision of the petition. They were, as such, ordered to be impleaded as respondents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/air-force-veteran-moves-high-court-against-son-183135

Representatives of around 90 RWAs attended this meeting.During the meeting, Puri raised various issues with the SSP. He demanded that a police team should visit the residences of senior citizens living alone at regular intervals (at least once in a month) to ask about their well-being.Manyfold increase in crime graph in the recent times had shattered the peace of mind of city residents, he said, adding that people wanted to know what would be the modus operandi of the police for curbing the rising crime in the city.Puri said there was a big problem of unauthorised vendors selling daily need items unchecked in the city.“They do not adhere to norms such as selling fruit/vegetables on the rates fixed by the Mandi Board and maintaining hygiene at their place. They also do not follow any health guidelines issued by the UT Administration,” he said.“It becomes the duty of the police also to take strict action against such unauthorised vendors. The police should take legal action against vendors who are selling products without valid licence,” he demanded.He said regular monthly meetings must be held between RWAs members and the SHO or the chowki-in charge as it would help both ways in maintaining healthy relationship, keeping a check on crime and maintaining peace and harmony among residents.The SSP said today only he gave instructions to the respective area SHO regarding monthly meeting with the RWAs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-police-to-work-hand-in-hand-with-rwas-says-ssp-183140
