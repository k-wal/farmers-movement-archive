He can neither speak nor listen.“So, the court referred the matter to the Punjab and Haryana High Court for confirmation of the proceedings under Section 318 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC),” said Public Prosecutor Kapil Gaud.Section 318 of the CrPC prescribes the procedure where the accused does not understand the proceedings. It says that if the accused, though not of unsound mind, cannot be made to understand the proceedings, the trial court may proceed with the inquiry or trial and if it results in a conviction, the proceedings shall be forwarded to the High Court with a report of the circumstances of the case. The High Court then passes thereon such an order as it thinks fit. The case dates back to 2017. The nine-year-old victim, an orphan, used to reside with her maternal aunt. On January 9, 2017, her aunt and uncle had gone to the market.On return, her aunt felt that the victim was unwell. The next day, the victim revealed that Udayveer came to their house and raped her. He also threatened to kill her.The FIR was registered on January 10, 2017, under Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) on a complaint of the victim’s aunt.The accused was arrested on March 18, 2017.The victim had recorded her statement under Section 164 of the CrPC and had deposed regarding commission of rape and had identified Udyaveer as the perpetrator. “The clinching evidence in the case was the DNA matching of semen found on the victim’s clothes with the convict,” said Gaud. After the trial, the court convicted Udyaveer on January 18.Why it is sent to HCSection 318 of the CrPC prescribes the procedure where the accused does not understand the proceedings.

On the second day, only 174 HCWs were administered the vaccine — 90 at the GMSH-16, 20 at the Civil Hospital-45 and 64 at two sites in the GMCH-32.Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, Director, Health Services, UT, said, “The response received today was tepid in comparison with the first day. Although we made calls to the beneficiaries and tried to counsel them, they kept telling us that they wanted to wait for some time before going for the shot. For Thursday’s session, we are planning to call only those beneficiaries who are willing to get inoculated.”The vaccination drive at five sessions went off smoothly without any major adverse events. A minor event was reported at the Civil Hospital, Sector 45.Dr Pankaj Malhotra from the Department of Internal Medicine, PGI, who monitored Covishield trial volunteers and took the vaccine on the first day of the drive, said, “A mild reaction after vaccination like fever actually means that the vaccine is working. A day after getting the shot, I developed fever and muscle ache for one day. Covishield is safe as it is a viral vector vaccine that uses an adenovirus (causes common cold in chimpanzees) to nudge the body to create the specific part of the coronavirus so that the immune system gets activated and makes antibodies against the disease. The virus used in the vaccines is too weak to make the recipient ill.”Dr Malhotra, who treats blood cancer patients at the PGI, has been asking such patients to wait and opt for an alternative – Covaxin as it is an inactivated form of coronavirus, which is safer for people with weakened immune system.Chandigarh receives 11,500 more doses of covishield||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/day-2-health-workers-show-reluctance-only-43-turn-up-in-chandigarh-200889

The petitioners had claimed that the order was construed to mean stamping out all live poultry birds, regardless of their health status.Taking up the petition filed through counsel Aashish Chopra, Justice Sindhu also fixed February 2 as the next date of hearing in the matter. As the case came up for preliminary hearing, Chopra contended that the action amounted to disregard of the provisions of the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009.Chopra contended that the Act provided for alternative and more humane means of controlling avian influenza. Section 25 of the 2009 Act made it clear that the veterinary officer had to pass an order in writing, if at all euthanasia was to be resorted to. In the present facts, it could not be ignored that such orders were apparently not passed by the veterinary officer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/mass-culling-of-poultry-birds-can-be-avoided-high-court-told-200890
