However, the UT Sports Department may take some time to open the facility due to technical reasons.Only one swimming pool — all-weather pool in Sector 23 — is expected to be open for trainees considering the changing weather. The facility has been shut since the implementation of the lockdown and the department is likely to follow an e-tendering process for choosing a contractor for carrying out the repair work, cleaning and maintenance work before opening the pool.“The facility may open next month. In addition to the technical work, following SOPs will be important. The Ministry of Sports will release SOPs before October 15, we have to see how it goes,” said an official of the sports department.Meanwhile, swimmers are both excited and worried. “It’s great that we can finally train and get back in shape. It will take us four to five months to regain endurance,” said international swimmer Chahat Arora, who represents Punjab and Chandigarh in competitions. She added: “I hope that swimming pools are well-sanitised and wearing a mask is mandatory at the pool deck. Only 10 to 12 swimmers should be allowed in one slot to avoid overcrowding. Time slots should be extended and a minimum number of swimmers should be allowed to use lanes,” said Chahat.Pool at PUPanjab University is another place with an all-weather pool in the city. However, it is restricted for the use by campus swimmers. “This session, it will open the pool only for competitors. We will abide by all guidelines, including those of the UT Administration.

The cleaning work is likely to start tomorrow,” said Dr Parminder Singh, Director Sports (PU).Gurcharan Singh Dhaliwal, PU winning coach, said no competitor would be allowed to take pre-practice and post-practice bath and there will be separate entry and exit points.Three pools in MohaliThree swimming pools — two outsourced by GMADA and one under the Sports Department — are likely to open to public.

At least three patients died every day in September due to co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.According to the UT’s data, 35 deaths were reported in the fourth week and 31 in the third week of September. The first and the second week saw 18 and 21 deaths, respectively.Rajesh Kumar, former head of the Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), said, “Death is a true indicator of an epidemic as with each case, it is assumed that there are 1,000 infections out there. Usually, there is a log of 7-10 days between the decline in number cases and the deaths. Chandigarh has already been witnessing a drop in the number of cases for the past two weeks. However, the true picture will be seen only after declining in deaths.”In the first week of September, the infection rate grew faster as 1,822 out of 5,802 persons, who were tested for the virus, were found positive, which means every 30th Covid-19 test was positive.The positivity rate came down to 12.8 per cent in the second week. It has also been noticed that the number of infections also dwindled in the past 14 days. As many as 3,353 cases were reported between September 15 and 30 as compared with 4,042 infections in the preceding fortnight.Dr Kumar said, “The decline is clearly evident when it comes to active cases. Active cases decrease only when less number of positive cases is reported daily. It has been observed in pandemics like these that the situation starts improving when cases rise abruptly and thus, creating fear in public.”Dip in testingThe testing has dipped from 1,200 to 700-800 tests per day in the past four days.Consequently, daily cases being reported in Chandigarh are now varying between 120 and 200. The highest number of infections recorded in a single day had previously ranged between 350 and 400.Arun Gupta, Principal Health Secretary, UT, said, “People do not feel the need to get tested. The numbers have dwindled to 100-150 tests per day in private laboratories. These labs were earlier testing 300-400 people daily. An inference can be drawn from here that the infections have decreased.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/september-saw-100-deaths-in-chandigarh-against-39-in-august-149778
