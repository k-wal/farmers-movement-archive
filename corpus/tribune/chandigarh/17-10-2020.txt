The doubling time is a crude estimate of the current rate of spread of the virus.A higher doubling time means it is taking longer for the cases to double and indicates that the infection is spreading slower. Conversely, a lower doubling time suggests a faster spread of infection.Chandigarh Principal Health Secretary Arun Gupta said: “Doubling rate is inversely proportional to the number of positive cases detected in the past week. It is also a function of total cases so far. The doubling rate has increased many times in comparison to last month. This is the trend in the whole country though more pronounced in case of Chandigarh as a decline in the number of cases is sharper in Chandigarh. We hope that it would increase further.”The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had projected that Chandigarh will witness 14,376 cases by October 13, of which 4,200 will remain active. However, due to the downward trend in the city, the projection did not reach its mark.Fatality rate of 1.5 per cent a matter of concernChandigarh has a fatality rate of 1.5 per cent while the recovery rate has breached the 90 per cent-mark.Gupta said: “However, COVID fatality is still an area of concern. We expect that fatality trend would also subside in next week or so due to the impact of decreased number of cases and increased focus on timely medical care to positive patients.”From October 9 to October 16, the city recorded 18 fatalities as compared to 19 fatalities in the preceding week. It recorded 24 COVID deaths in the week before that.In how many days have cases doubled?May 4 - 100  May 20 - 200 (16 days)June 20 - 400 (31 days)July 23 - 800 (33 days)August 11- 1600 (19 days)August 25- 3200 (14 days)September 9 - 6400 (16 days)October 7 - 12,800 (28 days)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarhs-corona-infection-doubling-time-improves-to-130-days-from-17-days-in-august-157043

17-10-2020||---||Now, Chandigarh Administration says ‘no’ to Senate poll||Chandigarh, October 16The UT Administration today advised Panjab University not to go ahead with the Senate elections, after the Chandigarh police and the Health Department recommended the same. In a letter to the officiating Registrar-cum-returning officer of the PU on Friday, the UT Administration, citing reports from the Senior Superintendent of Police, has said: “As the Covid-19 situation in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan and Maharashtra is at its peak and the member of faculties belonging to these states will arrive in Chandigarh to cast their vote on the PU campus, the possibility of spread the virus in Chandigarh cannot be ruled out. It is, therefore, recommended that permission may not be granted to the PU authorities to conduct the Senate Election-2020.”‘No merit in election deferment’“There is no merit in postponing the elections any longer. While observing the norms of social distancing, wearing masks and regular sanitisation, Senate Elections 2020 can be conducted with safety and caution. The number of voters in these elections, across separate constituencies, is not staggeringly large, says Senator Ashok GoyalAn official statement from the PU spokesperson reads: “As informed by Vikram Nayyar, FDO and officiating Registrar, the UT Administration has advised the PU to not go ahead with the Senate elections for the time being, keeping in view the Covid-19 situation.”Meanwhile, the Senators have written to the UT Administrator, VP Singh Badnore, the VC is trying to scuttle the democratic system of governance in the university.“The Vice-Chancellor is deliberately trying to scuttle the democratic system of governance in the university. There is no reason that the Vice-Chancellor should involve your office in the matter. In the University Calendar, there is no provision that mandates your office to have any role in the decision on holding the Senate elections. By involving the UT Administration in the matter, the VC is abdicating his own responsibility so that in case of any backlash, legal or popular, he may hold the UT Administration responsible for the postponement. It was two months after the Senate polls of Panjab University were postponed for the first time, the varsity on Thursday again decided to defer the elections further. The elections were scheduled to start on August 24.The Senate is a 91-member apex governing body of the PU. Thirtysix members are nominated by the Vice-President of India, who is also the Chancellor of the university. The four-year term of the present Senate ends on October 31.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/now-chandigarh-administration-says-no-to-senate-poll-156799

This Friday may not have lived up to the expectations in terms of movie business for a re-opening day in the tricity. However, the fact that people walked up to theatres amid the ongoing pandemic is in itself a commendable affair. So much so, that staffers and the management team of PVR could not hold back their emotions to clap and cheer for the viewers who walked out after watching the movie.Follow SOPs strictly, DC tells multiplexesChandigarh: Deputy Commissioner Mandip Singh Brar on Friday reviewed the arrangements made by theatres and multiplexes. During a meeting, the DC directed theatre and multiplex representatives to ensure strict adherence to SOPs framed to prevent Covid spread. TNSThe statement of Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Cinemas, that the safety and well-being of patrons and employees were their primary objective clearly shows that it is all about building that trust again, which can ensure a healthy progress in business, especially ahead of the festive season.With SOPs and guidelines followed to the T and installation of anti-microbial film to UV scanners for packaged food to take safety a notch higher, PVR Cinemas has left no stone unturned to make re-opening a pleasant experience.Ask youngsters who were part of the re-opening day shows, and they all have just one recommendation, “Why old movies? Many like us were interested to come, but found the choices boring or already watched.” The distributors have obvious answers, producers are not ready to risk new movies until there is a positive feedback or increase in occupancy. On the number of admits, distributor Raj Juneja says, “Slowly and steadily, I am hopeful we will get there. Those who came were excited about the theatre experience after a seven-month-long wait. I hope they get the word out. It is true that the numbers were not in our favour today, but we are hopeful.”The number gameThe four multiplexes — PVR Centra, PVR City Centre, Fun Cinemas and Piccadily Square — that re-opened on Friday said the maximum bookings were for “Tanhaji” (Hindi movie) and “Chal Mera Putt” (Punjabi). A representative from Fun Cinemas said their show started late around 4 pm as they wanted to make sure that everything was in order.He said, “We only had two movies, ‘Malang and Chal Mera Putt 2’. We only saw two customers for both shows.”Centra Mall, which recorded the highest number of admits (26) by the end of their last show at 6.40 pm for “Muklawa”, saw a promising start with the first show of “Tanhaji”. What started from 12 admits in the morning, came down to seven for the 2.45 pm show and declined to one admit for the last one.At Piccadily Square, a representative gave a rough figure of around 20 admits.
