He, however, failed to prove the defect in the product during the hearing.Dinesh Kumar Gupta had filed the complaint against Ahuja Electronics, Sector 22 C, Chandigarh and M/s LG Electronics India Pvt Ltd. He sought the refund of Rs38,500 (cost of refrigerator) along with interest; compensation of Rs4,00,000 and cost of litigation alleging defects in the refrigerator.He said the refrigerator started giving problems soon after he purchased it in 2017 and despite numerous complaints to the seller and manufacture, nothing was done.The service engineer claimed that there were no defects and that the refrigerator’s mode was not properly adjusted by the consumer.The opposite parties contested the complaint and claimed that their requests for getting the refrigerator checked by engineers of the other companies were rejected by the complainant.After hearing both the parties, the Court said, “The onus to prove defect in the goods so purchased by him/her lies on a complainant. However, he has miserably failed to discharge the said onus. Accordingly, the consumer complaint, being merit less, is hereby dismissed” said the order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/onus-lies-on-customer-to-prove-defect-in-goods-consumer-panel-147181

The elections for a total of 50 MC wards will be held in the last week of November or the first week of December.Thirty-five teams had been constituted to carry out the survey in which people would be asked three questions — head of the family, number of family members and caste. The survey has been delayed by almost a week as it was to be completed by September 20. On August 7, the Punjab Government had constituted a board to decide on the delimitation of wards of the Mohali MC. The board will also decide about the allotment of 50 per cent of the wards reserved for women.SS Dhanoa, former councillor of ward number 23, said the survey being conducted by the MC was just a formality. He said he had minutely watched the survey team. They were visiting a few houses in a lane to get information about the whole area. He said they were waiting for the finalisation of wards and if any ambiguity was found, they would challenge the same.People of the new sectors (66 to 82) alleged that the staff were not even visiting houses and were just conducting survey on the basis of information provided by the first house in a lane.Former Deputy Mayor Manjit Singh Sethi said they were not satisfied with the way the survey was being conducted. He said representation to people in the municipal council could only be given after adjusting the wards in the city.Municipal Commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said the survey would be completed in a day or two. He said after the completion of the survey, the board would hold a meeting to finalise the wards and reserve seats for women and SCs in the Municipal Corporation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/delimitation-of-wards-mohali-mc-yet-to-complete-survey-147184

The Senate and PUTA elections are believed to be the most important event of this institution. Student elections are nowhere near sight and the authorities must prepare themselves to face the harsh criticism in the coming weeks,” said one of the senators.  A faculty member said, “The step clearly indicates that the authorities have not used their powers properly in the past. The House members or PUTA moved the court. They actually took the matter via media and started blaming each other. There has not been a single word about the academic loss by any of these men in power.” Surprisingly, the House meeting was also not called. Many believe that the House was not called as the Syndics would take up the matter of conducing elections. “The meeting should have been called to discuss various issues pertaining to students and the PU. However, everyone wants to press the authorities for conducting elections of PUTA and the Syndicate. The clause of making a board of directors in the New Education Policy is also a concern for many. Fearing its implementation, anytime sooner or later, those in the fray wanted to get over with the election process,” said a source.  ‘Lack of governance’ Dr Harpreet Singh Dua, Fellow and Syndic, wrote a letter to the PU VC demanding to conduct meetings to discuss various issues. In his letter, Dua said, “University/colleges/teaching/non-teaching staff/students (all stakeholders) are facing a tough time. The university was unable to conduct entrance tests for the 2020-2021 session. The admission schedule was much delayed. Colleges have not been provided with the proper set of guidelines. Teachers are being forcibly relieved/not getting salaries/their teaching subjects are being discontinued and they are facing so many other issues. This is due to the lack of governance as no proper meetings of the Senate and the Syndicate were held.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/fellows-puta-upset-over-postponement-of-elections-147186
