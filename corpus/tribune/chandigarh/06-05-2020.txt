The contracts of liquor vends were allotted from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020.Vendors claimed that they suffered a minimum approximate loss of Rs 1.5 lakh per day. Last year, a liquor vend in Dhanas was sold for a whopping Rs 10.78 crore. The allottee submitted 25 per cent of the amount at the spot, while the remaining amount is paid on instalments of 10 per cent per month. The monthly instalment is paid from profit through sales and since the vendors did not operate, they claimed to have faced huge losses. ‚ÄúThere was no sale for 10 days, how can we submit monthly licence fee? The government should waive or adjust the licence fee for these 10 days. A majority of the vendors have two or three outlets from where they pay the money,‚Äù said a vendor.When asked about yesterday‚Äôs sale, a vendor said: ‚ÄúWine shops opened after a long period. Our main customers are labourers, who make daily purchases, and people coming from neighbourhood states as they prefer to buy liquor from here due to difference in prices. Labourers have returned to their native places and entry to the city is banned. Chandigarh is a small city and we cannot make profit from it. The coming days are very risky.‚ÄùOn odd-even formula, he said, ‚ÄúMost of the popular shops that are located on main roads and on sector dividing roads are not allowed to open.‚ÄùAnother vendor said, ‚ÄúSmall vendors sold liquor yesterday, but what about those who purchase liquor from prime locations? All liquor shops should be allowed to open.‚ÄùContract renewal bluesThe process of licence renewal (from April 1, 2020 onwards) was postponed by the UT Excise Department due to the Covid-19 scare. ‚ÄúWe are waiting for a decision. The department should charge fee from the date of opening of the shop instead of April 1. We have not done any business from April 1 till May 3,‚Äù he said.Higher priceHooch lovers alleged that vendors made huge profit by selling liquor at higher price. In one such complaint, Jatin Sharma, a resident, claimed, ‚ÄúHe purchased a beer carton for Rs 2,400, which normally costs somewhere around Rs 1,800.‚Äù Similar complaints were witnessed in many areas as wine lovers maintained that vendors took advantage of the current situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/liquor-vends-in-chandigarh-want-licence-fee-waived-for-10-days-80874

06-05-2020||Sandeep Rana||Covid patient flees Chandigarh on bike, reaches UP||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 5In a shocking case, a Sector 56 man, who had tested positive for Covid-19, allegedly fled the city to reach his hometown in Uttar Pradesh. He left on a motorcycle along with a relative from Sector 52.The 34-year-old man, an auto driver, went to the Civil Hospital, Phase 6, Mohali, after he felt unwell on Monday. His samples were taken for Covid-19. However, rather than isolating him at the hospital, he was asked to go home and isolate himself. He was also asked to take some strict precautions.Instead of following the isolation or precaution, the man left for UP on Monday.The report of his samples was received today in which he tested positive for Covid.‚ÄúWe do not know why he did so. Either he got scared by doctors‚Äô advisory and got an inkling that something was not fine or he already knew the contents of the report. We are finding out,‚Äù said a police official investigating the matter.DSP (South) Neha Yadav told Chandigarh Tribune, ‚ÄúHe had to go to Bijnor, but he went to Pratapgarh. We have informed the SP there as he has reached Pratapgarh. We are investigating the matter.‚ÄùOfficials are wondering how he managed to reach Pratapgarh by travelling nearly 800 km and crossing interstate borders during the lockdown.Mohali Civil Surgeon Manjeet Singh said, ‚ÄúHe had mild symptoms. Thus, he was asked to isolate himself after his samples were taken. If there is a patient with severe symptoms, we isolate him in the hospital till the reports are out. Unlike Chandigarh, we take as many as 70-80 samples in a day. So, we have limited space for isolation or quarantine. It is negligence on the patient‚Äôs part.‚Äù‚ÄúThe patient proceeded to his village in UP without waiting for his test results. He went there on a bike along with a relative. The facts came to light when field teams of the Health Department, Chandigarh, went to his Sector 56 residence for investigations on receiving his Covid positive report from the State Surveillance Unit of Punjab at 4.26 pm today. The patient has been tracked. He has reached his native village,‚Äù said a UT Health Departmemt report.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/covid-patient-flees-chandigarh-on-bike-reaches-up-80873
