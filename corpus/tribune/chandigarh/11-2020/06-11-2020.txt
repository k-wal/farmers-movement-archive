It’s purposed provisions were also against the law, the public policy and were discriminatory, the association added.The Act was drafted to benefit landlords and to make the upper class more rich as compared to the weaker section of tenants, the association stated.“The proposed Act is not balancing the rights of landlords and tenants. It has been drafted for the benefit of landlords. The Act has been framed only on the basis of a survey conducted with regard to vacant residential accommodation and not commercial. As such, the category of residential and commercial tenancies cannot be treated on a par. The hardships faced by commercial tenants have not been taken care of in the purposed draft,” said Arvind Kumar Jain, president, CTA.“The Rent Act must be drafted by a committee, wherein members from the tenant’s community should also be inducted so that the ground reality is taken care of,” he added.“The proposed draft of the Model Tenancy Act should be rejected and not implemented in Chandigarh without carrying out necessary changes,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/draft-model-tenancy-act-to-benefit-landlords-says-association-166611

06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Pre-existing disease no reason to deny insurance claim: Panel||While directing New India Assurance Company Limited to pay a total claim of Rs2,85,833 to a city resident, along with 8 per cent interest per annum, the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh, has held that an insurance claim cannot be denied on mere presumption that a person is suffering from a pre-existing disease.The commission also directed the company to pay Rs25,000 to the complainant as compensation for causing mental agony and harassment and Rs10,000 as costs of litigation.Pawan Kumar, a city resident, approached the commission after he was denied claim on the ground that he had pneumonia and a known case of chronic kidney ailment since 2015, which was a pre-existing disease and the claim was not admissible under Clause 4.1 of the terms and conditions of the policy being within 48 months from the date of expiry. Pawan refuted company’s claim by placing the documents on records that he was duly covered under the policy.Pawan had bought New India Floater Mediclaim Insurance Policy for first time in 2015, which was renewed subsequently. The policy, was valid from May 13, 2017, to May 12, 2018, for sum assured of Rs8,00,000.In October, 2017, during the validity of the policy in question, Pawan fell ill. He had fever for 10 days and was admitted to a hospital from October 24, 2017, to November 15, 2017.He was diagnosed with thick walled cavity RML/RLL (Right lung). He was referred to the Department of Pulmonary Medicine, PGI, and was again admitted for 13 days at the hospital. Later, when Pawan submitted total claim of Rs2,85,833 the insurance company denied it by stating that the claimant was a case of pneumonia and a known chronic kidney disease since 2015, which was a pre-existing ailment.Pawan also placed the record of the treatment at the PGI, which proved that he was suffering from fungal infection and diagnosed with thick walled cavity RML/RLL (Right lung). It is also recorded that during the period of complainant’s hospitalisation, his transplanted kidney was functioning normally. Hence, no treatment of any sort was given for kidney disorder.After hearing arguments the commission observed: “We have no option except to hold it a case of deficiency in service as well as unfair trade practice by the insurance firm.”The commission’s order states: “It is clear from the records that treatment did not pertain to kidney problem, but a fungal infection. It has no connection or relation with the kidney disorder and is a pre-existing disease for invoking of the exclusion Clause 4.1”The order further states: “In view of this the insurance firm is directed to pay the total claim of Rs2,85,833 to the complainant along with 8 per cent interest per annum from the date of repudiation, which is December 29, 2017, till realisation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/pre-existing-disease-no-reason-to-deny-insurance-claim-panel-166634

Dr Naveen Pandey, Deputy Medical Superintendent of the OPD, PGI, said the waiting area had been created with a seating capacity of 1,000 persons. Every middle seat on a bench for three had been blocked to maintain social distancing. A maximum of 600 patients and their attendants could be seated in the waiting area at any given point of time.On the first day today, several suspected patients were tested, but none of them was found to be infected, he said.After the lockdown, the PGI restarted OPD services from November 2 with strict adherence to the Covid-19 guidelines.Only patients with prior appointment given through tele-consultation were allowed to visit the OPD, that too at a particular time slot. Before sending patients directly to OPDs, the PGI screened them for Covid-19.Dr Pandey said a team of healthcare workers had been specially trained to screen patients at a designated area near the entrance to the OPD block.“The doctor stamps the appointment card with red and green colour. A questionnaire is given to the patient and his or her attendant to check Covid-19 symptoms. Those who are found negative are stamped with green colour and sent to their respective OPDs. Patients found symptomatic for Covid-19 are stamped red and tested immediately for the virus,” he said.He said 1,410 patients were screened on November 2, 1,114 on November 3 and around 2,000 patients and their attendants were checked for symptoms on November 5.Dr Pandey said 15 departments were providing OPD services in the New OPD Block. Patients were being called in hourly slots as mentioned in their appointment cards. Only one attendant was allowed to accompany a patient. The patients and their attendants were asked to wait in the specially created waiting area keeping in view the guidelines issued for maintaining social distancing norms.“From the waiting area, the patients are sent to their respective OPDs in the batches of 10. There is only one entrance and one exit for the patients, whereas there is a separate entry for the staff,” he said.At any given point of time, only 150 patients and an equal number of attendants were present in the building, he said, adding that the reception had been shifted outside the block. Once a patient entered the OPD block, he or she came out only after completing all procedures, including lab tests and depositing fee.The PGI authorities had decided to resume OPD services only with prior appointment through tele-consultation.He said even after the pandemic subsided, tele-consultation would continue to remain the initial point of contact of patients and doctors at the hospital. The patients would be evaluated first through tele-consultation. Only those requiring further examination would be called to the OPD through appointment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/pgi-begins-rapid-antigen-testing-at-new-opd-block-166637
