There is anger among people over the handling of the issue by the administration with allegations that the area councillor and the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) did nothing on their complaints of dirty water supply in the area.Probe marked into death of 9-yr-old boyResidents said they were angry over the alleged medical negligence on the part of the Civil Hospital in treating patients admitted to the government facility. The family of the nine-year-old boy has accused doctors of discharging his son before he was stable.Cholera outbreak: At Abheypur village, sewer lines run parallel to water pipesRaju, a local resident, said, “I came across a newspaper article which quoted the CMO as saying that Abheypur people live in poor sanitary conditions and that’s the reason behind the spread of the disease. People are upset over the statement. Secondly, those approaching the Civil Hospital are not being treated well or referred to the PGI, Chandigarh. Officials are just pretending to be working, but in reality, they are not.”A woman said, ‘’People who live in the village belong to lower economic strata and most work as daily wage labourers. Let’s hope we get clean water through the pipeline as we can’t afford packaged water.’’Rajesh Kumar, area councillor belonging to the JJP, said a group of people who entered into an argument with him were “politically motivated”.“It’s total nonsense. If a problem has come up, we should try to address it rather than asking absurd questions. I had to call up the police as it could have turned into a fight,” he said.“We don’t want the situation to go out of control. The pipelines are being closely monitored to keep tabs on leakage, if any. Hence, the water supply in the area will continue to remain shut today as well and residents will be provided water through tankers,” he said.Former Deputy Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Chander Mohan also visited the spot.Local people apprised him of issues related to the water supply. According to the HSVP, drinking water may have mixed with sewage water that led to the contamination.Haryana Speaker and local MLA Gian Chand Gupta also went to the house of the deceased’s family but they had left for their native place in Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh before his arrival.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/cholera-outbreak-anger-in-panchkulas-abheypur-village-284367

Even after floating fresh tenders, no company has expressed interest in running and managing the project.The UT Administration had re-invited tenders for a third time for the project of converting the Government Press building in Sector 18 into a museum of vintage cars and heritage furniture.Bids were invited from companies and agencies desirous of running the museum at a monthly rent of nearly Rs4 lakh by the Department of Culture of the UT Administration, but no company came forward to run the museum.As per the terms and conditions, the selected company will look after the establishment as well as the maintenance and operation of the museum. On the ground floor of the building, where machines used to run earlier, a vintage car museum is to be built. It will have about 50 vintage cars.Each car will reportedly display its owner’s name, model, company name, chassis and engine number.

The practice, he added, ran contrary to the statement by UT senior standing counsel on February 18, 2020. “In the light of such categorical contention by senior counsel, we direct Pankaj Jain, standing counsel for the UT, to file a specific affidavit in support of his submissions that had been recorded by this court in the order dated February 18, 2020.An order, dated May 7, by the Supreme Court in the case of “the Sarin Memorial Legal Aid Foundation and another versus the Union Territory of Chandigarh and others” was also brought to the notice of the Bench.The Supreme Court, in its order, had virtually set a four-month deadline for the High Court to give its ruling on the raising of apartments from the debris of bungalows in Le Corbusier’s Chandigarh.“We request the High Court to dispose of the writ petition (on the conversion of single residential units to three-storeyed apartments) expeditiously and not later than four months from today,” the Bench had asserted.Taking a note of the order, the High Court Bench added: “In due deference to the same, we post this matter for hearing on July 22. Chetan Mittal, senior counsel, who had been appointed amicus curiae in this matter, undertakes that prior to the fixed date for hearing, he would be filing a detailed synopsis as also suggestions for assistance of this court,” the Bench observed.Senior advocate and the Secretary-General of the foundation, Manmohan Lal Sarin, had earlier told the High Court that one could convert Chandigarh into Delhi. But Delhi could never be converted into Chandigarh.The petitioner-association was seeking directions for restraining the UT Administration and its respondent-functionaries from permitting conversion of residential plots into apartments. The High Court Bench had also asked for the details of the policy on disposal of properties in Chandigarh. “A subsequent vendee of a co-sharer cannot take possession till partition; and that is the crux of the matter before the court,” the Bench had asserted. “The UT does not allow partition”. The Bench had further added that increasing the number of dwelling units too was not without problems, such as pressure on the infrastructure, sewerage and car parking.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/floor-wise-building-plans-hc-tells-chandigarh-to-file-specific-affidavit-284372

Certain Sections of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act were added later on.Justice Harinder Singh Sidhu observed the prosecution’s case was that a mobile handset was recovered from Gagandeep Singh, alias Judge. As per the analysis report, the mobile phone had 256 contacts, including 127 international. All contacts were code-worded. The accused were being instructed from their bosses abroad. Their foreign counterparts provided them financial aid through hawala and other modes.The prosecution had also claimed that their links with foreign counterparts had been established through Internet dongles also. The accused were in contact with each other and far across the border with modern information technology gadgets like walky-talky sets. They procured dangerous illegal weapons and were also in touch with the “infamous secret agency ISI of Pakistan” through these walky-talky sets.Justice Sidhu asserted the allegations appeared to be very serious. But there appeared to be no material to connect the petitioner with it. His specific role in the activities allegedly attracting offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act was not forthcoming from the charge sheet.Beyond merely asserting that the petitioner and the other accused were involved in terrorist activities, the State counsel had not been able to point out any material collected during investigation to connect the petitioner with the accusations sought to be made and to indicate that the allegations against the petitioner regarding the offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, were prima facie true. In fact, no specific act attracting these offences had been pointed out.“The foreign contacts are recorded in the mobile handset recovered from Gagandeep Singh, alias Judge. How the petitioner is connected therewith is not forthcoming. It is also not the case of the prosecution that any of those contacts is involved in promoting anti-national activities,” the Bench concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-grants-bail-to-uapa-accused-284403

The victims were continuously harassed and they were asked to convey to their families so that extortion money could be paid. Out of fear, they initially didn’t share their plight with any jail staff. Later, they disclosed the matter to a senior jail official.Virat, AIG (Jail), said during his regular round of the jail he interact with inmates. All inmates were present during such interactions and that might have stopped inmates from sharing important information with him. “As a corrective measure, we got wooden complaint-cum-suggestion boxes installed outside every barracks which will enable inmates to share information with us without any fear,” said the AIG.The boxes with locks have been installed outside 18 barracks, including women ward. “The keys of these boxes will be with my office staff and I will check these complaint boxes twice a week.

In April-May, 2021, a nationwide study was undertaken to understand the clinico-demographic profile of patients and SARS-CoV-2 strains responsible for post-vaccination breakthrough Covid-19 infections across the country.To understand the possible reason of these breakthroughs, a total 677 clinical samples of individuals who had received two doses (592) and one dose (85) of vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) and tested positive were collected from 17 states/UTs between March and June, 2021. According to the study, 67 cases (9.8%) required hospitalisation and fatality was observed in only 3 cases (0.4%).“This clearly suggests that vaccination reduces severity of disease, hospitalisation and mortality. Therefore, enhancing the vaccination drive and immunising the populations quickly will be the most important strategy to prevent further deadly waves of the Covid-19 and will reduce the burden on the healthcare system,” read the study.Further, 482 cases (71%) were with one or more symptoms, while 29% had asymptomatic Covid infection. Fever (69%) was the most consistent presentation followed by body aches, including headache, and nausea (56%), cough (45%), sore throat (37%), loss of smell and taste (22%), diarrhoea (6%), breathlessness (6%) and 1% had ocular irritation and redness. 86.69% infections belonged to the Delta variant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/mortality-seen-in-0-4-cases-of-breakthrough-infection-284405
17-07-2021||Vijay C Roy||Chandigarh: No respite from network outages soon||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 16The Chandigarh Administration has received nearly 100 applications in the past 15 days for ramping up telecom infrastructure in the city by mobile service providers as residents have been complaining of call drops and poor mobile connectivity for the past many months. However, all applications were incomplete as these have not attached the documents required as per the new Right of Way (RoW) policy notified in February 2021.The submission of incomplete documents shows the callous attitude of service providers towards customers, said sources. So, the applications were sent back to the service providers and they were asked by the administration to submit these again with all documents. It is pertinent to mention here that if an application is in proper order, it takes around 60 days to get permission.According to sources, network outages is not restricted to a particular one player, but more or less the subscribers of all telecom players are experiencing these as the infrastructure was not expanded in sync with demand.According to the Administration, only 21 telecom towers were installed in the city last fiscal year, despite Internet usage and broadband traffic surged in double digit, which, at times, clogged the network leading to call drops and slow speed. Besides, the permission for 12 tower is pending. Overall, in Chandigarh, there are around 762 telecom towers.Perturbed over poor signals, Deputy Commissioner (DC) Mandip Singh Brar had recently instructed the telecom players to take steps to improve signal reception.It is an open secret that amid the lockdown period, several organisations resorted to work from home and others adopted e-learning and e-services, which resulted in an upsurge in broadband traffic and Internet usage.Now, the question arises why mobile service providers did not ramp up the infrastructure despite the fact that voice and data consumption increased significantly when the coronanvirus-induced lockdown was announced in March last year.The sources said owing to the lockdown, some of the players did not expand their infrastructure while the others were waiting for the new RoW policy which was notified in February 2021 as getting permission in previous policy was a Herculean task.An email sent to all three prominent telecom players, namely Vodafone-Idea, Airtel and Reliance Jio, regarding reasons behind network outages and what they are doing to make customer experience better in Punjab Circle (as Chandigarh comes under it) did not elicit any response. Despite repeated attempts, the Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA) did not respond.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-no-respite-from-network-outages-soon-284406
