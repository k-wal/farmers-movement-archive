09-07-2021||Amit Bathla||Vendors fail to show up at Panchkula’s first, largest zone||Tribune News ServicePanchkula, July 8Ever since its inauguration in February last year, the Municipal Corporation has failed to address issues concerning vendors in its first and largest vending zone in Sector 19 – mainly low customer turnout due to remote location and poor road connectivity with other parts of the town.‘We sit idle the entire day’We sit idle throughout the day, waiting for customers. The prices of essential commodities, including vegetables and pulses, have reached an all-time high. How can I feed my family with such a low earning? - Barsatu Nishad, A food item vendor‘Occupancy low despite notices’Though notices were issued to vendors who are yet to take possession of allotted sites, the percentage of occupied sites remains low. The issue will be taken up at the next meeting of the Town Vending Committee. - Kulbhushan Goyal, MayorThe concerns forced a majority of them to not take the possession of the sites allotted to them, while those who took the possession complain of poor sales.During a visit to the vending site today, Chandigarh Tribune found it wearing a deserted look.It has been learnt that even those who had earlier taken possession of their allotted sites have eventually stopped setting up their stalls at the vending zone due to poor sales.They either work as daily wager for an alternative source of income or set up their rehris or roam around in the neighborhood locations like Baltana.“Just a few vendors come to the vending zone every day, that too for limited hours in morning and evening,” said Jai Parkash Pandey, a cloth vendor.Pandey added, “How can we pay Rs2,000 as monthly rent for the site to the civic body with low earnings, particularly when we don’t have proper electricity and water facilities.”Barsatu Nishad, a food vendor, had moved to his allotted site in the Sector 19 vending zone a fortnight ago. From the Day 1, he struggles to get customers.The only breadwinner of his family, Nishad said, “We sit idle throughout the day waiting for customers. The prices of essential commodities, including vegetables and pulses, have reached an all-time high and we are a family of seven. How can I feed my family with such a low earning?”According to MC officials, the Sector 19 vending zone, the largest in the town, has a capacity to accommodate over 300 vendors. Around 200 sites had already been allotted, they said. Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said though notices had been issued to vendors who were yet to take the possession of the allotted sites, the percentage of occupied sites remained low in the Sector 19 vending zone. “The issue will be taken up at the next meeting of the Town Vending Committee,” he said.According to Goyal, at least 778 sites have been allotted at eight vending zones in Sectors 2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15 and 19. However, hundreds of sites are yet to be alloted to vendors in these vending zones.The mc has planned to develop eight more vending zones in the trans-Ghaggar sectors. On this, Goyal said, “Why to waste money? We would first try to allot vacant sites in the already operational vending zones.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/vendors-fail-to-show-up-at-panchkulas-first-largest-zone-280360

09-07-2021||Saurabh Malik||It’s back to learning for judicial officers||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 8It is back to learning for judicial officers of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. Making it clear that the facts in an FIR were required to be reflected in the orders on regular and anticipatory bail pleas, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has asked the Chandigarh Judicial Academy Director to educate the judicial officers about the manner of dealing with such matters.‘Issue appropriate directions’The Director, Chandigarh Judicial Academy, is directed to look into the matter and issue appropriate directions to judicial officers about the manner by which, while passing an order on bail plea, facts in FIR need to be reflected before forming an opinion whether bail/anticipatory bail is to be granted or not. - Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan“The Director, Chandigarh Judicial Academy, Chandigarh, is directed to look into the matter and issue appropriate directions to the judicial officers about the manner by which, while passing an order on bail application, the facts in the FIR need to be reflected before forming an opinion whether bail/anticipatory bail is to be granted or declined,” Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan of the High Court asserted.The directions came on a petition seeking anticipatory bail in a dacoity case. Appearing before the Bench through videoconferencing, counsel for the accused told Justice Sangwan that the order declining anticipatory bail by an Additional Sessions Judge was totally non-speaking and reflected non-application of mind. Besides, the judicial officer lacked the art of writing an order.Rapping the Additional Sessions Judge, Justice Sangwan asserted that the manner in which the order had been passed only reflected that the Additional Sessions Judge noticed that the offence of dacoity under Section 395 of the IPC was serious. As such, the custodial interrogation of the accused was required. “On the face of it, this order was passed against the settled norms,” Justice Sangwan asserted. Recapitulating the procedure, Justice Sangwan asserted that a Judge, while passing on order or a judgment, was required to notice the facts of the FIR, the role of the person seeking bail/anticipatory bail, his antecedents and the gravity of the offence committed before forming an opinion in the light of the guidelines given by the Supreme Court in a number of judgments on granting or dismissing the bail/anticipatory bail. The case will now come up for further hearing in August second week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/its-back-to-learning-for-judicial-officers-280369

So, I have in fact paid more property tax than actually invoiced by the MC. How can I be a defaulter?’’ said Aggarwal.He further claimed: “After the property tax notification of the Haryana Government in 2013, over Rs33 lakh were deposited towards property tax by me. The MC raised a baseless property tax bill-cum-notice of Rs 4.26 crore in 2017. We had challenged the same before the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The court had directed the mall management to deposit Rs1 crore and file an appeal before the Divisional Commissioner (Ambala Division).
