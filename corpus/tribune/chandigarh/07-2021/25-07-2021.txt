As per the prosecution, the accused was found roaming without a mask on April 19, 2020, near Khera Mandir, Mauli complex, Chandigarh, during the lockdown.On completion of the investigation, a challan was submitted before the court. Finding a prima-facie case, charge under Section 188 of IPC was framed against the accused to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.The counsel of the accused contended that in the present case, the investigating officer has not joined any independent witness which is mandatory as per the provisions of Section 100 (4) of the CrPC. He further stated that the accused has been falsely implicated in this case.Additional Public Prosecutor argued that prosecution has proved the charges framed against the accused beyond a shadow of doubt. After hearing the arguments, Randeep Kumar, Judicial Magistrate (Ist Class), said “there are a plethora of judgments in which the Apex Court has clearly held that usually the public hesitate to join the investigation out of fear of enmity with the accused and also for the reasons that they will be dragged into unnecessary litigation. No motive or previous enmity has been shown so as to give reason to the police to falsely implicate the accused.” The accused was convicted and directed to pay a fine of Rs1,000. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/examining-independent-witnesses-in-every-case-not-necessary-says-court-287873

I was thinking why it happened to me. Then I decided to go into the lap of nature. I started planting saplings in the back lane of houses where some people dumped kitchen waste or took their pets for nature’s call. I cleaned the area and converted it into a green space. It helped me recover from depression,” said Joginder Singh Bathh.Bathh started teaching poor students for free after he retired in 2013 as a mathematics teacher from Sacred Heart Convent School, Sector 26. Two months after his retirement, he was caught up with health issues and slipped into depression.“I was thinking why it happened to me. Then I decided to go into the lap of nature. I started planting saplings in the back lane of houses where earlier some people dumped kitchen waste, debris or took their pets for nature’s call. I cleaned the area and converted it into a green space. It helped me recover from depression,” he shared.“It was very challenging, but I continued. I started off with four or five ornamental plants. However, later I grew medicinal plants such as neem, giloy, ashwagandha, tulsi, green tea and lemon grass. Now, I have planted the saplings of pomegranate, papaya, banana and guava,” Bathh told Chandigarh Tribune.He did not want to grow vegetables for self-consumption, but wanted to help local residents by growing medicinal and fruit plants. “Medicinal plants not only helped me, but other people also in warding off several diseases,” he quipped.Since the area is adjoining to the main road, he has also planted bougainvillaea. “It absolves air and noise pollution,” said Bathh, who has grown a total of 50-60 plants in the back lane of 10-12 houses. He teaches poor kids from 4 pm to 6 pm. Children fondly call him ‘Bathh Sir.’The senior citizen is continuing all this despite the fact he underwent a hip joint operation in 2013 and a surgery to remove one of his kidneys, which had developed a tumour, in 2019. “People’s complements and my wife Gurbir Bathh’s support keeps me going,” he smiled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/ex-teacher-takes-the-green-way-to-beat-depression-turns-dump-into-garden-in-chandigarh-287745
