07-06-2020||---||Store owners to take call tomorrow||Chandigarh, June 6The Elante management and outlet owners in the mall continue to remain at loggerheads over the issue of rent. The outlet owners are likely to hold a meeting on Monday to decide on their further course of action.Sources said both sides had earlier held a series of meetings to find a solution.The outlet owners are demanding that the mall management should either waive the rent or revise it, as the Covid-19 pandemic has affected their businesses. “The malls are allowed to operate till 8 pm by ensuring social distancing. It won’t solve our purpose of earning profit. Due to the hot weather, not many people will come out to have food or shop in the afternoon,” said a food outlet owner.The owners of a famous clothing chain said the negotiations were still on with the mall owners. “We have offered that the outlets can pay 50 per cent of the rent from April to June and 75 per cent from July onwards. We are still negotiating with them,” they added.Replying to the queries, a spokesperson of the mall said the mall would reopen on June 8 as per a notification issued by the Chandigarh Administration.The spokesperson preferred not to comment on the rent issue.“Elante will reopen its doors for public on June 8.We are confident that all our partners will resume operations smoothly,” said the spokesperson.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/store-owners-to-take-call-tomorrow-95669

The Administration has allowed operations till 8 pm, which means one has to be there by 7 pm. This is an odd time to serve. As most of the people like to dine out during late evenings, we were expecting the Administration to be more lenient on timings for eateries,” said Ankit Gupta, president, Chandigarh Hospitality Association. He added, “The condition of closure of bars is also one of the main reasons that most restaurants are likely to remain shut till the end of this month. Many have to pay fixed rental costs. If they open, salaries, electricity bills and cost of raw food and other material will add to their misery.”A leading restaurant owner, requesting anonymity, said even allowing 50 per cent occupancy would not help. “The Administration has allowed 50 per cent table occupancy for restaurants, but did not realise how many people go out for lunch. Our main business remains during late evenings when families are free. Takeaway is another major concern for us, as people prefer to order takeaways from small-time eateries, not restaurants.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/50-of-restaurants-in-city-unlikely-to-reopen-assn-95670
