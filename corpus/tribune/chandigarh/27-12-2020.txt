However, a majority of residents, professionals and architects opposed the construction of the flyover.Local MP Kirron Kher has written to UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore for three-month extension to Mukesh Anand, Chief Engineer-cum-Special Secretary, Engineering. The move, however, has been opposed by political leaders and the employees union.“Mukesh Anand has been engaged with the important project of construction of flyover at Tribune Chowk from its initial stages. He has made special efforts to get the project cleared by the government of India and other departments. His technical knowhow of this project cannot be ignored at this level as the project is at its final stage of execution,” said the MP.If this officer is retired at this point, difficulties could be experienced in the execution of the project, she said, adding that it was imperative to the project of this magnitude that Anand be given a three-month extension. “We are not asking for a year’s extension, but only three months,” she stated.The UT Administration has recently decided to go ahead with the flyover as all alternatives to the project were found to be non-feasible. For construction of the flyover, the Administration has to axe 700 trees to pave the way for 1.2-km flyover on the Dakshin Marg.A committee was constituted to examine the technical suggestions on alternatives to the flyover project. Seven models were submitted, but all alternatives were termed as unviable by the committee.What union saysWhile opposing the said extension, Gopal Dutt Joshi, general secretary, Federation of the UT Employees and Workers, Chandigarh, in a letter to UT Adviser to the Administrator, has requested to reject the request for extension.“We are against granting of any type of extension as it is against the declared policy of the Chandigarh Administration. Promotional right of senior most officers should be respected and adhered to,” he said, and demanded the elevation of the senior most superintendent engineer in the UT Engineering Department to the post of the UT Chief Engineer. Criticising Kher for unethically forcing the UT Administration to grant three-month extension to Anand, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Prem Garg said, “It is unethical to give any undue benefits to any officials on political considerations and at the cost of other deserving officials.”Garg further asked what vested interests Kher had in Anand’s extension.“Giving extension to Anand will be an unfair practice otherwise also, when CB Ojha’s promotion as Chief Engineer has already been cleared by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Why Ojha be deprived of his well-deserved promotion,” the AAP convener said.“It is unfortunate that our MP says that the flyover at the Tribune Chowk is in the execution state when it is at the inception stage. The High Court was pleased to stay the cutting of the trees and the issue is sub judice. As far as the extension of Mukesh Anand is considered it may be in favour of the flyover project,” said Paveela Bali, who had filed the petition in the High Court, on behalf of her NGO, The Run Club.Questioning the move of seeking extension for Anand, Paveela Bali said: “The person due to get promotion is equally aware of the project too, then why the extension?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/kirron-kher-seeks-extension-for-chandigarh-chief-engineer-190034

The driver and his helper were killed.Patran SHO Ranbir Singh said the accident seemingly occurred due to a sharp turn at the chowk. The driver must have failed to notice the sharp turn, apparently due to fog.He said: “The truck crashed into the basement of the showroom. The driver had reportedly come to the town for the first time, as such he was not familiar with the sharp turn at the main chowk.” The deceased have been identified as Istak (20) and Nasir (19), both residents of Rajasthan. It was learnt that there are no traffic lights at the main chowk.Meanwhile, a 45-year-old woman, who was riding pillion, was killed after a truck hit the bike on the Patran-Jakhal road near Hamjehri village on Friday afternoon. The bike rider suffered injuries in the accident. A truck driver and his helper, along with the injured bike rider, chased the fleeing truck driver and made him pull over 1.5 km ahead. While the three were standing on the road, another truck hit them, killing the driver and his helper, who were helping the bike rider, on the spot and inflicting more injuries on the biker.The deceased have been identified as Bimla Devi, the pillion rider of the bike, Prince and Amrik Singh who tried to help the bike rider in catching the fleeing driver.The Patiala police have booked the drivers of both trucks under 279, 304-A, 337, 338 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/truck-crashes-into-showroom-2-killed-190035
27-12-2020||Sandeep Rana||Panels sitting on reports, key issues hanging fire||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 26Several contentious issues continue to hang fire as committees approved by the MC General House have failed to table their reports.Important mattersAbout two months ago, the House had approved the formation of a committee to decide the matter pertaining to 4,000 GPS watches. Wearing these watches is mandatory for MC employees. The committee was formed after sanitation workers opposed these watches citing certain faults. The members of the committee have failed to table their report. The civic body is paying a whopping Rs18 lakh per month to the company which has supplied these smart watches on rent to the corporation.The MC Commissioner had claimed that employees’ salaries would be prepared on the basis of data of their respective watches. However, the system has not been implemented yet.Another committee was formed to decide on the increased rent of booths in Sector 23. It, too, has not compiled its report yet.In the last House meeting held in November, two more committees were approved. These committees were formed to decide on the issue of regularisation of buildings violations in Sector 52 and Mauli Jagran colonies on a one-time payment basis. But these are yet to make any headway.Another committee was formed to decide on whether to give temporary water connections to 2,128 consumers outside the “lal dora”, who are at present using the supply illegally.The civic body expects to earn Rs 6.87 crore from the proposed connections.“Forming committees are only a way to dilly-dally an important issue, which the MC cannot decide on. It also shows a lack of interest of councillors in resolving the city issues,” said Baljinder Singh Bittu, Chairman of FOSWAC.While members of the committee claim they had a few meetings and would soon submit the reports, Mayor Raj Bala Malik said: “These issues required in-depth discussion, thus the committees were formed. We will soon table the reports at the MC House meeting.”Similar is the plight of about 12 sub-committees formed under the MC Act. These committees, which are formed each year, too, have failed to deliver over the years.Though the sub-panels are supposed to hold a meeting once a month, a majority of these met only once or twice the whole year. A few sub-committees did not meet even once during the year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/panels-sitting-on-reports-key-issues-hanging-fire-190036

The Centre had asked the UT to start making arrangements to deal with any Covid vaccine-related side-effects as one of the measures towards the safe vaccine delivery among masses.Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, Director, Health Services, UT, said, “Under the universal immunisation programme, an AEFI system already existed but it was targeted to children only. Since this is an adult vaccine, we have reconstituted the committee by involving doctors from cardiology, neurology, medicine, and anaesthesia. Vaccinators have already been trained to identify signs of the AEFI and deal with common occurrences.”Dr Kang added, “A 30-minute on-site monitoring of people, who will be vaccinated, will be mandatory post-vaccination. Besides, we will have 24X7 Covid vaccine help desk functioning to cater to the beneficiaries.”All beneficiaries will be counselled about adverse events, which may occur after administration of the Covid-19 vaccine. “These are expected to be minor events such as local pain and swelling, and mild to moderate fever, etc. However, the list of expected events could be different, based on the safety profile of the Covid-19 vaccine(s) that finally get(s) approved for use,” a document released by the Centre stated.All adverse events will be reported through the Co-Win application developed to monitor and manage the Covid-19 vaccination programme.The UT Health Department has consolidated data of health care workers as per which over 12,000 HCWs will be inoculated against Covid-19. Among the front line workers, there are over 7,000 police personnel and 6,000 workers of the Municipal Corporation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/covid-vaccine-chandigarh-readies-to-watch-deal-with-side-effects-190038

The swimmers also have to submit an undertaking before attending practice sessions.“The pool is going to open only for professional and competitive swimmers. They have to undergo Covid-19 test every week and also before enrolling themselves. The swimmers will be asked to sign an undertaking to declare any kind of illness,” said a senior official.He said the pool would not open for general public/members or amateurs.The department has already issued SOPs and admission forms have been made available. The swimmers will be called in small batches and will train under the supervision of coaches and staff members. For regular upkeep, the pool arena (outside swimming pool) will be sanitised and usage of common bathing facility is also likely to be prohibited.“A circular in this regard has already been issued and we have started filling of admission forms. The pool has been repaired. The swimmers will be called in small batches at designated time slots. We are committed to the promotion of swimming,” said another official.In October, the MHA had approved opening of swimming pools for pro-swimmers and thereafter, the department was planning for the same. Only one swimming pool — the all-weather pool in Sector 23 — was expected to be open for trainees as it has the facility to maintain the water temperature.The Sector 23-based facility was shut since the implementation of the lockdown and the department took almost two weeks to carry out the repair work, cleaning and maintenance work. “It’s a good decision as swimmers can practise during the off-season. So far, we were working on strength and muscle development, but practising in water is necessary. We are ready to follow all SOPs and if each swimmer get three days a week session of one hour each, things will be better in the next few months. All other cities have opened swimming pools for professionals and by god’s grace, everything is normal so far,” said Ankush, a local swimmer.cials maintained that the swimmers have to be cautious not only during practice hours but also during their daily routine. “It’s a collective effort and everyone has to be cautious,” said an official. Meanwhile, on Saturday, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports issued various SOPs for conducting championships in the country. With this, the competitions for swimming are likely to be held before the end of this financial year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/sector-23-swimming-pool-opens-tomorrow-190043

The order has been passed under Section 39(1)(g) of the Consumer Protection Act - 2019 [corresponding Section 14(1)(f) of the Act 1986].The court further said “as a matter of consumer rights, the consumer has the right to know that there will be an additional cost for carry bags (the same being a deviation from the normal wont in retail outlets in general) and also to know the salient specifications and price of the carry bags before he exercises his choice of patronising a particular retail outlet and makes his selection of goods for purchase from the retail outlet.These 14 petitions were filed against a common order passed by the Chandigarh Commission on May 18, 2020. The NCDRC upheld the orders of the Chandigarh Commission through which the firm was penalised for charging for carry bags from consumers terming it as deficiency and unfair trade practice on part of the company.The commission ordered the firm to not only refund the cost of carry bag(s) and pay compensation and cost of litigation to the complainants but also directed to deposit Rs5,000 in the consumer legal aid account of the district forum.The NCDRC finds no fault in the observation of the Chandigarh Commission, which found the practice wrong saying that big stores such as Big Bazaar never allowed customers to carry bags in their hands within their store premises knowing very well that if they were allowed then the customers will not easily give their consent for the purchase of carry bags.The company is, therefore, taking advantage of its dominating position. In this backdrop, charges of such things (carry bags) cannot be separately foisted upon consumers and the same will amount to unfair trade practice on part of Big Bazaar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/big-bazaar-told-to-stop-charging-for-carry-bags-without-prior-notice-190051
