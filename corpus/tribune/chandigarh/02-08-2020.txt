As the necessity for social distancing comes in the way of ‘Eid Mubarak’ greetings that are coupled with hugs, it makes people cherish each other even more. Talib, on his way back home from the Sector 45 mosque, says: “It’s one of the biggest sacrifices — not being able to hug each other and wish Eid. This makes me value the gesture and human bond even more.” His friend (17) looked forward to having ‘shir’. “This year, we couldn’t get the lamb because of Covid, but my mother has prepared shir,” he says. Right next to Jama Masjid in Burail, owner of Karim Halal Meat Shop, Islam Malik, said a few people visited the mosque. “Earlier, Eidhgah mela was held in the nearby park and people would queue up to pay obeisance at the mosque in hundreds, but Covid has made them stay at home,” he said. Though many people, fearing Covid, did not go to the ‘Bakra Mandi’ in Mani Majra, local meat sellers did a brisk business. “My sales have been good this year. Most people are preferring to buy mutton from their local shops rather than buying the lamb from the mandi and that’s advantageous for us,” Malik added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/eid-celebrations-sans-hugs-120890

According to the estimates of the enforcement wing, 200 such food joints exist, but only about 40-50 of them have been paying the monthly fee. However, they, too, could not pay the fee for the past three months due to the lockdown.The outlets have encroached on pathways and parking lots in a few areas such as Sector 32. Earlier, the MC had challaned the defaulters, but their practice continues.“As per the old records, only 40-50 food joints have taken permission from us in this regard. We are conducting a new survey. After the enforcement wing’s report, it will be verified by another special team. After we finalise our policy, food outlet owners will be made aware about it. After that, we will start a strict challaning drive to curb violations,“ said MC Joint Commissioner Sorabh Kumar Arora.The food joints were allowed to put up tables and chairs outside only in the evening, but now permission is being given for a day. Thus, the civic body is doing a survey to identify how many of these outlets exist.Recently, the MC approved the new rates for the practice. Kanwarjit Rana, Chairman of the Enforcement Committee, said: “We have asked the wing to give us information of resources required to carry out the drives.”“Food joints here were dependant on students, but since Panjab Unviersity is closed, they have no business. On the top of it, we are being challaned. During these times, the MC should be lenient. Besides, there should be one price for complete day, there should be no timings,” said Sanjiv Kumar, president, Patel Market, Sector 15.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/food-joints-encroach-on-government-land-120887
02-08-2020||---||‘Why weekend curbs only at Sukhna?’||Chandigarh, August 1 Sukhna Lake wore a deserted look on a rainy day today in the wake of UT Administration’s decision to close the city’s favourite place on the weekends. The decision was taken due to an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases and to avoid large gatherings at one place. However, regular walkers believe that the Administration could have taken precautions instead of a complete closure. “The Administration could have imposed restrictions. Footfall here increases on the weekends as people like to hang out at the lake,” said Pritam Sharma, a regular walker. “We are regular walkers. Since the entry to the lake is closed for two days, we will take a stroll on the road. The Administration needed to take some strong steps. According to me, the same curfew should be imposed on markets also,” said Manika Tiwana, a resident. “Sukhna Lake holds an importance in the lives of city residents. This is a place where a majority of the residents feel they can spend good time after a hectic day. Its closure may have received a mixed response but as per the officials, it’s the need of the hour,” said Prerna, a family psychologist.  "The Administration may have taken the decision so that people don't go out in crowded places. Due to the festive season, the decision to impose the curfew on markets may have been dropped," said an official close to the matter. "It is one of the most attractive spots of the city and ordering its closure will surely help the Administration to focus on other parts of the city," said Dr Amit Mittal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/why-weekend-curbs-only-at-sukhna-120888
