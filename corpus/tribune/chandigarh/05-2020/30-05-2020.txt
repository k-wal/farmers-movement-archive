He is one of the students selected to attend the internship programme at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). A third-year student of Production and Industrial Engineering at PEC, Chawla had left for KIT in January this year.“The first two months were good. My internship started from January 7. There were a few Covid cases at that time and the situation was not as grave. However, on March 22, suddenly all flights were stopped and institutes were closed. I was getting 511 Euros per month (approx Rs 41,000) from the KIT University to bear my living expenses. But still I had to ask help from my family, as this was not enough,” said Chawla.He added: “Due to the pandemic, I was advised by the KIT authorities to leave for India as soon as possible. They even booked a flight for me, but unfortunately, the flight got cancelled. Later, as we remained stuck we contacted PEC Director Dheeraj Sanghi and other deans who helped us.”Students claimed to have approached the Indian Embassy, but allegedly received a little help. “We got a confirmation from the Indian Embassy (in Berlin) that there is a flight from Frankfurt to New Delhi on May 28 (as per German schedule). But it was only for the residents of Delhi-NCR, Haryana and Chandigarh. Some of the students are from Punjab,” said Arshvir Singh from Mechanical Branch.“From 17 students, only five or six received the link for the repatriation of that flight. We again approached our teachers in PEC and got a contact of one of our alumni, who was a consulate officer at Consulate General of India at Frankfurt. She helped us in completing necessary formalities. Our Director wrote to the UT Administration, Punjab Government, Ministry of External Affairs and Indian Embassy in Berlin. PEC helped all of us, including Uday Raghuvanshi, Rajat Goyal, Sahil Mehta, Ankit Billa and Gurpreet Singh, board the same flight,” he added.These students landed in New Delhi on Friday and were later brought to Chandigarh. They have been put under 14-day quarantine at a hotel in Sector 17.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/stuck-in-germany-since-jan-pec-students-finally-return-home-92111

30-05-2020||Naina Mishra||Asymptomatic patients pose challenge at clinical trial of plasma therapy at PGI||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 30Even after three weeks of the beginning of the clinical trial of convalescent plasma use in critically-sick COVID-19 patients at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research and Education (PGIMER), there have been only five donors of plasma as majority of the tricity patients are asymptomatic and not fit for donation.Prof Ratti Ram Sharma, head, Department of Transfusion Medicine, PGIMER, said: “Many recovered patients haven’t qualified for the criteria laid down by the ICMR for plasma therapy. The donors of plasma should have both cough and fever as symptoms during the COVID-19 illness. A majority of patients in the tricity are asymptomatic. We have tried to contact Mohali and Jawaharpur patients as well but they were asymptomatic as well.”Explaining the rationale behind choosing only symptomatic patients, Prof RR Sharma explains: “Those patients who did not develop fever during COVID-19 illness, also did not respond to the infection. There are bleak chances of an anti-body being developed in asymptomatic patients. Fever is taken as a marker of the response in the body. If there is no fever, there is no point taking the plasma from the donor. The degree of response correlates with the degree of the anti-body response.”The plasma therapy is aimed at assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma to limit complications in COVID-19 patients. The critically-ill COVID-19 positive patients admitted in the Nehru Hospital Extension Block will be eligible to get this form of treatment.In this trial, antibodies from the blood of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 are used to treat severely infected patients. However, the exact role of this therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is still debatable and hence, the ICMR decided to conduct a multicentric study to clarify its role in these patients.The collaborative departments for this trial are Departments of Internal Medicine, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Transfusion Medicine, Endocrinology, Virology and community Medicine. The team of doctors from Dept of Transfusion Medicine are getting in touch with patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection and would explain the nature of the study.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/asymptomatic-patients-pose-challenge-at-clinical-trial-of-plasma-therapy-at-pgi-92094
