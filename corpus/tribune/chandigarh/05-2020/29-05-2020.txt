While students are complaining about being asked to pay the rent, most PG owners are afraid to let go of their only source of income. A majority of the city‚Äôs PG accommodations, mostly run by senior citizens, are rented out to students. But as soon as schools, colleges and university were shut due to the lockdown, inmates returned to their hometowns. The PG owners, however, have been asking them to pay half the rent now. Vimal Verma, a student at Panjab University, was staying at a PG accommodation in Sector 37. He has been living in UP, Gorakhpur, since Holi. ‚ÄúWe pay Rs3,000 a month. However, the owner exempted us from paying the rent for March. In April, we were asked to pay Rs1,000 and now, we are paying half the actual rent,‚Äù he said. The owner has been charging him for the luggage still in the room, he adds. ‚ÄúI had to leave in a rush. I didn‚Äôt know the situation will last so long,‚Äù he said. Paying Rs4,800 a month for an accommodation in Sector 34, Yukti, who was a student of SD College, said: ‚ÄúI left the city in March, but was supposed to come to the PG to settle the accounts, but because of the lockdown, I am stuck. Though my landlord has exempted the rent for March, he will charge me for April and May as my belongings are still there.‚Äù Following the February 22 fire tragedy at a PG accommodation in Sector 32, the UT Administration had issued new guidelines. Several PG owners had then asked their guests to vacate the rooms. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want any trouble.

They apparently have to deal with the shortage of essential items and medicines. Narinder Kaur, whose house is under the containment zone, said: ‚ÄúWe are deprived of ration and medicines. Unfortunately, nobody listens to the poor. The administration should give us some relief as the infected person from the colony has already been cured.‚Äù Particular areas in the residential colony were contained after an employee, working in a Baddi pharma company, had tested positive for the virus on May 11. He was later discharged from the Civil Hospital after getting cured of the disease. At present, there are only 17 houses under containment zone. If no positive case is reported from the colony, it will be declared as a containment-free zone after 21 days, when the last case was reported i.e. on May 11, said an official. Bhagat Singh, who is incident commander in the area, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not true. We have deployed officials to address the concerns of people timely. It‚Äôs just that their movement is restricted.‚Äù||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/ease-containment-curbs-say-panchkula-sector-19-residents-91263

A household at Mani Majra has not allowed her to work while at another house she worked for a bureaucrat‚Äôs family. The bureaucrat was transferred to Delhi recently. Kali said she had six members in her family and now the government had given her 5-kg rice and 1-kg each of pulses and salt. One can imagine how difficult it was for her to make both ends meet with such a small quantity of ration, Kali added. She and her family had been living at Dashmesh Nagar in Nayagaon village for the past 20 years, Kali said. ‚ÄúWe have white coloured ration card in the name of Hari Chand, my husband. The card was made 10 years ago at Mullanpur,‚Äù Kali added. Earlier, the depot holder had told them to fill a form to get new card if they wanted ration on subsidised rates provided by the state government, Kali said.   ‚ÄúWe filled the form and handed it over to the depot holder. We don‚Äôt know what happened to the form as curfew was imposed in the area. Other card holders are getting 10-kg atta (wheat flour),‚Äù Kali added.  ‚ÄúMy husband was working at an electronics showroom, but after the lockdown was announced, he lost his job. When there is work, showroom owner calls him and that too once in a week. I fail to understand as how to provide food to my family and meet other expenses,‚Äù Kali said. ‚ÄúWe have spent whatever money saved earlier on daily needs. Now, I am not sure whether I will get job again. The family at bureaucrat‚Äôs home where I worked has told me to wait for another six months till they get retransferred to the city,‚Äù Kali added. Renu Bala, DFSC, Mohali, said, ‚ÄúI will be able to tell the status of the family ration card only if they provide form details or Aadhaar Card number of the applicant.‚Äù  Meanwhile, after learning about Phool Kali‚Äôs plight, a city-based NGO, Joshi Foundation, immediately provided her with a basic ration kit having 10-kg flour, rice, pulses spices, etc. Most maids have lost their jobs after the imposition of the lockdown in the tricity. After relaxation in restrictions following two months, maids are getting work again.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/domestic-help-struggles-to-make-both-ends-meet-91265

Bansal said, ‚ÄúThe Central Government failed to impose the lockdown at the right time. It was too late and without proper planning.‚Äù He blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government for taking arbitrary decisions, which made the situation grave.  ‚ÄúMeetings of the Standing Committees should be held to deliberate on corrective action plan,‚Äù he said. Bansal said Rs20 lakh crore package offeres no relief and it does not have any provision of social security for migrants, peasants, unemployed and middle class. He said as per the 2011 Socio-Economic and Caste Census, only 11 per cent families in the rural areas are out of deprived category (89 per cent families need help). Just 5 kg of grains and 1 kg of pulses is not enough to keep them alive, he added. Bansal said the work of the Union Government seems limited to just two slogans ‚Äî‚ÄòAche Din‚Äô and ‚ÄòAtamnirbhar‚Äô. He launched a programme called ‚ÄòZero Hour‚Äô, to raise various issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/situation-grave-structured-exit-plan-essential-bansal-91266

The  MLAsaid both the varieties are officially developed by the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), but a shop outside the PAU is selling seeds of these varieties to farmers on higher rates.  Sharma said the PAU sells these seeds at Rs70 per kg while the private shop was found selling the seeds for Rs200-Rs250 per kg and duping innocent farmers of their hard earned money.  The shop was allegedly selling seeds branded and marked as ‚ÄòKarnal Agri Seeds‚Äô, he said.

In its order, the court stated, ‚ÄúThe convict has committed gruesome offence with ‚Äòhighest viciousness‚Äô. Human lust had taken such a demonic form. In such cases, sympathy in any form would be misplaced and it would shake the confidence of public in the administration of criminal justice system.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe live in a civilised society where law and order is supreme and citizens enjoy inviolable fundamental human rights, but when these type of offences are committed, it creates ‚Äòripples‚Äô in the conscience of society. Serious doubts are raised as to whether we are really living in a civilised society,‚Äù the court added. The convict through his lawyer had prayed before the court a minimum sentence as he was the sole breadwinner in the family. Kapil Gaur, the public prosecutor, had submitted before the court that the convict committed a heinous crime by raping a physically handicapped girl. So, he deserved the most harsh punishment, he added. The case On March 2, 2018, it was Holi, when the convict entered the victim‚Äôs jhuggi (hut) while her father had gone to Gurdwara Nada Sahib for getting food. He then physically and sexually assaulted her. Upon return, victim‚Äôs father tried to rescue her, but the convict hit him.
