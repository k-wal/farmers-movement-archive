On Tuesday,  a 32-year-old nursing officer, who was posted at the emergency medicine ward of PGIMER had tested positive after coming in contact with the a 65-year-old man from Nayagaon (near Chandigarh) without any safety equipment. UT Adviser Manoj Parida said today that: ‚ÄúOur doctors have been told to go for medical consultation and give advice to patients through video-calling for cases which are not critical. The list and timing will be finalised soon.‚Äù A nursing officer at the PGIMER said: ‚ÄúThe nursing staff kept on emphasising that the patient has symptoms of Covid and some protective gears should be given to them but to no avail. Doctors are leading the war front from the distance. It is the nursing staff that has been dealing with patients closely.‚Äù A letter written by all nursing officers to the PGI Director has highlighted deplorable condition of emergency wards. It reads: ‚ÄúThe patient (Nayagaon Covid case) was incubated by the health team, including junior resident and nursing officer without PPE, N95 mask as he was suffering from acute respiratory disease syndrome. On March 29, he was found positive for Covid. The staff of Emergency Medicine Ward had been exposed already. There is a common washroom for EMW-22, EMW ortho and ortho OT. The Covid patient had roamed in all these areas.‚Äù It may be mentioned here that the covid patient from Nayagaon was initially being tested for HINI and was tested as Covid positive after three days ‚ÄúWe have no time to ask about the travel history from a patient who comes to the emergency ward gasping for air. Our role is to cehck vital signs and by that time, we are exposed already. We are working in the same clothes that we wear from our houses. We know that PPE cannot be given to us and hence we have demanded N95 masks, disposal gowns, and head caps,‚Äù said a nursing officer. The PGI Nurses Welfare Association has demanded PPE, N95 masks and prophylaxis treatment for health workers in ATC OPC, Emergency OPD, ES OPD, APC Emergency, CCU and eye emergency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/sans-safety-gear-nursing-staff-helpless-64357
02-04-2020||Priya Tandon||Patience, prayers are all it will take||More than a week has passed since the lockdown was announced. It‚Äôs been a never-before experience for every household.For some, it may be a experience of staying with family, but for others, it‚Äôs a nightmare. My house has become a co-working space. My husband and children are all working from home. As for me, being primarily a home maker, I have my hands full. But I am happy because I get to see my husband and kids a lot more than normal and have the comfort of knowing that they are safe as well as constructively occupied. No one here is whiling time away, because they are working all day. We get to have our meals together nowadays and that‚Äôs a lovely feeling.The Navratri festival is going on. Who would have thought that in the Navrati, which is celebrated by the Hindus across India, the temples would be closed? Come to think of it, even the gurdwaras, churches and mosques are closed. It‚Äôs almost as if the God is annoyed with humans.Haven‚Äôt we abused all bounties given to us? Man has abused the land, water and air ‚Äî taking a note of the pollution levels. Man has been insensitive and avaricious. Perhaps, it is time to introspect and ask ourselves where we went wrong. We need to apologise and of course, make amends.One thing that everyone is realising is that life after Covid-19 shall be very different from what it was before. We shall learn to understand what is really valuable. We all should realise that life is not about accumulation of wealth but about how you can use it to help those in need. Suddenly, all your properties, business, lands, expensive clothes, jewels, handbags, shoes and cosmetics have no meaning. Our only concern is making through this all. It‚Äôs all about surviving. And for that, we have to live a life of discipline and austerity. Restraint from going out is also a form of discipline. Utilising resources judiciously and going out only when necessary requires a lot of patience.In the time of adversity, everyone should try to pitch in to help those who have no means of earning. The daily wagers have no work so they are the worst affected. How are we ever going to repay the selfless work being done by doctors, paramedical staff, the police, the media and milk and vegetable vendors? Not to forget, NGOs who have suo moto taken up the cause of giving food to many. All of these are surely working more than they do in normal times.The world is applauding India‚Äôs foresight and promptness in reacting to the impending situation.Chandigarh is doing pretty well in terms of social distancing. A number of NGOs as well as the Administration, religious organisations, political parties and business houses have come forward to give raw ration/ cooked food packets to those in need. There are several Good Samaritans out there. May their tribe increase!With the cooperation and efforts of all, and with God‚Äôs grace we can fight the virus. I, along with other members in family, pray to the Almighty for the wellbeing of all every day. We seek His ‚Äòkaruna‚Äô to tide over coronavirus! Collective prayers are very potent. It‚Äôs time that we realise that God is all we are left with and God is all that we really need.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/patience-prayers-are-all-it-will-take-64356
02-04-2020||Juzar Singh||Their quest  for identity||‚ÄúWe are what we are, we want a normal life, dignified life and a family, we want equal study and work opportunities. How we talk, how we walk, how we behave and how we look is all because of our hormones. We want people to accept us, adjust us and avoid the negativity that comes to their mind when they see us. We, too, are human beings,‚Äù said Oshin Sarkar, a transgender student at the Department of Women Studies, PU.All that they need is people to behave normally with them. They are barely respected and often ridiculed. They have to hide their identities for the fear of being taken to ‚ÄòDeras‚Äô for ‚Äòhijras‚Äô. Those who somehow manage to reach educational institutes face several difficulties there.In 2017, the first transgender student at the PU, Dhananjay Chauhan, succeeded in getting separate washrooms on the university campus. In 2015, the PU added a third column for transgenders. Dhananjay Chauhan said society should create a friendly environment for transgenders. ‚ÄúThere is a difference between sex and gender, sex is related to a physical state whereas gender is a mental state. Nowadays, one could undergo a surgery for changing sex in Chhattisgarh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu,‚Äù said Dhananjay. She says they need separate hostels also as people don‚Äôt want to rent their rooms to us.‚ÄúIf seats are reserved for transgenders, they can come to educational institutes for higher education, their presence in educational institutes and interaction with other students could be helpful in normalising their life. Reservation in jobs and education could help them with social acceptance,‚Äù said Dhananjay.Recently, Rajya Sabha MP from Odisha, Sasmit Patra, had introduced a Constitution Amendment Bill in the Upper House on March 13 which seeks reservation for transgenders in the Parliament and state assemblies.Dhananjay Chauhan runs an NGO ‚ÄòSaksham‚Äô for the welfare of transgenders. The purpose of the NGO is to pull their community out of the begging practice and provide them with higher education so that they can live with dignity.Oshin Sarkar has another version about the reservation, separate hostels and washrooms. According to her, these things are needed but what is desperately needed is creating awareness in society. ‚ÄúIn a society which is accepting and tolerant, there will be no need for separate accommodations and washrooms. It is sad that people seek our blessings, but don‚Äôt accept us,‚Äù said Oshin.Parliament had passed the Transgender Persons Bill, 2019, to protect the fundamental rights of the community, but the law raises concerns as it mandates a two-step procedure in which transgenders can get a ‚Äòtransgender certificate‚Äô through self-declaration about their gender. In the second step, they can apply for ‚Äòchange in gender certificate‚Äô but it requires surgery and documents confirmed by a medical authority. The WHO recommends that there should be no medical requirement for a person‚Äôs self-defined identity.We need to stop stigmatising identities and accept each in its own beautiful and refreshing way ‚Äî without this, there is no way ahead for any of us.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/their-quest-for-identity-64355
02-04-2020||Rajnish Wattas||Rendezvous with nature||During the time when everyone is staying at home, life doesn‚Äôt have to essentially become boring. For me, necessary joy is being generated by keeping in touch with nature.With the change of our quotidian rhythm, instead of the usual brisk morning walk in a neighbourhood park, I now do a leisurely stroll in our tiny lawn. I pause to admire the bottle brush trees across the boundary wall laden with red brush-like flowers, popping out from dainty feathery leaves. The small-sized trees with rough barks make them a favourite with squirrels who do a myriad acrobatics and scamper from one branch to another. Suddenly, I spot a parrot in its green feathery coat with a red band around its neck, fluttering his magnificent plumage. The similar red and green colour combination of the bottle brush trees might have perhaps fascinated him too.Looking down on the surface of the uncut lawn, I spot little star-like yellow flowers carpeting the surface. Wondering if these could be a ‚Äòdesi‚Äô version of dandelions, I call my horticulturist friend to identify them. The answer is no! These are just seasonal weeds, but how beautifully they embroider the green carpet of lawn with nature‚Äôs artistry.In the distance, I espy a ‚Äòkachnar‚Äô tree in bloom with its pink-white blossoms. Even if I can‚Äôt go near it, its powdery sprinkle of blossoms fallen on the ground can be smelt by my mind‚Äô eye. A sleeping seed of nasturtium suddenly sprouts out from slumber and shows up its orange yellow flower in a small crack in the driveway.In the little vegetable patch in our backyard, brinjal plants have overnight adorned small purple flowers. Even if they bear little fruit, the patch is worth its floral beauty. And right next is a patch of ‚Äòmethi‚Äô (fenugreek) that with the onset of warm weather has become overripe for eating, but gets speckled with yellow flowers in preparation for bearing seeds. These are short-lived flowers and remind me of Robert Bridges words:‚ÄúI have loved flowers that fade,Within whose magic tentsRich hues have marriage madeWith sweet unmemoried scents‚Ä¶‚ÄùIn spring, there is much mellifluous birdsong to bow our heads to for their divine orchestra. If you spot the long-tailed tree pie bird you can expect a ‚Äògrating overture followed by tinkling of bells‚Äô unlike the coppersmith‚Äôs ‚Äòdrab koob koob‚Äô. Of course, the ever quarrelling noisy babblers will have to be ignored. In March, the dwarf variety of a mango tree in our backyard begins to don fragrant blossoms holding promise of basketfuls of luscious fruit. If you get lucky, you may spot or at least hear a ‚Äòkoel‚Äô hiding amid the foliage. If you‚Äôre lazy, then you will rue like the poet James Stephen:‚ÄòI heard a bird at dawnSinging sweetly on a tree,That the dew was on the lawn,And the wind was on the lea;But I didn‚Äôt listen to him,For he didn‚Äôt sing to me.‚ÄôMy favourite readings on identifying trees, flowers and birds is Khuswant Singh‚Äôs ‚ÄòNature Watch‚Äô and Indian Birds by Martin woodcock.The ‚Äòstay at home‚Äô can turn into a houseful of wonders, if only we see and hear them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/rendezvous-with-nature-64354

Though it mostly affects lungs and causes pneumonia, but a lot of cases have now come forward wherein it has affected heart lethally, said Dr Virendar Sarwal, cardiothoracic and vascular surgeon here today. A study led by Dr Zhibing Lu at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University has found that 20 per cent of Covid cases had some evidence of heart damage. Many were not known to have underlying heart disease. But they often had abnormal electrocardiograms in addition to elevated troponin levels, which sometimes soared to levels seen in patients with heart attacks, he said. ‚ÄúThe risk of death in such patients is four times more than in a normal patient in heart attack and surprisingly, most of the patients do not have history of heart disease,‚Äù said Dr Sarwal.  Myocarditis could likely be caused either by the virus itself, or the body‚Äôs immune and inflammatory response to the virus, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/covid-infection-can-directly-affect-heart-doc-64350

There are also complaints that private hospitals were not only under-reporting bed capacity, but were also charging exorbitant rates for syringes and medicines from the patients.According to sources, one of the hospitals had allegedly under-reported that they had 180-bed capacity instead of 300. Under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, private hospitals have to provide beds and isolation wards on pro-rata basis to district health authorities depending on the overall capacity of the hospital and strictly on the principle of equity.Deputy Commissioner Girish Dayalan said, ‚ÄúThis is an unprecedented situation and at this time, parochial profiteering objectives cannot be justified. Concerted efforts will be required in order to be fully prepared as the public health infrastructure is grossly inadequate, given the potential magnitude of the pandemic. The private sector in the district has a strong health infrastructure, which is crucial to supplement ICU beds/ventilators needed in the district, so it is imperative to take urgent and essential steps to synchronise the strategies/infrastructure for prevention and treatment of the pandemic.‚ÄùDayalan said an advisory committee had been constituted, which would assess and decide the number of beds/ventilators/ ambulances, etc, on the basis of overall capacity of the hospital and strictly on the principle of equity. He said private hospitals (having 10 beds or more) in the district would set aside isolation beds/wards/other infrastructure as specified by this committee to be placed at the disposal of the Civil Surgeon (CS), Mohali, to be called into service as and when the need arises. The cases referred by the CS shall not be charged by the hospitals concerned; except for consumables (such as medicines, syringes, etc,) actually used in the treatment.The Deputy Commissioner further said private hospitals had been directed to ensure that staff, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, etc, were all available on duty and no one shall refuse treatment to Covid-19 positive/suspected cases. He said the district was also home to considerable population from low-income groups, especially migrant labour, who could not afford private medical care. The survival or life of any person cannot be dictated by his paying capacity as access to healthcare is a fundamental part of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/panel-to-assess-bed-capacity-in-mohali-private-hospitals-64347

02-04-2020||Manpriya Singh||I‚Äôd love to be amidst nature, says artist Prem Singh||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 1Before the lockdown, we all had a life, but ironically, it‚Äôs the lockdown that has taught us how to live. In the process, reflect on things, reconnect with things, especially those around us ‚Äî pets, people, plants.As the question, ‚ÄòHow‚Äôs the lockdown going‚Äô, temporarily replaces the traditional form of greetings, novel ideas emerge every time it is put to someone.‚ÄúI spend quite a bit of time gazing out of the window,‚Äù laughs Prem Singh, an eminent artist and former principal of the Government College of Art. It‚Äôs cruel ironies of time and the lockdown that has reversed the roles for good. ‚ÄúOne of my sons is in Canada and the other in the UK. Now, they call us up daily to check if we are home and haven‚Äôt ventured out.‚ÄùIn fact, that‚Äôs not where the instructions end. ‚ÄúThey even tell us to stock on ration and other groceries for the rainy days ahead because this problem, unfortunately might take time to end completely.‚ÄùWhile he hopes his children and grandchildren were with him during the lockdown, but since that couldn‚Äôt be so, much of the time these days is also spent in conversations and exchanging notes on the Covid-19 situation in the¬†countries where his immediate and extended families are based. ‚ÄúEvery day there is an update, there is a hope and there are measures taken. Let‚Äôs hope we get out of it, changed for good.‚ÄùReading is something that he enjoys, but ironically, ‚ÄúI had ordered a few books to read from Amazon and that order is stuck in the lockdown.‚ÄùEven though artists are famous for spending significant time of their day in the studio, he still misses the freedom, because ‚ÄúFreedom is something the most dear to the artist. But I don‚Äôt feel that freedom now. I‚Äôd love to be outside, amidst nature.‚ÄùHe adds, ‚ÄúI miss interacting with my friends and sharing my work with them.‚ÄùThis is perhaps one of the few instances in history when the ironic lack of freedom has actually given freedom of time and space.An individual cannot remain unaffected by what‚Äôs happening around; an artist even more so. This is why his drawings inspired by the lockdown depict several things like, ‚ÄúWe in conversation with the things around ‚Äî pets, people and plants. The works also reflect on how we are breathing the present.‚Äù||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/id-love-to-be-amidst-nature-says-artist-prem-singh-64336
