30-06-2020||New Delhi||Indigenous airborne Locust control system on MI-17 helicopter at 3 BRD Chandigarh||The versatile MI-17 helicopter will now be used locust control operations.The Indian Air Force has tasked 3 Base Repair Depot located at Chandigarh to undertake the challenging task of indigenously designing and developing an Airborne Locust Control System (ALCS) for Mi-17 helicopters in view of envisaged delay in provisioning of modification kits from the UK¬†due to COVID lockdown, according to a statement by Agriculture Ministry.Using all indigenous components, the atomised airborne spraying of pesticide has been successfully achieved in air through a configuration of nozzles mounted both sides on external trusses of a Mi-17 helicopter, it said.¬†The nozzles used for the purpose are a mix of commercially available nozzles as well as the nozzles developed by CSIO, Chandigarh.Anticipating Locust attack, the Ministry of Agriculture had¬†signed a contract with M/s Micron, UK to modify two Mi-17 Helicopters for spraying atomized pesticide to arrest locust breeding in May 2020.¬†However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, the UK-based firm would be able to manufacture and supply the modification kit to IAF only from September 2020 onward for system integration and testing.¬†¬†In the meanwhile, an unprecedented locust attack started manifesting from last week of May and was fast spreading practically across many states.¬†Malathion in appropriate concentration would be filled in the internal auxiliary tank of 800 litres capacity fitted inside the helicopter and pumped into the nozzles by using an electrical pump as well as compressed air, achieving nearly 40 minutes of spaying duration in the infected zone covering an area of approximately 750 hectares in each mission.A team of Test Pilots and Test Engineers of Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment, Bangalore, have successfully carried out ground and airborne trials of ALCS on a modified Mi-17 helicopter.¬†¬†Being an indigenously developed system, the ALCS would offer inherent advantages of in-house maintenance, future upgradeability, saving of foreign exchange and help in making the country Self Reliant in aviation related technology.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/indigenous-airborne-locust-control-system-on-mi-17-helicopter-at-3-brd-chandigarh-106693

An expert from the PGI‚Äôs School of Community Medicine said, ‚ÄúThe ICMR also asks states to test influenza-like illness (ILI) cases coming to hospitals. One of the reasons could be that hospitals are not testing ILI patients. Besides, in order to check the extent of community infection, more pregnant women should be tested as they represent community.‚ÄùUT health officials claim that the low testing is due to "less spread of Covid in the city". Arun Gupta, Health Secretary, UT, said, ‚ÄúOne reason behind low testing as compared to other states could be less spread of the disease in Chandigarh and hence lesser number of people requiring testing as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) criteria.‚ÄùHowever, medical experts feel that the guidelines of the ICMR are being "dodged" by the UT Administration.

So, to avoid miscarriage of justice to the complainant in the graft case involving police officers, an inquiry was needed. The order further stated that ‚Äúthe court deems it fit to refer the matter to the Senior Superintendent of Police, Chandigarh, for taking necessary action on the present complaint against the police officials in accordance with law under intimation to this court.‚ÄùPrem Singh Bisht is the complainant and witness in a 2017 graft case. In his application submitted before the special CBI court, he alleged that he was being threatened by some police officers of Chandigarh, who were asking him to turn hostile in a case against Inspector Jaswinder Kaur, who was the then SHO of Mani Majra Police Station. In 2017, the CBI had arrested Sub-Inspector (SI) Mohan Singh while allegedly accepting bribe of Rs2 lakh from Bisht at the Sector 31 market. Bisht approached the CBI after SI Mohan Singh allegedly demanded Rs9 lakh from him to drop the names of three of his employees from an FIR registered for an attempt to murder.Later, the complainant had also filed an application against SHO Jaswinder Kaur under Section 319 of the CrPC.Consequently, the CBI has now referred the matter to the competent authority for taking into consideration the facts of the case for the purpose of issuance of sanction against Jaswinder Kaur.The CBI had not chargesheeted Jaswinder Kaur, but it is still awaiting report for the grant of prosecution sanction against Kaur from the competent authority.Bisht had alleged that he was getting threats from cops, including Rajdeep Singh, Jaswinder Kaur and Constable Ashok. He said they wanted him to submit an affidavit in the favour of Jaswinder Kaur or they would falsely implicate him and his partner in an NDPS case. Bisht also expressed fear for his life and demanded security. He had asked for a CBI investigation in the case. Bisht has sought directions for preserving the phone records and CCTV footages of the police officials concerned.KP Singh, public prosecutor for the CBI, argued and placed the facts regarding the application moved by the complainant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/cbi-court-refers-complaint-against-policemen-to-ssp-106424

Vardan Rana became a major in July 2010. When he approached the UTI for the payment of the value of the units, he was told that the same had already been paid on April 28, 2009, and April 29, 2009, to his mother Indira Rani.He challenged the decision before the District Forum, Chandigarh, seeking compensation. He lost the case after the UTI contested that Indira Rani, submitted guardian updation form with a letter from a bank giving the details of a bank account in the name of the complainant. The signatures of Indira Rani had been attested by the bank. Her name was accordingly updated as the guardian of the complainant and a cheque in the name of the complainant with his account number printed on it was sent to Indira Rani. Vardan challenged the Forum‚Äôs decision dated December 20, 2011, before the State Commission, Chandigarh.The commission had ruled that the UTI erred in making the payment to complainant‚Äôs stepmother and directed the UTI to pay a sum of Rs3,49,878 to the complainant with interest as per the terms and conditions of the scheme. Compensation quantified at Rs10,000 and the cost of litigation was Rs5,000.Vardan Rana had proven that the name of his biological mother was known to the UTI before the name of Indira Rani was updated as the guardian of the complainant in 2005. The national commission ruled that the UTI was grossly negligent in updating the name of Indira Rani as Rana‚Äôs mother. The order said that for the reasons stated above, the view taken by the state commission does not call for any interference by this commission.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/national-consumer-disputes-redressal-panel-junks-uti-plea-106425

The drugs contain a metal as an active ingredient and are most commonly used as anti-cancer or anti-microbial agents.A solid compound based on phosphomolybdate cluster, an inorganic salt belonging to the polyoxometalates (POM) family, had been earlier identified to have anti-tumor potential. A team of INST scientists, led by Dr Monika Singh and Dr Deepika Sharma, has chalked out a mechanism by which the compound kills cancer cells.The POMs are an evolving class of inorganic metal oxides which have established promising biological activities over the last decade by the virtue of great diversity in structures and properties.To probe into the mechanism of how the cancer cells are attacked by the compound, the team synthesised it by hydro-thermal method. An aqueous mixture of sodium molybdate, phosphorus acid and bipyridine was heated in an acetate buffer solution of pH4 at 160 degrees Celsius for 72 hours.The compound‚Äôs cytotoxicity or the quality of being toxic to cells was determined on breast cancer, lung cancer and liver cancer cells by conventional colorometry. The observations were further compared with that of a routinely used chemotherapeutic agent.The mechanism of cell death occurring in breast cancer, lung cancer and liver cancer cells were also evaluated and the effect of the synthesised materials on cell division was determined. The in-vitro results showed that the hybrid solid is less toxic towards normal cells and its anti-tumour activity was also found to be comparable with that of a routinely used chemo-therapeutic agent.The POMs have evolved as a promising candidate for metallodrugs for combating cancer. The compound synthesised by the INST, can open up new avenues for anti-tumour applications.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/inst-synthesises-compound-for-anti-cancer-use-106429

However, he failed to fulfil both the promises even after receiving the payment, Luthra added.He had made the payment through cash and cheques, Luthra said.Surinder came in his contact when he met him at the CHB office where the former was an employee, Luthra said. The accused helped Luthra in getting his house at the MHC transferred in his name.Thereafter both had cordial relationship. When he was admitted to the PGI for brain tumor (cancer) Surinder met him and assured him of all help, Luthra added. Later, Surinder took 22.25 lakh on the pretext of either getting an appointment for his son at the CHB office or sending him abroad, but he failed to fulfil the promise, Luthra said. When Luthra demanded his money the accused gave him cheques of different amounts, but they got dishonored.While dismissing the bail application of Surinder Kumar, the Judicial Magistrate-First Class (JM-IC), Kushal Singla, in the order stated: ‚ÄúThe accused has duped many innocent persons. Moreover, recovery of money is yet to be effected. The case is in the preliminary stage of the investigation. The challan in the case is not yet presented. In view of this accused Surinder Kumar is not entitled to the concession of bail.‚ÄùThe District Courts heard the case through video conferencing. Advocate Ashok Sehgal opposed the bail application of the accused, Surinder Kumanr, on behalf of the complainant, Kuldeep Kumar Luthra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chb-officials-bail-plea-rejected-106430

30-06-2020||-----------------Jagat Ram Director||Covid-19 and the way forward for healthcare||Rakesh KochharSub-dean, ResearchWe are into the sixth month of Covid-19 in India. The number of cases is still rising and the peak is yet to come. The healthcare system has been stretched to the limit, burdened with the onslaught of Covid-19 at the expense of treatment for non-Covid diseases.The pandemic has affected patients suffering from other diseases. Figures suggest that in March and April, one lakh less cancer patients reached hospitals, 4.5 lakh fewer children received vaccination and 30% fewer obstetric emergencies reached hospitals. The government-supervised treatment of TB, having been interjected, will result in at least 1.5 lakh additional deaths in the next five years. Similarly, with more than two lakh new patients of chronic renal failure added every year, and interruption in dialysis facilities, we are likely to see increased fatalities. The same holds true for patients with coronary heart disease who are facing problems in getting interventional procedures. Data suggests hospitalisation under the PMJAY/Ayushman Bharat Scheme during the 10 weeks of lockdown dropped by 51%. Cancer treatment fell by 64% and institutional childbirth by 26%.In most states, government hospitals are bearing the brunt as these have been dedicated as Covid-19 hospitals. These hospitals are facing a shortage of isolation beds, ICU facilities, ventilators and manpower. With high cost of treatment in private hospitals and their reluctance to treat Covid-19 patients, there is pressure on a tertiary care centre like the PGI.Last year, the PGI had seen nearly 30 lakh patients in the OPD and more than one lakh were admitted, with over 2.5 lakh undergoing surgical procedures. Every day, close to 350 patients used to approach the emergency OPDs with 40% of them requiring hospitalisation. For the northern states, the PGI is the only government facility offering robotic surgery, liver transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, advanced cardiac procedures and PET-CT besides non-surgical specialised interventions. While Punjab accounts for nearly 40% of admissions, patients from UP, Uttarakhand and Bihar also seek treatment at the PGI.The pandemic has exposed inadequacies in the public sector healthcare system, especially at the secondary and tertiary care levels. It should be a wake-up call for Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir to augment infrastructure in their medical colleges.The PGI started the tele-consultation facility about four weeks ago. Of the close to 1,000 patients from medical OPD available for analysis, about 40% were consulting a doctor for the first time, suggesting they should have ideally been seen locally first. One-third needed easily available investigations like blood tests, x-rays or ultrasound before going further. Had these patients come to the PGI, they would have had to come again with test reports. Only 12% of the patients needed immediate attention.Data suggests that most patients at the PGI tax the facility unnecessarily. To optimise tertiary care at the PGI, patients should first be seen at the primary or secondary healthcare facilities and referred only for difficult-to-diagnose conditions or for specialised treatment not available elsewhere. If the district hospitals and medical colleges can provide coronary angiography, management of stroke, hepato-biliary surgery or neurosurgery, then the PGI expertise can be used for complex interventional procedures, robotic surgery or advanced retinal procedures.Non-Covid patients are denied ready access to medical facilities. Delay in diagnosis can lead to progression of the disease, making treatment difficult. A patient of liver cirrhosis or early cancer may become untreatable. A patient in early stage of coronary artery disease may develop heart failure or a simple patient of gallstone may develop complications. Covid-19 has also generated problems like joblessness, depression, and increase in domestic violence or alcoholism. A recent report said there is 60% increase in cases of suicide in one of the northern states.The crisis has also given us an opportunity to assess deficiencies and overcome them. Health infrastructure must be improved and specialised manpower generated or augmented in district hospitals and medical colleges in the region. We need super-specialists like cardiologists, gastroenterologists, neurosurgeons and urologists with corresponding upgrade of equipment and facilities. There is no point in having ventilators and not having critical care specialists to manage the patients or vice versa. Secondly, a referral system should be there in each state. Only cases requiring specialised treatment should be referred to the PGI; all others should be managed by the district hospitals or medical colleges.Each district can have a nodal officer to evaluate the need for referral. The patients could then be referred to the PGI after a tele-consultation with super-specialists. Availability of ICU beds should be checked to avoid inconvenience.Though the OPDs are functional through tele-consultation and telemedicine facilities, to help non-Covid patients at the PGI, plans are afoot to review resumption of physical OPD services in specialties. While ante-natal care and chemotherapy services are already available, along with emergency facilities for trauma, head injuries and medical conditions, there is a need to restart other services. It has been proposed that the OPDs should be started in a staggered manner, beginning from Chandigarh itself and then to the neighbouring states. Patients from Chandigarh should be routed through GMSH-16 and GMCH-32, and from Panchkula and Mohali through their district hospitals. Each patient could carry a slip with the indication for referral clearly defined. The second way of intake into the PGI could be booking an appointment through tele-consultation.Experience with telemedicine in the past two months has shown that it is a win-win situation. With a defined number of patients coming to the PGI, they will get better care. Patients can be allotted a specific time. Patients referred could be given priority in tele-booking appointments. A provision has also been suggested under which patients can be sent back to the referring facility after the diagnosis is established, treatment outlined and the acute phase over.We should utilise the current crisis to streamline the public healthcare system so that resource utilisation is optimised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/covid-19-and-the-way-forward-for-healthcare-106360
