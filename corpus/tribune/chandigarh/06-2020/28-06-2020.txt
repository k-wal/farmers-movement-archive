The technology has been transferred to a private firm for its commercialisation and mass production. Protective eye wear According to scientists, the conjunctiva membrane, located inside the eyelid to lubricate the eyeballs, is the only exposed mucous membrane of the body. When the eyes are opened, the conjunctiva membrane is also exposed, making it an important, but often overlooked entrance for viruses. The protective eye wear is ergonomically designed to provide full cover and efficient sealing to the eye area from hazardous aerosols as well as other suspended particles.A team of the CSIO scientists led by Dr Vinod Karar, chief scientist and head, Optical Devices and Systems, had taken up the design and development of the safety goggles in consultation with various industries and stakeholders.These safety goggles are designed with a flexible frame to provide tighter sealing with the skin of the face and would cover the eyes and the surrounding areas and even accommodating for prescription eyeglasses. It consists of a sturdy polycarbonate lens and an adjustable elastic strap for ease of wearing.“The goggles comply with ANSI/SEA Z87.1-2010 standard with respect to see-through optical transmittance and can be used in varied environmental conditions without any fogging or fatigue,” said Dr Neha Khatri, senior scientist and Principal Investigator, CSIO, associated with the project.The team included Dr Vinod Karar, Dr Sanjeev Soni, Dr Amit L Sharma, Dr Mukesh Kumar and Vinod Mishra.Dr Surender S Saini, head, business initiatives and project planning, said apart from healthcare professionals, the safety goggles could also be useful for the general public in crowded areas as well as in public transport.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/csio-develops-goggles-to-prevent-covid-19-infection-105531

28-06-2020||Chandigarh||High Court frowns on frivolous pleas for ignoring delay||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that keeping track of his case was the “bounden duty” of a petitioner; and decades-old excuses for not keeping in touch with the counsel, such as being mentally upset, could no more be accepted by the courts. It was time to denounce and turn down such thoughtless pleas.“It is pertinent to mention here that such types of frivolous/false pleas are taken in routine by every litigant for the past three to four decades. Much water has already flown. Now the time has come to deprecate and reject such type of frivolous pleas, taken in routine to abuse the process of law. More so, ignorance of law is no excuse,” Justice Ramendra Jain of the High Court asserted.The assertion came on a revision petition challenging an appellate court verdict dated July 29, 2017, affirming the trial court judgment dated January 23, 2014, whereby he was convicted in a cheque bounce case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a year and pay Rs3,000 as fine. An application was also submitted for condoning an inordinate delay of 847 days in filing the revision petition.The ground taken in the application was that the impugned judgment was passed in July 2017 by the appellate court in his absence as he was mentally upset and could not enquire about the case from his counsel. However, his family kept on depositing the due amount. The applicant-petitioner, under depression and tension, thought that his case had been closed. He came to know about the impugned judgment only when police officials arrested him on February 1, the Bench was told.Justice Jain observed: “The plea of applicant-petitioner qua his mental tension and depression is apparently incorrect in the absence of any medical prescription or certificate in this regard. Be that as it may, by this time, it is well settled that a litigant has to be vigilant throughout, till any legal proceeding initiated by him or against him is concluded. Thus, it was bounden duty of the applicant-petitioner to remain in touch with his counsel to pursue his case.”Justice Jain added that reason had not been explained for absence of efforts to ask the counsel about the fate of his case for a long duration.Dismissing the petition, Justice Jain added that each day’s delay was required to be explained in a mathematical manner, but the plea taken by the petitioner-applicant was completely vague, false and unreliable. As such, the court was not inclined to condone the inordinate delay of 847 days in filing instant revision.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/high-court-frowns-on-frivolous-pleas-for-ignoring-delay-105518
