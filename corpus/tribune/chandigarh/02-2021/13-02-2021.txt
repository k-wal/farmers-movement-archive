Hypocalcemia in Covid patients with the severe or critical disease is not unexpected.The basis of the study is to predict Covid-19 with hypocalcemia as it is associated with severe disease, organ failure, increased likelihood of hospitalisation, admission to the intensive care unit, need for mechanical ventilation and death due to the virus.“In our clinical practice, we had encountered cases of confirmed hypocalcemia in patients with non-severe Covid-19,” says the PGI study.The study, “High Prevalence of Hypocalcemia in Non-severe Covid-19 Patients: A Retrospective Case-Control Study”, was published in the Frontiers in Medicine journal.The study was conducted by Dr Rimesh Pal, Dr Sant Ram, Dr Deepy Zohmangaihi, Dr Indranil Biswas, Dr Vikas Suri, Dr Laxmi N Yaddanapudi, Dr Pankaj Malhotra, Dr Shiv L Soni, Dr Goverdhan D Puri, Dr Ashish Bhalla and Dr Sanjay K Bhadada.According to doctors, hypocalcemia is highly prevalent even in Covid-19 patients with non-severe disease probably implying that hypocalcemia is intrinsic to the coronavirus disease. The study says that the elevated levels of unbound and unsaturated fatty acids have been reported in Covid-19 patients and unsaturated fatty acids can bind calcium, causing hypocalcemia.The study also found out an overall occurrence of hypovitaminosis D (97%) in the Covid-19 patients. “The high prevalence in the cases could be explained based on the nationwide lockdown that had possibly limited the duration of sunlight exposure. Alternatively, it can be hypothesised that hypovitaminosis D, per se, is a risk for incident Covid-19 infection,” says the study.After exclusion, 72 patients with non-severe Covid-19 (63 mild and nine moderate disease) and an equal number of healthy controls were included in the final analysis. Hypovitaminosis D and hypocalcemia were seen in 97% and 67% patients, respectively.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/pgi-study-finds-calcium-deficiency-in-67-non-severe-covid-patients-211742

What CBI chargesheet saysThe CBI alleged in the chargesheet the then superintending engineer had exempted licence fee and advertisement fee/tax by the way of two allotment letters to the company for which there was no approval from the competent authority. Based on the allotment letters, the company did not give the advertisement fee to the MC. As per the terms and conditions of the contract, a minimum fee of Rs500 per toilet was to be charged from the company but the accused officer allegedly exempted the same which caused the loss of Rs25.80 lakh to the Municipal Corporation.The case has been sent to the HC in view of the Supreme Court’sjudgment passed on October, 15, 2020, in the case of Asian Resurfacing of Road Agency Pvt Ltd v/s Central Bureau of Investigation. In this case, the apex court ruled that the stay orders passed by High Courtand subordinate courts expired in six months, unless extended for good reasons. The Punjab and Haryana High Court has already stayed the trial in this case in 2016.A reference has been made to the High Court after the CBI moved an application for resumption of the trial in the case. The CBI contended that in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court, the trial proceedings of the case may be resumed, as final order has already been stayed for more than six months by the High Court. While replying to the CBI application, the counsel for the accused has pointed out that proceedings in the case are pending in the High Court and adjourned en-bloc with other cases on account of Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the matter could not be taken up for hearing in the High Court.After hearings on arguments, the CBI Court said a period of more than six months has elapsed and charged have not been framed to date in accordance with law. Keeping in view the directions of the Supreme Court, this court finds it appropriate that a copy of this order be sent to the Registrar General, High Court, for bringing these facts to the kind notice of the HC.The CBI had registered the case on December 9, 2014, against the accused for allegedly causing a loss of Rs 25.80 lakh to the Municipal Corporation. The case was registered against then superintending engineer and officials of the company entrusted the responsibility to maintain the public toilets, under Sections 120-B and 420 IPC for cheating, criminal conspiracy and under Sections 13 (2) read with 13 (1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The CBI filed the charge sheet in the case in October, 2016 .||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/high-court-to-take-call-on-resumption-of-trial-in-civic-body-toilet-scam-case-211746
