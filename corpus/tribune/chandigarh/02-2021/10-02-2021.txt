The court ordered the forwarding of the judgment to the UT Director-General of Police to sensitise police officers to rape case investigation.  While pointing out shortcomings in the probe, the Judge asserted it was a classic case in which police officials violated the mandatory provisions and made a mockery of law.  The Chandigarh police arrested a teacher, Gurdeep Singh, in 2018 after registering an FIR on a complaint by a college student. The woman alleged that the teacher raped her in the hostel where she was staying. She said the teacher was also allotted a quarter on the hostel premises in Sector 28 where he was living with his family.  She alleged that in March 2018 when she was alone in her room, Gurdeep forcefully entered her room and started misbehaving with her. When she resisted, he threatened to kill her and her brother. She alleged that he forcefully developed a physical relation with her without her consent. She alleged that he repeated the act several times but due to fear, she did not report the matter to anyone. She alleged that he also kept her passport with him.  Counsel Jagtar Kureel, appearing for the accused teacher, pointed out many loopholes in the allegations of the prosecution during hearings.  Kureel, while arguing, said no date of any incident of rape was mentioned in the FIR. He said the complainant in the FIR stated that the accused retained her passport and thereafter he raped in March, 2018. A copy of the passport of the complainant was placed on record and as per that record, the passport was issued on April 9, 2018. The complainant had also not conducted her internal medical examination and refused for the same.  Kureel said for each and every question of the doctor during a medical examination, she stated that she did not remember anything and there was a delay in lodging the FIR also.  After hearing arguments, the Court in the order says that no allegation of rape is made in the case history given to the doctor. The fact that the prosecutrix refused for her internal medical examination also makes the prosecution case doubtful. The Court says that not only material discrepancies, contradictions are also found in the different versions of the prosecutrix. Also she tried to improve her version on every next step. The Judge says the police have done a shoddy investigation.  No investigation is done as to whether the prosecutrix was actually staying at the hostel or not at the time of the alleged incidents. No CCTV footage was taken and it appears that the Investigating officer has not bothered about collecting the evidence but investigated the case as told.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/court-slams-cops-for-shoddy-probe-in-rape-case-acquits-accused-teacher-210147

As per an agreement signed between the MC and the parking firms, parking fee will be increased by 20 per cent every year.Some parking lots like in Sector 35-C have broken roads. CCTV cameras have not been installed at the entrance of some of the parking spaces in the city. Besides, haphazard parking is rampant in certain parking lots due to lack of space and attendants.In some parking areas, availability of 10-minute free pick-and-drop facility has not been properly displayed. At some, it is not mentioned at all.With the annual fee hike coming in effect, parking lots have started charging Rs12 and Rs6 for four-wheelers and two-wheelers, respectively. Officials now claim that hourly-parking charges have not been implemented even though earlier they had claimed it has been allowed in a phased manner.“Whether it is annual or hourly parking rates, there was a precondition that annual charges will be increased if smart parking features are implemented in the parking spaces. It is only going to burden the local residents. The MC should keep the rates minimum so that people can afford and are encouraged to park in the designated parking lots,” said Congress councillor Satish Kainth.“In the Sector 17 Bank Square parking lot, there is often no space to park vehicles but people are charged at the entrance and sent inside. There is an inadequate number of attendants inside the lot, who manage and help people park vehicles. This is a problem at some places in Sector 34 and 35 as well,” said Ramesh Kumar, a local resident.A Sector 35-C shopkeeper said, “The roads inside the lot are broken. Is it a smart parking? These roads have not been repaired for a long time now. Also, cars and two-wheelers are often parked at non-designated places.”An MC official said the precondition of smart parking features was only for hourly charges and not for the annual rate hike.Vikas Pandey, contractor, zone 2, said, “Annual rates have to increase. It has nothing to do with smart features as per the agreement. It is required for hourly parking. We will soon introduce the features in all lots.”Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said, “Annual rates have been revised recently as per the contract signed with the firms. If there are any shortcomings, we will get them checked.”An official said conditions like boom barriers were optional while displaying rates on boards and CCTV cameras at the entrance were mandatory.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/parking-rates-up-smart-lots-nowhere-in-sight-210143

10-02-2021||---||Flyover at Tribune Chowk will ruin Chandigarh’s heritage: Experts||Chandigarh, February 9Experts have come forward to oppose the proposed flyover at Tribune Chowk.In a recent letter written to the UT Adviser, a group of senior architects has questioned the legality of the approval given by a sub-committee of the Chandigarh Heritage Conservation Committee (CHCC) to the flyover. They also flayed the UT Administration for ‘bypassing’ the norms to protect the mango trees in the heritage zone on the Purva Marg for the construction of the proposed flyover.A flyover at the Tribune junction had been widely criticised by experts and opposed by a majority of residents of the city, said Shilpa Das, an architect. “The proposed flyover is not approved under the Chandigarh Master Plan-2031 and will destroy the heritage of the city. Flyovers are hostile to non-motorised vehicles, pedestrians and mass rapid transport,” she said, and added that the proposed flyover would increase the traffic problems of the city and hamper implementation of a comprehensive mobility plan.The Rs183-crore project was approved by the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in February 2019 to decongest Tribune Chowk.On a petition filed by the Run Club against the cutting and uprooting of nearly 700 trees for the flyover, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had stayed the construction of the flyover in November 2019 and had asked for a public opinion to find an alternative to the flyover.On the directions of the High Court, a public hearing was held in December 2019 to take suggestions and objections of the public and experts on the project. A majority of residents, professionals and architects opposed the construction of the flyover.However, the UT Administration had decided to go ahead with the construction of the flyover, as all other alternatives to the project were found non-feasible.UT Adviser Manoj Parida said the matter was sub judice and the final decision in this regard would be taken by the High Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/flyover-at-tribune-chowk-will-ruin-chandigarhs-heritage-experts-210146
