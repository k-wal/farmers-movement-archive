Last month, the division challaned a total of 176 passengers for travelling without mask and collected a fine of Rs35,650 from them.The number of passengers boarding trains has still not come up to the point that used to be before the pandemic. People are travelling, but not much. There is fear among them. — GM Singh, DRM, Ambala Division“So far, the Railway Ministry has not issued any guidelines on the functioning of passenger trains. We have not been told anything about the train occupancy. However, we are strictly ensuring public safety by issuing challans to those who are not wearing masks,” said GM Singh, DRM, Ambala Division.“The number of passengers boarding trains has still not come up to the point that used to be before the pandemic. People are travelling, but not that much. There is a certain fear among them,” he said.Way back in 2020, with the announcement of lockdown, all passenger trains were terminated in March, except ‘sharamik trains’ that were run free of cost for migrant labourers. Slowly, by the end of the year, passenger trains were being run in a phased manner. Till June 2021, only 10 pairs of passenger trains were plying over the city railway station. Before the second wave, the station accommodated 16 pairs of trains. However, before Covid, 35 pairs of trains plied over the station.

18-01-2022||---||AAP councillors challenge Chandigarh mayoral poll in High Court||Chandigarh, January 17Anju Katyal of the Aam Aadmi Party and two other councillors today moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court for declaring the election results for Chandigarh Mayor’s post illegal. Directions were also sought to the State Election Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, and other official respondents to hold fresh elections to the Mayor’s post.‘Political atrocities’Katyal, Prem Lata and Ram Chander Yadav submitted that their petition pointed out “various political atrocities openly carried out at the behest of ruling political party bigwigs in Chandigarh”.Katyal, Prem Lata and Ram Chander Yadav submitted that their petition pointed out “various political atrocities openly carried out at the behest of ruling political party bigwigs in Chandigarh”. Going into the background of the matter, the petitioners submitted that AAP secured 14 seats and became the largest party in the elections. But the result did not go down well with the Bharatiya Janata Party, in “power in the Municipal Corporation in the last elections”.The petitioners alleged that the party started indulging in horse-trading, but miserably failed to win any candidate from among the AAP councillors. “After being frustrated, BJP councillors started indulging in other methods to alter the results in their favour, which included putting undue pressure on the authorities of the Chandigarh Administration and trying to bully the election results”.The petition added that one of the petitioners, during the counting process, learnt about one ballot slip torn at the left bottom corner. The “defect” was immediately “objected to” by the petitioners and other AAP councillors before the presiding officer, who happened to be an elected BJP councillor himself. Upon counting of all 28 polled votes, eight votes were kept out of counting by the presiding officer for ‘defects’.“AAP had clearly won with a margin of two votes, 11 votes falling into the kitty of petitioner Katyal of the AAP and nine to the BJP candidate. The entire election process had been videographed and from the videography, it is clearly visible that the prescribed authority had firstly taken into account the valid 28 votes and kept the defective votes aside, which were eight in number and had already been objected to by representatives of AAP as well as the BJP…”The petitioners added that the presiding officer and the prescribed authority-cum-Divisional Commissioner started to play another trick by arbitrarily starting to reconsider the eight ballot votes from the cancelled/rejected lot, which was totally uncalled for. The presiding officer even proceeded to declare the torn/mutilated voter slip cast to the BJP candidate as good for counting.The counting continued and the final tally headed for a tie with 14 votes each, even after counting the defective/torn voter slip cast to the BJP candidate. The presiding officer, himself an elected BJP councillor, started playing otherwise by picking one ballot slip/vote cast in favour of the petitioner to cite a mark on its backside without showing it. Visibly under pressure from BJP quarters, the respondents immediately declared the vote/ballot slip in favour of the petitioner as ‘cancelled’. The BJP candidate was suddenly declared elected with a 14-13 margin to the utmost shock and surprise of petitioner, other members of the House and the public at large. The petition will come up for hearing on January 19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/aap-councillors-challenge-mayoral-poll-in-high-court-362228

The helpline number, which would remain functional round the clock, is 0172-2590000. Though the number of active cases continues to go up, the hospitalisation in the current wave is significantly minimal compared to the previous waves. Of the 2,845 active cases in the district, only 19 were receiving treatment in hospitals. It stands at 0.66 per cent. The number of health teams to keep tabs on the patients in home isolation has also been increased.Dr Mankirat Murara, a spokesperson for the Health Department, said intially the calls would be attended by Covid warriors deployed at the Covid control room. If a patient required clinical consultation, the phone number of the respective in-charges would be given. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/covid-control-room-restarts-in-panchkula-362225
18-01-2022||Panchkula||With 649 fresh cases, Panchkula positivity rate zooms to 79.53%||At a whopping positivity rate of 79.53 per cent, the district recorded 649 fresh Covid cases. The reason for the “exceptionally high” positivity rate is relatively lesser number of samples taken on Sunday, said the Health Department.Only 1,128 samples were collected yesterday, of which 312 were from outside the district, further decreasing the denominator of the district.Dr Mankirat Murara, a spokesperson for the Health Department, said, “We don’t have the accurate denominator due to a significantly lesser number of samples taken on Sunday. And of those who were sampled, 312 were outsiders. It further decreased our denominator. Also, as it was a holiday, only symptomatic people who couldn’t resist testing, came out for sampling and turned positive. We have added yesterday’s untraced to today’s tally, which further contributed to the positivity. All these reasons led to the extremely high positivity. Hence, it doesn’t present a realistic picture.”She said there was no reason for concern as of the 2,891 active cases, only 21 were hospitalised. “It is not even 1 per cent,” she said.With the fresh cases, the tally has reached 37,204.Meanwhile, the death count remained at 384.The number of recovered persons also rose to 33,929. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/with-649-fresh-cases-panchkula-positivity-rate-zooms-to-79-53-362224

18-01-2022||Naina Mishra||Chandigarh: Deaths due to Covid or comorbidities?||Chandigarh, January 17Six Covid patients, who died in hospital, were found suffering from multiple comorbidities such as renal disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease among many other ailments, while four patients were brought dead to the hospital and incidentally tested positive for Covid.Difficult to sayIt is difficult to say whether these patients died primarily due to Covid-19 or their comorbidities were more dominant. — Dr Suman Singh, DHS, UTWhile six patients were above 60 years, two were in their 50s and two below 45 years. Seven of them were fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and one was partially vaccinated. The status of the remaining two patients is not known. A 63-year-old woman, who died at the PGI, was suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia and was undergoing chemotherapy. She was also Covid positive.Another 87-year-old Covid patient died at the GMCH, Sector 32, as she developed urosepsis with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. She had other ailments, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and hypothyroidism.Another 72-year-old woman, who was fully vaccinated, died at the PGI last week. She was a case of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension and hyperthyroidism. One patient died after developing bronchopneumonia and another one who developed respiratory failure was suffering from asthma.Dr Suman Singh, Director, Health Services, UT, said, “It is difficult to say whether these patients died primarily due to Covid-19 or their comorbidities were more dominant. In many patients who died in hospital, Covid symptoms were not diagnosed like pneumonia or oxygen desaturation, as was seen in the second wave. The disease is in a milder form. These patients had multiple comorbidities and were already sick.”Dr Sanjeev Palta from the Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, GMCH, said, “In the second wave, patients either came with pneumonia or developed severe Covid symptoms during the course of admission. This time, pneumonia triggered by Covid is not seen. Going by the milder symptoms of Covid patients, it is suspected that these cases are omicron; however, scientific evidence is needed.”Dr Palta said, “A lot of patients came for other ailments and were shifted to an isolation ward after contracting Covid in the hospital. It is because of the high infectivity of Omicron that there are a lot of incidental findings this time.”Among the patients who died at home and tested positive for Covid posthumously was a known case of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, while another was a case of hypertension. A 68-year-old patient, who was brought dead, tested positive for Covid and was found suffering from heart disease, hypertension and diabetes mellitus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/deaths-due-to-covid-or-comorbidities-362220

The cases will be observed for some more days to ascertain whether Chandigarh has crossed the peak of the third wave. — Dr Suman Singh, DHS, UTThere has been a decline of 52.8 per cent in the daily count from January 14. Testing has also gone down by 44 per cent. The highest positivity rate, 26.7 per cent, was seen on January 15 when the city logged 1,795 cases. The daily positivity rate has been waning too with 21.42 per cent test positivity rate (TPR) recorded today.In the second wave, daily cases had peaked at 895 cases on May 9 with a positivity rate of 22. 7 per cent. The number of tests also dropped from 7,257 on January 14 and to 4,034 on January 17. This is in line with the latest advisory of the ICMR on testing that limits testing asymptomatic patients and low-risk contacts of a positive patients.UT Adviser Dharam Pal said, “While there is a drop in tests, the TPR has also declined, suggesting that the city is showing a declining trend. Had there been a 26 per cent positivity rate or even higher today, it wouldn’t have been a decline. The number speaks for itself but we would like to wait for another three to four days to watch the trend.

18-01-2022||Saurabh MalikChandigarh||Covid: 450 officials test positive in courts of Punjab, Haryana, HC||Justice delivery mechanism in Punjab and Haryana has plunged into crisis. More than 450 officers/officials, including 64 Judges in the subordinate judiciary, have tested positive for Covid in the two states and the high court in the Omicron-driven third wave.Available information suggests over 200 court staffers and 50 judicial officers have tested positive in Punjab. In Haryana, the situation is grim with nearly 70 staffers and 14 judicial officers down with Covid. No less than 115 officers and officials of the Punjab and Haryana High Court have caught the virus to date.The situation could have been worse but for timely action of switching over to restrictive functioning mode by the high court Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and other Judges for itself and the new guidelines for the subordinate judiciary.It is believed both high court and the PGI have the “heaviest footfall” in the city. The situation is even now being closely monitored by a special committee headed by Justice Ajay Tewari, which holds meetings on a weekly basis with the Bar members, among others, before submitting its recommendations to the Chief JusticeAmidst apprehensions of a third wave, the high court ordered virtual hearings a fortnight ago. An order issued by the high court on January 3 made it clear that the decision was taken following a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. The order followed the recommendation of the “special committee” in consultation with the Additional Solicitor-General, Punjab and Haryana Advocates-General, UT senior standing counsel, and public prosecutor. The order specified that hearing of the cases in the high court would be held through virtual mode/videoconferencing from January 5 and the present system of filing, listing, and mentioning of cases would continue as such.The high court had initially shifted to the virtual mode of hearing in March 2020. Limited physical hearing was ordered to be resumed from February 8, 2021, but it had to be suspended as the second wave took in its grip High Court Judges, judicial officers in the subordinate judiciary, advocates, and the staff. The high court was forced to go back to restrictive functioning from April 19, last year.Following a “massive surge” in cases, the functioning had to be restricted further from April 28, last year. But all Benches resumed functioning through the virtual mode from July 28, last year, with the reduction in the severity of the second wave. The high court decided to partially resume physical hearing of cases from September 6, last year. The number of Benches hearing cases physically increased gradually.                                     #corona                                     #coronavirus                                     #court                                     #courtofficers                                     #Covid                                     #Haryana                                     #high                                     #Omicron                                     #Punjab                                     #virtualhearing||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/covid-450-officials-test-positive-in-courts-of-punjab-haryana-hc-362072
