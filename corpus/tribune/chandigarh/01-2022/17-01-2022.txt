17-01-2022||EACH and every person knows the havoc Covid wreaked in India during the second wave. Now is the time for people to shoulder the responsibility of checking its spread. The Administration should step up awareness drives and not impose any further restrictions. Wearing masks and vaccination can be the only way forward.||OPEN HOUSE: What further restrictions should be imposed without impacting people's livelihood?||Sapna Sharda, ChandigarhUT admn was late in imposing restrictionsThe Chandigarh Administration was extremely late in imposing Covid-19 restrictions. But these restrictions aren’t helping in controlling the positivity rate. The citizens are not at all paying heed to following these guidelines and now, to control the situation, lockdown for at least 30 days is the only solution. We all know that lockdown affects a lot of things but, at least, our lives would be safe. Only collective efforts of both citizens and the Administration will help us to overcome this situation. We should never forget the mantra — ‘Precaution is better than cure’.Tanya Sharma,ChandigarhDon’t be careless, follow guidelinesThe UT Administration has imposed the best guidelines for the betterment of citizens. We all are thinking that the Administration is to blame for the increase in Covid cases, but it is not the culprit. We citizens are the actual culprits. This situation has arisen because of our careless attitude. So, from now on, we all should start following the coronavirus guidelines and make our lives safe.Tanvi Sharma, ChandigarhProvide free ration to the poor, needyThe Administration has to take suitable steps to check the spread of the Omicron variant. Even with restrictions, economic activities suffer. What will shopkeepers do when there is no customers? The UT Administration must earmark funds to help poor people who have no work and money to sustain life. People pay taxes and the government must rise to the occasion to save poor population by giving them free ration.Capt Amar Jeet, KhararInstitutions should Follow Covid normsAll government and non-government institutions must work with 50% capacity while strictly following Covid-19 norms. Teaching and learning process must be online. Supervisors should ensure that daily wage earners are vaccinated and they strictly follow all safety norms on duty, so that their livelihood is not affected. It’s high time for every individual that he or she acted sensibly and seriously.Dr Shakha Sharda, ChandigarhAdmn can impose weekend curfewIn addition to the curbs already imposed by the Administration, it has to be ensured that these are implemented in letter and in spirit. The Administration should go in for weekend curfew and ban dine-in services at restaurants and eateries, besides strictly regulating gatherings for various events. It can seek the help of social help groups for enforcing the guidelines. Lastly, the number of Covid care centres should be increased.Dr Dinesh Kumar Verma, PanchkulaDire need for taking stringent stepsIt is true that the situation is grim as the daily cases of Omicron are surging worldwide. In such a situation, there is a dire need for strict measures to contain the spread of the virus. At the same time, the Administration must ensure that the livelihoods of the masses is not affected, especially the poor and the middle class. We all need to understand that only collective efforts by the public as well as the Administration can help in curbing the Omicron spread.Bir Devinder Singh Bed, ChandigarhSimply issuing notices won’t be of much helpThe restrictions imposed by the Administration are sufficient to control the spread of coronavirus, but their implementation is poor. A few people wear masks properly in markets, public places and government institutions. The Administration should form a task force to ensure that everybody wears a mask properly and maintains social distancing in public places. Simply issuing circulars/public notices will not help.KC Rana, ChandigarhPublic is also to blame for the situationTo contain the spread of Covid, one cannot promise people’s daily life will not be affected. People are themselves to blame for the threefold rise in cases. Even after imposing so many restrictions, people are not cautious. They have no fear of the virus. There should be lockdown from 6 pm to 6 am. Also, stepping up police patroling in some areas will help contain the spread.Sushree Priyadarshni, ChandigarhDon’t step out, unless it is unavoidableThe Administration can put restrictions on the movement of people in clusters after ensuring uninterrupted supplies of daily need items on doorstep. Passes with photos of beneficiaries can be issued to all service providers such as maids, servants, drivers, washer men, barbers, guards, street vendors, delivery boys by RWAs or the police. The work-from-home culture should be encouraged. A two or three-hour relaxation could be given to people to move out provided they wear masks.SC Luthra, ChandigarhRealise responsibilityPeople still show carelessness. It is high time they realised their responsibility. The Administration must take action against the violators of Covid norms. With restrictions, some impact on the livelihood of the poor will be there, but the Administration can ensure that the labour class suffers minimum loss.MR Bhateja, NayagaonBizmen should take precautionsMasses had suffered massive losses during the lockdown. Imposing a ban on shops, industrial units, pubs, bars, food joints is not a good idea. Rather, the Administration should fix timings for these establishments. Businessmen should themselves feel the gravity of the situation and take precautions to check the spread of Covid.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliUse drones to keep an eye on violatorsThe Administration should ensure that all people must follow the Covid protocol. Violators should be dealt with strictly. Teams can keep a check on violators with the help of drones. Work from home is a good alternative in these times. Night curfew should be imposed. If the government imposes weekend lockdown, it should take special care of daily wage earners. They should be provided monetary help. Everyone should follow the principle of “Prevention is better than cure “.Adish Sood, AmlohPackages for daily wage earnersThe administration needs to ensure a strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour to save precious lives and livelihood. Work from home should be the norm. During lockdown, the Administration should announce financial relief packages for daily wage earners, rickshaw-pullers and other workers.Anita K Tandon, KhararTime to press the emergency buttonWhile Covid cases are increasing fast, most people still hardly wear masks or use sanitiser. Party halls, malls and banquets are working like normal days. The time has come to press the emergency button to curb the Covid spread in the city. All public gatherings should be curtailed and a special campaign started by the Administration to reward those following the Covid protocol.Avinash Goyal, ChandigarhDispensation needs to be proactiveThere is no denying while the Central and state governments are on their toes to fight the unprecedented upsurge in Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh and elsewhere in the country, more needs to be done to ensure that there is no loss of life owing to the Omicron variant. The dispensation needs to come out of its deep slumber and make sure that the Covid protocol is not compromised. It needs to tighten the noose on those jeopardising the lives of others. Hefty fines need to be imposed violators. The dispensation needs to focus more on enforcing the Covid-appropriate behavior instead of slapping restrictions.Ramesh K Dhiman, ChandigarhBehave responsibly, stay indoorsSteps such as social distancing and wearing masks are the key to curbing the spread of this deadly disease. Unfortunately, most people are still not taking precaution and keep roaming around ignoring restrictions imposed by the Administration. At this critical juncture, the public has to behave responsibly and remain indoors. The authorities should also take the responsibility of providing the public with essential commodities.Sanjay Chopra, MohaliCurtail timings of malls, restaurantsThe Administration should order for the closure of malls and restaurants or curtail their timings. Masks, especially for the staff, should be a must. More Covid wards and hospitals should be established to fight the third wave. Unnecessary movement of vehicles in the city could be curtailed. Home delivery service of necessary as well non-necessary items should be started free of cost or on nominal charges.Aarti Verma, PanchkulaGet tough with violatorsThe existing restrictions are sufficient but enforcement is poor. There is a need to get tough with violators. It is shocking that people know that the restrictions can save their lives but still not follow the guidelines. Simply imposing restrictions will be of no use if there is no strict enforcement. As we are civilised citizens, we should behave responsibly, why wait for govt orders. Chandigarh being the capital of two states, there is a need for an effective coordination among the governments of Punjab, Haryana and UT to control the situation.Vidya Sagar Garg, PanchkulaNeed to step up monitoringIf the situation gets worse, then we may see mini-lockdowns. Despite the grim situation, people continue to throng temples, amusement parks, markets, etc, without adhering to the Covid protocol. There are more innovative ideas such as odd-even movement of vehicles, staggered opening of markets and online e-governance services to prevent people from assembling in large numbers in one place. The police need to step up monitoring so that there is a fear in the mind of violators. Vaccination has to be accelerated. No one desires a lockdown, rather we have to work collectively to fight the pandemic.Dr Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhClose markets on alternate daysThe moment the Administration starts pasting notices at the houses of infected persons, people will seriously comply with the Covid protocol. It’s up to the Administration to go for the weekend lockdown, close the inner markets on alternate days and ban the Apni Mandis.Savita Kuthiala, ChandigarhWarn residents of legal actionTo check a steady rise in Covid cases, the UT Administration should warn residents of legal action for not taking the first or second dose of the vaccine by January-end. Persons who are posing a danger to society by not adhering to the Covid guidelines must be penalised.AK Jindal, PatialaQUESTIONBack-to-back incidents of crime against women, including two murders and a passenger being raped by an auto-driver, have raised questions over the safety of women in the city. What steps should the Administration and the UT police take to make city safer for women?Suggestions in not more than 70 words can be sent to openhouse@tribunemail.com||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/open-house-what-further-restrictions-should-be-imposed-without-impacting-peoples-livelihood-361883

17-01-2022||Sandeep Rana||Year on, town committee lying defunct, vendors bear the brunt in Chandigarh||Chandigarh, January 16Proper implementation of the Street Vendors Act has taken a hit in the city. The Town Vending Committee, which was formed in 2016 for the implementation of the Act, has been lying defunct for nearly one year.The five-year tenure of the committee ended in March last year. Since then, it is yet to be constituted.Due to scant regard to the implementation of the Act, several vending sites, which were approved by the civic body, continue to lie vacant in various parts of the city. Several registered as well as unregistered street vendors continue to operate from non-designated areas, defeating the purpose of the Act.The committee first failed to provide proper sites to vendors. As a result, spaces remained vacant. It is yet to give alternative approved sites to the vendors.Registered vendors, who wanted to raise several issues, especially during the pandemic, feel helpless in the absence of the committee. After the formation of the committee, a fresh survey of registered as well as unregistered vendors is to be held.VN Sharma, one of the members of the now defunct panel, said: “The Town Vending Committee should have been formed by now. Vendors approach us with issues such as payment and vending sites. We cannot take up the issue further as the panel does not exist in Chandigarh.”MC Commissioner Anindita Mitra said: “The committee will be formed by the month-end. We have received applications. However, due to the Chandigarh MC poll, the applications could not be processed further.”The Covid-19 pandemic has turned several registered vendors defaulters as they failed to deposit their monthly licence fee with the civic body. Though they got some fee exemption, it was not enough for some who have poor sale at their sites. A total of 10,917 registered vendors, divided in three categories - essential, non-essential and street vendors - were registered following a survey in 2016, but the pandemic rendered about 30-40 per cent of the vendors defaulters in the city.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/year-on-town-committee-lying-defunct-vendors-bear-the-brunt-361868

The residents demanded that notices on old constructions or need-based changes should not be served to them until the Delhi solution was implemented. They demanded that transfer of properties should not be stopped because of changes made in their flats. Residents demanded that transfers based on GPA, valid before September 2011, should be accepted.Hitesh Puri and Poonam Sharma, both directors of the CHB, assured the residents that they would take up the demands of residents at the next meeting of the committee formed to review need-based changes made by residents, scheduled for January 19, and would try to get maximum relief for them.

17-01-2022||Amarjot Kaur||Zirakpur: Underpass site turns motorists' nightmare||Chandigarh, January 16The construction of a vehicular underpass on the national highway near the Zirakpur-Chandigarh border has become a cause of worry for commuters and those who run businesses in the vicinity.‘Unplanned construction at Zirakpur site’There is a constant traffic jam in the area. They have closed all drains. When it rained recently, the water entered my showroom. The construction is not only haphazard, but unplanned too, it seems. Raju, a shop ownerIron rods protruding out of the road along the boundary of the construction area make it risky for motorists. That’s not all. Sewer water, which flows on to the road and gets accumulated in the potholes, also raises a stench in the area. Regular traffic jams around the construction site too make it difficult for those who run their shops there.“I travel through this road daily. Often, I fear that the iron rods protruding from the road will tear my vehicle’s tyres. Every day, we battle never-ending traffic jams in the area where the underpass is being constructed,” said Shanti, who commutes daily between Chandigarh and Zirakpur for her job.Raju, who owns a shop along the road where the underpass is being constructed, is harrowed for the past four months now. “There is a constant traffic jam in the area. They have closed all drains. When it rained recently, the water entered my showroom. The construction is not only haphazard, but unplanned too, it seems. The sewage water, which accumulated on the road, is raising stink in the entire area. No customer wants to come here and shop in this situation. We are bleeding financially,” he said.The underpass is reportedly being built on the Zirakpur side in an area of 450m at a cost of around Rs10 crore to facilitate the movement of heavy vehicles coming from the godown area side. The work is being carried out by a Jalandhar-based company, Associated Engineers, under the supervision of the National Highway Division, Public Works Department (PWD), Punjab.Yuvraj Bindra Singh, Executive Engineer, National Highway Division, Public Works Department, Punjab, said: “I am not aware of all these problems, but now that they have been brought up, we will fix these immediately. As for traffic, we have made the diversions thoughtfully. It is possible that iron roads are protruding out of the drains that we removed.”                                     #Chandigarhtraffic                                     #Zirakpur                                     #Zirakpurtraffic||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/underpass-site-turns-motorists-nightmare-361865

17-01-2022||Amarjot Kaur||Chandigarh: Murdered woman suspected to be pregnant, says doctor||Chandigarh, January 16While the post-mortem report and findings from the dump provided by the cyber cell of the GRP, Ambala Division, hold the key to solving the murder mystery of the woman whose body was found near the Chandigarh railway station yesterday, there is a possibility of “suspected pregnancy” and her daughter suspects she was killed by an acquaintance.Marks found on neckApart from multiple stab wounds on the woman’s body, we have also found marks on her neck, which hint at strangulation. We are not yet ruling out the possibility of sexual assault, but there is a suspected pregnancy. A doctorA group of 15 family members of the victim were anxiously seen waiting for the post-mortem report at the mortuary of the Civil Hospital, Sector 6, Panchkula, today. GRP officials walked in and out of the mortuary. It was 4 pm and the doctors continued to examine the body.The woman’s daughter, however, seemed a little sceptical. She was joined by her brother as she began to talk about her mother’s death.“I know a man who used to meet her often. He wanted her to leave the job of the cleaner at the Mauli Jagran police station and would often trouble her if she didn’t bow to his whims. We called him uncle and he once had a tiff with my father too, who is physically challenged. I have a feeling that he has something to do with her death,” said the victim’s daughter.Investigating officer Vilayati Saini, SHO, GRP, Chandigarh railway station, said, “We called one of the persons known to the woman for questioning. The family suspects that the woman was killed by that man. Apart from that, the cyber cell of the GRP, Ambala Division, has been contacted. I have got the dump from where we can trace the location of mobile phones at the crime scene. We will hopefully catch the culprit soon.”While the post-mortem report is expected to be out tomorrow, one of the doctors conducting her autopsy said there was a possibility that the victim was pregnant.                                     #Chandigarhcrime                                     #Chandigarhmurder||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/murdered-woman-suspected-to-be-pregnant-doctor-361861

Around 1,200 health workers from the PGI have tested positive in the third wave. Dr Suman Singh, Director, Health Services, said, “This is one of the factors why healthcare workers have not turned up for the booster dose as many contracted the infection recently. Other healthcare workers are on reliever duties.”The booster dose for senior citizens, healthcare workers and frontline workers was started on January 10. As per the UT estimate, around 15,600 beneficiaries would require the booster shot as they are above 60 years and have comorbidities. Besides, there are 26,237 HCWs and 22,438 FLWs in Chandigarh.On the contrary, more elderly people have been inoculated with the booster dose in comparison to the other category. Till now, 15 per cent of the elderly (2,358) have received the third dose of the vaccine, while only 7.5 per cent of health workers (1,990) and 6 per cent frontline workers (1,525) have turned up for the booster dose.The Director, GMCH, Sector 32, Dr Jasbinder Kaur, said, “The response to the vaccine is more among children between 15 and 18 years of age. Although HCWs are taking the booster shot, the number is not very high. The pace will gradually pick up.”To avail of the booster dose, there should be a gap of nine months from the second dose of the vaccine. UT Health Secretary Yashpal Garg said, “The target population of 60 plus has been calculated with an assumption that only 20 per cent are co-morbid. However, the target population of HCWs and FLWs has been taken in full without any discounting factor. Hence for a better comparison of the booster dose coverage of HCWs and FLWs with the 60 plus, we should take only 20 per cent of the 60 plus coverage. It means that 15 per cent coverage of the 60 plus target population is actually 3 per cent of the total population of 60 plus. Actually, the coverage of HCWs and FLWs is better than the 60 plus in terms of the total population.”57% teens jabbedChandigarh has jabbed 41,203 children in the age group of 15 to 18 with the first dose of Covaxin, which translates into 57.23 per cent turnout for the shot. The Administration aims at inoculating all children by the end of this month. There is a target of 72,000 children in this age groupMeanwhile, 98 per cent of the target population has been vaccinated with the two doses of Covishield in the city. The UT has administered over 70,000 doses in the week ending January 14 and over one lakh doses in the week prior to that.Factor behind slow paceOne of the factors behind the slow response to the booster dose among HCWs is that many have turned positive recently and will not be eligible for the booster shot for the next three to six months.                                     #Chandigarh                                     #Covid19                                     #Covidbooster||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/booster-shot-coverage-tardy-361856

Dr Suman Singh, Director, Health Services, said, “All bodies are being tested for Covid-19 whenever there is a surge. The death in these cases was not primarily due to Covid. Some had co-morbidities and some possibly died a natural death, and Covid was an incidental finding in these patients.”24% decrease in fresh cases, 1,358 found infected in cityChandigarh recorded 1,358 cases on Sunday, a 24 per cent decrease from the 1,795 cases seen a day earlier.The test positivity rate has also declined to 22.49 per cent, while it was 26.71 per cent on the previous day.The city also reported the death of a 38-year-old man from Sector 35, who was brought dead to GMSH-16. He was found Covid positive posthumously and was fully vaccinated. Dr Suman said, “There has been a decline in cases due to a fall in testing on that particular day. It is too early to predict that Chandigarh has crossed the peak. The verdict will be out in a week.”2 deaths, 718 fresh cases in PanchkulaPanchkula: The district reported 718 new cases on Sunday and saw 736 recoveries.
