The event is being played at the renovated Serapong course of Sentosa Golf Club.Around 12 Indian golfers - Shiv Kapur, SSP Chawrasia, Rashid Khan, Viraj Madappa, Khalin Joshi, S Chikkarangappa, Aman Raj, Veer Ahlawat, Jyoti Randhawa, Jeev, Kochhar, and Chadha - are participating in this event. Two of them, Randhawa (2000) and Milkha (2006), have won the title in the past, but are now approaching the seniors (50 years and over) category.Non-availability of caddiesIn his career, spanning over 10 years now, Kochhar has faced a first-of-his-kind problem - non-availability of caddies - before reaching for this prestigious event. Not having any other option, Kochhar has to take his local caddie Mahesh for the event, which turned out to be a lifetime experience for him. “It has happened for the first time. Having no other option, I decided to travel with my childhood and local caddied Mahesh. It’s turning out to be a good experience with never-ending talks on golf, improvement of shots and assessment of performance. It will be an experience worth living for him (Mahesh) also as he will learn several things. I hope exchange of words help me spot my mistakes and win a podium position in this event,” said Kochhar.‘Being the youngest has its own advantages’Kochhar is the youngest participant not only among Chandigarh golfers but also in the entire Indian contingent playing in this championship.“There’s no such pressure. Being the youngest has its own advantages and I am sure of getting support from the likes of Milkha, Kapur and all others. The tournament has an added incentive which makes four spots on offer for the 150th Open at St Andrews this year,” said Kochhar.Kochhar currently leads the 2020-21 PGTI order of merit with two wins and four other top 10s in the season. In the past, his six top 10s on the PGTI (2019) helped him take fourth place on the PGTI order of merit. Last held in 2020, the SMBC Singapore Open was won by American Matt Kuchar with a score of 18-under-par for the week. Kuchar, however, is not defending his title this tournament.Golfers taking part in the eventAround 12 Indian golfers - Shiv Kapur, SSP Chawrasia, Rashid Khan, Viraj Madappa, Khalin Joshi, S Chikkarangappa, Aman Raj, Veer Ahlawat, Jyoti Randhawa, Jeev, Kochhar, and Chadha - are participating in this event.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/smbc-singapore-open-chandigarh-lad-kochhar-youngest-indian-contender-363112

Gym administrators take good care of health and adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour in all respects”.They said due to such administrative decisions, the gym and fitness industry had been completely destroyed and the government was doing nothing to help it. It had now become difficult for gym and fitness centre owners to run their households and they had no choice but to take to the streets against the administration and the government.MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu also reached the spot and spoke to the Deputy Commissioner over phone to resolve the issue.

21-01-2022||---||Chandigarh raises objections to plea challenging mayoral poll||Chandigarh, January 20The Punjab and Haryana High Court today fixed February 4 for hearing a petition by Anju Katyal of the Aam Aadmi Party and two other councillors. They had moved the Court for declaring the election results for the Chandigarh Mayor’s post illegal. Directions were also sought to hold fresh elections to the Mayor’s post.As the case came up for preliminary hearing before the Bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma, UT senior standing counsel Anil Mehta took technical objections and requested for the dismissal of the petition.Mehta submitted that the petitioners had not challenged the declaration of the results. They had, rather, placed on record a newspaper cutting and challenged the same. Mehta added that the petitioners had also challenged the appointment of the Senior Deputy Mayor and the Deputy Mayor, but had not made them a party to the litigation.Mehta also told the Bench that the petitioners had raised certain objections on January 8. The next day, an order was passed dismissing their objections. But the same was not challenged by the petitioners. After hearing the objections and rival submissions, the Bench adjourned the hearing to February 4, when the petition with amendments may be placed before the Bench.Katyal, Prem Lata and Ram Chander Yadav had submitted that their petition pointed out “various political atrocities openly carried out at the behest of ruling political party bigwigs in Chandigarh”. The petitioners submitted that AAP secured 14 seats and became the largest party in the elections. But the results did not go well with the BJP, in “power in the Municipal Corporation for the last elections”.Upon counting of all 28 polled votes, eight votes were kept out for ‘defects’. “AAP clearly won with a margin of two votes, 11 votes falling into the kitty of petitioner - Katyal of the AAP and nine to the BJP candidate,” the petitioners added.But the presiding officer and the prescribed authority-cum-Divisional Commissioner arbitrarily started to reconsider the eight ballot votes from the cancelled/rejected lot and proceeded to declare a torn/mutilated voter slip cast to a BJP candidate as good for counting.The petitioners added the final tally headed for a tie with 14 votes each, even after counting the defective/torn voter slip cast. The presiding officer, himself an elected BJP councillor, started playing otherwise by picking one ballot slip/vote cast in the petitioner’s favour to cite a mark on its backside without showing it. The respondents immediately declared the vote/ballot slip in the petitioner’s favour as ‘cancelled’. The BJP candidate was suddenly declared elected with 14-13 margin to utmost shock and surprise of the petitioner, other members of the House and the public at large, it was added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-raises-objections-to-plea-challenging-mayoral-poll-363092

21-01-2022||Ambala||One killed, another hurt in firing at Ambala Cantt||One person was killed while another suffered bullet injuries in a firing incident that took place near DAV Public School in Ambala Cantonment this evening. The entire incident was captured in a CCTV camera.The deceased has been identified as Mohit Rana, a resident of Punjab, and the injured as Vishal, a resident of Ambala Cantonment. It is learnt that Mohit had been associated with the Bhupi Rana gang while Vishal is facing an extortion case. Mohit and Vishal were travelling in a black car bearing a Punjab registration number when assailants, who were following them in a white car bearing a Delhi registration number, intercepted them on the Ambala-Saha road around 5 pm. Two men in the white car fired shots at the victims before fleeing towards Saha. After the incident, the victims were rushed to the Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantonment, where Mohit was declared dead and Vishal was referred to the PGI in Chandigarh.In a Facebook post, Goldy Brar, who is associated with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, later claimed the responsibility of the incident. Goldy mentioned that Kala Rana and he were behind the murderous attack. Mohit used to support their rival group and was witness in a case against them, Goldy claimed, while warning other opponents to wait for a similar fate. While Goldy is reportedly in Canada, Kala Rana is in Thailand.Mohit was a witness in the Mohammad Mustaq murder case of 2014. SP Jashandeep Singh Randhawa said, “There are inputs that Mohit had taken Rs12.50 lakh for not giving testimony in the murder case. Still, the accused (Monu Rana and other accomplice) were convicted in the case following which the other party sought its money back leading to a monetary dispute between them. There could be some other reason as well, because there were murder cases against Mohit. We are verifying the facts.”“The matter is being investigated from all the angles. Five teams have been constituted to nab the suspects,” he added.On a complaint of Subhash Rana, Mohit Rana’s brother, a case has been registered against unidentified persons under Section 302 and 34 of the IPC and Section 25 and 27 of the Arms Act at the Mahesh Nagar police station. —                                     #Ambala                                     #firing||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/one-killed-another-hurt-in-firing-at-ambala-cantt-363057

21-01-2022||Naina Mishra||Off ICMR protocol, Chandigarh Health Department gave antibiotic||Chandigarh, January 20The UT Health Department continued to give azithromycin, an antibiotic drug, to Covid patients in home isolation despite the drug being put off the clinical treatment protocol by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) last year.In March 2020, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had suggested using azithromycin along with hydroxychloroquine as an off label.The ICMR clinical management protocols of May and December 2021 do not find a mention of antibiotics to be prescribed to Covid patients as the protocols were revised time and again as more evidence gathered. A senior PGI doctor said, “Azithromycin is an antibiotic that means it will work against bacterial infections. However, its use in Covid came because of some experimental data that it works in Covid too. So far, this drug has not been found to be of any use in Covid.”A home isolation kit accessed by Chandigarh Tribune reveals a list of medicines, which includes a five-day course of azithromycin, 10 capsules of zinc tablets, 20 chewable tablets of vitamin C and giloy tablets among other drugs. This home isolation kit list pertains to January 6 whereas the ICMR excluded multivitamins from the clinical treatment protocol on January 17. However, it is worth mentioning that azithromycin has been off the treatment protocol since last year itself.Asked, Dr Suman Singh, Director, Health Services, said, “We only provide home isolation kits to patients who require it through Red Cross Society. The list of medicines has now been updated and azithromycin has been omitted from it.”The current clinical guidelines prescribe antipyretic (fever suppressants), antitussives (cough suppressants) and hydration among mild patients with symptoms. The guidelines require mild patients to monitor their temperature and oxygen saturation and, if fever persists or Spo2 falls below 93 per cent, they should seek medical help.What’s deleted from clinical treatment?Ivermectin | Multivitamin | HCQWhat’s allowed for mild casesSeek immediate medical attention if                                     #Azithromycin                                     #ICMR||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/off-icmr-protocol-chandigarh-health-department-gave-antibiotic-363050

The agency will have to submit its report within 15 days.UT Adviser Dharam Pal had recently directed the Deputy Commissioner (DC) and the UT Chief Engineer to prepare a report on an alternative shorter route to the airport from Chandigarh.Earlier, the road distance from Tribune Chowk to the airport was 2.71 km, but people have to now cover an extra distance of 14.5 km to reach the airport through Mohali. People have been demanding an alternative route, which will make it easier and shorter for residents of Chandigarh and Haryana to reach the airport. For a shorter route to the airport from Chandigarh, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs had recently asked the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to take up the issue on a priority basis with the stakeholders.The committee mentioned that the existing route from Tribune Chowk to the airport was causing unnecessary inconvenience to residents of Chandigarh as they had to cover more distance and spend more time to reach the airport.The committee further recommended that the MHA may coordinate with the Government of Punjab for making a provision of approximately 4.7-km road through Jagatpura village for the airport, which will reduce the distance to the airport by 10 km and will save time of people travelling to airport from Chandigarh.Agency will have to submit report in 15 daysAn official of the UT Engineering Department said the consultant would conduct a survey of the area and carry out work on an alternative route to the airport from the Sector 48 side to reduce the distance between the airport and the city.
