He steered me to where I am right now and it’s all because of him,” said Raj, while talking to The Tribune from the World Cup venue.This is not for the first time that Raj proved his mettle in this tournament.

Sukhwinder would spend hours and hours of hard work on Raj do see his ward wearing Indian jersey.“My father knew about my cricket’s gives and takes. I started with off-spin, but he asked me to focus on my batting. Gradually, I developed my interest and it helped me in improvising in bowling too,” Raj had said in one of his previous interviews.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/ut-lad-dedicates-innings-to-father-cum-coach-364124

It shows signs of the city moving towards a declining trend in fresh coronavirus infections.There is a 62 per cent dip in daily Covid-19 cases from January 19 when Chandigarh saw 1,502 cases. It was on January 8 when the city last reported 541 cases.However, experts caution that it is not the right time to declare that Chandigarh is past the peak of the highly infectious third wave.Will analyse casesWe saw daily cases declining and the number rising again twice so far. So, we would like to analyse the cases for a few days to ascertain whether the peak is over. — Dr Suman Singh, Director, Health ServicesHospital occupancy stable in ChandigarhAt present, the occupancy of hospitals has stabilised in the city and no rise has been seen over the past week. Around 290 beds are occupied in city government hospitals, while this figure was 280 a week earlier. This indicates that there has not been any significant rise in hospital admissions.“We saw daily cases declining and the number rising again twice so far. So, we would like to analyse the number of cases for a few more days to ascertain whether the peak is over,” said Dr Suman Singh, Director, Health Services.There has also been a decline in testing by 32 per cent from Sunday. The number of samples tested today was 3,920, while 5,768 samples were tested a day earlier. A positivity rate of 14.49 per cent was recorded today, which is marginally higher than yesterday’s 14.01 per cent.Dr PVM Lakshmi, professor, Community Medicine and School of Public Health, PGI, said: “Generally, infection in the community starts dipping a week after a decline in infection among healthcare workers. The infection rate among health workers has already started declining at the PGI.”She said: “For Chandigarh, we will still have to wait for the exact situation of peak as the cases reported on Monday are a reflection of tests on Sunday and generally people do not come for tests on weekend. If the cases continue to decline over a week, along with the positivity rate, it is only then we can say that the wave is on a downhill trend. So far, we can say that there is a slightly declining graph of Covid in the UT.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/breather-for-city-as-new-cases-see-a-dip-364122

25-01-2022||Sandeep Rana||Ruckus mars first Chandigarh MC House meeting||Chandigarh, January 24Amid a ruckus and protests by Congress and AAP councillors, the first House meeting of the Municipal Corporation approved solid waste management-related agenda items.While the high drama by the councillors went on for nearly three hours, the agenda items were cleared in just five minutes.Waste mgmt Agenda items approvedRight from the start of the meeting, the Congress and AAP councillors created a ruckus against an agenda of approving the minutes of the last House meeting in which the mayoral elections were held. The Opposition councillors said they did not recognise BJP’s Sarabjit Kaur as the Mayor.They were also demanding a vote on the agenda. Kaur told them that a case in this regard was pending in the Punjab and Haryana High Court and they should maintain the decorum of the House. However, the protest and shouts continued.Raising slogans such as “Tanashahi, dhakeshahi nahin chalegi”, they sat in the well of the House and criticised the BJP. They alleged that the BJP and officials were hand in glove. BJP councillors countered them with “Bharat mata ki jai” slogans and asked them to let the “development agenda to be passed.”After the councillors did not let the House function to discuss the agenda items, Senior Deputy Mayor Dalip Sharma, who was in the Mayor’s chair for over an hour in the absence of the Mayor, called marshals to remove them.Some AAP and Congress councilors had to be physically removed from the House. It took much time to remove them as there were only a few marshals. After some of them were removed, they later sat on their seats following which the House could work. It was then decided that the agenda of the mayoral poll would be sent for legal opinion. The agenda of forming a few panels was deferred.The BJP had won by a single vote in the January 8 poll after an AAP vote was declared invalid by the presiding officer. AAP challenged the election in the court.Earlier, Congress councillors got angry and caused a logjam after the Mayor told a Congress councillor that they should not speak on the Mayor election agenda as the Congress had abstained from the mayoral poll.No voting by AAP, Cong councillorsAAP and Congress councillors did not vote in the agenda items regarding repair of the existing solid waste processing plant and the bio-mining project at the Dadu Majra dumping ground.When the Secretary of the House, Rajiv Prasad, asked councillors supporting the agenda items to raise their hands, only BJP councillors raised their hands. He later asked councillors opposing the agenda items to raise their hands. However, AAP and Congress councillors did not raise their hands in opposition. Thereafter, the agenda items were okayed without any discussion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/ruckus-mars-first-mc-house-meeting-364100
