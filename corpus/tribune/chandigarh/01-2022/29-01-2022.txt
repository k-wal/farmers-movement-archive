They should judge a candidate from his or her report card of past work and capabilities to perform in future as per their expectations, said sitting MLA and Congress candidate from Mohali Balbir Singh Sidhu while addressing an election meeting at Lakhnaur village today.Sidhu said if the AAP candidate could not keep happy people of his own sector, then what you could expect from him for your area. What destruction Akalis caused in the past 10 years was in front of you all and what development the Congress did in the past five years was for everyone to see. Now, it’s your turn to support such a party which works for general welfare by rejecting those who used political platforms for their vested interests, he added.Addressing a meeting with members of the Muslim community at Kumbra village, Sidhu said the demands of people from all communities in Mohali had been met on a priority basis.Himachal Congress MLA Rajinder Rana said if Mohali was at the international level now, it was due to the efforts of the Congress and Balbir Singh Sidhu. Going by the present sentiments of the public towards the Congress in Punjab, he could say that the Congress candidate would have the highest victory margin in Mohali in all 117 seats of the state.Meanwhile, Mayor Jeeti Sidhu also held election meetings in Phase 1 in favour of Sidhu.

The issue of illegal parking along the single-route auto lane for picking and dropping of passengers was highlighted along with the problem of parking of taxis on the exit route of the station.Taking a stock of the law and order situation, the GRP swung into action and requested for more staff to be deployed at the station to manage the traffic pangs. “We didn’t have much staff and had already requested for more people to be deployed at the station to manage the traffic problem here. On Thursday, four people, an ASI and three subordinates, were sent to the city station from Ambala. They will manage the traffic here from now on,” said Saini.He said any person who parked in the no-parking zone to wait for passengers would be fined. “Today, the traffic personnel warned people, but from tomorrow, they will be issued challans. We will not let anyone park their vehicles along the pick-and-drop routes, where the traffic should be moving always, be it an auto driver, taxi driver or a cycle rider,” he said.GRP asks STA for revised rate listThe GRP has written to the UT State Transport Authority for revising the rate list of auto fares in the city to run the auto prepaid booth. Earlier, it was reported in these columns that the auto prepaid booth at the city station, which is manned by the GRP, had not been running since the lockdown. One of the major concerns, for both auto drivers and the GRP, was the unrevised rate list of auto fares at the booth. It was found that the STA had not revised the auto fare since 2013. “Two days ago, we had sent a letter to the STA for fixing the auto fare, which will be displayed at the prepaid booth. Once we get the rate list, we will start the prepaid booth too,” said Saini.                                     #Chandigarhrailwaystation||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/grp-personnel-to-address-traffic-pangs-at-chandigarh-railway-station-365133

Action against the violators such as fine and legal action under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, had been initiated, he said.“Use of single-use plastic has immensely polluted our environment with dire consequences,” he said, adding that with the intention of combating the problem of plastic pollution, the Department of Environment, UT, had imposed a complete ban on identified single-use plastic/thermocol items vide a notification, dated September 27, 2019.However, it had been observed that the implementation of the ban had dwindled with the passage of time and the use of single-use plastic carry bags was still in vogue. The major cause of the problem was the use and sale of plastic carry bags by hawkers and vendors in apni mandis in Chandigarh, he said.To ensure the effective implementation of the ban, the CPCC was regularly conducting awareness programmes on various platforms for sensitising the public and encouraging it to abstain from using single-use plastic items, especially plastic carry bags. People need be motivated to at least carry a cloth or jute bag while making purchases. Also, the officials concerned will be conducting raids and imposing a fine so that the use of single-use plastic items could be prevented and the use of other eco-friendly items promoted, he said. —                                     #CPCC                                     #Environment                                     #Pollution||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-350-kg-plastic-carry-bags-seized-in-raid-at-mandi-365126

Besides a designated post for GRP and RPF staff, the station also lacks basic amenities such as a functional lift and a proper roof shed in the platform area.At the station, one of the passengers, Pradeep Thakur, said, “It had been raining here for the past so many days. To board a train, one has to wait at the platform and the roof was leaking. The benches are few and far between. It’s quite inconvenient to stand and wait for the train. There is not a single eatery open here. The tuck shop on the platform is locked.”The lifts too are not functional. The only way one can reach the platform is through a staircase, which makes it difficult for the elderly and the differently abled to access the platform.A budget of Rs1.56 crore was reportedly sanctioned for upgrading the Mohali railway station on May 14, 2019, by the then general manager of the Northern Railway, TP Singh. Under this grant, the station was to get a makeover, with proper parking, lifts, escalators, canteen, waiting room and benches for train passengers. For now, even the car parking lot at the station is not manned by any contractor. One of the officials at the station said, “The parking here is free of cost. The previous contractor ran away at the time trains were suspended during the lockdown and never returned. Now, a new tender will soon be floated.”Ambala Division DRM GM Singh said, “I will get these issues resolved in the next two days. Parking is an issue as no contractor turns up due to lack of volume. The grant was sanctioned a long time ago but installation of lifts got delayed due to Covid.”                                     #Mohali||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/mohali-railway-station-lacks-basic-amenities-365120

The surveys conducted for mega herbivores and some bird species of the sanctuary confirmed the presence of 16 species, which includes 13 mammalian species (both carnivores and herbivores). The major bird species of conservation importance included the Indian peafowl and the red junglefowl.

People face many hardships as roads and lanes are in a pathetic condition and the area lacks civic amenities, especially in villages.                                     #DeraBassi                                     #Environment                                     #NKSharma                                     #Pollution||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/effluents-release-perennial-problem-365059

29-01-2022||Amit Bathla||Cremation of  Covid victims: Probe indicts 6 of Panchkula MC for embezzlement||Panchkula, January 28A preliminary inquiry conducted by Joint Commissioner Vinesh Kumar into allegations of misappropriation of funds for cremation of persons who died of Covid has put forth shocking revelations, including a finding that safai karamcharis and some MC officials involved in the cremations claimed money for conducting the funeral of over 900 victims though only 377 were reported as Covid deaths back then.The Urban Local Bodies Department, Haryana, had announced that Rs2,000 would be paid to every safai karamchari of the five-member team for cremation of each Covid victim.According to the inquiry findings, 14 safai karamcharis were made a payment of Rs31.34 lakh on September 29 last year for cremations. According to the report, Rs20.72 lakh of the total amount was transferred inappropriately, adding that then Chief Sanitary Inspector Madan Lal was also transferred money despite his role being confined to supervision of cremations as in-charge. Pending payments, for which claims were made, were put on hold after an inquiry was marked into the matter.Those found guilty in the inquiry included assistant sanitary inspectors Ajay Sood and Satbir, safai karamcharis Sonu, Parvesh Kumar and Gulab, besides Madan Lal, the report mentioned. In the report, the Joint Commissioner also stated that pujaris at the cremation ground informed that only three-four safai karamcharis used to cremate bodies of Covid patients regularly. “On some occasions, just a single person conducted the funeral,” stated the report.The report also raised a question on the constitution of a 10-member committee of safai karamcharis for cremation of bodies that put a financial burden on the state exchequer. “If only 10 people were assigned for cremations, how is it possible that funds were diverted into accounts of 14 people? How can the accounts department verify these bills?”The report further stated, “When the data on cremations was verified from the MC, it was found that some deaths termed to have occurred due to Covid were actually natural deaths.”On the basis of prima facie evidence, the Joint Commissioner suggested legal action be taken against the accused and funds recovered from them.Speaker orders recovery, legal actionHaryana Speaker and local MLA Gian Chand Gupta said he had ordered the MC Commissioner to ensure recovery of funds inappropriately transferred into accounts of safai karamcharis and officials and take legal action.The complainant, Dev Raj of the Panchkula Vikas Manch, said the matter had come to his knowledge after some safai karamcharis who conducted the last rites of Covid victims approached him and claimed that they didn’t get paid for the service. He then approached the MC Commissioner, who further asked the Joint Commissioner to conduct a probe into the matter. A complaint was also made to the Urban Local Bodies Department.Cremation of Covid victimsAgainst 377 deaths then, funds claimed for over 900 bodiesAccused deny chargesHowever, all accused have denied charges, saying they just followed government orders and committed no fraud.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/cremation-of-covid-victims-probe-indicts-6-of-panchkula-mc-for-embezzlement-365107
29-01-2022||Dushyant Singh Pundir||Chandigarh Housing Board finds no takers for leasehold properties||Chandigarh, January 28The Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) has failed to find buyers for its residential as well as commercial properties put up for auction on a leasehold basis.The CHB had invited e-bids for the sale of its 13 built-up residential units on a freehold basis, 24 built-up residential units on a leasehold basis and 108 built-up commercial units on a leasehold basis.The bids were opened today as per the schedule, and the CHB could sell only three residential units on a freehold basis and there were no takers for the residential and commercial units on a leasehold basis.The three freehold residential units fetched Rs1,83,93,552 against the total reserve price of Rs1,78,11,578.Gaurav Singh, a resident of Sector 45, said the CHB would not get a good response to its properties on a leasehold basis unless these were converted into freehold units. He said the prices of the units were comparatively high and the board should bring the rates within the reach of the prospective buyers. In its earlier auctions also, the CHB had failed to elicit a positive response to its properties on a leasehold basis.In an e-auction held on December 27 last year, the CHB could sell only five of the 113 commercial units on a leasehold basis to the highest bidders. Similarly, only three of the 27 residential units were sold on a leasehold basis. The CHB also received a lukewarm response to its residential properties on a freehold basis as it could sell six of the 19 units put up at the e-auction. In an e-auction held on September 1 last year, the CHB could sell only two of the 149 commercial units on a leasehold basis, two of the 33 residential units on a leasehold basis and eight of the 34 residential units on a freehold basis.On August 10 last year, the CHB had received five e-bids against 151 commercial units on a leasehold basis and could sell only three units to the highest bidders. Similarly, 15 e-bids were received against 38 residential units and only five units could be sold to the highest bidders. The CHB is selling those properties on a leasehold basis that are constructed on land allotted by the UT Administration on lease. Similarly, residential properties constructed on land allotted on a freehold basis are being sold on a freehold basis.In case of leasehold property, the allottee is required to pay an annual ground rent at the rate of 2.5 per cent of the consideration amount for 33 years, followed by 3.75 per cent for the next 33 years and 5 per cent for the subsequent 33 years.The conversion of a leasehold property into freehold is a costly affair. The conversion charges for residential properties may range from 12 per cent to 15 per cent of the consideration amount. However, the conversion is not permitted in the case of commercial properties. The UT had recently written to the Cente for approval to allow conversion of leasehold properties to freehold in the case of commercial and industrial plots.e-auction gets poor response                                     #CHB||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chb-finds-no-takers-for-leasehold-properties-365103
