This has invited criticism from all sections of society,” Chawla added.“This time, though a new corporation has been constituted with the election of 35 councillors in Chandigarh, nine councillors have not been nominated as per the Act till date,” said Chawla. “Prior to year 2016, councillors were nominated by your office strictly as per provisions of the Act.

University officials claimed that shopkeepers protesting at Gate No. 2 were called to for the online meeting. However, no one turned up as they demanded an offline interaction, officials added.Fourteen senior PU functionaries attended the meeting. After paying tributes to Neeraj, owner of Raj Eatery shop in vicinity of the Student Centre, who committed suicide, the committee discussed that the university had to function for academics and students.“Leasing of shops in the market is as per terms of a contract signed with shopkeepers. No such agitation is expected from them. The university cannot be pressurised to enter into any illegal negotiation. This can’t be made an emotional issue,” said a panel member.“The PU has allowed 10 per cent rebate in rent for the corona period,” the member added. “Representatives of shopkeepers demanded that there should be no double electricity meter security. Hiked rent should not be charged from legal heirs of deceased shopkeepers. Traders should be exempted from property tax,” the member claimed.“The university has never increased rent of any shop three to four times. The protesting shopkeepers are from the main market, which never closed during the pandemic. Only Student Centre food joints were closed. Shopkeepers of the Students Centre area were never asked to pay rent for the period when their eateries were closed. These shops were allowed to open only on representations of students,” members said.Protest march in memory of traderMeanwhile, shopkeepers association members held a protest march in memory of Neeraj. Earlier, Manoj Lubana, president, Chandigarh Youth Congress, wrote to the Chandigarh SSP for an independent inquiry into shopkeeper’s death. “There’s a limit to which a person can sustain pressure. Shops in university are closed frequently. Recently, the PU issued a notice to close shops till January 16. An independent inquiry should be initiated into this matter and punish the culprit,” said Lubana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/pu-panel-holds-online-meeting-to-resolve-shopkeepers-issues-361686

16-01-2022||Amarjot Kaur||No check on auto-rickshaws at Chandigarh railway station, people prefer app-based taxis||Chandigarh, January 15In the absence of regular checks on documents related with vehicles and identities of auto drivers at the Chandigarh railway station, a sense of insecurity envelops rail passengers who have now started to opt for trackable commuting via travel apps.On a regular day, hundreds of autos do the rounds of the city railway station hoping to get a potential customer. The single-lane auto route is painted with the green and yellow of the autos parked along the lane. It gets busier when the train drops off passengers at the station; the auto drivers shout from a distance: “Auto chahiye, madam? sir? (Do you need an auto, madam/sir?)”, “Kaha jaogay? (Where can I drop you?)”. For those who fancy the idea of “penny saved is a penny earned”, an auto ride comes as a cheaper option. But safety comes with a price tag.Deepika Kaur, an HR executive in a Delhi-based company, often shuttles between Delhi and Chandigarh. “My parents stay in Mohali, so I come and visit them every week. I don’t drive in Delhi, so a train journey is a viable option for me. However, I am a little scared to take autos. Firstly, I don’t know if the auto driver is vaccinated, given the pandemic.Then, I don’t know if he has all his papers in place. It’s not safe. So, I book an Ola or Uber cab instead,” she says.But things aren’t as rosy for Neelam Devi, who travels to Sitapur in UP every year. She works as a domestic help in Chandigarh and often takes autos when she has to travel in the city and doesn’t have her bicycle. “When I go to my village, I usually take an auto and reach the station. Then I come back on the auto. It’s cheap, I don’t have the money to book a cab and I can’t afford it either. I don’t feel very unsafe, but that is probably because I choose to travel during the day,” she says.Asked about the frequency of checks on auto drivers, an official from the GRP said, “We are already short-staffed. Almost every other day, we find bodies of people who get hit by trains or are murdered. There are more important issues at hand for us to deal with.”                                     #automenace                                     #Chandigarhrailwaystation||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/no-check-on-auto-rickshaws-people-prefer-app-based-taxis-361682

During normal days, the “At Home” witnesses the presence of bigwigs from the UT.Unlike last year, he, however, said the award-distribution function would be held as usual. Last year, fewer people were honoured at the Parade Ground and the department heads were entrusted with the task of the distribution of awards and honours to the recipients of their respective department.Thousands of people attend the Republic Day celebrations every year at the Parade Ground in Sector 17, but this time, the list would be pruned. However, the march past will be presented by the police. It would be mandatory for everyone to wear masks.Meanwhile, the Central Government has rejected the themes submitted by the UT Administration for its tableau for the Republic Day Parade for the sixth year in a row. The Administration had submitted different themes for the tableau to the Central Government, but all were rejected, said an official.                                     #Covid19                                     #rday                                     #republicday                                     #Covidspike||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/covid-shadow-on-r-day-celebrations-361680
