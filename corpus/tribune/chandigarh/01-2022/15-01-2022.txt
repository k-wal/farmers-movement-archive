The Bench was told that initially an FIR was registered on September 5, 2019, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of the IPC and provisions of the Explosive Substances Act at the Sadar police station in Tarn Taran.The Bench observed that the Special Judge dismissed the bail application, though the applicant’s name was not found in the FIR. As per the prosecution case, it came out during the course of theinvestigation that the appellant was associated with a pro-Khalistan terrorist gang to support the Khalistan movement. On account of his close association with co-accused persons, he had advocated/abetted/advised/incited the commission of terrorist offences and was also associated with the co-accused persons in testing bombs.The Bench of Justice GS Sandhawalia and Justice Vikas Suri asserted: “Mainly because there are some Khalistani mentions spotted in his social media account, which are of offending nature, which show that there are two mobile numbers that have been saved under the title ‘Guri Khalistani’ and another mobile number wherein the entry reads as ‘Khalistan Jindabad’ would not as such be conclusive proof that the appellant is a member of a terrorist group,” the Bench added.Before parting with the order, the Bench added that the appellant had been in custody for almost two years and four months. The trial was not likely to conclude in the near future. The court, on account of the material collected against him in the investigation, was of the considered opinion that it could safely be recorded that the accusation was not, prima facie, true. He was entitled to the benefit of regular bail during the pendency of the trial.The Bench also directed the appellant’s production before the Special Court within a week to enable him to seek bail by furnishing bail bonds/surety bonds. The Special Court will impose a condition that the appellant will report to the local police station after every 15 days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/offending-social-media-post-no-proof-of-person-being-terror-group-member-high-court-361394

This is happening at a time when the district is witnessing record-breaking infections.‘People don’t listen’We urge people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, but they don’t listen. Cops are also deployed to improve the situation. In the coming week, crowds will decrease as we have attained 100% vaccination for both doses.Rs — Suvir Saxena, Principal Medical Officer, Civil HospitalOn the ground floor of ‘A Block’ of the hospital, one often finds a large number of people standing in a serpentine queue for their turn to get the Covid vaccine. Social distancing is far-fetched here. The health authorities also fail to ensure mask discipline at the infirmary.Though the health administration had recently decided to deploy cops at the Civil Hospital to ensure the pandemic protocol was observed by visitors, the struggle to achieve the same continues.At a time when the cases are rising rapidly, the prevailing situation at the biggest health facility of the district doesn’t show the health administration in a good light.The “sheer negligence” can also affect health care workers and doctors at the hospital. As many as 80 health workers have been found positive in the district this month.The situation is not confined to the Civil Hospital. Crowded scenes can also be seen at various vaccination centres across the city.However, the health administration stated that as they had achieved 100 per cent vaccination for both doses, the number of people turning up at the Civil Hospital and other vaccination centres across the district would come down.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/covid-norms-flouted-at-pkula-hospital-361393
