Interpreting the couplet, Justice Gill said it meant: “O son, why do you argue with your father? It is a sin to argue with the one who fathered you and raised you.”Justice Gill added the parents became helpless from all sides and then began the unfortunate tale of their moving from one forum to another for the redress of their grievances. Referring to the facts of the case in hand, Justice Gill asserted it was a classic example where petitioner son and daughter-in-law were seeking equities, entirely forgetting that their old and aged parents had to seek their eviction to buy back peace and freedom because of their conduct. Equity means a set of remedies and associated procedures involved with civil law.Justice Gill observed the father’s case was that the house was his self-acquired property, and not joint Hindu family property. Acting on the basis of a Sub Divisional Magistrate’s report saying that father was the house owner as per the sale deed, Kurukshetra District Magistrate ordered the petitioners’ ejectment.Dismissing the petition, Justice Gill added that the petitioners had not filed any document to show the father had gifted the house. “Even in the cases, where a gift deed was executed by the parents in favour of the children, it was held that irrespective of any condition regardingproviding to the transferor the basic amenities, the transferee would be bound to maintain the transferor,” Justice Gill concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/treat-parents-as-god-says-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-315002

Now, suddenly they have sent reminders for the fees for three years. All the colleges have already participated in the tournaments, on the basis of which they have also been awarded overall trophies. If any amount was pending, colleges should have been informed in the same financial year,” said a coach.The colleges have also demanded adjustment of dues, citing the Covid pandemic. “The authorities should waive off or adjust the said fee as there has been no activity in sports or on the development front since the Covid breakdown. The authorities should consider this before issuing such notices,” said a faculty member of a college.“As per rules, the dues are to be cleared in the same financial year. If the Punjab University Sports Committee or Directorate of Sports has failed to spot the discrepancy and colleges are allowed to participate in inter-college championships, the fault is at their level, not at the college level,” the faculty member added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/panjab-university-asks-9-colleges-to-clear-sports-dues-314851

The direction came nearly five years after the brick-by-brick demolition of the city’s glorious past with the raising of apartments from the debris of palatial houses came under the judicial scanner.During the course of the hearing, the Bench of Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Justice Vivek Puri referred to an office order, dated August 20, issued by the UT Assistant Estate Officer. The Bench asserted that its perusal gave the impression that the Estate Office, while issuing the NOC to banks to facilitate certain loan transactions, mentioned the share percentage as well as the floor. Accordingly, a clarification was circulated that fragmentation of property was not allowed in Chandigarh and only the percentage of share may be indicated.The Bench, as such, called upon the counsel representing the UT, Anil Mehta, to clarify whether NOCs had been issued by the UT Administration/competent authority indicating not only the share but also the floor.“During the course of the hearing today, counsel Mehta took a categoric stand that the necessity of issuing order/clarification, dated August 20, had arisen only on account of one solitary NOC having been issued indicating not only the share, but also the floor, and that also on account of a court decree having been passed,” the Bench observed.Before parting with the order, the Bench directed counsel Mehta to ensure filing of a specific affidavit by the Assistant Estate Officer, UT, to substantiate his stand. “The affidavit be placed on record positively on September 23,” the Bench concluded. The High Court Bench of Justice Dhindsa and Justice Puri had earlier scanned newspaper advertisements to find out whether floor-wise sale of dwelling units was contemplated. Finding no less than two dozen such advertisements in the Sunday edition of newspapers, the Bench had not only rapped the UT Administration, but also directed the holding of an exercise under the UT Chief Architect’s supervision.The Bench had observed that it thought of scanning the advertisements as the court was seized of the matter and discovered 24 advertisements in the Sunday edition “scouting for purchasers /investors for separate floors/independent floors”.Reproducing the advertisements, the Bench added that it lent credence to the petitioner-Residents Welfare Association that independent floors were being sold under the garb of sale of a certain percentage share of a residential unit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/floor-wise-sale-of-houses-file-affidavit-whether-nocs-issued-indicating-owners-share-floor-says-punjab-and-haryana-hc-314854

Vehicles were parked on cycle tracks, road berms and both sides of the roads. There was little police presence on roads to manage the situation.The event was seemingly marred due to poor planning by the UT Administration as all roads were meant for VIPs and VVIPs barring one, which leads to the rear of the lake. Even before 4.30 pm, when the event was to start, massive jams were witnessed on the road stretch from the Sector 27/28 chowk to Sector 26. Seeing hordes of vehicles, the police diverted these from the grain market light point towards the transport light point. Rather than taking the road to the lake’s rear, vehicles went to Kishangarh village from outside the Bapu Dham Colony road. Seeing serpentine queues of vehicles inside the village trying to head towards the lake, several people parked their vehicles at the village entrance and went to the lake by foot. Some went on in their vehicles. On reaching the rear of the lake, they could not find any parking space. Left with no option, they parked their cars on cycle tracks, footpath, road berms and both sides of road leading to commotion.“We could not watch the show as we ended up reaching late due to a huge traffic jam. We had to walk 2 km to reach the venue. The village road was full of potholes covered with mud and rainwater,” rued Samiksha, one of the visitors.Manjeet Singh, another visitor, lamented, “The Administration’s mismanagement was apparent. For VIPs, they had got all roads reserved and the public was left to fend for themselves. They should have done their homework before holding this show, causing huge trouble to people, especially children, women and elderly, who suffered in the humid weather.”The show venue was too crowded and suffocating for senior citizens. Some people even climbed trees. There was no public address system to inform public about the happenings at the event. Even after the show got over, people kept waiting for the next jets to fly.After the show ended, people started leaving the venue in a large number. They had a harrowing time as they were stuck in long traffic jams. The police and military vehicles too were caught in the snarl-up. There were scuffles over minor car accidents. “It was all chaos. Arrangements were far from adequate for such a big show. The police presence was too thin. Only a few cops were seen at the junctions,” said a car driver.A UT official said, “There was unexpectedly huge crowd. Though the police arrangements were made, they fell too little in number for such a huge rush.” Meanwhile, the Covid protocol too went for a toss. There was no social distancing at the venue and people gave scant regard to wearing a mask.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chaos-rules-roads-as-crowds-throng-air-show-venue-at-sukhna-lake-in-chandigarh-314857
23-09-2021||---||Air show: Suryakirans fail to show up over Sukhna sky||Chandigarh, September 22Thousands of people thronged Sukhna Lake to witness the air show, organised to commemorate Chandigarh Air Force Station’s diamond jubilee, but were left disappointed as the Suryakiran aerobatic team could not perform due to bad weather.Also read: Chaos rules roads as crowds throng air show venue at Sukhna Lake in ChandigarhSuryakiran: Flying formation that dazzles the skies with loops, rolls and divesThe Chinook heavy-lift helicopter from Chandigarh-based No. 126 Helicopter Unit and the Rafale fighter aircraft from the Ambala-based No. 17 Squadron made their appearance.Demonstrating its capability and manoeuvrability, the Chinook traversed the perimeter of the lake just a few feet above the water, sending spray over the visitors, much to their delight. Airlifting underslung load, inducting special forces and assault demonstration by commandos were among the other highlights.A lone Rafale streaked in low, made a couple of circuits over the lake, the amber flame of its twin exhausts contrasting with the grey skies, before executing a ‘vertical charlie’ manoeuvre and disappearing high above into the clouds.According to an Air Force officer, low clouds and consequently poor light in the evening prevented the Suryakiran team from performing at the show.Many visitors, who had congregated at the lake from the tricity as well as peripheral areas, some complete with cameras and zoom lenses, could not hide their disappointment. The entire stretch of the embankment of the lake, from the police post at the entrance to the regulator end, was jampacked. Some even stood atop the concrete lamps or climbed atop trees to get a better view.“It was a rare chance to witness the Suryakirans from so close, but the weather seems to have played a spoilsport. Being an aviation enthusiast, I was keen on clicking pictures for my collection,” said Ankush Behl, a college student.“The aerobatics were something definitely not to be missed, but it was also exciting to see the other aircraft. It was for the first time that I saw the Chinook and Rafale from so close,” said Ridhima Vohra, an executive with a private firm.While an announcement about the Suryakiran show being cancelled was made at the VIP enclosure, the audience crowding further along the embankment did not have a clue and kept waiting till last light in the hope that the aircraft would make an appearance.Punjab Governor and UT Administrator Banwarilal Purohit, Haryana Governor Bandaru Dattatreya, Himachal PradeshGovernor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar and Ravi Shankar Jha, Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, attended the event.Also present on the occasion were Dharam Pal, UT Adviser; Vini Mahajan, Punjab Chief Secretary; Lt Gen RP Singh, General Officer Commanding-in-C, Western Command; Air Marshal BR Krishna, Air Officer Commanding-in-C, Western Air Command (WAC); Praveer Ranjan, DGP, Chandigarh; Dinkar Gupta, DGP, Punjab; Air Marshal Vikram Singh, SASO, WAC; Air Commodore Tejbir Singh, AOC, Air Force Station, Chandigarh; Ravi Kant Sharma, Mayor, UT; officials of the Chandigarh Administration and Judges of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/air-show-suryakirans-fail-to-show-up-over-sukhna-sky-314860
