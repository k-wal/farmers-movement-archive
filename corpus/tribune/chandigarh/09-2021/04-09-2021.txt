The suspension comes at a time when the admission process has already started.While the officials blame the Covid pandemic for the delay, the colleges are finding it difficult to induct sportspersons of the state.A senior official of the Punjab Sports DepartmentCovid pandemic to blame for delayThe delay has occurred due to the Covid pandemic. We are in the process of allotting the sports wing seats. Usually, the last date to admit students in colleges is July 31. However, the date has been extended due to a delay in the examinations. The colleges should not panic.The sports wing seats are usually allocated in the month of May-June.Under the sports wing scheme, a day scholar gets a specific amount as diet money. The amount is doubled for a residential athlete.“The delay has occurred due to the Covid pandemic. We are in the process of allotting the sports wing seats. Usually, the last date to admit students in colleges is July 31. However, the date has been extended due to a delay in the examinations. The colleges should not panic,” said a senior official of the Punjab Sports Department seeking anonymity.The coaches, meanwhile, said they had to put admissions under the sports quota on hold as they had no information on sports wing seats.“The admission process has started. The officials should have at least given us some clarity on number of seats per college and diet money,” said a Ludhiana based coach.“Many promising players are moving to other universities to secure their seats and pursue their career amid no clarity from the Punjab Sports Department,” said the coach.The process to induct players under the reserved seats usually runs for three months from April to June. The colleges get confirmation on the number of seats allotted and hike in diet money, if any, and accordingly, hostel seats are reserved and players get categorised as day scholars and hostellers.The process helps colleges to induct players before Panjab University inter-college championships.As per the Panjab University sports calendar, subject to the approval from the Associations of Indian Universities, the championships would be conducted from October this year.“The players are already out of action for one year and we are left with only a month to prepare for the inter-college competitions. In such a scenario, the department should allot seats so that colleges begin the induction process,” said another coach.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/allotment-of-sports-seats-gets-delayed-in-punjab-coaches-fume-306491

The police recovered 20 injections of buprenorphine from his possession.The police presented a chargesheet against the accused in the court and charges were framed against him.After hearing the arguments and examining the records, the court, in its order, said: “The extent of recovery of contraband in the present case falls in the category of ‘commercial quantity’. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, the accused is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment under Section 22 (c) of the NDPS Act for a period of 10 years.”The court also imposed a fine of Rs1 lakh on the accused. In case of default of the payment, the convict will have to undergo RI for one more year.The court says the period of detention already undergone by the convict, during the course of investigation or trial, shall be set off against the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon him as per the provisions of Section 428 of the CrPC.The convict submitted that he was a sweeper by profession and had elderly parents, wife and a minor son who were dependent upon him for their livelihood and prayed for leniency.In the order, Dr Rajneesh, Additional Sessions Judge, said: “Sale and consumption of narcotics in an illegal manner is immensely affecting our society. Drug addiction destroys the trait of appreciation of a person, who cannot differentiate between fair and unfair and commits heinous crimes. Nowadays, drug menace has become a social malady and it has attained monstrous proportion and is tearing families apart.

These patients are often very sick and difficulty in obtaining respiratory symptoms leads to further delay in the diagnosis. Moreover, many CAPM patients remain unproven and die even before reaching the hospital,” he said.Another important observation made in the study, which has been published in the radiology journal, was that 47 per cent of the CAPM patients had no associated risk factor. Diabetes was seen only in 29.4 per cent of these patients.“This is in contrast to other cases of non-pulmonary CAM where more than 80 per cent patients are reported to have underlying diabetes. Also 71 per cent of the CAPM patients were found on mechanical ventilation in contrast to only 40 per cent of the non-pulmonary CAM,” Dr Garg elaborated.The study has been co-authored by Dr Nidhi and Dr Shameema from the Department of Radiodiagnosis; Dr Harsimran from the Department of Microbiology; Dr Vikas Suri from Internal Medicine; and Dr Valliappan and Prof Ritesh Agarwal from Pulmonary Medicine.The study also highlighted that CT scan could play a crucial role in the diagnosis of the CAPM.“The presence of cavitation, consolidation, pleural effusion and nodules seen on CT chest are ‘red-flag’ signs for superimposed fungal infection,” said Dr Garg.“Without any delay, such patients should be further worked up for fungal infections so that anti-fungal treatment can be started at the earliest and the life of these patients can be saved,” he said.Expertspeak“We found that the Covid-associated pulmonary mucormycosis infection is more dangerous and has higher mortality when compared to the non-pulmonary Covid-associated mucormycosis,” said Dr Garg – a renowned chest radiologist and a professor in the Department of Radiodiagnosis at the PGI, Chandigarh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/covid-associated-pulmonary-mucormycosis-more-deadly-306302

04-09-2021||Saurabh Malik||Send minor girls leaving home to child care institutions: HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 3The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that minor girls leaving their parental homes were, more often than not, sent to Nari Niketan/special home/observation home meant for juveniles in conflict with law and not to child care institutions.Directions issued to district courtsThe High Court directed district/subordinate courts to ensure minor girls were not sent to Nari Niketan/special home/observation home meant for juveniles in conflict with law, but to proper child care institutions with adequate budgetary and infrastructural facilities.The assertion came as the High Court issued a slew of directions to the district/subordinate courts, legal services authority and the governments/administration of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on their protection. The commandments included directions to the district/subordinate courts to send minor girls in need of care and protection to proper child care institutions instead of homes for juveniles in conflict with law.The directions came after Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi observed the earlier commandments issued by another Bench some six years back had apparently not been fully executed and “much more” was required to be done for the “minor girls who leave their parental homes with paramour on account of love affair, alone or in company of some friend, due to maltreatment by their parents or pressure on them to marry a person of their parents’ choice”. Justice Tyagi added the child care institution, too, lacked requisite budgetary and infrastructural facilities.To begin with, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh were directed to identify/notify child care institutions in each district, or a group of districts, before providing requisite financial assistance. Directions were also issued for closely monitoring/supervising their working to ensure minor girls were not subjected to “miseries or exploitation”.In his August 31 order released today, Justice Tyagi also directed the states and the UT to ensure the minor girls were as far as possible prompted and allowed to continue their education from institutions they were studying in. Adoption of steps for providing additional vocational training in sewing, computer applications, cooking and fashion designing etc. was also directed to enable them to earn livelihood on attaining of majority.The State Legal Services Authorities of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh were also directed to prepare a scheme/widen the scope of existing scheme for providing necessary assistance, including legal aid for redressal of their grievances, along with requisite financial help.The District Legal Services Authority secretaries were also asked to visit and depute legal aid counsels to periodically visit the child care institutions for assessment of their living conditions, suggesting improvement and assisting them in redressal of their grievances.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/send-minor-girls-leaving-home-to-child-care-institutions-hc-306099

The institute would soon submit a draft policy.In January, the then UT Administrator, VP Singh Badnore, had directed senior officials of the Administration to work on regularisation of a large number of illegal constructions outside the Lal Dora, as the villages had been merged with the Municipal Corporation (MC).Political parties and residents of the villages have been demanding the extension of Lal Dora and regularisation of constructions outside it. Meanwhile, a delegation led by Dr Naresh Panchal, along with other members of the village development committee, met MC Commissioner Anindita Mitra in the presence of Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma and raised issues regarding the development of the villages, including new road networks, laying of storm water pipes and sewer lines, electrical and horticultural works and strengthening water supply system. The Mayor said there were 22 villages under the jurisdiction of the MC and 13 of these, including Behlana, Raipur Khurd, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra, Daria, Mauli Jagran, Kishangarh, Kaimbwala, Khudda Ali Sher, Khudda Jassu, Khudda Lahora, Sarangpur and Dhanas, were transferred to the civic body in 2019. The General House of the MC had already approved a proposal of Rs102 crore for development works in these villages. The plan prepared by the Engineering Wing and upgrading the sewerage and improving drinking water supply system in these villages would be the top priority of the MC, he said. The process would be completed within the stipulated time frame and the work would be started as soon as possible, the Mayor added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-readying-plan-for-overall-development-of-villages-in-ut-306318

Out of these, 28.45 per cent were symptomatic and rest 71.54 per cent asymptomatic.“Asymptomatic patients were found to have higher viral load than the symptomatic patients. Though the difference was not found to be statistically significant,” read the study.Also read: Covid has fuelled diabetes pandemicThe aim of the study by the PGI, Chandigarh, was to investigate the association of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with disease severity, if any, in different population subsets infected with Covid-19.Viral load refers to the quantitative number of viral particles in the body fluid, which represents the infectivity levels and has been used conventionally for monitoring the curative effects of antiviral. The viral diseases are always discussed in terms of viral load and disease severity. However, SARS-CoV-2 has shown new trends in the field of virology in aspects of viral load and diseases severity. The ICMR had also refuted the role of viral load and disease severity by releasing a statement that cycle threshold (Ct) value can be found similar in both mild or asymptomatic patients and those who develop severe symptoms. The Ct value is inversely proportional to virus load, meaning higher virus load (VL) will have less Ct value. The Ct value emerges in RT-PCR tests. “The low Ct values may not necessarily suggest disease severity as high VLs have also been seen in entirely asymptomatic patients. The virus shedding by RT-PCR has been shown to be up to 83 days as even the RNA of the dead viral particles can be detected and hence may not be a marker of infectivity,” the study noted.Then what is causing disease severity?The PGI researchers said the SARS-CoV-2 viral load was not found to be significantly associated with the disease severity among different age groups in the present study as various host factors had been implicated in the disease severity.According to the researchers, SARS-CoV-2 infection severity mainly depends on host factors and the immunological responses, including cytokine storm. Host factor refers to the traits of an individual person that affect susceptibility to disease. This may include general health, comorbidities, immune response, etc.Low severity in children Paediatric positivity, in the present study, was found to be 15.8 per cent and a majority of the patients were found to be asymptomatic. Various reasons for lower severity in paediatric population can be explained by trained immunity in children, which is a reprogramming of innate immune response to more activated stages by frequent viral exposures, vaccination, routine live viral vaccine, frequent viral exposures, and higher regeneration capacity of children’s lungs.UT sees 4 casesChandigarh: The city on Friday reported four new cases of Covid-19 and no death due to the virus.
