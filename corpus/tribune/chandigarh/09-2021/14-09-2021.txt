These included flying operations involved in rehearsing of war plans and implementation of operational instructions inclusive of international exercises, all combat and tactical sorties in preparation of war, valley flying and missions involving operating at ultra low levels, all operational missions undertaken during peace like special operations, live operational readiness platform, recce, intelligence, survey and induction trials of new weapons, missions undertaken in support of troops and security forces deployed in forward areas, and lastly, flying missions involving landings on advance landing grounds.The ministry’s letter of September 9, 2009, which had specified these categories, explicitly stated that “cases already settled prior to the date of issue of this letter will not be reopened.”A memorandum issued by the Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare earlier this month states that the matter has been examined in the ministry and it has been decided that the flying accidents cases that occurred on or after January 1, 1996, the date of implementation of the Fifth Pay Commission, and which fall strictly under the six aforementioned categories, may also be considered for grant of pensionary benefits.“Service Headquarter /Record Offices concerned are advised to re-examine each such case strictly in accordance with six categories mentioned above in consultation with the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts without any deviation,” the memorandum says.Between 1996 and 2009, dozens of armed forces fighter and transport aircraft as well as helicopters were involved in accidents, in which aircrew as well as passengers had lost their lives. This included operations in conflict zones such as Kargil as well as war like situations such Operational Parakram and Siachen, besides training exercises.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/pensionary-benefits-in-cases-of-aircraft-accidents-extended-to-cover-all-post-1996-cases-311080

The police have registered the case on a complaint of Philip Jacob, a businessman from Kerala and an accused arrested in April this year for illegally dealing in Remdesivir injections. Jacob, along with five others, including Prabhat Thyagi, was arrested by the Operations Cell of the Chandigarh Police in April for illegally dealing in Remdesivir injections from a Sector 17 hotel.Jacob alleged that Prabhat Thyagi, along with gangster Lawrence Bishnoi’s aide Narwal, who was in the same barrack, extorted Rs2 lakh from him. After coming out on bail, Jacob lodged a complaint at the Sector 49 police station. Jacob alleged that the extortion demands were initially made by Thyagi, who had been sharing details about Jacob’s business and financial details with other inmates in the barrack.Jacob said Prabhat Thyagi told him that Ankit Narwal was a big gangster and he was from the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. They had more than 6,000 shooters across the country and they would kill him when he comes for a hearing in the court.Ankit Narwal and Prabhat Thyagi threatened him several times to pay extortion money and Ankit Narwal gave his brother’s phone number and asked him to coordinate with him to get the money transferred.Jacob said he spoke to his wife through a calling facility provided by the jail authority and gave the phone number of Narwal’s brother Vikas to get bank account details, PAN card and Aadhaar card. In turn, Vikas allegedly forwarded bank details to his wife, who transferred Rs2 lakh from her son’s account. He alleged that after getting Rs2 lakh, Prabhat Thyagi and Ankit Narwal again threatened to kill him and sought Rs10 lakh. They further demanded Rs30 lakh from him after he was out on bail, otherwise their shooters would kill him. He said they also threatened him not to disclose anything to anybody.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/extortion-racket-from-burail-jail-chandigarh-police-file-chargesheet-against-2-310812

This was the sight at city hospitals during a late night surprise visit by the UT Health Secretary.Health Secretary Yashpal Garg conducted a surprise inspection at various hospitals under the UT Administration here from 11 pm last night.During the three-hour long inspection, Garg strictly pointed out that the emergency medical officers (EMOs) should remain in emergency ward instead of retiring rooms, leaving behind the nursing staff/attendants.The Health Secretary said there was a need to consider deputing senior doctors/consultants during night shifts at the GMCH-32 and GMSH-16. For this, the night duty roster being followed at the PGI and other premier medical institutions in other parts of the country should be implemented, he said.A surprise inspection note was sent to all medical officers at the city government hospitals.According to the note on the GMCH-32: “The supervisor of the security guards was quite busy surfing his mobile phone. He seemed to be least bothered about people coming in and going out of the emergency. The EMO was not available in the emergency. She was busy surfing her mobile phone in a nearby room.”“The attendant was in the emergency with five-six persons, including one police official. None of them was wearing a face mask and they were busy in gossiping/cracking jokes,” read the inspection letter.Giving an ultimatum to the medical officers, Garg said this being the first surprise inspection, there was no need to take any action against any of the officials on the basis of the inspection note. “However, it need not be interpreted as leniency because the undersigned is well aware about his authority to carry out the assigned responsibilities.” “There will be frequent surprise inspections and the same may be followed with appropriate actions,” the letter stated. He also said senior medical officers; Medical Superintendent; Director, Health Services; and Director Principal should also take surprise rounds during the night time.“At the ESI Hospital in Ram Darbar, the X-ray machine was not functional for the past few days and one patient in the emergency had been asked to get the X-ray done from the GMCH. Plaster was coming out from the ceiling on one of the beds in the emergency and the patient was shifted to another bed,” Garg noticed during his visit.The Health Secretary said though the staff at the ESI Hospital was not being paid by the UT Administration, there was need to apprise the authorities concerned about the plight of the outsourced staff waiting for their salary for the past more than six months.Trespassing complaint filedAccording to Health Secretary Yashpal Garg, five-six persons were taking liquor in front of the oxygen plant at the GMCH-32. Garg has written to the SSP, Chandigarh, seeking action against them. He urged the police to take action against the unidentified persons for trespassing.
