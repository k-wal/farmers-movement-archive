A challan to the tune of Rs 20,000 was issued to the contractor,” said MC Commissioner Anindita Mitra.The MC had given a week’s deadline to the parking contractors to adhere to all mandatory provisions of their contract. A team of MC officials were deputed by the Commissioner to inspect all 89 parking lots and submit the report on the compliance.According to the report submitted to the Commissioner, haphazard parking and lack of attendants were found at many parking lots.The report found haphazard parking in the evening at major parking sites. At major parking lots such as Elante, Sukhna Lake, Sector 35-B & C, 43, 20, 22, 26 and the MOH and Sahib Singh in Sector 17, staff was deployed inside the facility but they were without whistles and sticks. In small parking lots, no staff was deployed, the inspection team had reported. The report mentioned that improvement was needed with regard to parking kiosks, barricades, cones and chains put up at the parking lots. However, the report pointed out that several other smart features mentioned in the contract were in place.Two parking contractors, who manage 89 sites, had complied with most of the basic parking features such as e-ticketing, LED display, e-payment, staff wearing uniform at most sites and boom barrier (at required sites), it added.The UT Adviser had earlier raised the issue. Later, the Opposition in the MC General House had also raked up the issue of smart features not having been introduced.

It had also upheld the orders of consumer courts below requiring the Administration to pay compensation to the complainants for mental agony and physical harassment caused due to deficiency in service.However, allowing the Estate Officer’s appeal, the top court directed the Administration to decide in three months the claim of conversion of allottees as on the date when the consumer complaints were filed.“We find that it is not a case of deficiency in service as contemplated by the Consumer Act but definitely a case of exercise of jurisdiction in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. In exercise of the power conferred on this court under Article 142, we direct the Administration to decide the claim of conversion as on the date when consumer complaints were filed. Such action shall be taken within three months,” it said.The top court said, “The difficulty in the Administration is that senior officers in the Chandigarh Administration are on deputation from either Punjab or Haryana. The officers revert to their parent cadre after the completion of the deputation period of approximately three years. However, the officials continue to work at the Estate Office.“Though the Administration has done commendable work to maintain the character of Chandigarh as the City Beautiful, the Estate Office has underbelly, that is, the action of the officials cannot be said to be bona fide, as is apparent in the present case. It is a typical case of ‘you show me face, I will show the rule’. On the other hand, the officers are unable to take decisions which are citizen friendly. Even no attempt is made to remove the bottlenecks in the working of the Estate Office,” it noted. The top court asked the Administration to give details of the notices for resumption on account of alleged misuse, which are pending consideration. Such details should include the date of serving of notice of the alleged misuse and the stage of proceedings pending before officers of the Administration. A report is to be submitted by the Administration thereafter in respect of the above directions within four months for perusal and necessary action, if so warranted, after four months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/set-up-panel-to-streamline-mutation-supreme-court-to-chandigarh-administration-309540

The entire village, including the young, the old, the educated and the uneducated, gathered to shunt him out. The poor ape climbed up a tall tree as the crowd gathered.He had no idea about the offence he had committed as a result of which everyone was running after his life. In the meantime, the village sarpanch carrying a stick or a symbol of authority came there. Looking at the crowd and hearing the noise, he enquired about the matter. A man stepped forward and said he was the ‘lambardar’ or the headman appointed by the king to shunt the ape out of the village.The sarpanch politely asked him, “What is the matter and why do you want to shunt him out”. The ‘lambardar’, in response, said he was the king’s representative and the sarpanch had no business to ask him. The sarpanch asked: “Are you all on one side?” The whole crowd replied in affirmative, compelling the sarpanch to ask who was on the ape’s side. His query was met with a pin-drop silence.The ‘lambardar’ questioned the sarpanch: “How do you expect anyone to be on the ape’s side”. The sarpanch smiled, raised his stick and said this was injustice and he stood for the ape. He would not allow the ‘lambardar’ to shunt the ape out unless he gave plausible reasons.“This is how the legal system in India work where the Court follows, the principal of ‘audi alteram partem’, i.e. nobody should be condemned unheard. The plight of the petitioner appears to be similar to the story as this Court protected the right of the petitioner by passing various orders,” Justice Sangwan added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/high-court-draws-parallel-between-fable-sumedh-singh-saini-case-309545

With growing population and no solution in sight, the problem has taken a turn for the worse in the past few years.With Kulbhushan Goyal taking over as the Mayor (in January), who promised to make the city free of stray cattle by March, people hoped for situation to turn better but in vain.Even as more than seven months have passed since the MC General House okayed a resolution to meet the ‘objective’, there seems to be no respite for locals.This is not the first time that deadlines have been missed to make the city free of stray cattle. The Haryana Government had set a target to make the state free of stray animals by August 15, 2018, which was later extended to January 1, 2019, but nothing has changed till date.Fatal accidentsIt is often seen that stray cattle not only abruptly come in the way of commuters, leading to accidents, including fatal ones, but also attack people, especially children and elderly people, while roaming the streets. In an RTI reply, the state government had stated that at least 16 lives were lost in accidents involving stray cattle in Panchkula between February 2018 and March 2020.Civic body strategyyet to taste successThe BJP-JJP-ruled Panchkula Municipal Corporation seems to be backing a strategy of constantly increasing the number of gaushalas and the financial support given to them. However, the planning hasn’t seen any success so far. After the inauguration of a cowshed at Sukhdarshanpur in January, the MC has now decided to build a ‘nandishala’ village on 5 acres at Kot village. It will have a capacity to house 1,500 stray cows. “A tender for the ‘nandishala’ in Kot village will be floated soon,” said Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal.In June, the MC General House had announced an assistance of Rs3 lakh per month to the Madhav Gaushala Charitable Trust, an NGO which operates a cowshed.Till date, the civic body has claimed to have shifted over 1,000 cows to different cowsheds (gaushalas) to ensure roads are free of stray cattle.The Sukhdarshanpur cowshed, which can accommodate 1,000-1,200 animals, currently houses around 750 head of stray cattle. The remaining cows, approximately 250, have been kept at Mata Mansa Devi Gaudham.Mayor blamesrising headcount“We have been impounding roaming animals and putting them in cow shelters. So far, 1,200 head of stray cattle have been shifted to the Mansa Devi and Sukhdarshanpur cowsheds,” the Mayor told Chandigarh Tribune. When asked about jumping deadlines, he said, “We have been putting in every effort to address the problem, but there has been a rapid increase in the population of stray cattle over the years. In view of the rise in their numbers, we have decided to construct another cowshed with a capacity of minimum 1,500 animals, at Kot village,” he said.Menace reached alarming proportions: ResidentsRP Malhotra, president of the Federation of Residents’ Association (FORA), a residents’ body in Panchkula, said, “The problem of stray cattle is not new and it has reached alarming proportions due to the negligence of the civic authorities.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/spending-up-gaushalas-too-but-strays-still-rule-panchkula-309550

But it was one of those days when the putts just didn’t roll in for me, the exact opposite of what happened in round two when I converted everything on the greens. To make matters worse, my chipping was totally off as I didn’t land it close enough to the flag to be able to make chip-putts. The key will be to hit maximum fairways in the final round and I feel making greens in regulation will be even more crucial. I’ll take heart from the fact that I hit just one bad drive and pulled things back on the back-nine.”The Gurugram-based 25-year-old Ahlawat (67-62-71), followed up his whirlwind 62 in Round 2 with a sedate 1-under 71 on Friday to move his tournament total to 16-under 200. Veer’s mixed round saw him pick up five birdies at the expense of four bogeys.Noida’s Amardeep Malik (71-65-66) was breathing down the leader’s neck at the culmination of the penultimate round as he struck a terrific 66 consisting of eight birdies and two bogeys to be placed second at 14-under 202.Bengaluru’s Chikkarangappa S (69-65-69) was also in contention in third place at 13-under 203 along with Mysuru’s Yashas Chandra (65-70-69) who occupied fourth place at 12-under 204.Yuvraj Singh Sandhu (66) was the highest placed among the Chandigarh golfers as he closed the day in tied-fifth at 11-under 205 along with Om Prakash Chouhan (66) of Mhow and M Dharma (70) of Bengaluru.Noida’s Gaurav Pratap Singh shot the day’s best score of 7-under 65 to move up 34 places into tied 15th at six-under 210. His round featured an eagle, six birdies and a bogey.Earlier in the day, the second round was completed by the 65 players who couldn’t finish their rounds on Thursday due to the rain and resulting delayed start. At the end of Round 2, the cut was declared at one-over 145 as fifty-six professionals and one amateur made it to the money rounds. Veer Ahlawat enjoyed a five-shot lead at 15-under 129 at the halfway stage while Chikkarangappa was second at 10-under 134.Veer Ahlawat had a forgettable front-nine courtesy his inconsistent chipping as he claimed just two birdies and dropped three bogeys. He had a far better back-nine with three birdies and a bogey that helped him stay the course despite his putts not rolling in. Veer’s last birdie on the 16th was a 15-foot conversion.Amardeep Malik, lying tied fifth and seven off the lead after round two, began with a two-under on the front-nine but picked up pace in the second half of his round with five birdies and a bogey to narrow down the gap with the leader to two shots.Malik, a two-time winner on the PGTI, sank a 20-footer for birdie on the 15th before going on to make a good par save on the 16th despite a poor tee shot. However, he had a lip out in his 20 feet birdie putt on the 18th where he had to settle for par. Ranjit Singh was the second Chandigarh player in the top-10 after Yuvraj Singh Sandhu. Ranjit was placed tied eighth at 10-under 206 along with Delhi’s Rashid Khan and rookie Kartik Sharma of Gurugram.Karandeep Kochhar occupied tied 11th place at nine-under 207. Chandigarh’s Bishmadpal Singh Seerha, the lone amateur to make the cut, was tied 39th at even-par 216.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/pgti-players-championship-veer-ahlawat-maintains-lead-in-round-3-309553
