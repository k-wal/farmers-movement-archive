The policy was valid from November 30, 2018 to November 29, 2019, with coverage of health insurance upto Rs.10 lakh, they added.Bhinder said on January 14, 2019, he was taken to Fortis Hospital, Mohali, where he was admitted and his coronary angiography done. As he had got insurance policy from firm, his case was processed by hospital for preauthorisation of cashless treatment, Bhinder added.Bhinder alleged that preauthorisation for cashless treatment at hospital was rejected by firm on the ground that in the report of coronary angiography done at Fortis Hospital on December 14, 2018, it was found that he had pre-existing disease, which fell within 30 days waiting period from the commencement of the policy. Bhinder claimed that he never visited any hospital before January 14, 2019, for coronary angiography.Later, it was found that there was a mistake on the part of the hospital while preparing the angiography report of Bhinder. When this fact was brought to the notice of the hospital, an email was sent by it clarifying that coronary angiography of the complainant was done on January 14, 2019, and not on December 14, 2018. However, despite this clarification pre-authorisation of cashless treatment was denied to Bhinder by firm.Complainant was given permission to apply for reimbursement of the claim amount after treatment.Coronary artery bypass graft surgery of the complainant was conducted at the hospital for which he paid Rs4,84,499 from his pocket. The insurance company denied any deficiency on its part.After hearing arguments the commission found the insurance firm guilty of the deficiency in services and directed it to reimburse the entire amount to the complainant spent by him on his treatment along with nine per cent interest per annum.Besides, the firm was also directed to pay Rs2 lakh compensation for deficiency in providing service and adopting unfair trade practice.The commission also directed the hospital to pay Rs50,000 compensation to complainant for its callous approach and negligence in maintaining record/report, which led to rejection of his claim.The commission also told all opposite parties (firm and hospital) to jointly pay Rs35,000 towards cost of litigation to complainant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/panel-directs-insurance-firm-to-pay-rs-2-lakh-for-denying-claim-301232

While the DSP told Chandigarh Tribune that an inquiry in the case was marked to the SHO of Sector 26 police station, farm activists fear police inaction.“We have seen how the police becomes a mute spectator in many cases of state-incited violence across the country. The attack on woman farm activist is no different,” said Kanwaljit Singh of the Punjab Kisan Union.“Such an incident happening in Chandigarh, which has a woman MP is disappointing. How come, Kirron Kher didn’t utter a single word against the incident? Is she not a woman? Not a single person from the BJP has apologised for the indecent behaviour meted out to a woman by a group of their men,” he added. He demanded an immediate apology from the BJP and an FIR against the accused.Sukhjeet Kaur, member of Lok Akhikaar Lehar, Mohali, said, “This is pathetic.

Inder Sain, also an accused in the case, had died in October 2020.The caseRanjit Singh was shot dead when he was returning from his fields in his native villagein Kurukshetra district on July 10, 2002.EyewitnessAccording to the CBI, “Eyewitnesses Joginder Singh, father of Ranjit Singh, and his farm neighbour Sukhdev Singh, had identified Sabdil and Jasbir as shooters.”During the final arguments, CBI claimed there was enough evidence that Dera chief had hatched a conspiracy to kill Ranjit Singh after suspecting his role in the circulation of an anonymous letter alleging sexual exploitation of his female followers in the Dera.“Dera chief’s former driver Khatta Singh in his testimony before the court revealed Ram Rahim’s role in the murder,” special CBI prosecutor HPS Verma told the court.Khatta Singh as a CBI witness had testified before the court that Ram Rahim ordered his men to kill Ranjit Singh during a meeting inside the Dera on June 16, 2002. Khatta Singh had claimed that he was present in that meeting.The defence, meanwhile, claimed that the Dera chief was in Rajasthan on that particular date.Verma though challenged the claims, saying: “Witnesses produced by the defence to corroborate the claims were actually Dera followers. Hence, their statements can’t be relied upon.”“A bullet removed from Ranjit Singh’s body was fired from a .455 bore pistol and same type of weapons were issued to Sabdil, who is a former gunman of Dera chief,” said Verma.The defence, however, said Sabdil had been issued just one weapon and there was a wrong entry in official documents that led to the confusion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/ranjit-singh-murder-case-final-order-on-august-26-301228

During the meeting, options of MRTS such as Metro, monorail, etc, were also discussed.The UT Administration in 2019 had rejected a detailed study conducted by a French company, Systra, for the city’s mobility plan under the Smart City project.The mode of transportation to be adopted to resolve the urban transportation problems of the city would be based on the new study to be conducted on MRTS.Recently, UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore gave his approval to the proposal of the UT on the issue. The RITES had proposed that Metro would cover a distance of 52.4 km, of which 40.4 km will be in Chandigarh and the rest in Mohali. The alignments were proposed both above ground as well as underground. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had prepared the detailed project report of the first phase of the project. Later, in 2017, the Central Government had declared Metro was unviable for the city.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/administration-seeks-fresh-report-to-solve-traffic-problems-in-chandigarh-301224
