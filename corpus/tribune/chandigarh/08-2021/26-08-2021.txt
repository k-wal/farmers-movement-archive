It’s for the first time in over two decades that an official from Himachal Pradesh has been appointed to the post. Rayat is said to have got his doctorate degree from Panjab University in 2019 and holds specialisation in boxing.Perhaps, it’s a coincidence that the Union Sports Minister is also from Himachal Pradesh and Chairman of the UT Administrator’s Advisory Council for Sports is also the co-incharge of BJP party affairs, Himachal Pradesh.Notably, last time (in 2016), the department did not seek the appointment of the JDS from the Himachal Pradesh cadre.Meanwhile, with this additional post (JDS), now all top three officials (Secretary Sports, Director Sports and Joint Director Sports) of the Sports Department are officer-in-charge on deputation basis.According to a Sports Department circular, the appointment of a Class I officer (Joint Director) will be made by way of transfer/deputation. The person was asked not to be above 55 years (as on January 1, 2020) and a postgraduate in physical education or equivalent in any sport, with administrative experience, especially in the field of sports.The post has been lying vacant since November 2019 and since then, the department had been working on filling the post. The department also claimed to have approached the UPSC to set up a criteria as the UT follows the Punjab Civil Service rules, wherein a minimum of 15 years of service in administration or field of sports is required. However, in the latest circular, nothing has been mentioned about the years of experience.However, since Chandigarh does not have any rules or policy for promoting its own coaches, the chair was to be filled by a person from outside the cadre. The UT follows Rule 8 (i) of the Punjab State Sports Rules, 1993. As per the Clause, the post of the JDS should be filled by a Class-I officer of the state or the Centre having an experience and background of sports or sports administration. No criteria or re-drafting has been framed to promote coaches even after an initiative of the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1997.The appointment, meanwhile, has raised silent objections from the local coaching fraternity. However, sources said the appointment had been made to avoid individual interests of other contenders. “There were as many as three contenders from Chandigarh, who were interviewed for this post. However, the panel recommended the applicant from Himachal Pradesh,” said a source.Pending works at Sports DepartmentObjections raisedThe appointment, meanwhile, has raised silent objections from the local coaching fraternity.

Since then the accused was in the Burail Jail.Goel argued that the date of birth of the accused was January 12, 2005, and he was just 16 years old on July 7, 2021 – the date on which the alleged offence had been committed.The matriculation certificate of the petitioner issued by concerned Board of School Education and his Adhaar card may be considered as a proof of date of birth of the accused, Goel pleaded.The police intentionally concealed the fact from the court and the boy has been lodged in Model Jail at Burail in the company of hardcore criminals, he said.The act and conduct of the police is clearly a breach of rights of juveniles as per the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015, said Goel.After hearing the arguments, the court stated that the concerned School Education Council had also submitted that the record pertaining to the age of the accused was correct and not fabricated.“In view of the fact and in light of provisions under the Section 9 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, it is evident that age of applicant at the time of occurrence was less than 18 years,” the court observed.“The juvenile is also to be produced before the Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board, Chandigarh, for the purpose of further custody in the observation-cum-special home, Sector 25, Chandigarh,” the court said.The court also directed the authorities concerned to send a copy of the order to the SHO for submitting the final report before the Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board.A copy of the order has also been sent to the Jail Superintendent, Model Jail for intimation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/2-months-on-accused-lodged-in-chandigarhs-burail-jail-declared-juvenile-302254

He wrote: “Since the auction is taking place outside India, it is under the jurisdiction of the External Affairs Ministry, that’s why this communication is addressed to you and since the auction is taking place in Australia, so the Ambassador is also being informed by way of sending a copy of this communication.”First to have identification mark, says JaggaJagga said, “This will be the 13th heritage auction (of UT items) in 2021 alone. Another important thing is that this is for the first time that the auction house has declared the identification mark/tag of this chair i.e. ACA-CH/W9. The only instance of the identification of a heritage item in the history of these auctions is of 2018 when the office of the Commissioner of Customs (Export) and Inland Container Depot, Tughlakabad, New Delhi, held a consignment of Chandigarh furniture, contacted us.”Description given by Sydney auctioneerMeasurements||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/no-stopping-auctions-chandigarhs-heritage-up-for-grabs-down-under-302250

But these were never enough given the rising patient load in the city. The healthcare system in the UT has been teetering on the brink with many hospitals unable to handle the relentless inflow of patients while also running out of ICU beds.GMCH Director Dr Jasbinder Kaur said, “We had received additional 74 ventilator beds during and after the second wave from individual donations and the Government of India. Now, the total capacity of the institute is 149 ICU beds with ventilator support. We are well-equipped to manage any surge in the infection.”Not only this, the institute has also augmented its RT-PCR testing capacity to 1,200 tests per day, which was only 450 tests per day during the second wave.The UT Administration had to request the GMCH-32 and the PGI to enhance their RT-PCR testing capacity as the Covid reports were delayed. Due to a limited capacity, the turnaround time of Covid reports was 72 hours and the Administration was forced to rope in private labs for the same.Although, the GMCH was a 500-bedded hospital, the overall bed capacity has been upgraded to 980 beds, including 124 beds at the GMCH-32 South Campus.‘RT-PCR testing capacity enhanced’We have also purchased two more RT-PCR testing machines so that our testing capacity is enhanced. We are hopeful of conducting up to 1,500 tests per day. — Dr Jasbinder Kaur, Director, GMCH||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/gmch-raises-count-of-beds-with-ventilator-support-to-149-302218
