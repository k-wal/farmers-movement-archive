It has been directed that the hospitals may procure oxygen cylinders as per their requirement. However, they need to ensure judicious and optimum utilisation of cylinders. The hospitals as well as oxygen suppliers will need to share the utilisation status of the past 24 hours by 9 am every day with the authorities concerned.Anybody who has taken any undue advantage will not be spared and lodging of an FIR will also be considered, the Administration said after a meeting with the private hospitals and oxygen refilling centres here today.The meeting was chaired by Jagjit Singh, a PCS officer.Some of the hospitals alleged that Super Agencies had been overcharging them for oxygen cylinders.The hospitals complained that even though the Administration had fixed the refilling charges for ‘D’ type cylinders at Rs295, plus 12 per cent GST, they were being forced to be pay Rs600-Rs800 by the vendor.The hospitals said since the quota and refilling vendor was fixed by the Administration, they had no option but to pay the extra amount.The Administration has earmarked three private vendors for refilling of oxygen cylinders. It has also fixed the prices for refilling based on the category of cylinder. For a ‘D’ type cylinder, hospitals need to pay Rs295, plus 12 per cent GST, while for a ‘B’ type cylinder, they need to pay Rs175, plus 12 per cent GST. Residents can also avail of the service.“Despite repeated calls, Super Agencies (representatives) did not attend the meeting on the pretext of being ill,” stated the Administration. The UT Administration has asked the four private hospitals – Mukut, Healing, Kare Partners and Apollo – to submit complaints in writing with regard to the issue.Jagjit Singh will deal with the complaints, after going through facts of the case and hearing all the stakeholders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/oxygen-firm-fleeces-private-hospitals-257094
23-05-2021||---||Revise Covid treatment charges, say hospitals||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 22With the UT Administration going hard against overcharging by private hospitals, the latter have demanded revision of charges for Covid treatment.The helpline set up by the Administration against the fleecing of Covid patients by private hospitals has so far received 14 complaints and the authorities have initiated investigation into these.As per the complaints, the private hospitals were allegedly charging extra for oxygen and medicines even as these were part of the package notified by the UT Administration on April 24.A UT health official said private hospitals did not raise the issue of “unjust charges” notified by the Administration earlier. “They have raised their voice only when inspections have started after a month of notification,” said the official.According to private hospitals, the UT’s charges per patient per day are meagre in comparison to the expenses incurred by them.“Critical Covid-19 patients who are on high oxygen support consume around six-seven cylinders a day, which comes to around Rs4,000-Rs5,000. The cost of commonly used medicines, equipment (ventilator, Bi-PAP, oxygen flow meter, etc) and consumables like gloves, masks, PPE kits, etc, has doubled owing to the shortage and profiteering, thus increasing our cost significantly,” reads a representation submitted by the city’s private healthcare institutes.“The packages specified by the Administration have no capping on the expense of oxygen, medicines, lab investigation and other consumables. In many cases, the actual cost to the hospital on the above is more than the permitted package per day,” it added.The hospitals also raised the issue of fleecing by private oxygen vendors as they were charged extra amounts over and above the permitted charge and no receipts were being issued for the excess amount. Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, Director Health Services, UT, said: “The issue will be flagged at the higher level and revision of rates will be decided by the higher authorities.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/revise-covid-treatment-charges-say-hospitals-257095
23-05-2021||Naina Mishra||Centre allocates city only 50 doses of anti-fungal drug||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 22Centre has sanctioned only 50 doses of amphotericin- B, a key drug to treat mucormycosis or ‘black fungus’ to Chandigarh.The doses will not suffice for the patients admitted in various hospitals of the city. Each patient of mucormycosis requires more than 100 doses to combat the fungal infection. The local hospitals have also been sharing the existing stocks. The PGI provided the GMCH with 50 vials on Saturday evening, officials said. The PGI has been sent a separate stock of amphotericin-B by the Centre.The patients’ families in the city are still scrambling for the anti-fungal drug. Firoz Khan, the attendant of a patient who has been admitted to the PGI, said: “I have been given a slip by the doctors for this injection but I am not able to procure it anywhere in the city.”The Union Minister of Chemicals and Fertilisers, DV Sadananda Gowda, today announced an allocation of 23,680 additional vials of the drug to various states and Union Territories.Dr Jagat Ram, Director of PGI, said there were more than 35 cases of mucormycosis patients admitted to the hospital, of which 24 were covid positive and 11 non-Covid patients.“A lot of mucormycosis patients are Covid positive, diabetic and immunocompromised. Such patients have been the victim of indiscriminate use of steroids. Even after discharge, many patients develop mucormycosis. There is a need to control the sugar levels of patients who have received steroids during Covid treatment. We have to stop the formation of fungus in patients by ensuring that there is no indiscriminate use of steroids in Covid patients,” said Prof Jagat Ram. Principal Health Secretary Arun Gupta said the city was facing a shortage of anti-fungal drug. “The UT Administration has placed the order of 2,000 doses of amphotericin-B with a private company to meet the shortage of anti-fungal drug in the city,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/centre-allocates-city-only-50-doses-of-anti-fungal-drug-257097

It will provide a relatively safer environment for indoor activities during the current pandemic.The ultraviolet (UV) light-based system can be used in auditoriums, large conference rooms, classrooms, malls and other public places. It will provide a relatively safer environment for indoor activities during the current pandemic.UV light deactivates over 99 per cent of viruses, bacteria, fungus and other bio-aerosols using the appropriate dosages of the light. The use of UV light may also help in ameliorating the fungal infections being witnessed during the current wave of the pandemic.It has been developed according to the requirements for deactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virus contained in an aerosol with necessary ventilation measures, necessary safety and user guidelines and tested bio-safety standards.Airborne transmission is considered a major risk in indoor settings by international agencies as well as health authorities in several countries. Significantly, a research by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research’s Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and Institute of Microbial Technology last year had demonstrated experimentally that SARS-CoV-2 viral particles could be detected in air even two hours after the exit of infected persons from a room and at distances much greater than a few metres.Based on these studies and recognising the need for effective solutions of viral disinfection, the challenge was to develop an effective retrofit device with high intensities to handle fast airflows that could be fitted with minimal intervention in air ducts of existing HVAC systems used in indoor industrial and commercial environment.The CSIO’s system has been tested for more than 99 per cent disinfection and could be used as a retrofit solution in air handling units of buildings and transport vehicles besides having other spin-off applications. The UV light is energy efficient, improves airflow through coils, enhances indoor air quality, requires less maintenance, is easy to retrofit with existing system having AHU ducts and has low initial set-up cost. The system comes with commercialised standards and certifications.Prof S Anantha Ramakrishna, Director, CSIO, said this technology, developed by the Fabrionics Division led by Dr Harry Garg, was now available for deployment throughout the country as the technology for its commercial production had been transferred to 28 companies located in different states.Installation of UV-based solutions might boost people’s confidence and facilitate return to workplaces, public transport and educational institutions as and when appropriate guidelines were issued by the government, added Prof Ramakrishna.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/csio-develops-system-to-counter-airborne-transmission-of-covid-19-257101

23-05-2021||---||HC sets aside retirement of asst professors at 60||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 22In a significant judgment, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the law made by the legislature will prevail in case of conflict with the rules framed under Article 309 of the Constitution.The ruling came as a Division Bench set aside the action of retiring assistant professors serving in the Government College of Arts and Government College of Architecture in Chandigarh at the age of 60.The Bench of Justice Augustine George Masih and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma was listening to a petition on whether the notification — Conditions of Services of Union Territory of Chandigarh Employees Rules, 1992, issued under proviso to Article 309, would hold the field even if it was in conflict with the AICTE Regulations, 2010 and 2019.Dr Jogender Pal Singh and other petitioners stated that the Union of India and other respondents were wrongly retiring the petitioners from service by giving effect to the 1992 rules, which came into effect vide the notification dated January 13, 1992, issued by the President in exercise of powers conferred by the proviso to Article 309.Senior advocate Rajiv Atma Ram with Arjun Partap Atma Ram argued on the petitioners’ behalf that the age of superannuation was 58 as per the 1992 rules. But the AICTE regulations, entitling the petitioners to continue till 65 with further extension up to 70, would apply.The Bench made it clear that the proviso to Article 309 was only a temporary or stop-gap arrangement till provision was made by, or under, an Act regulating recruitment and service conditions.The life of the rules framed under proviso to Article 309 was limited and governed the service conditions of the employees till relevant statutory provisions of the Act, and/or the rules or regulations framed there under, came into force. As such, the AICTE Regulations 2010/2019 and Architecture Regulations 2017 would apply in case of conflict with the 1992 Rules, the Bench observed.It added the two colleges being run by the UT Administration, were imparting education in the field of ‘applied arts and crafts’ and ‘architecture’, as such, these would fall within the definition of technical institution. Hence, the AICTE regulations and the Architecture regulations would be applicable to the faculty of these colleges.The Bench further stated that the services of the petitioners were governed by the AICTE regulations, according to which, the age of superannuation would be 65, with provision for five year extension subject to requirements of the regulations.“The action of the respondents in declining the representations/claim of the petitioners for continuing them in service till the age of 65 years as per the AICTE regulations/Architecture regulations is unsustainable….,” the Bench asserted and directed that the petitioners – assistant professors – should be reinstated they shall be entitled to all consequential benefits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/hc-sets-aside-retirement-of-asst-professors-at-60-257106
