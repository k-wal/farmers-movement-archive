The rest 20 MT oxygen is for government hospitals of the UT Administration and all private hospital.Hospitals scramble for meeting requirementThe UT Administration had requested the Centre to raise its oxygen quota from 20 MT to 35 MT. Now, even the PGI has requested the Centre to increase its quota of liquid medical oxygen gas to 40 MT. Of 20 MT quota of oxygen, about 17 MT is directly used at the GMCH-32, GMSH-16 and the hospital in Sector 48. The remaining about 3 MT oxygen is given to a private vendor in Dera Bassi to refill oxygen cylinders of the government hospitals of the UT Administration and private hospitals of Chandigarh.The UT Administration had requested the Centre to raise its oxygen quota from 20 MT to 35 MT. Now, even the PGI has requested the Centre to increase its quota of liquid medical oxygen gas to 40 MT.Chandigarh, with a daily requirement of 35 MT of oxygen, is barely able to manage with only 20 MT capacity. There is a scramble for meeting the daily requirement of three government hospitals and seven private hospitals of the UT.The two oxygen plants set up at the hospitals of the UT are only able to meet 25 per cent oxygen requirement.Of 20 MT quota of oxygen, about 17 MT is directly used at the GMCH-32, GMSH-16 and the hospital in Sector 48. The remaining about 3 MT oxygen is given to a private vendor in Derabassi to refill oxygen cylinders of the government hospitals of the UT Administration and private hospitals of Chandigarh.With the PGI now expressing helplessness in procuring adequate oxygen, the UT Administration has started giving 60-70 B type cylinders from its own quota to the PGI.The daily consumption of liquid oxygen (LMO) of the PGI has reached approximately 22 MT and is being barely managed by an oxygen plant in Uttarakhand. In addition to this, the PGI is also using 50-60 D type cylinders and 60-70 B type cylinders. The institute has four liquid oxygen storage tanks of 44 KL capacity.As pointed out by the institute, non-cooperation of state governments is the bone of contention in making adequate supply of oxygen. “As an interim arrangement, the institute has now started supplying liquid oxygen to wards where Covid patients are admitted to reduce the dependency on oxygen cylinders,” said an official of the PGI.Requested Centre again, says ParidaThe UT Adviser, Manoj Parida, said: “We have requested the Centre again today to increase 10 MT immediately. We have been giving PGI some cylinders from Derabassi plant. Chief Secretaries of both Punjab and Haryana are coming tomorrow and we will take up the issue with them.

But oblivious to the fact, hostellers continue to protest, they said.In the evening, during curfew hours, a large number of students protested outside the wardens’ residences.PU officials said the Chandigarh Police was informed about the incident, but instead of managing the situation, the personnel started questioning the authorities.“We are complying with the UT Administration’s order but the Chandigarh Police are not helping us,” said an official, requesting anonymity.“Hundreds of students gathered outside wardens’ homes and continuously rang the doorbell. What kind of a protest is this? The students were furious after the wardens were asked to call their parents,” said the official.“A number of cases have been reported from hostels. It can be fatal for both students and authorities. Libraries are shut, non-essential shops are closed, classes are being held online, then for what reason students want to stay here?” the official asked.“The students are mature enough to understand the value of life and the impact this virus is having on people. We will once again approach the UT Administration and again request the students to leave for their respective homes,” the official added.‘Stop calling parents’Meanwhile, protesting research scholars submitted a representation to the PU Vice-Chancellor, asking the authorities to stop calling their parents.“The students/research scholars of PU demand repeal of arbitrary notice/order of vacating hostels. Please don’t call our parents and guides. It’s an unfortunate method used by the PU authorities,” read a letter signed by representatives of various student groups.“We demand proper access to libraries and labs by strictly following SOPs. If university is to be vacated, then the residential area must be vacated, considering the first step. We request to stop harassing the students,” it added.SFS, ABVP extend supportLeaving no opportunity to encash the situation, student organisations like SFS and ABVP jumped in support of protesting students.“From the past few days, students are being harassed constantly. Some of them were made to vacate hostels forcefully. They are being pressurised through their respective guides and phone calls are being made to their homes,” stated an SFS release.The ABVP activists also justified the protest.“The administration has pressured and psychologically harassed students to vacate their hostels. In this critical time, students are constantly forced to comply with the orders of their respective hostel wardens and supervisors,” ABVP stated in a release.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/panjab-varsity-authorities-in-a-fix-as-students-refuse-to-leave-hostels-251013

He was very active and his love for greens and landscaping was unending. He co-authored two books – Tress in Urban Habitat and Landscaping Human Habitat,” said his son and golfer Ajaipal.Hardial’s other son, Amandeep Johl, is also a golfer and a certified teacher.“We all play golf, including my mother (Gurbrinder K Johl),” said Ajaipal.Hardial worked to create UT’s landscape under MS Randhawa, the first Chief Commissioner of Chandigarh.He started his career as a landscape designer at Pinjore’s Mughal Gardens and worked in Chandigarh for over two decades before shouldering the responsibility of landscape advisor to the Punjab Urban Development Authority.In an interview to The Tribune in 2016, Hardial had raised concerns over lack of trees, drainage at lawns and planting potted plants at congested places.His love for greens was evident from what he said. “Technically there should have been one species of trees, 37 kinds have been planted. The entire city can easily take the shape of a park, only if we have a complete and separate department of horticulture.”“To develop a drainage system, there’s a need to develop 12-inch layer of bajri, so that the excess water is drained out. Rest, the lawn should contain 70 per cent of coarse sand, 20 per cent of oil and 10 per cent of organic manure,” he had said during the interview.“Closed apartments or small houses should focus on potted plants, bonsai, and space and size appropriate creepers,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/landscapist-johl-lived-with-passion-till-his-last-breath-251014

Despite whatsoever pressure the health facilities were facing, administration could not ignore patients’ complaints.Dayalan reiterated that patients should may not be refused admission for want of an ICU bed.

Dera Bassi SDM Kuldeep Bawa met the traders’ community in Zirakpur and Dera Bassi to streamline the process and implement it effectively. — TNSDayalan said the Punjab government and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, had laid out detailed protocols for treatment of critical care patients and the procedure being followed was more or less uniform at all L3 facilities. So, changing critical care facility without any rhyme or reason would add to undue pressure on hospitals and might also put the patient in jeopardy.Dayalan said there was an exponential increase in the number of Covid patients from Punjab and outside the state who were under hospitalisation in Mohali district. So, there was a need to optimise the available resources to ensure that lives could be saved and patients were treated with the best possible outcome.
