The directions came after senior advocate Ashwani Kumar Chopra and Akshit Chaudhary told the Bench that the process had been expedited even though people were dying because of the second wave of Covid. Directions were also sought for staying the operation of a document in this regard.The Bench, on a previous date of hearing, was told on the petitioner’s behalf that the union was aggrieved by the decision to privatise the electricity wing by selling 100 per cent stake of the government in the absence of any provision under Section 131 of the Electricity Act, 2003. The Bench was told that the process of privatisation of the electricity wing could not be initiated at all, especially when it was running in profits. The sale of 100 per cent stake was unjust and illegal as the electricity wing was revenue surplus for the past three years. It was economically efficient having transmission and distribution losses less than the target of 15 per cent as fixed by the Ministry of Power.It has also contended that the transfer scheme without calling for objections from all stakeholders could not be legally sustained and acted upon. As per Section 131(2) of the Act, the power could not be transferred to a totally private entity with no stake or control of the government.“The entire action of the respondents in privatising the electricity wing of the Engineering Department of the UT and the entire process being carried out pursuant thereto, including office memo dated June 10, the decision taken during the meeting of the privatisation of the power department/utilities held on May 12 as far as the UT, Chandigarh, is concerned and the notice inviting bids and the documents prepared in relation thereto is not only illegal, unjust, arbitrary, unconstitutional, but also in violation of the provisions and the principles of law...,” it was added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/hc-applies-brakes-to-chandigarh-power-privatisation-proceedings-260203

In a spotIn its report submitted to the Deputy Commissioner, the SDM Jagdish Sehgal-led panel had recommended an FIR against the hospital management, chief financial officer Mukesh Sharma and his son Kshitij Sharma.An FIR under Sections 188, 269, 270 of the IPC, Section 51(b), 58 of the Disaster Management Act 2005 and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 has been registered against the Mountstar Hospital management at the Phase 8 police station, said the police.Deputy Commissioner Girish Dayalan said the FIR had been lodged against the hospital after the committee headed by Mohali SDM found the hospital guilty of selling 83 vials of remdesivir on black market.In its report submitted to the Deputy Commissioner, the SDM Jagdish Sehgal-led panel had recommended an FIR against the hospital management, chief financial officer (CFO) Mukesh Sharma and his son Kshitij Sharma.Notably, the Phase 8 police station had received a secret complaint against M/s Chandigarh Healthcare Pvt Ltd and Mountstar Hospital and it’s pharmacy regarding siphoning of remdesivir injections supplied by the government for Covid patients admitted to the hospital and their unethical over-the-counter sale to unidentified persons.After receiving the complaint, a four-member committee was constituted comprising SDM Jaideep Sehgal, Deputy Superintendent of Police Deep Kamal, Senior Medical Officer Dr Vijay Bhagat and Drug Inspector Jai Singh.The committee found that the bills for the injection were issued in the name of a prominent cement manufacturing firm besides the CFO and a few doctors of the hospital.One bill was issued in the name of a woman on March 17 even as she was admitted to the hospital on March 18.Interestingly, the hospital staff in a written statement to the panel denied the purchase of remdesivir injections.Earlier, the three directors of the hospital – Deepak Tyagi, Virender Dhankhad and Dr Manoj Sharma – had accused the CFO and his son of illegally procuring remdesivir injections and selling them at a premium to patients outside the hospital.Mukesh Sharma on the other hand, alleged that the directors fabricated the documents pertaining to the drug sale to frame him.Remdesivir is provided to private hospitals at controlled rate by the state government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/fir-against-mountstar-hospital-for-unethical-sale-of-remdesivir-260212

The institutes are also permitted to generate surplus funds, which they can use for the betterment and growth of the educational institutions. However, at the same time, the institutions cannot be permitted to indulge in profiteering or charge capitation fee,” said the High Court Bench.The ruling came as a Division Bench of the High Court dismissed a bunch of petitions filed by the Independent Schools’ Association of Chandigarh, Kabir Education Society and other petitioners against the Union of India and other respondents.The Bench of Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Sant Parkash observed that the petitioners were aggrieved by a certain provision in the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institution Act, 2016, as extended to Chandigarh.Their contention was that the uploading of income and expenditure accounts, and balance sheets, on the website had no rationale. It was not incidental to the objects to be achieved by the main enactment. The schools were already submitting financial information to the authorities concerned. As such, uploading financial information on their websites was not required as it would only render private institutions vulnerable to unbridled dissection of the accounts by the public.The Bench asserted the 2016 Act extended to Chandigarh was enacted by Punjab to provide for the constitution of regulatory body to provide a mechanism for regulating fee of unaided educational institutions, besides related matters and incidental issues. Section 18 said every unaided educational institution was to maintain proper accounts of fees and charges. It also has to prepare annual statement of accounts which was to be audited by a qualified chartered accountant.After hearing senior advocate and UT standing senior counsel Pankaj Jain and rival contentions, the Bench added it was settled position that there could be no fixing of rigid fee structure. “Each institute has freedom to fix its own fee structure while taking into consideration the facilities and the infrastructure of the institute. Further the institutes are also permitted to generate surplus funds which they can use for the betterment and growth of the educational institutions. But at the same time the institutions cannot be permitted to be indulged in profiteering or charging of capitation fees”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/uploading-financial-statement-by-pvt-schools-will-ensure-transparency-hc-260215
