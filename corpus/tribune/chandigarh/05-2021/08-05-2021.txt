Rajdeep Singh is the fourth accused arrested in the case after journalist Sanjeev Mahajan, realtor Manish Gupta and Satpal Dagar.The police have arrested Rajdeep Singh, former SHO of the Sector 39 police station, on the charge of not taking any action on a complaint filed against the accused, who had allegedly forcibly occupied the house in Sector 37.As per the FIR, the accused allegedly sold a house of Rahul Mehta in Sector 37, Chandigarh, fraudulently. The police alleged that some accused confined Mehta in a room and took his signatures on papers after torturing him. Rahul Mehta was later abandoned at a stud farm in Gujarat from where he was shifted from one place to another. It is alleged that an imposter of Rahul Mehta was produced before the office of sub-registrar at the time of execution of sale deed of the house.In the bail application filed before the Session Court through Advocate Harish Bhardwaj, Inspector Rajdeep Singh said he had no concern with accused Sanjeev Mahajan, Surjit or any other person as alleged by the police and all allegations against him were imaginary and unbelievable and were a figment of imagination of the investigating agency, clouded with professional rivalry out of vengeance and reasons not linked with the alleged sale or grabbing of the house.Special public prosecutor Manu Kakkar opposed the bail by saying the accused is fully involved in the case. Kakkar claimed that Rajdeep Singh was part of the larger conspiracy hatched by all accused to grab the house. Kakkar opposed the bail by saying that had the accused acted as per the law, other alleged accused would not have succeeded in their conspiracy to grab the house. After hearing the arguments, the court dismissed the bail application of accused Rajdeep Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/suspended-chandigarh-cop-denied-bail-249604

08-05-2021||Saurabh Malik||Consider Oxygen-fitted auto ambulances in tricity: Punjab and Haryana High Court||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 7Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today asked Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh to consider the rollout of oxygen-fitted auto ambulance service for patients.The Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh also asked the two states and the UT to consider the setting up of an unified command centre for Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali “as the working and business class have their workplace or residence in either of the three cities”.As the Covid management and control case came up for resumed hearing this morning, the Bench referred to media reports on some states activating auto ambulances. “The states may ascertain veracity of such reports and consider whether such citizen-friendly exercise can be undertaken by outsourcing, if necessary,” the Bench added.Speaking for the Bench on the issue of the unified command centre, Justice Gupta asserted the three cities were now integrated as a tricity. It might be easier to tackle the present crisis in case a joint strategy was drawn up. “In a situation like the one created by the Covid-19 pandemic, the paramount consideration with the governments should be of helping every human being, irrespective of the state to which he belongs,” said Justice Gupta.Justice Gupta added parochial or other considerations should not stand in the way of better administration and implementation of the policies. It would be easier to tackle the challenges posed by the pandemic if there was a common platform to deliberate upon the strategies to be adopted. Appearing before the Bench, UT senior standing counsel Pankaj Jain and amicus curiae Rupinder Khosla pointed out that the supply of Covid-related drugs through private chemists had already been withdrawn in view of the Court’s previous order.Jain added the control and supply of drugs such as remdesivir and tocilizumab had been taken over by the Director, Health Service, Chandigarh, and hoarding, etc., had been considerably curbed.“A query has, however, been put to him whether these drugs can also be provided through a government-controlled drug centre, preferably at the GMSH-16, which is centrally located, on a payment basis against prescription, he submits that this issue shall also be examined today itself,” Justice Gupta added.Before parting with the order today, the Court appreciated the philanthropic organisations for taking upon themselves the daunting task of serving and taking care of the patients by risking their own lives.“At the same time, there are others who have acted as predators looking for an opportunity to fleece people even in this crisis. This Court gives the liberty to the states to act sternly against such culprits and take strict action,” Justice Gupta concluded.‘Act sternly against culprits’“At the same time, there are others who have acted as predators looking for an opportunity to fleece people even in this crisis. This court gives the liberty to the states to act sternly against such culprits and take strict action,” said Justice Rajan Gupta.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/consider-oxygen-fitted-auto-ambulances-in-tricity-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-249579
08-05-2021||Dushyant Singh Pundir||Amid surge, all eyes on PGI to expand Covid bed capacity in Chandigarh||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 7All eyes are on the PGI with a surge in the number of Covid patients needing hospital beds and oxygen. Though the premium institute has reserved 404 beds for the purpose, clamour for expanding the bed capacity has been growing in the city where bed shortage is beginning to impact treatment of Covid patients adversely.With more Covid patients getting critical, the UT Administration has sought the immediate intervention of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for proper utilisation of the infrastructure of the PGI.In a recent letter to the ministry, the UT stated that it was trying to tackle the crisis by enhancing the capacity of Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, and the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, and setting up mini-Covid care centres with the help of social organisations, yet the help of the PGI was urgently required.The Administration had requested the ministry to direct the PGI to enhance the number of Covid beds to at least 700, as they have nearly 2,000 beds.Manoj Parida, UT AdviserAdviserspeak We will be able to win the battle against the coronavirus only if all three medical institutions in Chandigarh work as a team. All our resources should be used optimallyMedical experts said the GMCH and the GMSH had increased their bed capacity to 564 by overstretching their resources. Since the PGI had stopped OPD services and elective surgeries, the institute should have enhanced its capacity to at least 1,000 Covid beds with 30 per cent ventilators and oxygen attached with the remaining beds, they said.With a faculty strength of nearly 400 and approximately 1,000 resident doctors, the PGI was offered Infosys Serai, located on the campus of the institute, to set up more beds there, but the institute refused to do so. However, later an NGO came forward to set up a 100-bed temporary hospital there. However, the institute stated that the Infosys Serai facility fell under the jurisdiction of the UT Administration.Prof Ashok Kumar, PGI spokespersonWhat the PGI saysDue to the second Covid surge, most patients reporting are sick/critical requiring prolonged care and oxygen/ventilator support. To create a Covid bed facility, there is a requirement of defined logistics/oxygen support as well as well-trained manpower.Amid the Covid rage, it was shocking that even the health staff of the PGI had not opted for 100 per cent vaccination and if they got infected with the virus, who would serve the patients, the experts questioned.Reacting to the allegations, Prof Ashok Kumar, official spokesperson for the PGI, said the PGI was providing care to Covid as well as non-Covid patients reporting at the institute.“At present, of the total bed strength of 2,000, 404 beds have been specifically allocated for the treatment of Covid patients. As per the available bed census, at any time there are around 350-380 Covid patients and over 1,000 non-Covid patients remain admitted to the Institute,” he said. Besides, the institute was also providing daily care to around 150 non-Covid ICU/critical patients and more than 50 different major/minor operative procedures were done. The antenatal care to pregnant women and radiotherapy care was being imparted to cancer patients on a daily basis. “Yet, with a daily rise in the number of Covid patients reporting at the institute, the number of beds is also increased accordingly,” he said.Being a premier multi-specialty institute of North India, the institute is the only care centre for the states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh for providing tertiary-level super-specialty care to non-Covid patients. Yet, the institute is doing its best within the constraints for providing care to Covid as well as non-Covid patients, he said.With a rise in the caseload, medical oxygen has been in acute shortage as the region grapples with a deadly second wave of the virus, but the PGI has failed to set up even one oxygen plant and solely depends on a private supplier, whereas the UT Administration has set up three oxygen plants during the peak of the pandemic.Kumar said at present, the daily oxygen requirement of the institute was around 20 MT and it was being met by the institute with a back-up of around two days. Besides, as an interim arrangement, the institute had in stock around 350 oxygen cylinders to provide care to the patients. The process for the installation of one more oxygen storage tank was underway and it would be done in the near future. The possibility for an independent oxygen plant for the institute was being explored.Due to the pandemic, new recruitment was not being sanctioned. Thus, to provide healthcare services to both Covid as well non-Covid patients reporting at the institute, elective planned procedures as well as new OPD services had been curtailed, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/amid-surge-all-eyes-on-pgi-to-expand-covid-bed-capacity-in-chandigarh-249582
