While the drivers will cost Rs45 lakh per year to the MC, insurance and maintenance of the vehicles will be the extra expense.The budgetary provision has already been made in the 2021-22 financial year. The matter will come up in the coming House meeting for approval. The vehicles will be used for transporting and disposing the horticulture waste lying in different parts of the city.The MC Horticulture Wing had earlier expressed inability in providing the service in a time-bound manner. It had cited lack of machinery and manpower as reasons for not being able to manage the waste.“Dry leaves are not being lifted by the MC. In different parts of the city, dumps of dry leaves can be spotted,” said RK Garg, president of the Second Innings’ Association.KS Gill, president of the RWA, Sector 21-B, said: “The horticulture waste has been lying outside houses for about one to two months and in service lanes, but is not being lifted by the MC. I even sent pictures to the Commissioner through WhatsApp, but to no avail.”“When the monsoon arrives, the waste may clog sewerage. Even service lanes in the middle of two houses may get blocked during the monsoon. The MC should have planned for their removal in advance,” he added.Councillor Devinder Singh Babla, leader of the Opposition in the MC, said: “The horticulture waste is not being properly lifted. But it will be wastage of money to buy vehicles. They should instead be taken on rent. Despite buying them, work will not be done.

Banks should be persuaded to waive interest on loan taken by the traders for a quarter and instalment should be extended for at least three months without any extra interest, said the delegation.All loses of lives and earning of traders and that of their staff must be compensated for by way of immediate relief or monthly assistance to the dependents.Charanjiv Singh said the Deputy Commissioner promised to take up the matter with the Administrator tomorrow and take the decision in consultation with senior officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/traders-want-loan-interest-rent-waived-submit-memo-255867

Raid was also conducted on a pharmaceutical plant in Baddi, and 3,000 remdesivir vials were seized.Additional and Sessions Judge Narender observed in the order that some of the suspect, who had travelled from the southern states of the country to Chandigarh, did not properly verify the fact that the manufacturer from whom they were purchasing the drug was not yet granted permission by the department concerned for supplying or selling the same in the domestic market. This shows that the intention of the applicants was not up to the mark. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/illegal-sale-of-remdesivir-chandigarh-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-five-255869

21-05-2021||Nonika Singh||Gurcharan Singh Chani: Artiste who spent his last years bringing cheer to ailing kids||Zindagi Retire Nahi Hoti”… That was one of the many delightful and meaningful plays of eminent thespian and filmmaker Gurcharan Singh Chani. Alas, the deadly Covid can force many to retire from life prematurely and Chani too succumbed to its fatal reach.National School of Drama (NSD) alumnus, though he studied theatre as deeply as his fellow students, the path he created for himself was markedly different. If as a student he was piqued by the question “theatre for whom”, as a practitioner he found an answer and decided to dedicate it to the community and stage it right in the centre of the people.Read also: As renowned theatre-person from the city Gurcharan Singh Chani loses his battle with Covid-19, his friends remember the man who spread smilesFree of all isms, his plays were for, of and certainly by the people. Non-actors, ordinary men and women became stars of his plays, where he would take a song, a line, piece of poetry, toss it around and turn it into a play.While the rich proscenium theatre that NSDians so excel in never fascinated him, rich literature certainly did. In his theatre of protest and provocation one could often hear the poetry of radical poets like Avtar Pash. Returning to Punjab during times of militancy not only required courage, but also conviction in his beliefs.As a professor of the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, he could easily have chosen an easy way out and opted for cinema as many of his contemporaries did. But not only did his home-state beckon, so did his beliefs which later became his cause celebre.Chandigarh may have been his home for the past several decades, but as the Sangeet Natak Akademi recipient became one of the city’s most notable persons, world was his oyster. His documentaries on Indian arts and heritage, encapsulating the true spirit of India’s majestic forts and more have that rare archival value. More recently, his documentary series on North-East celebrated the region’s ethnic diversity and the vigour of the land.Donning colourful turbans like an emblem, his zeal never waned. Forever a communicator, his past few years were also dedicated to bringing cheer to the ailing children. Through his numerous clowning acts, he and his “CEVA Drama Repertory Company” spread joy and laughter in children’s wards in city hospitals.Till last lockdown he believed in living in the moment and now the moment has frozen. But not that endearing smile which never left his lips, not even when nearly two decades ago he lost his mentor and teacher Balwant Gargi whose death he did not mourn but celebrated by throwing a party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/gurcharan-singh-chani-artiste-who-spent-his-last-years-bringing-cheer-to-ailing-kids-256093
21-05-2021||Chandigarh||Social acceptance of live-in relationship on rise: Punjab & Haryana HC||The Punjab and Haryana High court has granted protection to a couple who are in a live-in relationship, observing that social acceptance of such relationships is increasing.The order by Justice Sudhir Mittal, passed on Tuesday, comes days after another Bench of the high court observed in a separate case that a live-in relationship is morally and socially unacceptable.Justice Mittal’s order came in response to a petition filed by Jind-based couple Pardeep (26) and Pooja (23), their counsel, Devender Arya, said.The couple submitted that they were adults and had decided to enter into a live-in relationship after careful consideration.They alleged that Pooja’s family was against the relationship and had threatened to cause physical harm.Opposing the protection to the petitioners, the counsel representing the state of Haryana said live-in relationships are not legal and are frowned upon by the society.To this, Justice Mittal observed that the Constitution of India is the supreme law of the land, and right to life and liberty is enshrined therein and is treated as a basic feature.“The said right includes the right of an individual to full development of his/her potential in accordance with his/her choice and wish and for such purpose, he/she is entitled to choose a partner of his/her choice,” the judge observed.“The individual also has the right to formalise the relationship with the partner through marriage or to adopt the non-formal approach of a live-in relationship,” he added.The concept of live-in relationships has crept into our society from western nations, and initially, found acceptance in the metropolitan cities probably because individuals felt formalisation of a relationship through marriage was not necessary for complete fulfilment, the judge wrote in his order.“Education played a great role in development of this concept. Slowly, the concept has percolated into small towns and villages also as is evident from this petition. This shows that social acceptance for live-in relationships is on the increase,” he observed.“In law, such a relationship is not prohibited nor does it amount to commission of any offence and thus, in my considered view, such persons are entitled to equal protection of laws as any other citizen of the country,” Justice Mittal wrote in his order.However, a single Bench of Justice HS Madaan had in a May 11 order said a live-in relationship was morally and socially unacceptable, and dismissed a petition of a runaway couple from Punjab, Gulza Kumari (19) and Gurwinder Singh (22), who sought protection of their life and liberty.“As a matter of fact, the petitioners in the garb of filing the present petition are seeking seal of approval on their live-in relationship, which is morally and socially not acceptable and no protection order in the petition can be passed,” Justice Madaan had said in his order.In their petition, the couple had said they were living together and intended to get married shortly. They apprehended danger to their lives from Kumari’s parents.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/social-acceptance-of-live-in-relationship-on-rise-punjab-haryana-hc-255849
