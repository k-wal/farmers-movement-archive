We have asked them to refund the excess money taken from all patients. We are deliberating legal ways to pursue this matter as well.A majority of the complaints have been filed against Eden Hospital, Industrial Area.“As per the complaints, Eden Hospital has been charging Rs9,600 extra per day for oxygen. Attendants had arranged oxygen cylinders from outside but still the patients were charged for oxygen,” said Dr Charu Singla, nodal officer to keep check on the charges levied by private hospitals on Covid patients.During inspection visits to private hospitals in the city by a team of UT health officials on Monday, the records of bills and rates charged from Covid patients were checked. “We checked the records of private hospitals and found various anomalies in the charges. We have asked them to refund the excess money taken from all patients. We are deliberating legal ways to pursue this matter as well,” said Dr Singla.Eden Hospital procured remdesivir for Rs1,300 from the UT Administration and charged Rs4,000 for the same drug from patients.Dr Singla said Chandigarh City Hospital had fixed Rs20,000 per day as charges for very severe Covid patients, whereas the rate fixed by the government was Rs16,500 per day. Attendants also complained that the hospitals even charged over and above the structure fixed by them. It has also been found that some hospitals were asking for Rs50,000 in advance as the minimum ICU admission fee.The rates issued by the UT Administration for private hospital beds are inclusive as a package, which include cost of medical care of underlying comorbid conditions such as supportive care (oxygen) and cost of medication for the duration of the Covid treatment. As many Covid patients have conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular problems, the charges for medical care of such comorbidities are part of the package.The package fixed by the UT Administration also includes doctor’s consultation fee and investigation charges, including imaging. Drugs such as remdesivir and tocilizumab are not part of the package.Dr Sanjay Bansal of Eden Hospital said, “We are able to procure oxygen from private vendors at a very high rate, between Rs800 and Rs1,000. The package is not feasible if out of Rs16,500, we spend Rs5,000-Rs6,000 on oxygen. We have to recover the cost as well.”Meanwhile, the UT Health Department has given private hospitals two days to display rates on the premises so that these are visible to patients’ families. The Health Department also directed hospitals to initiate the process of refund to patients who were charge extra.In a representation to the Director, Health Services, UT, private hospitals stated that critical Covid-19 patients, who are on high oxygen support, consume six-seven cylinders of oxygen a day, which comes to around Rs5,000. “The rate given by the government, Rs14,000, is not enough. The rate of medical oxygen though has been fixed at Rs295 plus GST for D-type cylinder, hospitals are getting cylinders for Rs600 to Rs1,000,” read the letter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/private-hospitals-fleecing-covid-patients-complaints-pour-in-chandigarh-255423

Most of the food and beverages outlets in the city are temporarily closed and if some relief package is not extended, they might permanently shut shop,” said Ankit Gupta, president of Chandigarh Hospitality Association and joint secretary of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Northern India.Gupta said they had also written to UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore requesting for some relief package for the industry.Their demands in the relief package were waiver of ground rent and property tax for the financial year 2021-22, deferment of electricity charges along with request for industrial tariff, exemption of VAT and assessment fee, tourism survival package and creation of a Covid relief fund (through ESI) for payment of salaries.Keeping in view a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in the city, the UT Administration had decided to impose corona curfew in the city from 5 am on May 4 to break the chain of Covid transmission. However, after discussions with medical experts, Badnore on May 17 decided to extend the corona curfew for another week, from 5 am on May 18 to 5 am on May 25, so that the gain of number of Covid-19 cases coming down steadily due to the restrictions imposed under the curfew was not wasted.Expressing similar views, Manmohan Singh, president, Hotels Association, Chandigarh, said: “The hospitality industry is on the brink of collapse and much more than the promoters, it’s our workmen who are going to face total joblessness and scarcity of resources because service industry does not only comprise of the promoters but largely of workmen. The ratio of workmen in service industry is the highest for performance of business.”He said they very well understand that life is very important over livelihood, but a middle path should be found for coexistence.Another hotelier said the Administration should focus on vaccination instead of imposing corona curfew, as it would sound death knell to their business. They would not be able to bear the loss of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, as they were yet to recover from the previous lockdown, he addedMeanwhile, the Administrator had asked the Deputy Commissioner to meet the representatives of various traders, market associations and industry associations to solicit their views and suggestions regarding relief that could be provided to them due to loss suffered in the shut-down.Their demands||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/hotel-industry-in-chandigarh-on-brink-of-collapse-255487

If a firm does not follow the rules and deposit the fee, its connections should be snapped.Goyal said the MC had not charged the annual renewal fee for mobile towers from companies. He said the city had mobile towers of about 290 different companies, but MC officials had neither collected the fee from towers nor taken any action against them.Goyal said mobile towers were causing revenue loss to the MC. “If they do not follow the criteria set by the MC, it can lead to a mishap, threatening the lives of people besides causing damage to public property,” he said. He said if a company did not follow the rules and deposit the fee, its connections should be snapped.The Mayor asked Deputy Municipal Commissioner Aman Dhanda and Corporation Planner Advisor Swati Anand to prepare a complete record of the mobile towers and issue notices immediately to the companies and collect the outstanding fee and charges.He also instructed Deputy Municipal Commissioner Deepak Sura to issue fire NOCs to residential, schools and commercial buildings so that the Municipal Corporation could generate revenue.Joint Commissioner Sanyam Garg, Deputy Municipal Commissioners Deepak Sura and Aman Danda, Superintending Engineer Vijay Goel, Executive Engineers Sanjeev Kumar and Ankit Lohan, Consultant Corporation Planner Swati Anand, Assistant Architect Lavika, CSI Sadhu Ram, Section Officer Amarjeet Singh and Anil Rohila were among those present at the meeting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/panchkula-municipal-corporation-to-snap-mobile-tower-connection-of-defaulting-firms-255528

Why are others being left behind? There are a lot of workers who have dedicated a lot of time to this party. They were a part of every protest, faced lathicharge and were arrested,” wrote the former president of the Congress’ Chandigarh unit.“Today the party is being guided and controlled as per the wishes of one person and absolutely arbitrarily. President Subash Chawla must be made answerable for this,” he wrote.“Just like the rest of the country, Chandigarh is also equally suffering because of the pandemic. Towards the end of this year there are municipal corporation elections, this is the time where the party should stand united and work hard,” Chhabra added.“I had asked partymen to invite all. I will check how and why someone has been left,” said Chawla. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/not-invited-to-virtual-meeting-congress-leaders-write-to-harish-rawat-255530
