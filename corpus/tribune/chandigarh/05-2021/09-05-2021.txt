As per their direction, we will be unable to supply medical oxygen gas in ‘B’ type cylinders to you till further instructions,” read the letter.Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for oxygen supplies in UT, said, “Despite clear instructions to the vendor, it was observed that some of the cylinders from the PGIMER were being filled without any permission from the UT Administration.”“The vendor was directed to use the 20 MT oxygen quota for specific hospitals only. For filling of cylinders from PGI, oxygen may be supplied by the PGIMER out of its exclusive quota of 20 MT,” said Garg.A PGI spokesperson said, “Considering the Covid-19 patient load here in PGIMER and incessantly increasing demand for medical oxygen, this kind of directive can lead to panic.”Chandigarh has been assigned a quota of 40 MT oxygen, which includes 20 MT oxygen exclusively for PGI. About 17 MT oxygen is directly used at GMCH-32, GMSH-16 and Sector 48 hospital and remaining 3 MT is given to a private vendor in Dera Bassi to refill cylinders for government hospitals under the UT and private hospitals.‘Increase quota to 40 MT’The PGI has written to UT Adviser Manoj Parida to forward its request of increasing medical oxygen quota to 40 MT daily in view of a manifold increase in patient load.The request was forwarded to the Secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, GOI, by the UT Administration.A letter written by PGI Director Prof Jagat Ram read: “I wish to bring to your notice that about 1,886 indoor patients, including 194 in ICU and 277 in emergency, Covid as well as non-Covid requiring oxygen support, are admitted to different wards of the institute.”“Due to an increase in the number of patients arriving to the PGI emergency over the past few days, the consumption of oxygen has increased tremendously,” he said.“At present, 20 MT of liquid medical oxygen is allocated and we are already consuming it. Going by the present trend, this is going to further increase rapidly. To cope up with the increasing rush of Covid patients, the institute will require more liquid medical oxygen for treating these critical patients,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/cant-increase-covid-beds-pgi-250042

As several private hospitals were consuming medical oxygen in excess quantities, an inspection done by a health team of the UT found that a private hospital was taking about 400 cylinders per day while another hospital of almost the same capacity was consuming about 90 cylinders only.“The consumption of each of the private hospitals was examined with regard to its capacity and beds reserved for Covid patients. Senior doctors from the government hospitals could not analyse and find out the possible reasons for such an abnormal consumption of medical oxygen by that private hospital. According to them, it seems almost impossible to consume such quantity of oxygen even when all patients were on ventilator,” said Yashpal Garg, Nodal Officer for Oxygen Supplies in UT.The issue has now been taken seriously and it has been decided that a detailed inquiry be carried out in this regard. Garg said appropriate actions would be taken against the hospital authorities, in accordance with the findings of the inquiry.It has also been decided that a team of senior doctors of the GMCH-32 and GMSH-16 will visit private hospitals and government hospitals next week. The purpose of the visit will be to educate and sensitise the hospital authorities to optimum utilisation of medical oxygen, which is a precious commodity.According to senior doctors, some of the reasons for wastage can be a leak in oxygen pipelines and outlets, valves left open, masks not fitted properly on patients or incorrect flow of oxygen.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/hospital-overdraws-oxygen-in-spot-250048

The reason for heightened security was two incidents where some influential persons, who were not eligible, pressurised a vendor to get oxygen cylinders.According to an official statement of UT, “A senior PCS officer has been deputed to see the supply of oxygen to private hospitals and the daily quota has been fixed for each of the private hospitals in Chandigarh. Each of the private hospitals has been attached with either of the private vendors to avoid confusion and regulate the actual supply in a better way.”The administration is also making efforts to have some backup arrangements from Punjab/Haryana to get oxygen on a loan basis, in case of any crisis.Meanwhile, the voluntary organisations that have come forward to set up mini-Covid centres have been requested to make their own arrangements for oxygen through concentrators.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-beefs-up-security-at-baddi-oxygen-plant-250051

He also expressed concern at the pace of constructions being carried out in violation of law, which was changing the shape of "the city of beauty" internationally known for its architecture and urban design."As the special leave petition is filed against an order of adjournment by recording the statement of the standing counsel for the UT, Chandigarh, we are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the High Court. However, we are of the opinion that the writ petition does not brook any further delay in view of its importance…," the Bench asserted while dismissing the special leave petition.The Sarin foundation was set up in 1995 in memory of senior advocate Harbans Lal Sarin and his son Ranjit Lal Sarin. Former Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court, Justice SS Sodhi, is its president.Senior advocate and the foundation's secretary-general Manmohan Lal Sarin had told the High Court during the course of hearing that one could convert Chandigarh into Delhi. But Delhi could never be converted into Chandigarh.The petition was filed before the High Court for directions to restrain the UT and its respondent-functionaries from permitting residential plots to be converted into apartments.The HC Bench had asked for the details of the policy on disposal of properties in Chandigarh. "A subsequent vendee of a co-sharer cannot take possession till partition; and that is the crux of the matter before the Court," the Bench said. "UT does not allow partition". The Bench had said increasing dwelling units too was not without problems, such as pressure on infrastructure, sewerage and car parking.‘Plea brooks no further delay’“As the special leave petition is filed against an order of adjournment by recording the statement of the standing counsel for the UT, Chandigarh, we are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the High Court. However, we are of the opinion that the writ petition does not brook any further delay in view of its importance…,” the SC Bench asserted while dismissing the special leave petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/supreme-court-sets-deadline-for-high-court-to-decide-250053

Even the district administration is banking on it heavily.A ventilator facility for a construction worker would be a wishful thinking — there is none in any of the government-run hospitals in the district — even the chance of getting access to a hospital bed is hopelessly faint for commoners these days.Their only protection against the virus is a mask. “It is not easy to do menial work with a mask on. But the employers insist, so we have to wear it. Nobody wants to lose a job these days,” said Bhanumati, a housemaid in an upscale housing society in Sohana. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/in-mohali-they-see-threat-in-lockdown-not-virus-250054
