At places, they were involved in the standoff for 17 to 20 hours throughout the intervening nights.The ITBP troops not only effectively used shields to protect themselves, but also responded fiercely to PLA advancing troops and brought the situation under control, he had said, while announcing the names of 21 personnel for gallantry awards for their action during faceoffs and skirmishes with Chinese troops in May-June 2020 along the Himalayan frontier.The stand-off between the two nations in Ladakh is continuing for the past seven months after China unilaterally attempted to change the status quo along the LAC and deployed a large number of troops in the region.This action was mirrored by the Indian side and despite several rounds of talks between commanders of both sides, there are no visible signs of de-escalation.Ane-La, Chip-Chap, Rango, Yula, Mukhpri, Daulat, Charding, Srijap, Chung-Thung, Chang-Chenmo, Imis, Sultan-Chusku and Khardungi are other names approved for the pups.These are border posts and other locations in the vicinity of the LAC.About three months ago, two ITBP bitches, Olga and Oleshya had given birth to 17 pups that were sired by another ITBP dog, Gala. All three canines, of the Malinois breed, are veterans of counter-insurgency and Anti-Naxal operations.ITBP was the first Force to deploy Malinois dogs in left-wing extremism hit areas a decade ago, and now they have also started scientifically breeding K9s to meet own demands and provide pups to other CAPFs and state police forces as mandated by the Ministry of Home Affairs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/itbp-names-its-new-born-k-9-warriors-after-flash-points-along-lac-in-ladakh-179894

Another test being conducted among the donors is to find IgG antibody against covid titre of 1:640.‚ÄùProf Ram added, ‚ÄúThe rationale behind the change in protocol is to prevent malpractice and inappropriate use of plasma donation. The available literature also suggests that the plasma units given in a specified concentration of antibodies were more useful in covid-19 patients.‚Äù‚ÄúIt is speculated that convalescent plasma having a low concentration of specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 may be less beneficial for treating COVID-19 patients as compared to plasma with a high concentration of such antibodies,‚Äù said ICMR advisory.The PLACID Trial (in which PGI was also a trial site) published in British Medical Journal also suggested that there was potentially no benefit of convalescent plasma collected from young survivors of mild covid-19 and administered to elderly patients with moderate or severe disease who have a robust antibody response. As per the study, symptomatic patients had higher antibody positivity and median neutralizing antibody titres than the donors of convalescent plasma.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/covid-pgi-to-check-antibody-concentration-in-plasma-donors-for-cpt-179866

Going by this, we have decided that our affiliated schools will adopt a fee hike of 8 per cent for the upcoming session,‚Äù said HS Mamik, president, ISA.As per the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, 2016, the increase in the fee should not exceed eight per cent than the fee that was being charged for the previous session. If any unaided educational institution contravenes the provisions of the Act, it is punishable with a fine. ‚ÄúThe Administration has already restricted us to charging only the tuition fee and in such a case, the schools did not want to take any decision on their own,‚Äù said a source.Many schools have opted not to reveal their fee structure as they started the process of issuing and receiving admission forms of entry-level classes from today.The step was taken as the schools wanted to know about the UT Administration‚Äôs take on the fee hike so as to avoid any kind of hassle in future.Earlier on Tuesday, the ISA had submitted a representation to the Administration stating ‚ÄúAs you are aware the Chandigarh Fee Control Act allows the schools to increase the fee by eight per cent every year. However, as per the directions of the Administration, schools had not increased the fee for 2020-21. Now the question arises whether the schools will be permitted to increase their fee for the 2021-22 session up to 16 per cent (i.e. 8 per cent for 2020-21 plus 8 per cent for 2021-22) or only eight per cent?‚ÄùCharging full feeThe schools are now awaiting clarity on charging the full fee from students. ‚ÄúWe have been already demanding that the Administration should allow us charging full fee since everything is open now. As we have decided on eight per cent fee hike, we now demand that we should be allowed charging the full fee. Otherwise, things would be back to square one,‚Äù said the head of a local school.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-schools-to-go-in-for-8-per-cent-fee-hike-179762

It was found that 77 per cent of the samples were adulterated with sugar syrup. Of the 22 samples checked, only five passed all tests.Vishal Dhiman, a resident of Sector 15, who has been a regular consumer of honey for the past several years, said he felt cheated when he came to know that the brand he had been buying was also in the list of those adulterating the product.Another city resident Mandeep Kaur, who has been consuming honey during the pandemic to build immunity against Covid, said if honey was adulterated with sugar syrup, it would have added to the body fat, thus defeating the purpose of consuming it.Gurpreet, a Sector 42 resident, claimed that he gained weight during the lockdown following which he started consuming honey for weight loss.

There are few such CT scan machines in India, he said.The benefitsThe machine allows a cardiac CT to be done in a fraction of a second ‚Äî within a single heart beat‚Äî and without the need for any ‚Äúbeta blockers‚Äù to the patient to reduce their heart rate, he said.It will be beneficial to patients who are critically ill, trauma cases and small children who have difficulty in holding their breath. ‚ÄúWith this machine, holding the breath is literally not necessary in most of the critical cases, and the resultant images are of a very high quality, without any motion-induced artifacts,‚Äù said Professor Sandhu.This CT scanner drastically reduces the quantum of X-ray radiation to the patient and also reduces the amount of contrast media required to be injected into patients. With these advantages, the CT examination would now be more ‚Äúkidney friendly‚Äù as a very low volume of contrast would be required to be injected into the patients, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/pgi-gets-state-of-the-art-ct-scan-machine-179634

The deceased, Kamlesh, and Davinder Kumar were working and staying at Royal Park Resort. Kamlesh‚Äôs body was charred and mutilated after coming in contact with a 11,000 volt power line. The incident took place when the victim was having lunch while sitting on a railing. He lost the balance and touched the wires.Sub-Inspector Rajesh Chauhan said the police had recorded a statement of the victim‚Äôs family under Section 174 of the CrPC.On October 28, a seven-year-old girl in Anand Vihar of Baltana had come in contact with a high-tension wire while playing with her friends in the balcony of the first floor of her house. She had to be taken to the PGI.Anand Vihar residents alleged that in many colonies of Baltana, power lines were running directly over the road or dangerously close to the buildings.In the past, fatalities due to electrocution have been reported from Krishna Enclave, Motia City and the Peer Muchalla area also.‚ÄúColonisers know how to raise buildings without caring about violations. Neither PSPCL nor Municipal Council officials are held accountable. Due to the lack of any formal complaint, the police investigate cases of electrocution under Section 174 of the CrPC, and the matter ends there only,‚Äù said a Baltana resident not wishing to be named.PSPCL officials said power lines were running over the main road, which was an aberration, but also pointed out that there were numerous illegal and unauthorised colonies raised by fly-by-night colonisers. ‚ÄúNobody allows a pole with high-tension wire to be erected near his house. The electricity lines were laid long before the building came up. It is the construction activity that is going on mindlessly,‚Äù said a PSPCL junior engineer posted in Baltana.In 2016, seven persons died due to electrocution while in 2017 two persons had lost their lives. Not only high-tension wires, naked wires hanging loose are a common site in several areas of the town.The possible solution to the problem lies in underground cabling of power lines but it looks like a distant dream. In 2017, the Municipal Council had mooted a project for underground cabling in some parts of the town but there has been no headway in the project.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/officials-make-light-of-high-tension-wires-near-houses-179056

The university has instead decided to go ahead with  admission to its five-year law course on the basis of marks obtained in Class XII considering the Covid-19 situation. The university authorities on October 2 scrapped the entrance examination for the five-year integrated course and the three-year law course for the 2020-21 session. Assailing the November 16 verdict of the High Court, petitioner Shruti Nayar contended that the university scrapped the UGLAW ‚Äúwrongly and illegally‚Äù and in violation of principles of natural justice. To go for admissions based on Class XII examination results only was arbitrary and liable to be set aside.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/student-moves-sc-against-scrapping-of-law-entrance-test-by-pu-179068

Some sub-committees did not meet even once during the year exhibiting their lack of concern.Barely any proposal by 12 sub-panels, including the ones for sanitation, electricity, road, environment and city beautification, women empowerment and enforcement, was brought to the Finance and Contract Committee or MC‚Äôs General House meeting for approval.‚ÄúThese are the reasons behind the MC‚Äôs failure.

However, senior advocate Rajinder Kumar Chhibbar was different. The number of cases he won, and the justice he ensured for people, and society, was just one aspect of the incredible success story he scripted for himself.His real accomplishment lay in the way he lived his life to the fullest. His office and days were filled with law books, and thoughts with poetry. The way he mingled the two at times was remarkable. He was always solemn about the cases he handled. However, he had the ability of bringing Mirza Ghalib in, while explaining the intricacies of constitutional law to his friends, who visited him for new insights.He Lived life to the fullestHis real accomplishment lay in the way he lived his life to the fullest. His office and days were filled with law books, and thoughts with poetry. The way he mingled the two at times was remarkable.His never-ending zeal and exuberance was contagious and his aptitude to value the richness of human experience was remarkable. He was a gentleman, who loved Urdu shayari and appreciated relationships.You could not come out of his house without savouring hospitality and new Urdu words, if you were his friend. Having a penchant for perfection, it was obvious that your pronunciation of words was required to be perfect. Like a teacher who refuses to gives up, Chhibbar would make you repeat the word till he was satisfied with the pronunciation.His inclination for excellence was also reflected in his work. It was no less even in cases where only social cause was involved. Chhibbar was not holding anyone‚Äôs brief when he appeared before the Punjab and Haryana High Court for safeguarding the legacy of Seth Bhagirath Dass.The senior advocate had willed that his property be put to use for charitable and educational purposes. Chhibbar was initially representing an applicant in the matter. However, during the course of the proceedings, the applicant died, and Chhibbar was left without instructions.But Chhibbar continued to appear ‚Äúas a member of the general public‚Äù, as the masses were ‚Äúthe beneficiary under the will‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhen I joined the practice, Seth Bhagirath Dass was the High Court Bar Association president. How could I let his legacy crumble?‚Äù Chhibbar said after the conclusion of the hearing in the matter.Chhibbar had the rare distinction of being a senior advocate for more than three decades. In fact, Chhibbar was a part of the Punjab and Haryana High Court since 1962 and was designated senior in 1989. His son, Anand Chhibbar, too, is a designated senior lawyer.Young at 87, senior Chhibbar passed away this morning. For many, his demise was nothing less than the goodbye of a teacher.
