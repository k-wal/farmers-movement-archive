16-11-2020||How to check pollution & prevent 2nd covid wave?||Shun complacency, be cautious||Follow thumb rule to control spreadPeople are not following guidelines issued to control the spread of Covid -19 pandemic. It is utmost important to follow the thumb rule i.e. sanitise hands, wear mask and keep social distance (2 gaj ki duri) at public places. Further, NGOs/RWAs must educate people to control the spread of virus. There is no other cure except to follow the thumb rule.Col TBS Bedi (retd), MohaliMonitor air quality regularlyThe authorities have become complacent about challaning violators, who do not wear masks or maintain social distance. In this festive time during winters, social distancing at shops, public places and offices has to be maintained. Many people believe that there is no Covid and do not take required measures. The authorities should regularly monitor air quality, find steps to reduce pollution and stubble burning.Abhinav Kapil, ChandigarhScale up virus control measuresLast month there was some relief from Covid cases, which made the respective administrations in the tricity somewhat complacent. People started avoiding masks or observing social distance. The authorities should enforce precautionary measures strictly as surge in Covid-19 cases is expected in the coming months due to the festive season, pollution and cold weather.KC Rana, ChandigarhImpose fine for not wearing maskTo prevent the second outbreak of the virus, schools and other institutions must remain closed. Hefty fines must be imposed on residents, who don‚Äôt wear masks. Teachers and employees must work from home. Hygienic conditions should be maintained. Home quarantine must be encouraged for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases.Shobhna Kalra, PanchkulaUse battery-operated vehicles in tricityAir pollution in the tricity is due to multiple factors. The solution lies in encouraging use of public transport, shared taxis, rental bicycles/electric two-wheelers, battery operated three-wheelers and car pooling. A behavioral change is required among citizens until they realise the gravity of the Covid crisis.Rajiv Boolchand Jain, ZirakpurMasses, traders must coordinateMasses need to act responsibly to avoid the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic during the festival season. One person per house should step out for shopping. Shopkeepers should make WhatsApp groups to display their products and provide home delivery while following protocols. Coordination between shopkeepers and masses can prevent the second outbreak of the virus.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliTake Pledge not to burst firecrackersIt is worrisome that a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is feared in the tricity. People and the authorities should realise the severity of the situation. Residents should pledge not to burst firecrackers. Farmers must stop burning stubble in their fields in the larger interest of the humanity. The government should help farmers monetarily to adopt other methods to dispose of stubble.Bir Devinder Singh Bedi, ChandigarhBan firecrackers everywhereThe second wave of coronavirus is expected due to decrease in temperature and increase in air pollution. The UT Administration banned use of crackers. Unfortunately, the Punjab Government allowed the sale and bursting of firecrackers on Diwali. This would increase pollution manifold and add to Covid positive cases. Better ban firecrackers everywhere.Wg Cdr Jasbir Minhas (retd), MohaliWearing mask should be compulsoryTo stop second the Covid wave wearing masks should be compulsory. The authorities should distribute masks free of cost among residents. Social distancing should be a norm. As the tricity has highest educated population rules can be easily enforced in the area.NPS Sohal, ChandigarhDon‚Äôt venture out unnecessarilyMany people roam on roads, in streets and markets without wearing masks. Coronavirus can be controlled if residents in the tricity take safety measures like wear masks, maintain social distance and sanitisation. Celebrate festivals, but do not venture out unnecessarily.MR Bhateja, NayagaonLife important than celebrationsCovid-19 will not spread if we follow dos and don‚Äôt. Life is more important than celebrating festivals or enjoying marriage parties. Nothing will happen if we don‚Äôt celebrate festivals. The authorities are allotting spaces to traders in markets, which might spread virus in the tricity. In the prevailing situation Covid cases will trigger. Avoid going to public places, sit home and pray for safe and bright new year ahead.Opinder Kaur Sekhon, ChandigarhDon‚Äôt lower guard against pandemicThe Administration and the health authorities are warning from time to time to not lower our guard against the pandemic. As there is steady increase in Covid-19 cases due to the cold weather and air pollution, residents of the tricity should heed to their advice. Wear face mask, use sanitiser and maintain social distance religiously. Go to markets when absolutely necessary. Don‚Äôt burst firecrackers.Dr Gurdev Singh, MohaliStop burning crop residueStudies reveal that the people, who live in polluted areas, more likely contract Covid-19. Air pollution harms lungs and increases respiratory diseases. Farmers are burning crop residue, which is causing air pollution. This practice has to be stopped immediately.Akshar Kumar Singla, ChandigarhPrecaution is only panaceaEverybody dreads the repeat of the coronavirus outbreak. Precaution is the only panacea so far. People should not burst firecrackers. Avoid large gatherings to prevent the transmission of virus. It‚Äôs incumbent upon one and all to religiously abide by the new norms. When self-regulation fails, the administrations in the tricity must not be negligent. Moreover, the country cannot afford fresh lockdown.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaBan gathering at public placesPublic gathering at public places should be banned in the winter season. Cashless transactions should be promoted. Shopkeepers must wear gloves and masks. Emphasis should be on social distancing and wearing masks. Only precautions can protect us and prevent the second virus outbreak in the tricity.Anita Tandon, KhararAssns must commit to follow normsThe tricity might witness second wave of Covid -19. The pandemic has already affected the health and financial condition of residents. The administration in the tricity should allow economic activities with all guidelines in place. Traders‚Äô associations in the tricity must commit to follow Covid prevention norms in markets.Avinash Goyal, ChandigarhAll is not wellA Hindi idiom ‚ÄòSavdhani hati durghatna ghati‚Äô fits in the present Covid-related situation in the tricity. Day to day activities and rush in market places gives an impression that all is well. Not to mention social distancing people have even stopped wearing masks. They should understand that all is not well and follow norms to prevent the second outbreak of virus in the tricity.Gobind Ahuja, ChandigarhFollow safety normsEvery body should follow Covid prevention norms. Do not lower guard against the pandemic. Pollution will aggravate the virus. So, avoid bursting firecrackers during the festive season.Vidya Sagar Garg, PanchkulaPrecautions the only remedySecond wave of the pandemic may strike again considering the prevailing situation in the tricity. Wear masks, frequently wash hands and observe social distancing till vaccine arrives. Residents should contribute by maintaining cleanliness in their surroundings. Discipline can prevent the spread of the virus.Bharat Bhushan Sharma, ChandigarhDo not be complacentThough the pandemic in the UT seems to be under control, it will take longer to free the city from the dreaded disease. Covid-19 vaccine is still under trials. Under such circumstances, residents must not be complacent with the increasing recovery rate and decreasing positive cases. Rather, they should always keep in mind three letters ‚Äì SMS ‚Äì sanitising hands, wearing masks and social distancing for self-protection.Hardeep Singh Slaich, MohaliAuthorities don‚Äôt seem to be worriedIf at all the authorities would have been cautious to prevent a second outbreak of virus, then Diwali was the right time. The allotment of huge number of stalls to vendors in Sector 19 and Sector 23 speaks for itself. The MC earned revenue at the cost of residents‚Äô health. Residents should themselves be careful and not burst firecrackers.Balbir Singh Batra, MohaliKeep a check on vendorsGive special attention to social distancing at public places and in local buses. Keep a check on fruit/vegetable vendors, who do not follow guidelines. Schools, colleges and other educational institutions should not reopen. People should use sanitisers, wear face masks and keep social distance.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, Mohali QUESTIONThe sale and bursting of firecrackers was banned on Diwali in Chandigarh by the Administration.

16-11-2020||---||Chandigarh Administration fails to enforce complete cracker ban in City Beautiful||Chandigarh, November 15The UT Administration miserably failed to enforce a complete cracker ban in the city on Diwali. Only 12 FIRs were registered for violating the ban on Diwali night compared to 13 cases registered under Section 188, IPC, at 16 police stations in the city last year.Many residents complained about the Administration‚Äôs lack of seriousness in strictly enforcing the complete ban. There was no check on the offenders in most parts of the city as the police restricted themselves to the job of patrolling with loud siren and showing no resolve to act sternly.The UT Adviser, Manoj Parida, drew critical comments from the city residents as soon as he tweeted, ‚ÄúNo noise pollution from crackers till now‚Ä¶ Feels good (5:59pm).‚ÄùResidents from Sectors 15, 19, 20, 22, 25, 26, 29, 30, 32, 34, 35, 44, 45 and 46, Mani Majra, Kishangarh, Kaimbwala, Dhanas and Maloya complained of noise from bursting crackers and air pollution. Residents in Sectors 35, 42 and 51 were irked that there was no police presence in the markets after 9 pm.The UT had promised much to implement the ban by invoking the Disaster Management Act 2005 besides booking offenders under Section 188, IPC. While the former mandates two-year imprisonment, the latter carries a maximum jail of three months.A few residents opined that the idea of imposing a ban on crackers was more or less a meaningless exercise when relaxations were given in the neighbouring Mohali and Panchkula. ‚ÄúThe ban can dissuade law-abiding citizens. To deter offenders, you need to enforce it aggressively. Sadly the enforcement part was missing,‚Äù said Shashipal Nehra, a resident of Sector 18.The president of the Chandigarh Residents Associations Welfare Federation (Crawfed), Hitesh Puri, said the soft-heartedness of the police was there for everyone to see. ‚ÄúThe blanket ban imposed by the Administration on crackers was just not possible,‚Äù said a resident of Sector 43.Ward No. 1 councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu said: ‚ÄúPeople complained of noise produced by bursting crackers from Mani Majra, Nayagaon, Kishangarh and the nearby villages.‚ÄùCrackers bought from Mohali, KuraliMost residents of Chandigarh bought crackers from Mohali and Kurali.
