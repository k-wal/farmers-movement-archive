14-04-2021||Chandigarh||Hope for Type II diabetes patients with kidney-pancreas transplant at PGIMER Chandigarh||PGIMER performed the first simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant in a patient with Type 2 Diabetes with high success in putting the patient off insulin.A 54-year-old patient from Roorkee became the first person to receive the treatment at PGI. He was on dialysis three times a week, requiring insulin 3 to 4 times every day along with blood sugar monitoring.The patient had diabetes for the last 10 to 15 years and was had kidney failure for four years. He was initiated on dialysis because of his kidney failure and was listed for deceased donor kidney transplantation.Last month, a family from Kaithal in Haryana lost their 12-year-old child in a road accident and approached the transplant coordinator to donate all his organs, including the pancreas.Dr Ashish Sharma, an expert in Nephrology, Renal Transplantation treatments at PGI said, “When we first talked to him regarding the possibility of a simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant, the patient thought it is a better solution than doing a kidney transplant alone. After the transplant, he is now able to eat whatever he wants and his blood sugar is well-controlled without the need for any insulin therapy. This patient illustrates that adding a pancreas transplant to a patient with diabetic kidney failure can prove to be a boon for these patients.”“A successful pancreas transplant can also significantly lower the cost of medicines like insulin and other drug therapy to manage diabetes alone can cost between Rs 3,000 to 5,000 per month for these patients,” he adds.At present, the utilisation of the pancreas remains very poor due to a lack of trained transplant surgeons in this area which results in higher complications.At PGI Chandigarh, 25 simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplants have been performed in patients with type 1 diabetes, but no such transplant had been performed in patients with type 2 diabetes. The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney failure end up having kidney transplant alone.Driven by the success of pancreas transplant at PGI, it has been decided to initiate simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant in type 2 patients as well. This was the first-ever simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant at PGI in a patient with type 2 diabetes.Dr Sanjay Badada, associate professor, endocrinology, PGIMER, said, “Diabetes is fast becoming the most common cause of kidney failure in India. Having diabetes as a cause of kidney failure not only reduces patient survival after kidney transplant. Diabetes can also affect the newly transplanted kidney and again cause kidney failure.”A pancreas transplant was recommended in type I diabetic patient who presents with kidney failure however, patients with type II diabetes were discouraged from undergoing pancreas transplant as it was thought that there is insulin resistance in these patients and doing the pancreas transplant would not be useful in these individuals.“However, in the last few years, this thinking has been challenged and a few successful simultaneous Pancreas kidney transplants have been done in patients with type 2 diabetes in the US and other developed countries,” said Dr Badada.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/hope-for-type-ii-diabetes-patients-with-kidney-pancreas-transplant-at-pgimer-chandigarh-238977
14-04-2021||Is a civic issue bothering you? Are you agitated over the lack of concern? Is there something heartening that you feel needs to be highlighted? Or a picture which in your opinion ought to be seen by many||Paying Rs 50 for ‘Darshan’ unfair at Panchkula Mansa Devi temple||The Tribune invites its readers to have their say. Please email at: haryanacity@tribunemail.com Paying Rs 50 for ‘Darshan’ unfair at Panchkula Mansa Devi templeCovid protocols can be enforced strictly on the campus of Mata Mansa Devi shrine during Navratri, but the concept of preferential darshan after paying Rs 50 per person is alien to the religious ethos. The shrine Board should withdraw this kind of darshan. Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaEncroachment on roads leads to traffic chaosAll major roads in Kaithal town have been encroached upon by shopkeepers and rehriwalas who continue to carry on their business from such 'illegally occupied' space. Thus congestion on roads leads to frequent traffic jams, which adversely affects normal life of residents and road users. This has been going on for the past decades and the civic authorities have failed to get these encroachments vacated or reclaim such land despite repeated anti-encroachment drives. The morale of encroachers is so high that they reoccupy the roads space got vacated by the administration within a few hours. Satish Seth, KaithalNight curfew warning for those ignoring SOPSIt is natural that the people of Haryana will have to face many problems with the night curfews across the state. But the government has no other option. In a way, this is a warning to the people that one should not be lax and must protect themselves from corona.

14-04-2021||Chandigarh||High Court no to quashing charges against Panchkula man||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has refused to quash charges framed against a man accused of snatching money and mobile phone from a foreign national after threatening her.The complainant in the case, a Russian, had alleged that the petitioner brought her to Chandigarh and she lived with him from July 18, 2019 to July 24, 2019 at Panchkula and Zirakpur. She had also alleged that the accused snatched her mobile phone and money in the process.“A perusal of the FIR and the (final investigation) report under Section 173, CrPC, clearly makes out a case, where a foreign national alleged that her money and mobile phone were snatched by the petitioner by extending threat to life, which the petitioner got recovered by making his disclosure statements. Therefore, at this stage, the trial court has rightly framed charges under the provisions of relevant Sections,” Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan asserted.Deepak Kumar of Panchkula district had moved the High Court for setting aside the order dated January 8, 2020 under which the trial court framed charges against him for cheating, criminal intimidation, criminal conspiracy, snatching and other offences under Sections 343, 379-A, 420, 506, 120-B of the IPC and Section 66-D of the Information Technology Act.Referring to the FIR, Kumar's counsel argued it was stated that the Russian and the petitioner were having love affair. She came to India and met the petitioner at Indira Gandhi International Airport at Delhi before she was brought to Chandigarh.He argued that snatching and another offence under Sections 343 and 379-A were not made out as the complainant has admitted that she came to India on her own and stayed with the petitioner thereafter.The allegations of forcibly taking away the money from the victim/complainant was also not made out, he added.After hearing the counsel for the petitioner and going through the contents of the FIR and the report, Justice Sangwan dismissed the petition after not finding merit.Among other things, Justice Sangwan asserted: "It is a well settled principle of law as held by the Supreme Court in State of Andhra Pradesh vs Goloconda Linga Swamy and another that at the time of framing of the charge, only prima facie evidence is to be seen."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/high-court-no-to-quashing-charges-against-panchkula-man-238736
