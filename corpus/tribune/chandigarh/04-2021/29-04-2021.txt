He said a grievance committee would be set up to look into complaints of employees regarding “faulty location” issues.The watches were brought in to check on-field ghost employees, to mark their attendance in the field and to give them salaries on the basis of the watches. Many employees have been wearing these. The civic body has not given salaries through this technology to anyone so far. A monthly rent about Rs18 lakh is being paid to a private agency.During the meeting, the MC chief said the May salaries would be disbursed on the basis of these watches. Interestingly, in May, the Commissioner will be completing his three-year tenure of deputation and will go back to his parent cadre Punjab.“Once the Commissioner goes, the system will also go,” quipped an official.During the House meeting, Yadav and councillor Arun Sood, who is also the city BJP chief, had arguments over the issue. Yadav wanted the system to continue, but Sood was against the watches, citing “faulty location and no utilisation”.Yadav claimed that about 250 ghost employees were detected through the technology. Sood sought a list of such employees. Yadav said it would be provided to all councillors.Earlier, a report of an MC panel was tabled in the House. In the report, councillors wanted to stop the system, while officers wanted it to continue.Two-three deadlines were set earlier, but the MC failed to implement the system. In February last year, the civic body started distributing 4,000 watches among its employees to track them. A three-year contract was signed with a private company to provide the watches.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/may-salary-via-smart-watches-mc-chandigarh-chief-245689

The obvious question that remains unanswered is when. The district has already been struggling to meet the current vaccine demand due to a limited supply.Only three vaccination centres – Sector 12-A Community Centre, Sector 26 Government Polyclinic and MDC Sector 4 Government Dispensary — are operational in urban Panchkula.The preference is being given to those visiting to receive the second jab.On the plans for rollout of the next phase, Dr Meenu Sasan, District Immunisation Officer, said they would add more centres once they receive the stock from the state government to vaccinate people between 18 and 45 years.“Everything depends upon supply. There is no hard and fast rule. We can conduct vaccination at additional centres if we have enough stock to vaccinate the targeted group,’’ she said. She said currently, they had 4,350 doses of Covishield and 15,900 doses of Covaxin in stock.She said vaccination at many centres across the city, including the Civil Hospital, has been suspended due to a rise in Covid cases and staff getting infected.Meanwhile, Haryana Speaker and local MLA Gian Chand Gupta said today that the district would add 20-22 vaccination centres ahead of the next phase. However, the Health Department did not confirm this statement.The shortage of vaccine has slowed down the drive at a time when the district is grappling with the deadly second wave of Covid. The district targets to vaccinate 2.57 lakh people in the 18-45 age group. As many as 1.38 lakh doses of vaccine have been administered in the district so far.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/shortage-of-vaccine-clouds-next-phase-in-panchkula-245691

Sometimes attendants take the injections, but at the same time hospitals provide them the required medicines. Sometimes people from Haryana and Punjab come here to purchase these vials, creating an unnecessary rush. We can understand that patients are in dire need, but creating such pressure will only worsen the situation,” CJ Singh asserted.Another wholesaler, Gupta Agencies Pharmaceutical Distributors, Sector 24, said the doctors should set a parameter for prescribing these injections.“Things need to be streamlined under current circumstances. The doctors should set a parameter for prescribing these injections,” said owner Ankur Gupta.“Only critical patients should be prescribed these injections,” Gupta insisted.“Also, the government should provide these injections directly to hospitals,” he added.‘Unnecessary harassment’Attendants, coming to purchase these injections, though alleged that they were unnecessarily being harassed by the shopkeepers.“If there is no supply of injections, why do they (shop owners) ask us to wait for hours in this scorching heat. And if someone argues, they tell him/her to approach the authorities,” claimed Parbhat, an attendant.“We are already under lot of stress. No one will let his/her patient die. He will make every possible effort to get the medicines,” he added.Anuj, another attendant, said: “We have been told to bring copies of aadhar card (both patient and purchaser), doctor’s prescription, Covid reports and address proof… instead of smoothening the process, they are making it more complicated. The verification of documents takes hours and then we are told to wait or approach the Drug Controller office. This is sheer harassment.”Many attendants said the updated stock report should be pasted outside every medical shop to stop black marketing.“I have witnessed people selling medicines and injections on higher prices. The attendants are told to wait and later someone would approach them with the medicines. The administration should act and appoint officials to stop black marketing,” said Ravi, another attendant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/wholesalers-under-pressure-to-meet-remdesivir-demand-245693

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has fixed a daily quota of 20 MT of medical oxygen for the UT. This medical oxygen is being utilised at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital in Sector 16, the Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32 and the Covid Hospital in Sector 48. To ensure regular and uninterrupted supply of oxygen to both government and private health facilities in the city, it has been decided that sufficient quantity of medical oxygen, out of the 20 MT quota of the UT, will be provided to a private vendor for the purpose of refilling cylinders. Anaesthetic Gases Private Limited, Sector 22-A, will cater to the need of all private healthcare facilities and will ensure uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen.  Private hospitals have been informed that the AGPL will not accept any industrial cylinder for refilling with medical oxygen. The cylinders prescribed for medical oxygen gas should only be used for the purpose. The cylinders should be hydraulically tested as per the prescribed guidelines/standards to avoid any mishap during the process of refilling and transportation and there should be an adequate number of empty cylinders to have better rotation of refilling.
