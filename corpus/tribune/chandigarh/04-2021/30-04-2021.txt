30-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration picks two more private vendors for supply of oxygen||For smooth and uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen, the UT Administration has roped in two more private vendors for refilling of cylinders to be used by healthcare institutions in the city.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has fixed a daily quota of 20 MT of medical oxygen for the UT from INOX, Barotiwala, which is being utilised for Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, and the Covid hospital in Sector 48. Recently, three oxygen generation plants had been commissioned at the GMCH, the GMSH and the Covid hospital, Sector 48, with a capacity of 1,000 litre per minute (LPM), 500 LPM and 100 LMP, respectively. The requirement of medical oxygen for the PGI is met out of a separate quota.City quota 20 MT After meeting the daily requirement of main government hospitals, the remaining medical oxygen out of the 20 MT quota of the UT will be provided to private vendors for refilling medical oxygen cylinders to cater to the needs of government as well as private healthcare institutions in the city.Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for managing the medical oxygen supply to the UT, said, there was additional requirement of refilling of medical oxygen in cylinders in each of these three government hospitals. “Further, private healthcare institutions also require medical oxygen and these are mostly dependent on medical oxygen in cylinders,” he said.After meeting the daily requirement of the GMCH, the GMSH and the Covid hospital, Sector 48, the remaining medical oxygen out of the 20 MT quota of the UT will be provided to private vendors for refilling medical oxygen cylinders to cater to the needs of government as well as private healthcare institutions in the city.At present, Anaesthetic Gases Pvt Ltd (AGPL), Sector 22-A, is the approved private vendor for the GMCH and the Covid hospital for refilling cylinders with medical oxygen. “Now, it is also supplying oxygen to the GMSH,” he said. AGPL is also refilling medical oxygen cylinders of private healthcare institutions in the city.“To avoid a possible rush with a single private refilling vendor and to ensure smooth supply, now, two more private refilling vendors – Chandigarh Gases, Industrial Area, Phase 1, and Super Gages, Dera Bassi, will provide sufficient quantity of medical oxygen out of the 20 MT quota of the UT for refilling of medical oxygen cylinders to be used by both government and private healthcare institutions,” he said.Dr Manjit Singh, Medical Officer, GMSH, will coordinate with INOX and ensure that the daily 20 MT quota medical oxygen is rationally distributed among the GMCH, the GMSH and the Covid hospital, Sector 48. “The remaining quantity will be provided by INOX directly to the private refilling vendors to refill medical oxygen cylinders of healthcare institutions,” he said.He said the quantity of medical oxygen provided to the private refilling vendors and the quantity of oxygen supplied by them to healthcare institutions would be regularly monitored by Dr Manjit Singh.As agreed upon by the vendors, refilling would be provided at the rate approved for the GMCH, he said. “The private refilling vendors, who have been provided medical oxygen out of the quota of the UT, will not charge higher than the approved rate of the GMCH,” said Garg.Private healthcare institutions have to ensure that private vendors do not accept any industrial cylinder for refilling with medical oxygen. Only cylinders prescribed for medical oxygen should be used for the purpose. The cylinders should be hydraulically tested as per the prescribed guidelines/standards to avoid any mishap during the process of refilling and transportation. There should be adequate number of empty cylinders to have better rotation of refilling and to take care of any delay in the supply chain.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-picks-two-more-private-vendors-for-supply-of-oxygen-246003
