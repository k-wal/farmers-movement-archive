Patients are evaluated first through tele-consultation and only those requiring further evaluation and examination are called to the OPD by appointment.Dr Naveen Pandey, in-charge of the OPD Administration at PGI said, “The tele-consultation is open between 8 am and 9.40 am. We have one tele-consultation number with 21 lines. The institute registers over 2,500 patients through telephone. This means, one patient is registered through telephone every minute.”“Those patients who face difficulty in registering through telephone can also register online, which is available 24X7,” said Dr Pandey.On expanding OPD services, he said tele-consultation was time consuming in comparison to physical OPDs as doctors spend around 10 minutes on each patient. This includes sharing of reports over WhatsApp, etc.The doctors are calling patients till 5-6 pm in the evening, and expanding OPD services seems difficult at the moment, he said.Prof Jagat Ram, Director, PGI, said, “In days prior to Covid, OPDs at PGI witnessed a daily footfall of 10,000 to12,000. Catering to this mammoth load through tele-consultation is very tough, but we are trying our level best and reaching out to almost 50 per cent of our patient load, considering that over 4,500 to 5,000 patients are either given consultation over phone or through physical examination.”“Though we have tried to increase the number of lines to facilitate patients, still there is a long way to go.”“At times patients with routine health issues also want consultation at PGI. However, this being a tertiary care hospital, ideally, only those patients requiring tertiary care should be catered to. All this leads to patient load much beyond the expectations and hence any facilitation or service falls short of the demand,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/tele-consultation-appointments-add-to-agony-of-patients-at-chandigarhs-pgi-233868

03-04-2021||Ramkrishan Upadhyay||Accused forged papers to secure loan for purchasing house||Tribune news serviceChandigarh, April, 2The Chandigarh Police have made more revelations in the Sector 37 property grab case in which nine people have been booked.The special investigating team (SIT) of the Chandigarh Police, in its reply before the court, alleged that the accused had submitted “forged papers” to secure the bank loan for the purchase of the house.The SIT filed the reply while opposing the bail pleas of accused Sanjeev Mahajan, a former journalist, and Inspector Rajdeep Singh.The police have so far arrested four accused, including Mahajan and Inspector Rajdeep Singh, in the case and are on the lookout for the other accused.As per the FIR, the accused had fraudulently sold the house of Rahul Mehta in Sector 37, Chandigarh.The police claimed that the accused obtained the signatures of Mehta after torturing him. They said he was later abandoned in Gujarat and an impostor was produced before the office of the Sub Registrar at the time of the execution of the sale deed of the house.Rajdeep Singh, former SHO, Sector 39 police station, was arrested for not taking any action on the initial complaint filed against the accused, who had forcibly occupied the house in Sector 37, Chandigarh.The police also stated in its reply that one of the accused had falsely lodged a complaint after the bank had raised objection with respect to the original transfer letter and original lease deed of the house.The accused submitted an undertaking-cum-indemnity in favour of the bank claiming that original transfer letter and original lease deed was lost and got it attested even as original lease deed never existed, the police said.The police also claimed that in order to receive the cheque from the bank, forged and fabricated undertaking was prepared in the name of Rahul Mehta.The police said an advertisement in the name of Mehta also got published in the newspapers without any authorisation.Special public prosecutor Manu Kakkar argued on behalf of the SIT before the court. While opposing the bail plea of the accused, Kakkar cited the judgment of former Chief Justice of Supreme Court Deepak Misra and Justice Prafulla C Pant, who had observed that the court must deal with corrupt people with an iron hand.The court postponed the hearing on the bail pleas for Monday.Rajesh Sharma, counsel appearing on behalf of accused Sanjeev Mahajan, claimed that the police failed to show any documentary evidence or any transaction in favour of Mahajan in relation to the controversial property.Sharma also said the statement of Mehta alleging that the accused trespassed into his house in April/May 2017 was not tenable as he had already rented out the upper floor of his house to Surjit Singh, who is also an accused in the case, on January 14 of that year.Harish Bhardwaj, counsel of inspector Rajdeep Singh, claimed that all the allegations against his client were imaginary and a figment of imagination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/accused-forged-papers-to-secure-loan-for-purchasing-house-233867

They said the reply of the department was not satisfactory.Hence, strict action for compliance with the directives was required by the commission. “Due to the bimonthly billing, consumers are forced to pay surcharge at 4 per cent for the total bill if they miss out on paying the bill even by a day. The department comes to know about the non-payment after four months,” they said.“If the commission wants to retain the bimonthly billing, surcharge on late payment should be taken at 2 per cent per cycle instead of per month, the interest rate on the principal amount should exceed the bank rate as at present, 24 per cent surcharge is being charged yearly,” they stated.In response, the department submitted that at present, over 85 per cent consumers (domestic and commercial) are billed bimonthly. “The conversion of meter reading from bimonthly to a monthly basis will lead to various problems as there is an acute shortage of staff. Further, the software will also need to be upgraded for monthly billing,” said the department.Meanwhile, the work on installation of smart meters under the National Smart Grid Mission is in progress, which will help support monthly billing for all categories of consumers, including domestic and commercial, said the department.However, the commission directed the department to expedite the process and submit the progress report in a month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/switch-over-to-monthly-billing-fast-says-jerc-233857

Of this, Rs10 lakh will be given to the victim’s family.The accused, Gurcharan, alias Mintu, was held guilty and convicted under Sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) read with Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 404 (dishonest misappropriation of property possessed by deceased person at the time of his death) of the IPC.Mukul Bhardwaj, who owned a call centre in Sector 3, was found dead in the bushes near the banks of the Tangri river in Raipur Rani on August 5, 2015. His Toyota Etios was found near his office. Post-mortem had revealed that he was strangled using a cloth.A case under Sections 302 (murder) and 201 (disappearance of evidence) of the IPC was registered at the Raipur Rani police station.Gurcharan, alias Mintu, owner of Panchkula Regency Hotel in Sector 3, was arrested in connection with the case on August 14.According to the police, Mukul was last seen leaving the hotel with Gurcharan around 1.45 am as per the footage of a CCTV camera. As per the investigation, Mukul and Gurcharan were involved in betting and used to meet at the latter’s hotel.“One day, Gurcharan lost Rs 5 lakh to Mukul in a betting game. Gurcharan was avoiding the repayment since long and Mukul’s repeated demands led to him getting frustrated. Hence, he hatched a conspiracy with his cousin/another accused, Davinder Pal, alias Rinku, to kill Mukul. According to the plan, they made Mukul drink cold drink laced with poisonous substance and strangulated him with a cloth in his car and threw his body near the banks of the Tangri in Raipur Rani,” the police said.Later, they drove the victim’s car to Panchkula and left it near his office before taking away the victim’s personal belongings in order to make the case appear to be that of a robbery.The two accused then allegedly sold the items to another accused, Vikram Sharma, who was earlier acquitted by the court in the case.While Davinder Pal, alias Rinku, died during the course of hearing in the case, Jeetu, who is also an accused of purchasing the victim’s items, is absconding.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/hotelier-gets-life-term-for-killing-call-centre-owner-233860

The decision was taken after the inspection of parking lots. During the inspection, it was found that both parking contractors are yet to implement smart parking features.The parking lots in the city are divided into two zones. As many as 32 parking lots are in Zone 1 and 57 in Zone 2. The MC had auctioned both zones for nearly Rs10 crore annually.In October last year, the MC had directed the parking contractors to install all smart features in 89 parking lots within a month as new parking charges will be applicable only after installation of smart features in the parking lots.However, the MC had to extend the deadline several times as the contractors had failed to put in place smart features.After the implementation of hourly charges, parking fee for the first four hours will remain the same as being charged at present - Rs5 for two-wheelers and Rs10 for four-wheelers. Thereafter, these will be doubled. The charges will further be doubled if vehicles are kept parked beyond 12 hours. There will be free entry for pick and drop in the first 10 minutes.The smart features include e-ticketing, HD night vision CCTV cameras at exit/entry points, smartcard-based daily and monthly passes, provision for e-payment, LED display of real-time occupancy at entry points and online booking of parking space through app. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/civic-body-defers-hourly-parking-charges-in-chandigarh-233859

Now, the vaccination will be done throughout the week, including Sundays, to cover the vulnerable population of above 45 years at the earliest.Covid care centre made functionalEven though most cases are mild and in home isolation, a dental college in Barwala has also been made functional as a Covid care centre in view of a significant rise in the patient load. Its current capacity of 70 beds can be expanded to 200.The district, which shares its boundary with the badly affected Chandigarh and Mohali, has been seeing a rapid rise in the coronavirus cases in the past few weeks.Even though it is the least populous district of Haryana, it currently figures among the top five districts with the highest active cases in the state. The active caseload, which stood at 124 on March 1, now stands at 1,038. The recovery rate has also dipped to 91.08 per cent from 97.48 per cent on March 1.The current wave — How it beganThe district had started witnessing a downward trajectory in daily Covid-19 cases towards the second half of December, and on February 1, the daily count had come down to just seven cases, which was the lowest since July last year.

03-04-2021||Barabanki/Chandigarh||Papers of ambulance in which BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari went to Mohali court 'fake'; Punjab Police clarify||The UP Police have lodged an FIR, saying fake documents were used to register the ambulance, which recently ferried gangster-turned politician Mukhtar Ansari from a Punjab jail to a court in that state.The ambulance had the registration number of UP’s Barabanki and was used to ferry Ansari from Punjab’s Rupnagar jail to a Mohali court on March 31.Amid a row over the issue, a Punjab Police official clarified that an inmate can be transported in a private ambulance on medical grounds and the cost of conveyance has to be borne by the prisoner.The BSP MLA from Mau, who is wanted in Uttar Pradesh for various cases, was produced before the Mohali court in connection with an alleged 2019 extortion case.Ansari was taken to the court in a wheelchair. He was sent back to the Rupnagar jail, where he is lodged since January 2019.“After an initial probe, the name and address given for the registration of the ambulance were found to be false. An FIR in this regard has been registered by an additional road transport officer against Dr Alka Rai, whose name was given for the registration of the ambulance,” a senior police official said in Barabanki.An FIR was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 420 (forgery), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using documents as genuine), 467 (forgery of valuable security) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating).Superintendent of Police Yamuna Prasad said acting on media reports that Ansari was produced in a court in Punjab on an ambulance with the registration number of Barabanki, police teams probed the matter and found that documents such as PAN, electoral photo ID card and others were fake.The address on which these documents were made was also found to be wrong, he said.However, the Punjab Police official said if an inmate has any medical condition, then he can be taken in a private ambulance, subject to due diligence by the security in-charge. The cost of conveyance has to be borne by the prisoner, he said.According to the Punjab Prisoners (Attendance in Court) Rules, 1969, police can allow a private vehicle on the request of a prisoner, the official added.It was also clarified that ambulance in which Ansari was taken to the court on March 31 was not a bullet-proof vehicle. Meanwhile in UP’s Mau, Dr Alka Rai, the manager of Shyam Sanjivini Hospital there, said that she had nothing to do with the ambulance and termed it as a conspiracy of Mukhtar Ansari and her rivals. Dr Rai, who visited the Mau Kotwali police station on Friday, gave a complaint to police in this regard and appealed to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for justice.The Supreme Court had recently directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh Police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues.The apex court had also said that a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another and the courts are not to be a helpless bystander when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity.The court had said the custody of Ansari, a BSP MLA from the Mau constituency, be handed over to Uttar Pradesh within two weeks so as to lodge him in Banda district jail in Uttar Pradesh.The apex court had also noted that Ansari was allegedly involved in various cases of attempt to murder, murder, cheating and conspiracy apart from offences under the Gangsters Act, lodged in Uttar Pradesh and out of them, 10 cases are at the trial stage.Mukhtar Ansari’s wife has written to President Ram Nath Kovind, expressing fears that he might be killed in a fake encounter while being transferred from Punjab to Uttar Pradesh following a Supreme Court direction.His brother, BSP MP from Ghazipur, Afzal Ansari told PTI, “To divert attention from the life threat to Mukhtar, BJP government is making wheelchair and ambulance as an issue.”  “If the BJP is making Mukhtar Ansari (2022) election agenda, we and our supporters will also make vindictive action of the government against their family an issue,” he said.Asserting that Mukhtar Ansari has been ill for the past two years, his brother said that if there is any shortcoming in the documents of the ambulance, a fine could be imposed.Meanwhile, a Mohali court has rejected a plea of Mukhtar Ansari who sought directions to jail authorities to constitute a medical board for examining him.The court of Judicial Magistrate 1st Class (JMIC) Amit Bakshi said the Supreme Court has already considered Ansari’s plea regarding his medical condition.“There is nothing on record which can suggest that after the apex court order on March 26 there have been any fresh medical issues with the accused,” the Mohali court judge said.
