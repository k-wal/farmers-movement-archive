In 2019, the Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission had directed GMADA to pay Rs60,000 as compensation and 12 per cent interest on the principal amount to Surjeet Bedi. However, she hasn’t received the amount yet.In the meantime, she was even misguided by GMADA officials. They did not obey the judgment and stated that they would appeal to the national consumer court (NCLT), Delhi. However, no case has been registered by GMADA in the national court during the past two years.The caseSurjeet Bedi was allotted a flat in Purab Apartments under the reserved category of gallantry award winners/Vir Chakra personnel catergory after a draw and was issued a letter of intent in May 2012. GMADA promised possession in May 2015, failing which she had the right to withdraw from the scheme after sending an application to the estate officer. Despite being paid Rs63.3 lakh, GMADA failed to deliver the apartment to Bedi, following which she moved the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab.In January this year, Surjeet Bedi said she had again approached the State Consumer Court by filing the execution of not obeying the February 2019 judgement by GMADA. She said this was a sheer case of delay and harassment to a senior citizen and the mother of a braveheart sacrificed his life for the nation.Bedi was allotted a flat in Purab Apartments under the reserved category of gallantry award winners/Vir Chakra personnel catergory after a draw and was issued letter of intent (LOI) in May 2012.

This entitles the complainant to seek the refund of the amount. Bedi has already been refunded Rs55.7 lakh by GMADA out of the Rs63.3 lakh she paid, but the 10 per cent deduction was unjustified, unauthorised and uncalled for.”Bedi’s son 2nd Lt Amardeep Singh Bedi from Bareilly was awarded the Vir Chakra posthumously on January 26, 1990, for exemplary action in confining militants to a jungle strip on January 18, 1989, thwarting their escape and killing one.
