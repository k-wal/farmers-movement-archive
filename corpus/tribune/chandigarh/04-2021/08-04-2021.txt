He said some people were trying to discredit the management of the SGPC and mislead the sangat. Gurdwara Sri Amb Sahib had about 24 acre land at Premgarh Saini Majra village, of which about 12 acres was acquired by GMADA in 2012-13. The compensation for this land was offered at Rs1.69 per acre and accordingly, it came out to Rs19.40 crore, approximately.WHat’s the matter?He said though the land acquisition was done as per law, the compensation amount was contested in Mohali court. “We contested that GMADA should have given us compensation to the tune of at least Rs5 crore per acre, which was the market price,” he said. He further clarified that the amount received by the gurdwara sahib for this land was used to buy another chunk of 59 acres at Bagrian village in Sangrur district, which was worth Rs14.30 crore. “The FDR of the remaining amount is still prevalent in the name of Gurdwara Sri Amb Sahib only,” he said. Advocate Harjinder Singh Dhami said: “In February 2019, GMADA acquired 5,500 acres at Saini Majra, Bakarpur, Patto and Seon villages. Here also, nearly nine acres of the remaining land belongs to Gurdwara Sri Amb Sahib. The GMADA has fixed the price of this land at Rs2.17 crore per acre. Apart from this, GMADA is also offering a land pooling scheme.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/sgpc-clarifies-mohalis-gurdwara-sri-amb-sahib-land-row-236179

Amid demands to open vaccination to all, the high percentage of those vulnerable but not eligible for the jab runs contrary to the Centre’s contention that for now, it wants to inoculate “those who require it”, not those who “want it”.In the second wave, since February this year, more than 40 per cent of those infected with coronavirus in the tricity fall in the age group of 20 to 40 years.Of the 382 Covid deaths in Chandigarh till now, 47 victims were below 45. The fatality figure for Mohali in the same age category was 72 out of the total 465. In Panchkula, of the 156 deaths reported so far, 12 victims were aged below 45.In Chandigarh, those aged above 60 accounted for 221 deaths (57.59 per cent) and those in the age group of 45 to 59 almost 30 per cent.Dr JA Jayalal, president of the Indian Medical Association, says people below 45 “are super spreaders, which is why they should be targeted for vaccination”. The constraint, he adds, is that if inoculation is opened across age groups, the vaccine requirement per month will go up to 15 crore, which is far above the monthly production capacity.The answer, according to him, could be allowing more vaccines in the country.According to Dr Rajesh Kumar, former Head of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, PGI, many people below 45 years with comorbidities have succumbed to Covid. “The government should open vaccination for all age groups so that the severity of the disease and hospitalisation goes down. There is circumstantial evidence in some countries of a substantial population being vaccinated and the infection rate declining. However, more evidence is needed to be certain of a vaccine’s role in breaking the transmission.”40% of infected in 20-40 age groupIn the second wave, since February this year, more than 40 per cent of the infected in the tricity fall in the age group of 20 to 40 years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/below-45-account-for-13-of-deaths-in-chandigarh-tricity-236066

How will it help?Since Punjab has already imposed a night curfew, if we don’t do it, people will flock to the city. This will mean that our farmhouses and hotels will be packed with people from neighbouring states who will take advantage of the difference in rules to crowd the capital city.Will you go for a weekend lockdown if cases rise further?We are keeping a watch on the situation and take a decision accordingly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-night-curfew-passengers-exempt-235972

Rana alleged that when he was coming to the mall in the Industrial Area, Phase 1 on February 7 to pick customers, two boys started chasing him on their bikes from Tribune Chowk.When he stopped in front of the mall, the bikers came there and asked him to remove his jacket. As he objected, one of them attacked him with a sharp weapon on his neck. He resisted but the other boy caught hold of him and hit him with a helmet. He was again attacked with the weapon. The complainant alleged that the boys attempted to murder him. As he shouted for help, they fled on their motorcycles.A case under Sections 307 and 341 of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Industrial Area police station.The counsel of the accused claimed that the accused were falsely implicated by the police at the instance of the complainant.The public prosecutor argued that as per the medical report, injuries on the forehead and the left eyebrow of the cab driver were grievous. As the accused were involved in a case of attempt to murder, they deserved no leniency.The court observed that the allegations against the accused were too grave to release them on a regular bail. There was every likelihood that if granted bail, the applicants might attempt to hamper the investigation or influence the witnesses. “Without further delving into the merits of the case and in view of the grave nature of offence, the court is of the opinion that the applicants do not deserve the discretionary concession of bail,” observed the court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/court-offence-grave-no-bail-for-two-youths-in-cabbie-attack-case-235981
