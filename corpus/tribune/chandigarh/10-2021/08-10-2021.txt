The court also imposed a fine of Rs25,000 on the convict, Parwinder Singh.As per the prosecution, 45 grams of opium was allegedly recovered from his possession while he was undergoing imprisonment at the Model Jail, Burail, on June 4, 2019. The jail authorities had disclosed before the police that the opium was recovered from the accused when a search was conducted in 12 cells by the staff.After registering a case and conducting investigations, the police presented a challan before the court.The counsel for the accused denied all charges during the hearings and argued that there were discrepancies in statements of prosecution witnesses. He also argued that the recovery was made inside the jail and no independent witness joined the investigation.After hearing the arguments and examining the records, the court said the prosecution had been able to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt that he was found in conscious possession of 45 grams of opium falling in non-commercial category without any legal permit or licence. As such, the accused was held guilty for the offence under Section 18 of the NDPS Act.Though the accused pleaded for leniency during the hearing on the quantum of the sentence, the public prosecutor demanded strict punishment by saying the accused was already convicted in another case in which a commercial quantity of the contraband was recovered from him. While saying that the instances of the NDPS Act are on alarming rise and drugs had directly affected the youth and entire social fabric of society, Jagdeep Sood, Judge, Special Court, sentenced the accused to one-year rigorous imprisonment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/jail-inmate-gets-1-yr-rigorous-imprisonment-in-ndps-case-321524

The direction by Justice Deepak Sibal of the High Court came after the transgender alleged threat to life and liberty from her mentor and other respondents.As the petition filed by Latika against the state of Haryana and other respondents came up for preliminary hearing before Justice Sibal’s Bench, the petitioner’s counsel submitted that he would be satisfied at the current stage if directions were issued to the respondent – Station House Officer (SHO), police station, Sector 9, Ambala — to consider and take a final decision on the petitioner’s representation, dated September 20.Appearing before the Bench on advance notice, the state counsel submitted that he had no objection if the prayer was accepted.“After hearing counsel for the parties, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondent – the SHO — to forthwith consider the grievances raised by the petitioner in the representation made to him/her and take action thereupon as he/she deems fit in accordance with law,” Justice Sibal asserted.Latika, in the petition, had earlier submitted that she was a member of the transgender community and was living under constant danger from certain respondents, who were threatening her to either leave Ambala City or face elimination.Going into the background of the matter, the petitioner contended that she was earlier a “chela” or disciple of a respondent. However, later they parted ways. As a result, the respondent started pressuring the petitioner to leave Ambala City.The petitioner added that she was attacked and threatened in the past also at the respondent’s behest. “The petitioner has reasonable apprehension to believe that the respondents may attack her, either themselves, through their goons or any anti-social elements, just to make the petitioner flee Ambala City out of fear,” her counsel submitted, adding that approaching the High Court by way of the present petition was the only efficacious and speedy remedy available to her.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/transgender-moves-high-court-seeks-protection-from-mentor-321510

Parents are worried about the opening of schools and it will be a relief for them. We thank the Adviser for taking a positive note of our request,” said HS Mamik, president, ISA.Meanwhile, the private schools have started issuing circular to the parents, stating that the UT Administration is likely to open the schools for all the students of Class 1 to 12 from October 11.The schools have also started taking consent from parents with regard to transport facilities.“There is no clarity as of now and no official order has been signed by the competent authority till date,” said a teacher.“The offline mode of teaching for students above Class 6 has already started. If approved, the junior students can also come to school, but under strict Covid protocol. School managements have to be extra cautious,” said the teacher.Sources claimed that like previous orders, the UT Education Department would ask the schools to get consent from the parents for sending their children to school.With a dip in the number of Covid cases, private schools have been demanding to open schools for all age groups.“The neighbouring states have already opened schools, even for junior classes. I don’t understand what Chandigarh is waiting for. There has to be some clarity as schools have been facing huge losses,” said a member of a school management.Parents worriedMeanwhile, some parents continue to oppose the move and demand that opening of schools should not be allowed before Covid vaccine for the children.“The pandemic is not over completely and cases are expected to rise.

Justice Harsimran Singh Sethi asserted that the allegations reflected “very poorly upon the working of the police, if proven”.Justice Sethi directed the officer to file her affidavit before the allegations in the petition were adjudicated by the High Court. The officer was directed to specify whether she monitored the investigation after the FIR was registered in the present case and the investigation was transferred from Ambala to Kurukshetra.“If yes, what action has been taken so far by the SIT to investigate the allegations mentioned in the FIR and whether any of the accused was arrested while investigating the allegationsl; if no, then why? Let the affidavit be filed before the next date of hearing positively,” Justice Sethi asserted.The matter was brought to Justice Sethi’s notice after a petition was filed before the High Court against the state of Haryana and other respondents by Sikander Singh Sangwan through counsel Pradeep Virk. The Bench was told that the case involved cheating the petitioner of his hard-earned money “to the tune of Rs2.10 crore” for sending him abroad via permanent residency to Canada and establishing his business over there.Justice Sethi asserted that the allegations against the police were “very serious in nature” to the effect that the police were hand in glove with the private respondents and doing nothing to investigate the FIR registered only when the Ambala Inspector-General of Police intervened and directed the registration of the same.Justice Sethi also took note of Virk’s arguments that the FIR was registered in July, but action had so far not been taken, despite the fact that an SIT was formed to investigate the allegations in the FIR and the probe was transferred from Ambala to Kurukshetra, which “itself showed the interest of the police”.

Two oxygen plants set up at city hospitals were only able to fulfil 25 per cent of the oxygen requirements during the second wave.The four PSA oxygen plants were today formally dedicated to the people of the city.Prime Minister Narendra Modi today virtually inaugurated a PSA oxygen plant with a capacity of 500 litres per minute (LPM) at the GMSH-16.

We would like to be fully geared up as far as oxygen supply, hospital beds and medicines are concerned and have ensured adequate funds to every hospital to meet critical care medical requirements.”To tide over further oxygen crisis, the UT Administration has already sanctioned two PSA plants with a capacity of 800 LPM to the GMSH-16 and the GMCH-32. The UT also proposed to set up two 400 LPM capacity plants at the GMCH (South Campus), Sector 48, the Civil Hospital in Mani Majra, and three plants with 300 LPM capacity at the civil hospitals in Sector 45 and Sector 22 and the ESI Hospital at Ram Darbar.Chandigarh was the first in the country to install and make PSA oxygen plants functional in all major hospitals, said Yashpal Garg, Secretary, Health Department.PGI Director Prof Jagat Ram said, “Two more PSA oxygen plants will be installed at the PGI and these will use the PSA technique and molecular sieve (zeolite) technology to generate oxygen directly from the atmospheric air.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-readies-4-oxygen-plants-for-3-600-hospital-beds-321520
