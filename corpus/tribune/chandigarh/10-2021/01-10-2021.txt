Finding no less than two dozen such advertisements in the newspaper’s Sunday edition, the Bench had not only rapped the Chandigarh Administration, but also directed the holding of the exercise under the UT Chief Architect’s supervision.The Bench had observed that it thought of scanning the advertisements as the court was seized of the matter and discovered 24 advertisements in the Sunday edition “scouting for purchasers /investors for separate floors/independent floors”.Reproducing the advertisements, the Bench added that it lent credence to the petitioner-Residents Welfare Association that independent floors were being sold under the garb of sale of a certain percentage share of a residential unit.The UT Estate Office had, during the course of hearing, claimed that it did not issue no-objection certificates mentioning particular floors. “No such NOC mentioning floor on the basis of share of owner/co-owner was issued by the deponent-Assistant Estate Officer or any of his predecessors as per records,” the Estate Officer had asserted.In an affidavit placed before the Bench, it was added that the only exception were the “ones which may have been issued on the basis of registered sale deeds executed while the Chandigarh Apartment Rules-2001 were in vogue”. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/floor-wise-sale-of-houses-in-chandigarh-high-court-reserves-verdict-318548

The original rules and bylaws have been well thought out and should not be tampered with.“The city was planned for a population of 5 lakh. We already have close to a million inhabitants. No further densification or apartmentalisation should be permitted as there is great pressure on the infrastructure of the city. Any increase in population will lead to the collapse of the city,” they submitted.The vehicular traffic in the city must be carefully monitored and properly regulated, they said and added that it has already become a nightmare for pedestrians to cross a street in most parts of the city, especially between Sector 4 and 9, and Sector 5 and 8.They said: “Stress should be laid on preserving the planned nature and heritage of Le Corbusier’s city, which is renowned globally for its architecture and town planning.” Sukhna Lake and the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary need to be preserved and for doing so, eco-sensitive zones should be declared around both at the earliest, they added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/master-plan-of-chandigarh-should-not-be-tweaked-318544

But all Benches resumed functioning through the virtual mode from July 28 with the reduction in the severity of the second wave. Amidst apprehensions of Covid third wave, the high court decided to partially resume physical hearing of cases from September 6, with two Division Benches and 10 Single Benches designated for hearing of cases through the physical mode.The high court at that time made it clear that four Single Benches would take up writ petitions and civil matters, while six would take up criminal matters. Currently, more than 2,000 cases are being listed for hearing.Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar president GDS Dhillon said the advocates had since long been demanding the resumption of physical hearing of cases and the decision to increase the number of Benches to 50 per cent of the total would expedite to a large extent the hearing of matters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/50-per-cent-of-punjab-and-haryana-hc-benches-to-hear-cases-physically-from-monday-318340
