19-11-2021||Saurabh Malik||High Court raps Chandigarh judicial officer for ‘casual approach’||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 18The Punjab and Haryana High Court has rapped a UT judicial officer for “casual approach” after describing as shocking her failure to decide a maintenance plea in a pending divorce case. The Bench made it clear that the presiding officer would send her explanation in case the application was not decided on the next date of hearing before her court. “In case the application is not decided on that date, the presiding officer shall send her explanation for not doing so and the District and Sessions Judge, Chandigarh, would append his comments thereon, which will then be placed before this court,” Justice HS Madaan ruled.The matter was placed before Justice Madaan after the wife filed a plea against the husband with a limited prayer for issuance of “necessary directions” to the court concerned to decide the plea for maintenance for herself and her minor daughter under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act in the divorce petition by her husband. The Bench was told that the plea was pending before UT Additional District Judge for the past more than two years and eight months.Section 24 entitles not only the wife, but also the husband, to claim maintenance “pendente lite” on showing that he or she has no independent source of income. The court, under Section 24, can, in its discretion, grant maintenance to a spouse with no independent income while the matrimonial petition is pending.Referring to the facts of the case in hand, Justice Madaan asserted: “It is very surprising rather shocking that such type of application which requires urgent attention and prompt action by the court concerned is pending for such a long time and that points towards the casual approach of the presiding officer.”Disposing of the revision petition, Justice Madaan directed the court concerned to decide the application under Section 24 filed by the petitioner-wife by the next date of hearing, which was stated to be November 26.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/high-court-raps-chandigarh-judicial-officer-for-casual-approach-340074

The broad objective was to provide support for decarbonising the city transport and contribute to the climate change agenda.The study would focus on suggesting an alternative eco-friendly transport system for the city, she said. The Adviser appreciated the British High Commission proposal for the study and accorded its concurrence to initiate the project. On conducting the study, the British High Commission would look at various options available across the world and depending upon the requirements of the city, it would give recommendations regarding combination of modes that would be feasible in Chandigarh keeping in view the requirement for the next 20 to 30 years, the UT Adviser said.On the study to be conducted by RITES, he said the agency would prepare an overall mobility plan for a mass rapid transport system (MRTS) for the tricity. Both recommendations would be studied and then a final proposal would be prepared which would be sent to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning for approval, he said.RITES had prepared a report on the city’s mobility plan in 2009. However, the report was found to be outdated as the city’s requirements have changed drastically in the past more than a decade and also, the guidelines set by the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry of the MRTS project have changed.RITES had suggested a Metro, which was opposed by Member of Parliament Kirron Kher. She had said that she would never want a small city like Chandigarh get uprooted for a Metro.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/uk-to-suggest-eco-transport-system-for-chandigarh-340076
