24-11-2021||Amit Sharma||Coming up, roundabouts at 3 light points in Chandigarh||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 23The UT Administration will build roundabouts at three intersections in the city. These will come up at the Press light point (Sector 17/18/8/9), the Transport light point (Sector 26) and the Housing Board light point on Madhya Marg. These are among the busiest light points and also accident-prone spots in the city.The decision was taken during a meeting of the State-level Road Safety Council today. The meeting, which was chaired by UT Adviser Dharam Pal, was attended by SSP (Traffic)Manisha Choudhary among officials from different departments. The focus during the meeting remained on rectifying the black spots/accident-prone areas as well as improving the overall visibility on roads for the safety of road users and to prevent fatalities.Sources said the construction would start soon and the project would be completed in less than six months.The decision to redesign the already existing roundabouts to minimise the impact of vehicle collision was also taken.Navdeep Asija, a member of the council, said stress was laid on the safety of cyclists and pedestrians, especially on roads where cycle tracks were part of the main road.A slight rise was witnessed in deaths of cyclists across Chandigarh. The fatalities rose from 18 per cent in 2016 to 19 per cent last year. While 10 cyclists, all males, died last year, 14, including three females, sustained injuries in the city.In 2020, a majority of pedestrian deaths and injuries due to road crashes were reported from areas where no pedestrian infrastructure was available i.e. 89 per cent, while the remaining 11 per cent deaths and injuries occurred on zebra crossing.

He was seeking directions for being impleaded as a party to the ongoing proceedings initiated by Shiv Kumar against the Chief Electoral Officer and other respondents.Appearing before the Bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Karamjit Singh, Gaurav and Anurag Chopra submitted that the applicant, a resident of Dhanas Housing Complex, was aggrieved by a notification whereby his place of habilitation was excluded from being a reserved ward for the Schedule Caste category. He added the population as of today was not considered while “determining the selection of ward towards the reserved category”.The Bench was also told that the minutes of the meeting dated December 4, 2020, on the delimitation of wards duly laid emphasis on the fact that the latest population data based in the electoral roll would be taken into account for reference for the areas where population dynamics had considerably changed due to the shifting of colonies, which was not reflected in the census data. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/reservation-of-wards-for-chandigarh-mc-poll-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-dismisses-plea-341995
24-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana High Court raps Chandigarh in floor-wise sale of residential buildings case||The Punjab and Haryana High Court today ruled the Chandigarh Administration was deliberately choosing to look the other way regarding floor-wise sale of residential buildings. It, in the process, failed to discharge the onus of being the guardian of the interests of city residents.The Bench of Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Justice Vivek Puri ruled that the Administration chose to stay smug taking a stand on paper that floor-wise sale of residential building was not permissible, while residential floors were being advertised for sale right under its nose. The Bench added that it discovered as many as 24 advertisements for floor-wise sale in the Sunday Tribune, dated July 25. “Surely suchlike advertisements spread over a period of time would be manifold.”The Bench also observed that UT Assistant Estate Officer deposed that the Administration would take steps to issue an advertisement in local newspapers to warn the general public against unverified advertisements on sale of immovable property. But it stood conceded that no such public notice was issued till date. UT additional standing counsel Anil Mehta’s response to a specific query in this regard by the court was that the ‘matter is being deliberated upon’.Referring to a survey report placed on record, the Bench observed that 891 residential buildings had been identified where sale of shares had taken place “within the stipulated time frame”. A number of instances were given where the shareholder was occupying a particular floor in the building.Appearing before the Bench on behalf of the Sarin Memorial Legal Aid Foundation, senior advocate ML Sarin, during the course of arguments, submitted that developers were having a field day and the UT Administration was turning a blind eye to such activity in spite of a clear embargo against a single residential unit being fragmented and apartments being built.The matter was brought to the notice of the High Court after a residents welfare association and another petitioner filed a petition against the Union Territory of Chandigarh and other respondents through senior advocate Puneet Bali, with BS Patwalia, Uday Agnihotri and Gauravjit Patwalia. Before parting with the order, the Bench recorded its appreciation for “valuable assistance” rendered by amicus curiae Chetan Mittal.The respondents were, among others, represented by senior advocates Anand Chhibber, Amit Jhanji Aashish Aggarwal and Gaurav Chopra. President Property Federation, Chandigarh, Kamaljit Singh Panchhi hailed the verdict by saying homebuyers in Chandigarh could rejoice. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-raps-chandigarh-in-floor-wise-sale-of-residential-buildings-case-341997
24-11-2021||Saurabh Malik||Buyer can’t assert exclusive ownership: Punjab and Haryana High Court||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 23The Punjab and Haryana High Court today made it clear that a homebuyer purchasing a share in a residential building before being “put into possession” of a particular floor/specific portion could not assert exclusive ownership of the area. The homebuyer only became a co-owner/co-sharer to the extent of his shareholding in the entire site/building, which remained in joint ownership.The Bench of Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Justice Vivek Puri also made it clear that the Chandigarh Administration did not recognise a homebuyer’s ownership rights over any floor or part of a site or a building by the virtue of purchase of a share or a memorandum of understanding entered into by the co-sharers.The Bench ruled that sale of share by the owner or co-sharer of a residential site/building was not prohibited under the Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulation) Act, 1952, or Rules framed there under. The only remedy in case a dispute arose between the co-sharers/co-owners would be to put the property to auction as “fragmentation/ division of the building/site by metes and bounds was specifically prohibited” under the Chandigarh Building Rules, 2017. The sale proceeds would thereafter be distributed.What it meansThe sale of share by the owner or co-sharer of a residential site/building is permitted. However, the homebuyer purchasing a share does not become the sole and exclusive owner of the specific portion under his occupation. The building remaines in joint ownership.The Bench also directed the UT Administration to issue public notices at periodic intervals in English and vernacular newspapers having circulation in the region. It would underscore the salient features of the judgment for sounding a word of caution and educating homebuyers, who have already purchased a share in a residential building/site, and also the prospective homebuyers.The Bench also directed compulsory incorporation of similar stipulations in the affidavit to be submitted by the purchaser/vendee at the time of execution and registration of a sale deed and again at the stage of submitting transfer applications for entering mutation in the purchaser’s name in the Estate Office record.The stipulations would also be made a part of the transfer letter to be issued by the Estate Office. The Administration was also directed to initiate necessary steps to criminally prosecute, in accordance with law, persons “who may misrepresent through any medium as regards sale of floor/storey/specific portion of a site/building”.The Bench added it would be a matter of concern whether the homebuyer/vendee purchasing a share understood the position. “In our view most homebuyers/vendees do not. To state the obvious, a real estate agent/developer/seller in order to extract maximum premium would paint a picture to the prospective buyer that by virtue of purchase of a share in the building and the same having been recorded in the record of rights, not only exclusive possession, but even ownership rights would vest by entering into a memorandum of understanding inter se the share holders,” the Bench added.Salient features||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/buyer-cant-assert-exclusive-ownership-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-341996
