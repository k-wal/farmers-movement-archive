23-11-2021||Chandigarh||Homebuyer buying share in residential building before being ‘put into possession’ cannot claim exclusive ownership: Punjab and Haryana HC||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday made it clear that a homebuyer purchasing a share in a residential building before being “put into possession” of a particular floor/specific portion cannot assert exclusive ownership of the area. The homebuyer only became a co-owner/co-sharer to the extent of his shareholding in the entire site/building, which remained in joint ownership.The Bench of Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Justice Vivek Puri also made it clear that the Chandigarh Administration did not recognise a homebuyer’s ownership rights over any floor or part of a site or a building by the virtue of purchase of a share or a memorandum of understanding entered into by the co-sharers.The Bench ruled that the only remedy in case a dispute arises between the co-sharers/co-owners would be to put the property to auction as “fragmentation/division of the building/site by metes and bounds was specifically prohibited” under the Chandigarh Building Rules, 2017. The sale proceeds would thereafter be distributed.The Bench also directed the Chandigarh Administration to issue public notices at periodic intervals in English and vernacular newspapers having circulation in the region. It would underscore the salient features of the judgment for sounding a word of caution and educating homebuyers, who have already purchased a share in a residential building/site, and also the prospective homebuyers.The Bench also directed compulsory incorporation of similar stipulations in the affidavit to be submitted by the purchaser/vendee at the time of execution and registration of a sale deed and again at the stage of submitting transfer applications for entering mutation in the purchaser’s name in the Estate Office record.The stipulations would also be made a part of the transfer letter to be issued by the Estate Office. The Administration was also directed to initiate necessary steps to criminally prosecute, in accordance with law, persons “who may misrepresent through any medium as regards sale of floor/storey/specific portion of a site/building”.The Bench added it would be a matter of concern whether the homebuyer/vendee purchasing a share understood the position. “In our view most homebuyers/vendees do not. To state the obvious, a real estate agent/developer/seller in order to extract maximum premium would paint a picture to the prospective buyer that by virtue of purchase of a share in the building and the same having been recorded in the record of rights, not only exclusive possession, but even ownership rights would vest by entering into a memorandum of understanding inter se the share holders,” the Bench added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/homebuyer-buying-share-in-residential-building-before-being-put-into-possession-cannot-claim-exclusive-ownership-punjab-and-haryana-hc-341936

We will be recruiting 100 candidates in the same age group. — Dr Madhu Gupta, Principal Investigator, Covovax trial, PGIThe multi-centre trial is aimed at checking the safety and immune response of (Covid-19 vaccine) Covovax in children, aged two to 17 years.Dr Madhu Gupta, principal investigator of the Covovax trial at the PGI, said, “We have administered the vaccine to eight children in the age group of 2 to 11 and so far, there have been no side effects.”Initially, the PGI was to recruit candidates from two to 17 years for the study, but the trial was started late and the target for enrolling participants was achieved in other centres of the country.All eligible participants will be randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive two doses of 0.5 ml each of either Covovax or Placebo, respectively, on Day 1 and Day 22.The study vaccine is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) in the deltoid or the anterolateral aspect of the thigh as two doses of 0.5 ml each on Day 1 and Day 22. The participants are observed closely for 30 minutes post-vaccination. The study objective in this cohort is to evaluate the safety of Covovax in comparison to Placebo; and immunogenicity of Covovax in children from two to 11 years of age in comparison to adult participants (adult participants in the reactogenicity and immunogenicity cohort from the Covovax group), separately. Reactogenicity refers to a subset of reactions that occur soon after the vaccination and the immunogenicity of the vaccine is the antibody response provoked in the human body after administering the vaccine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/all-8-kids-administered-covovax-safe-says-pgi-341643

Finding no less than two dozen such advertisements in the Sunday edition of newspapers, the Bench had not only rapped the Chandigarh Administration, but also directed the holding of the exercise under the UT Chief Architect’s supervision.The Bench had observed that it thought of scanning the advertisements as the court was seized of the matter and discovered 24 advertisements in the Sunday edition “scouting for purchasers /investors for separate floors/independent floors”.Reproducing the advertisements, the Bench had added it lent credence to the petitioner-Residents Welfare Association that independent floors were being sold under the garb of sale of a certain percentage share of a residential unit.The UT Estate Office had, during the course of the hearing, claimed that it did not issue no-objection certificates mentioning particular floors. “No such NOC mentioning floor on the basis of share of owner/co-owner was issued by the deponent-Assistant Estate Officer or any of his predecessors as per records,” it was asserted.In an affidavit placed before the Bench, it was added that the only exceptions were the “ones which may have been issued on the basis of registered sale deeds executed while the Chandigarh Apartment Rules-2001 were in vogue”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-floor-wise-apartment-sale-case-verdict-today-341646

The city had to settle for a distant 66th position among 4,320 cities which participated in the survey. However, the city has bagged an award for the best -performing Union Territory under the “Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge” for 2021.Expressing concern over the decline in the city’s rankings in the national survey, UT Adviser Dharam Pal said a meeting was scheduled for November 24 to review the reasons responsible for the poor performance of the city in the survey.At the meeting, each officer of the Municipal Corporation (MC) and the Administration would be given responsibility and their performance linked with the performance of their department, he said, adding that if there was no improvement in the performance of the department, the officer concerned would be responsible for it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-to-fix-accountability-for-poor-show-in-swachh-survekshan-341650

Also, the sitting area needs a minor modification.“A tender has been floated to install 20 foot-long steel (chain linked) wire fencing behind both the goal posts to stop the ball from going out on the road. It will be installed soon. There are few other minor demands raised by the UT Sports Department which will be completed in the coming time,” said an official of the UT Engineering Department.Questions have also been raised on the structure of the ground, which has been built into an open arena.Before refurbishing the ground, claims were made to host national/international matches there. However, it may be difficult, considering the open layout of the ground and allied security reasons.The other football grounds in the city have been built inside the sports complexes.The ground has been developed as a part of the ‘Urban Park’ multipurpose facility.As per the approved plan, the UT Engineering Department had planned to make a multipurpose ground, badminton courts, cycling and skating park along with the football arena.Underground changing rooms, permanent sitting stands, a huge screen, a commentary room, big hall for players and officials and other facilities were also expected.It was also proposed to have three entry gates for the fans, besides a players’ entry.“We will surely try to conduct national level matches at the venue once we get the possession of the ground,” said Sunil Rayat, Joint Director, Sports, UT Sports Department.“The condition of the playing arena is pretty good. The only problem is the open structure of the ground. I think covering the area behind the goal posts will solve a majority of the purpose. It will be interesting to see if this ground gets approval to host any major championship,” said Harpinder, a former footballer.“Only the direction of the field has changed and there has been a remarkable improvement in gym facilities,” said a senior football coach. “However, I have my doubts regarding the space to make team dugouts, area to hold ambulances right on the sidelines of the ground, spectators stand and other facilities,” the coach added.“The department will host their annual sports event – the UT Administrator’s All India Cup – at the venue. It is an invitational championship. However, getting clearance for hosting national or international events may be a difficult task,” said another official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/4-yrs-on-no-clarity-on-chandigarhs-sec-17-football-stadium-341651

The reserve price often turns out to be higher than the bid price by at least 20 per cent,” said association members.The members, while citing a few similar examples, said: “A person had purchased a residential plot at a bid of Rs1.35 crore, which was auctioned at a base price of Rs88 lakh in the end of July. After he paid the 10 per cent booking amount, he was informed via an email that the reserve price for the property was Rs1.66 crore. Since then, the matter has been ending with HSVP officials wherein they are neither returning the money nor giving him the possession of the plot.”“The HSVP is befooling people by giving out lucrative base prices while hiding the actual amount it will charge. The policy further allows the HSVP to give this plot as per its ‘discretion’, which causes discrimination. Whenever there is discrimination, there will be corruption,” they said.Suresh Aggarwal, president of the association, said: “The HSVP was initially started for no-profit, no-loss and for the betterment of people so that they may come to Haryana and make a home for themselves at a reasonable cost.”Calling the HSVP policies ‘anti-developmental’, the association members cited it as the main reason behind “people shifting to Mohali from Panchkula”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/assn-questions-hsvps-revised-e-auction-policy-341657

Moreover, they arbitrarily raise monthly charges for door-to-door collection.There is no disposal and processing of around 120 tonnes of trash generated by the city daily in the absence of a solid waste management plant.Chandigarh Tribune spoke to representatives of residential welfare associations and ward councillors to get their views on the issue.SK Nayar, president of the Citizens’ Welfare Association, said: “MC officials have just deceived people in the name of beautification. Regarding cleanliness, nothing concrete has been done by the civic body. Everything is just on paper and ground reality is totally different.”Bharat Hiteshi, chairman of the House Owners’ Welfare Association, Sector 10, said: “Steep fall in the cleanliness rankings has punctured the tall claims of the MC for its so-called strenuous efforts to improve overall cleanliness in the city. For so many years, residents are being given assurances of efficient door-to-door collection of garbage, but no positive results have come yet.”BR Mehta, senior vice-president of the Sector 25 RWA, said: “The BJP came to power in Haryana as well as the local Municipal Corporation with a promise to make Panchkula a smart city. Contrary to its promise, solid waste is being dumped illegally at the Jhuriwala dumping ground in clear violation of the laid guidelines and requisite permissions.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/slip-in-rankings-panchkula-residents-blame-poor-waste-collection-lack-of-solid-waste-plant-341660

No specific allegations have been made against the accused in the FIR and the chargesheet. The action of the Chandigarh MC was genuine and nothing wrong was done by the accused. The action of the applicants or their company in no way caused any harm to the MC. No internal inquiry was ever conducted by the civic body. Thus, the accused deserved to be discharged.The public prosecutor for the CBI stated that at the stage of framing of charge, the court was not required to go into the intricacies of the case and rather, only a prima facie case was to be seen.There is sufficient evidence on file to prove the criminal conspiracy, cheating and offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act by different accused. There is enough evidence of the witnesses and, thus, at this stage, there is no merit in the applications. Any defence of the accused can be seen when the evidence is produced and at present their applications deserve dismissal.After hearing the arguments, the court dismissed the applications saying law is well settled that at the time of framing of charge only a prima facie case is to be seen and the court is not required to see as to whether the evidence on file will ultimately lead to the conviction of the accused or not.The CBI had registered the case against the accused in 2014 for allegedly causing loss to the Municipal Corporation. The case was registered against the then Superintending Engineer and officials of the company entrusted with the responsibility to maintain public toilets, under Sections 120-B and 420 of the IPC for cheating, criminal conspiracy and Sections 13 (2) read with 13 (1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.The CBI filed the charge sheet in the case in October 2016. In the chargesheet, the CBI alleged that the then Superintending Engineer had exempted licence fee and advertisement fee/tax by way of two allotment letters to the company for which there was no approval from the competent authority. Based on the allotment letters, the company did not give the advertisement fee to the MC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-toilet-scam-discharge-pleas-of-accused-dismissed-341663
