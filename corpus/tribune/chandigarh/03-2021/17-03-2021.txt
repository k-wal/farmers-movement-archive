Kuldeep Vats, a representative of the IOA who also attended the March 8 elections (conducted by one of the COA factions), will perform the same duty on March 17 elections to be conducted by another faction. The March 8 elections were organised by former general secretary of the COA Maha Singh, wherein his son was elected as the president, and tomorrow’s elections are going to be organised by former president of the COA Amarinder Singh Bazaz, who is re-contesting for the top post. “Kuldeep Vats has been nominated to oversee the elections under the official capacity of the ‘election observer’ for the March 17 elections,” said a highly placed source. Vats remained unavailable for his comments. On March 8, he had confirmed to have attended those elections under the official capacity. However, no document was produced. IOA chief Narinder Dhruv Batra had already issued a circular confirming that this exercise (appointing observer) is not mandatory. However, appointment of a same person to perform same duty in parallel elections has taken many into state of shock. The sources also claimed that the announcement made by Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, Punjab Sports Minister and life president of the COA, on being chosen as the COA’s representative in the IOA on March 8, has not gone well with many in the higher-ups. The announcement (about Sodhi) was not included in the minutes of the annual general meeting, held recently, confirmed sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/same-election-observer-for-two-parallel-factions-226294

Appearing before the Bench through videoconferencing, Navkiran Singh submitted that the Punjab Industrial Development Board invited proposals for construction of the bus terminal-cum-commercial complex at Mohali.The proposal of Gurugram-based M/s C&C Constructions Limited was accepted and the contract was awarded. However, the company constituted a special purpose company (SPC) “M/s C&C Towers Limited” for undertaking the construction.M/s C&C Constructions Limited furnished a deed of guarantee and a certificate that it had 100 per cent equity in the SPC. Navkiran Singh further submitted that the petitioners, along with nearly 400 other innocent buyers, invested in the project for purchase of retail shops/commercial space. In this manner, approximately Rs490 crore was collected by M/s C&C Towers Limited, which was a subsidiary of M/s C&C Constructions Limited.He also told the court that the construction was to be completed by 2011, but it did not make any headway. The petitioners and other investors were left in the lurch after investing huge amounts. “In this manner, the directors and other office-bearers of M/s C&C Constructions Limited and the SPC created by it, defrauded the investors of a huge amount of about Rs490 crore,” he submitted.The Bench was also told that several FIRs were registered against the companies and its directors. However, the police had not conducted a fair investigation inasmuch as they had virtually given a clean chit to the directors of the parent “defaulting company, namely Amritpal Singh Chadha and Rajbir Singh, on the grounds that they had no concern with the SPC”.Even Col CVS Sehgal, chief general manager of the company, was declared innocent as per the inquiry report. Navkiran Singh added that Gurjeet Singh Johar, chairman of the “defaulting company”, and Charanvir Singh Sethi, whose anticipatory bail applications were dismissed, were shown undue favour by the police. Despite dismissal of their bail applications, they were released on personal bonds.Navkiran Singh contended that it was evident that a biased investigation was being conducted and the real culprits, who siphoned off crores of rupees, were not being taken to task. In such circumstances, the investigation was required to be conducted by some independent agency such as the CBI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/mohali-bus-terminal-cum-commercial-complex-hc-puts-punjab-on-notice-on-plea-seeking-cbi-probe-226313
