The family members of the victims today alleged that the suspects were using their political influence and money to change the evidence and pressure eyewitnesses.“We have the evidence to prove that someone from a suspect’s family has visited a victim, Shri Pal, a cyclist who is admitted to a private hospital, to threaten his family and influence the probe,” they alleged.Incident took place week agoThree sole earning members of each family were left dead and another three seriously injured in the accident. Samrat Singh, who was at the wheel at the time of the accident, and his two teenaged accomplices had fled the spot, leaving the victims behind.Zirakpur resident Rajni Narula, wife of deceased Ankush Narula and who is eight-month pregnant, said, “We seek a speedy justice from the Mohali police. Two accomplices, who are rich brats with political influence, are still absconding. Have the Mohali police been outsmarted by two teenagers for so many days or are cops giving them a long rope?’’The family members of the victims demanded that Section 109 of the IPC should be immediately added to the FIR.“The tower location of the phones of the accused at the time of the accident should be taken on record. CCTV footage of the crime location should also be considered,” they demanded during a candle march for speedy justice at Sector 17, near the Weldon Opticians showroom in whose name the car is registered.The showroom was closed today but some members placed candles in front of its shutter and moved on to take a round of the Plaza with passersby and showroom owners watching in silence.The victims’ kin appealed to the Punjab Government to announce a compensation for the three bereaved families.Mataur resident Shubham, son of Ram Prasad, one of the deceased, said, “I have four sisters and mother to take care of. I don’t know how I will manage,” said the Class XII student, who has Board exams next month. The 17-year-old’s shaven head and a big family to take care of is in stark contrast to the absconding teenagers who have their “families’ backing”.Narrating a typical poor man’s plight, Shubham said, “I reached the spot but my father was already taken to a hospital. In front of my eyes, a person came and put an arm around a turbaned cop and asked him to settle the matter. At the hospital, doctors refused to hand over the body to me and my wailing mother, saying it is in the unclaimed section and the police would perform the last rites. ‘Tum jao yahan se’, they said.”Gholumajra resident Amanpreet Singh, 17, brother of Dharampreet Singh, another deceased, is worried about his aged father, who works as a daily wager. “He wanted to come to the candle march but his blood pressure is not in control. He faints time and again. My brother started working two years ago. Our family’s all hopes were on him.”Mataur resident Kajal, wife of injured cyclist Shri Pal, said, “I don’t know whether my husband will be able to work again. He has multiple fractures and has already undergone two surgeries. I have small kids to take care of.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/money-influence-at-play-to-save-suspects-231465
