Having worked extremely well for decades, the Senate, as the highest governing body of the university, has now been defamed as faulty,” the letter reads.The PUTA has criticised the manner in which the designated portal will be functional only for seven days, on which all stakeholders are supposed to submit their inputs.The letter further reads: “It is a matter of great concern that the high-level committee seems to be in a great hurry to demolish the democratic and people-centric governance structure of Panjab University in the name of governance reforms, without even inviting inputs from the stakeholders of the university, as if there is a pre-determined agenda given to them.”The association requested the Chancellor to direct the committee to invite all stakeholders with an open mind, instead of rushing to meet any deadlines.The Government of India had constituted an 11-member high-level committee for recommending governance reforms at PU in the light of the National Education Policy 2020.

With the reopening of boating at Sukhna Lake from November 1, CITCO had earned Rs1.64 lakh from boating on the first day itself.However, the corporation was yet to get more than Rs10 crore from the UT Administration on account of expenses incurred on running a UT guest house in New Delhi and a canteen at the UT Secretariat in the city.CITCO has been running and managing the UT Secretariat canteen since April 1983 and the New Delhi guest house since November 1984.Kashmir Chand, chairman, CITCO Progressive Workers’ Union, said the UT Administration must release the amount at the earliest as revenues of the corporation had been adversely affected due to the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/citco-to-get-bailout-package-of-rs-27-crore-224357

This was told to the Punjab and Haryana High Court by the Chandigarh Administration during the hearing of a petition. Its senior standing counsel informed a Division Bench of the High Court that a notification issued more than four years ago made it clear that such an order was without jurisdiction.The Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Meenakshi I. Mehta was hearing the petition filed by the UT Administration and other petitioners against Amit Sharmaand other respondents. As the service matter came up for preliminary hearing before the Bench on a previous date of hearing, the Judges asked the UT senior standing counsel, Pankaj Jain, to explain whether the order under challenge passed by a single member of the Tribunal was sustainable. Jain, under the circumstances, sought some time to examine the issue. Taking a note of his submission, the matter was adjourned for further hearing.As the case came up for resumed hearing, Jain produced the notification dated September 8, 2016, which was taken on record by the Bench. Referring to the notification, Jain told the Bench that a bare perusal of the document made it clear that the order passed by the single member of the Tribunal would be coram non judice.The Latin legal maxim means “not before a judge” and is basically used to indicate a proceeding before a court lacking the authority to hear and decide the case in question.Taking a note of the submissions, the Bench asserted: “In view of the above, we deem it fit to relegate the petitioners to the same authority for moving an appropriate application to consider its plea”. The Bench, with the direction, disposed of the matter.The case is significant as it means orders passed by a single member of the Tribunal would be considered as lacking jurisdiction in view of the notification.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/cat-single-members-order-not-sustainable-chandigarh-tells-high-court-224365

Specimen signatures of the accused were obtained in court and were sent to the CFSL and its report was obtained. On completion of the entire investigation, a challan was presented.After hearing the arguments, the judge in his order said that the accused deserve to be convicted under section 419 IPC read with 120-B IPC.It stands proved that accused Harmesh Singh put his signatures on the attendance sheet of accused Niranjan Singh, representing as Niranjan Singh and he was apprehended at the spot as stated by Investigating Officer. Merely because the accused had not yet appeared in the recruitment test, does not wash out the offence committed by them, the judge observed.They were apprehended in the holding area and accused Harmesh Singh was about to appear in the test representing himself as Niranjan Singh. So, both the accused were part of a criminal conspiracy to commit the offence of cheating by impersonation, the judge added.“Taking into consideration the gravity of the offence, no ground is made out to take a lenient view and accordingly both convicts are sentenced to undergo RI for a period of two years each with a fine of Rs 1,000 each,” read the order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/two-fazilka-residents-sentenced-to-two-year-ri-for-impersonation-224380

13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Comorbid patients in Chandigarh hit certificate hurdle to get jab||Persons with comorbidities are facing hiccups in getting the Covid-19 vaccine due to certification issues. As a result, only 1,512 in this priority group have received the first dose of the vaccine.Many individuals from this priority group claim that they are facing difficulty in getting the certificate for comorbidity as either the conditions in the category of the disease are too stringent or the medical practitioner is not willing to sign the certificate.On the contrary, as many as 15,848 beneficiaries above 60 years of age have got the vaccine as they do not require any certification of comorbidity.As per the rule, the beneficiary falling in the age group of 45 to 59 years will be prompted to confirm if he/she has any specified comorbidity. In such cases, the beneficiary will also be advised to bring the comorbidity certificate signed by a registered medical practitioner.Gopal Krishan (56), a resident of Sector 47, said, “My wife is a patient of asthma for the past 30 years. I have been visiting the GMCH-32 for getting a certificate of comorbidity but no doctor from the hospital is certifying it. I am being told that the GMCH authorities will first appoint officials who will sign the comorbidity certificate. Doctors tell me that they have not been given the authority to sign the certificate.”Mamta (47) from Sector 30 said, “I have diabetes for the past six years. I am also hypertensive. But I am not taking medicine for hypertension and this makes me ineligible for vaccination. On the one hand, cases are rising rapidly while on the other hand, the common man does not have access to the vaccine with such stringent rules.”There is a list of 20 comorbidities given by the Centre. The major comorbidities are diabetes (more than 10 years or with complications) and hypertension on treatment; heart failure with hospital admission in the past one year; moderate or severe valvular heart disease; pulmonary artery hypertension.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/comorbid-patients-in-chandigarh-hit-certificate-hurdle-to-get-jab-224385
