TNSChandigarh going Punjab wayThe infection is spreading rapidly in the city just like Punjab. It is very difficult to isolate so many people travelling from Punjab to Chandigarh.

14-03-2021||Ramkrishan Upadhyay||Inspector sent to police remand for two days||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 13A local court today remanded Inspector Rajdeep Singh, arrested in the Sector-37 house grab case, in two-day police custody.The special investigation team (SIT) of the police arrested Rajdeep yesterday. He is the fourth accused arrested in the case after journalist Sanjiv Mahajan, realtor Manish Gupta and Satpal Dagar. The police have arrested Rajdeep on the charge of not taking any action on a complaint filed against the accused.In the remand paper, the police said the accused was the Station House officer of Sector 39 and being in charge of the police station, he, in connivance of co-accused Sanjeev Mahajan and Surjit (a bouncer), played an active role in grabbing the property.The police told the court that from the very beginning when the incident of trespassing on the property occurred, it was to the notice of the accused, but instead of taking any legal action against the other accused, he helped them to grab the property for his personal interest.The police said it was a sensational case and more accused were yet to be arrested.The police had sought five-day remand of the accused for the recovery of the original complaint regarding trespass on the house along with a medical certificate of the owner of the house, Rahul Mehta, which was personally given to the accused by the complainant at his office in the police station on January 14, 2017. The police said that the accused neither took any action on that complaint nor did he enter the same in the police station record.Meanwhile, Harish Bhardwaj, counsel appearing for Rajdeep, said he was falsely implicated in the case. The inspector was the supervising officer and the investigation of the complaint was carried out by the investigating officer (a sub-inspector) who told the inspector that there was a landlord-tenant dispute. A DDR was also registered on his behalf. The complaint was also not filed by the victim but by some other person.It was alleged in the FIR that a health certificate regarding owner Rahul Mehta’s mental health, which was attached with the complaint, was removed by the SHO, who kept it in his pocket.According to the FIR, some of the accused entered a two-storey house of Rahul Mehta in Sector 37 and forcefully took possession of the first floor in March 2017.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/inspector-sent-to-police-remand-for-two-days-224894
