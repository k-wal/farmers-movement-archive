This despite the fact that most cases were being reported from residential areas, villages and government offices in the city, he added. “The Administration has adopted a pick-and-choose policy. How will we survive and pay rent, employees’ salary, electricity and water bills and other taxes?” Vohra asked.All shops, barring those selling grocery, bakery items and medicines, remained closed in the city today. Several shopkeepers in Mani Majra reached the market to open their shops in the morning. On getting information, senior police officials reached there and prevented them from opening their shops.UT Adviser Manoj Parida said the decision to close the shops on weekends was taken to prevent shoppers’ rush. “We have no plans to disrupt the normal functioning of private sector offices, industries, hotels and banks, which can operate by observing social distancing norms,” he said. Neeraj Bajaj, president, Chandigarh Business Council, stated that the weekend lockdown gave a jolt to the business community. “Two-day lockdown results in 40 per cent loss of business,” he added. Bajaj and Vohra appealed to the Administration to review the decision and allow shops to open seven days a week.Situation in MohaliThe weekend lockdown was enforced fully in Kumbhra, Sohana, Mataur, Shahi Majra, Madanpur and Mohali city. Eateries and shops selling confectionery items, groceries, medicines and other essentials remained open. While small shops in Zirakpur were closed, stores like DMart, Walmart and Metro were open. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/chandigarh-shopkeepers-protest-weekend-lockdown-130080

Now, because of the pandemic, we haven’t been allowed to have such a gathering here.”The time period of the immersion of Ganesha idols, which would usually be done 10 days after the ‘puja’, has been snipped short too. “Before the pandemic, a large number of people gathered on the banks of the Ghaggar in Panchkula to immerse Ganesha idols. This would usually happen 10 days after the ‘puja’. But now, we will be immersing the idols here in a water barrel on August 24,” Sane said. Prof Jayanth Narayan Pethkar from School of Communication Studies, PU, is a regular visitor to the bhawan. He said, “This time, the festival lacks fervour. At all previous celebrations of the festival, this place would be jam-packed with people, but now, because of the pandemic and the lockdown, people are mostly celebrating it at home.”Artist Pradeep Das, who makes Ganesha idols, said, “Last year, I sold more than 40 idols of Lord Ganesha, but this year, the business has been slow. I have not even been able to sell 20 idols this time.”Pradeep Bansal of Ganapati Mahautsav Sabha, Sector 32, said, “At Gugga Madi mandir, an eco-friendly idol of Lord Ganesha has been installed.
