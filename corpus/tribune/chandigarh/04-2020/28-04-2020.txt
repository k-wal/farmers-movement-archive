Singh has been appointed as the Principal Coordinator for the establishment of these testing facilities, while R.K. Ratho is a member of the committee. Both are from the Virology Department.A total of 40 lab personnel, including senior faculty members from various medical colleges and medical institutes, have been trained in the Department of Virology from April 4 to April 26 which is also providing diagnostic services for testing around 200 samples per day for COVID-19.

Even crayons are given for drawing. We try to keep them busy," he said, adding that it helps them develop a bond with the children so they do not create any problem during sampling.The children also get to talk to their family members through video-conferencing to make them more comfortable."We play musical rhymes on Youtube and give them pen and paper to scribble," Sahu added.Currently, four COVID-19 positive children ‚Äì a one-month-old, a six-month-old, a one-and-a-half-year old and an eight-year-old ‚Äì are admitted to the PGIMER, Chandigarh. All of them are asymptomatic.On Sunday, an 11-month-old baby girl, along with her mother, was discharged from the PGI after they were fully cured of the infection."Though both mother and daughter were stable physically but psychologically, it was a very stressful experience to stay isolated."The mother reported significant distress during her stay at the ward and was consistently counselled through video-conferencing to address her anxiety and anger. Despite testing negative, she had to stay for a long period of time as her baby had tested positive," said Sahu.

Personally speaking, she hasn‚Äôt stepped out of the gate of her house since March 21 and it‚Äôs not been all that a challenge.‚ÄúThe real challenge lies in bringing normalcy back into our lives and psychology once all this over.‚ÄùSomething she intends to channelise all her energy into once the college reopens. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd still like to maintain social distancing though. And I also don‚Äôt think we should celebrate by immediately resorting back to the old ways.‚ÄùThe lessons learnt shouldn‚Äôt be forgotten anytime soon. Personally speaking, it‚Äôs the morning walks she misses the most, baring which the rest of the day goes on smoothly with the similar routine as before. ‚ÄúMy day begins early, with a cup of tea, followed by half an hour devoted listening to Gurbaani, telecast live from the Golden Temple.‚ÄùAnd then before she knows it, the rest of the day goes by. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve covered the syllabus through online classes and in fact, are now onto online assessment. However, the modalities on the next session and the next year‚Äôs admissions are still being worked upon.‚Äù Currently at home with her husband, and with both her daughters based in the US, the day doesn‚Äôt begin or end before exchanging ‚ÄòAll Good‚Äô messages with both of them.In a span of less than eight weeks, there has been a complete reversal of life and lifestyles, then there are domestic pets and stray animals, who are probably grappling with intuitions of their own too.‚ÄúThere is this third generation of stray cats that I have been looking after. While earlier they would come twice a day for food, now knowing I‚Äôll be home all the time, they visit thrice a day,‚Äù she laughs, adding how that‚Äôs not the only thing that staying at home has taught her.‚ÄúI must have cooked after 20 years and initially I was quite stressed out about how I‚Äôll cope up, but to my own surprise I not just managed but also I am enjoying cooking.‚Äù In fact, she is happy with having perfected ‚Äòpeas pulao‚Äô and even ‚Äòchhola bhatura.‚Äô ‚ÄúI made it twice during this period,‚Äù she adds laughingly.Though cooking might be a new pursuit, reading has always been a part of life. ‚ÄúThese days I am reading Ten Judgements that Changed India by Zia Modi.‚Äù Sure she must have her to-do list when the lockdown ends? ‚ÄúHonestly, I miss being physically present in my office. That‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôll do, go sit there and soak it all in. In fact on working days, I don‚Äôt come to know when it‚Äôs time to leave for home.‚Äù Hopefully, very soon it‚Äôll be time to leave for office too.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/lessons-learnt-shouldnt-be-forgotten-77231

This has prompted the hospital administration to keep a reserve force of health workers.Of the seven health workers, who tested Covid positive, six are from the GMCH-32, and one from the PGIMER.When asked about the source of infection in non-Covid areas, Dr BS Chavan, Director Principal, GMCH-32, said, ‚ÄúThe first case from Bapu Dham Colony, who is also the GMCH staff, was working in the operation theatre (OT). Subsequent contacts from the GMCH were also working with him in the surgical and orthopaedic OT.‚Äù‚ÄúTwo doctors are from anaesthesia, who were also working with them in the OT. The primary source of infection is either ward attendant himself or Bapu Dham Colony,‚Äù he added.The PGIMER Director, Dr Jagat Ram, said, ‚ÄúWe have deliberated upon the need to test patients coming to the OT. Patients coming from other states should be tested locally so that emergency cases can be handled promptly.

About 3,000 sex workers are registered with Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society and a majority of this chunk belongs to women residing in impoverished colonies and slums located on the city‚Äôs fringes. Though the first half of the instalment from a sum of Rs 3,000, given by the National Institute of Social Defence (NISD), an autonomous body under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, has been sent to the NGOs in the city for transgender and men-to-men sex workers (MSM), the women are left to fend for themselves. Since none of the workers agreed to come on record as most of them are staying with their families during the lockdown, several NGOs working closely with their health concerns narrated their ordeal. Sandeep Mittal, deputy director, Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society, said, ‚ÄúTheir business has hit a new financial low. Since there are no designated red-light areas in the city, most of them operate from home and through telephones. We have around 3,000 sex workers registered with NGOs working for preventing AIDS.‚Äù He said most of the sex workers registered with the NGOs were from colonies and slums. ‚ÄúAlso, most sex workers here are home-based as there is no brothel in the city; so they don‚Äôt reveal their identity. Most of them, who are registered with us, are from the economically weaker section of society. A few of them have alternate jobs to earn extra income,‚Äù he informed Mittal. Working with Indian Public Health Association, Tapan Singh, who has a composite project that tends to male sex workers or MSMs and transgenders said, ‚ÄúUnlike the women sex workers, transgenders and MSMs are not home-based. Nevertheless, they have received the first half of Rs 3000, a two-part instalment by the NISD. We have a total of 150 transgenders and MSMs registered with us and a sum of Rs 1,500 will be credited to their account.‚Äù Pinky Rani, project manager at Yuvsatta, has been closely working with those involved in sex trade. ‚ÄúBecause of the lockdown, the sex trade has been affected. Most workers are not able to head out and there are no customers,‚Äù she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/women-sex-workers-left-to-fend-for-themselves-say-city-ngos-77220

28-04-2020||Looking ahead||India needs ICUs, not just ventilators||Dr Harinder K Bali¬†& Dr Priyanka GoyalAs India battles Covid-19, a number of serious fault lines have been exposed in our public health system. We seem to have done reasonably well in limiting the spread of the disease till now. This has been possible despite and not because of our public healthcare system.The real challenge will arise when there is a progressive easing of the lockdown. In the absence of widespread testing, we have no idea about the extent of the spread of the disease in the community. Are we just seeing the tip of the iceberg? We also have started to believe that a majority of our citizens are immune to serious consequences of the disease. The widespread use of hydroxychloroquine to the national policy of uniform BCG vaccination have all been offered as possible explanations for this hypothesis.Worldwide, there has been lot of talk about ventilators. This is because lungs are the predominant organs that are affected by this disease and ventilators are used to provide temporary support to patients who are unable to get enough oxygen for their body on their own. A feeling seems to have taken root that if we have enough ventilators, we can save more lives.Ventilators are certainly one of the most essential components for management of these critically sick patients, but certainly not the only components. What we need are fully equipped and optimally managed intensive care units (ICUs). We need:Manpowera) Enough trained intensivists to manage these ICUsb) Specially trained nurses to handle critically sick patientsc) Medical officers trained to evaluate patients and carry out instructions under the supervision of intensivistsd) Respiratory therapists/ physiotherapistse) GDAs to assist medical officers and nursesf) Biomedical engineers to regularly check the medical equipment, identify trouble shooting.g) Sterilisation departmentEquipmenta) Ventilators, obviously the most important partb) All patients with critical diseases need to have monitorsc) Minimum of three to four infusion pumps would be required per patientd) Portable dialysis machineWith a few exceptions (Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and J&K), most states have a completely dysfunctional public healthcare system. Most hospitals have no ICUs. There is no infrastructure, no qualified manpower and no equipment. Either there is no equipment or whatever is present is lying defunct for want of maintenance and qualified manpower.It is ironic that even small nursing homes have 6-10 bed functional ICUs in the private sector. The present pandemic has completely exposed the inadequacies of our public healthcare system. It is a huge opportunity to get it back on track.The government has already placed an order for around 50,000 ventilators. We also need to have all other equipment that is essential to run these ICUs. More important, we need to rapidly train manpower required to manage these units. If we start now, it will take nine months to a year to have these ICUs in an optimally functional state.Till more trained intensivists become available, we should have aggressive short-term training for physicians and anaesthetists. We can also utilise the services of second and third-year DNB students to tide over the acute manpower shortage.We must not lose this opportunity to reboot our dysfunctional public healthcare system. India needs more fully equipped and properly manned ICUs in each and every sub-district.Dr Bali is a leading¬†cardiologist and Dr Goyal a cardiac anaesthetist||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/india-needs-icus-not-just-ventilators-77218
