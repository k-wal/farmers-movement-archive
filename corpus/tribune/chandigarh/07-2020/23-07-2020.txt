The students were to be given grades on pro-rata basis on their current semester’s internal continuous assessment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/can-students-be-passed-on-basis-of-previous-semester-performance-hc-to-panjab-university-117013

23-07-2020||---||Housing policy tweaked to permit more flats per acre||Chandigarh, July 22The Punjab Housing Department has tweaked its “Affordable Housing Policy”, giving additional incentives, including allowing more flats, increased saleable area, less parking and better floor area ratio (FAR).Key Takeaways Of Affordable Housing PolicyMaximum plot size for construction of affordable houses has been capped at 150 sq yd while for EWS it will be 100 sq ydIt is mandatory to keep 10 per cent of the total number of residential flats reserved for EWSIn the tweaked policy, the department by doing away with density norm has allowed promoters to raise up to 130 flats per acre, compared to 60 flats permissible in the previous policy.“This has been achieved by allowing a realistic 60 per cent saleable area, removing mandatory school, dispensary and religious site and instead giving a community centre. Moreover, an FAR of 1:3 for group housing socities,” said a senior official of the department.Sarvjit Singh, Secretary, Housing, said the policy would give a secure alternative to people who get trapped in illegal colonies.The department has reduced saleable area from 65 per cent to 60 per cent and increased green areas from 6 per cent to 8 per cent of the project area.Clearing misconception about reduction in saleable area, an official said, “In the earlier policy, actual saleable area came to near 55 per cent against 65 allowed on papers. Now, with more incentives, the actual saleable area will be 60 per cent,” said a senior official in the town planning wing.In case of parking, equivalent car space (ECS) for a 600 sq yd plot has been reduced to 0.5 ECS from 1 ECS.For a plot above 600 sq yd and up to 900 sq yd, an ECS of one has been allowed in the tweaked policy.Explaining the new policy, an official said unplanned growth was happening on the outskirts of towns and this policy would help in curtailing it.For areas under SAS Nagar Master Plan, a minimum 25 acres and 10 acres and for New Chandigarh Master Plan minimum 100 acres and five acres are required, respectively.At present, the department has prepared a master plan of only 44 of the 156 towns.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/housing-policy-tweaked-to-permit-more-flats-per-acre-116572

The committee would go through the entire issue before submitting its report. For the purpose, the Bench set a two-week deadline.“The committee shall be at liberty to seek the assistance of the Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Chandigarh, or any other authority competent to throw light on the matter,” Justice Gupta asserted on behalf of the Bench.Giving details, Justice Gupta asserted that the court was not an expert body to express its opinion on the issue of proper disposal of medical waste. As such, the court found it imperative to direct the examination of the matter by an expert medical team “so that the needful is done in a proper manner in the existing Covid-19 conditions”.The Bench was hearing a petition filed by Paramjit Singh against the UT and other respondents on making the health infrastructure more robust by underscoring the issue of collection, treatment and transportation of bio-medical waste generated in Chandigarh.The issue before the Bench was whether such hazardous waste was disposed of in a proper manner, “particularly in the conditions prevailing in view of Covid-19”. A status report filed on behalf of the UT Pollution Control Board in response to the contentions raised in the petition was placed before the Bench during the course of the hearing.Among other things, it said Chandigarh had only one biomedical waste treatment facility for collection, transportation and disposal of biomedical waste generated by healthcare facilities in the city.The affidavit added that there were around 900 healthcare facilities operational in Chandigarh. All units were having an agreement with the biomedical waste treatment facility.All healthcare facilities operational in Chandigarh were segregating biomedical waste in accordance with the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016, and handing it over it to the biomedical waste treatment facility for the final disposal.The biomedical waste from all the healthcare facilities was transported in 10 different vehicles to the treatment facility located in the Industrial Area for final treatment, it added.The case will now come up for further hearing in August second week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/experts-panel-to-look-into-disposal-of-medical-waste-116807
