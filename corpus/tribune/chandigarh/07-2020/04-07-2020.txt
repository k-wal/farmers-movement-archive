Under exceptional circumstances, more flights might be considered, he added.Dayalan said: “The respective state governments may designate their nodal officers from whom an NoC or permission is to be sought and who shall be responsible for making arrangements to collect or transport their passengers to their respective states. The names and the contact details of the nodal officers may be communicated to the office of the Director, Civil Aviation via email.”The Deputy Commissioner said the airlines/charter/any other operators seeking permission would ensure that if all passengers in the flight are from Punjab, they might apply for permission to the office of the Director, Civil Aviation.If any passengers in the flight were from states other than Punjab, then before applying for permission to the office of Director, Civil Aviation, they would have to seek permission/NOC from the nodal officer of the state concerned, the DC added.He said they would also supply an undertaking from the nodal officer of the state concerned that the arrangements for the transport of passengers from the airport to the respective state and further institutional quarantine (in that state) would be made by the respective state government.The DC added: “They shall give a soft copy of the flight manifest in the specified format clearly giving a breakup of the passengers of Punjab (clearly mentioning destination district) and passengers from the other states while applying for the permission.”The permission may be applied at least two days before the intended date of arrival. This would facilitate coordination with the other districts/other states for movement of these passengers from the airport. Furthermore, all passengers should be informed of the quarantine requirements of the respective state before boarding/booking the flight.All passengers from Punjab shall download the COVA App and should make bookings in advance in hotels for their institutional quarantine in their destination districts on the app itself. Pertinently, as per guidelines of the MHA and the government of Punjab, all international passengers arriving into the state must undergo institutional quarantine for the first seven days followed by home quarantine for the next seven days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/only-two-international-flights-a-day-to-be-permitted-at-chandigarh-international-airport-108533

His counsel contended that a 22-foot-wide approach road to the residential society was already in existence.The Bench also asked the Secretary to explain whether then Secretary SS Sandhu was in any manner involved either himself, through his family or immediate relative at any point of time from the purchase of the land till date.The Bench asked for the reason and basis for issuing a notification dated July 8, 2011, stating that the acquisition would take place at the expense of the society and on what basis and for what reason it was changed vide a corrigendum to read “public expense”.Details were also sought regarding the status of the road, and whether it was part of the original master plan. If not a part, at what stage was the road planned and on what basis was the modification/amendment to the master plan carried out to include the road.The Secretary was also asked to explain how the 22-foot-wide road leading to the society was depicted in the master/development plan. The Bench also sought details of the procedure involved in dealing with objections under Section 5-A to a declaration under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, and whether any officer having interest in the society himself or through his family was part of the dealing of the acquisition proceedings.The Bench also asked for details of landowners and farmers affected by the land acquisition for the road catering to the society and the number of residential units planned/sanctioned for society members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/punjab-ias-pcs-officers-society-road-under-lens-108319

As regard the requisite requirements are concerned the DBA has prepared a full-fledged and accurate voters’ list with painstaking efforts.”“Now, as desired by you to send another voters list in the prescribed pro forma comprising enrolment numbers, fathers’ name and mobile numbers of members will be a Herculean task in the present trying time,” Nanda added.The Bar Council sent a letter on June 22, 2020, asking the DBAto provide a fresh voters’ list in the prescribed pro forma. The Bar Council has sought lists from all Bar Associations as it is planning to hold online election of associations.“Due to an unprecedented spread of the Covid-19 the working of courts has come to a standstill and lawyers are home bound due to restrictions.
