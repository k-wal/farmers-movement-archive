The union said the government would be responsible for any eventuality.Notably, the teacher had started fast-unto-death atop a mobile tower since the past one week after the matter of giving government jobs to two sons of the Congress MLAs had come to the fore. The union said the protesting teacher was unable to speak due to weakness.Deepak Kamboj, president, ETT/TET Pass Unemployed Teacher Union, said, “It is shameful that a teacher has been protesting atop a mobile tower for the past 98 days and the government is not even trying to hold talks. If anything happens to the teacher, the government will be responsible.”Union members, who went atop mobile tower to meet the protesting teacher, took his blood samples for health check up. Lab reports of samples revealed that the teacher was suffering from hypoglycemia, low blood sugar level.Health experts said the teacher needed immediate health intervention to save his life. If the situation worsened the teacher might face visual disturbances, seizures and loss of consciousness, they added.Deep Banarsi, a teacher union leader, said, “The blood sugar level of the protesting teacher has dropped to 40. The government should set aside their ego and convince him to come down by giving him written assurance.”—TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/health-of-unemployed-teacher-protesting-atop-mobile-tower-in-patiala-deteriorates-274722

However, district health officials informed that the infected person did not require even hospitalisation.It has been learnt that the 27-year-old unvaccinated resident had tested positive on May 11. Health officials said patient’s sample was sent for viral genome sequencing on May 15.Consequent upon the late results, which came almost after 40 days, there was no room for health officials to curb the spread of the virus.The Central Government has predicted increased transmissibility of the Delta Plus variant. However, no one from the high-risk contacts of the positive patient has been found infected with the virus.All three high-risk contacts, who happen to be patient’s family members, did not show any Covid symptoms.Meanwhile, health officials today sent four more samples of the Covid positive patients from the same area where Delta Plus case was found.The Patiala Civil Surgeon, Dr Satinder Singh, said, “The patient has already recovered and is healthy. However, we will collect more samples from the area where Delta Plus variant has been detected.”“We will also ramp up sampling along with vaccination in the district,” he added.Meanwhile, district epidemiologist, Dr Sumeet Singh, said people should be more alert and follow Covid appropriate behaviour.When asked about Delta Plus variant, he said, “It is too early to comment on the basis of one isolated case. However, vaccination will definitely be helpful against any variant of the virus.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/delta-plus-patient-in-patiala-district-recovers-274724
