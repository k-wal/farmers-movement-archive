In 2018, reports submitted to the NGT by an expert committee suggested that if transplantation was delayed by a week, the state could meet the demand for water of its 3 crore population for over 3.5 years.As per the committee, there are 14.5 lakh tubewells in the state. Every tubewell pumps out 30.24-lakh litre water per week with an average eight hours of power supply. This means that 14.5 lakh tubewells pump out 4,385-billion litre water per week, which will be sufficient to meet the state’s demand for 3.64 years if transplantation is delayed by a week.The PPCB, too, advocated that the government should amend the Punjab Preservation of Sub-Soil Water Act, 2009, and make June 25 as the official date for paddy sowing. In 2014, the state had issued an advisory to farmers to not transplant saplings before June 15. Earlier, the date was June 1, which was postponed to ensure more dependency on rainwater.The area under paddy was around 26 lakh hectares in 2005 but increased to 30.5 lakh hectares in 2016 and delaying paddy transplantation to June 15 helped in checking the depleting water table.Already over 108 blocks in the state are under the “dark zone” (where water table has fallen drastically) because of the increasing area under paddy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/labour-shortage-looms-as-paddy-sowing-begins-on-june-10-261601

After Sidhu repeatedly attacked the Chief Minister over sacrilege and delay in justice to families of the victims of police firing, the CM had hit back, stating that Sidhu was in talks with the AAP and was damaging the Congress by taking on his government.A senior party leader, Sidhu shifting base to Patiala had political ramifications as it symbolised the cricketer-turned-politician taking on the Chief Minister on the latter’s home turf and offering himself as an alternative. Otherwise, Sidhu has been openly questioning the Chief Minister on the unfulfilled poll promises. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/navjot-sidhu-shifts-base-to-patiala-creates-ripples-261613
