The machine, which cost Rs15 crore, is stated to be lying defunct for the last few days. The reason is one of the MRI machine part, magnet gradient coil, has stopped functioning. The defunct part is said to cost Rs 75 lakh.Dr Navkiran, head, Radio Diagnosis Department, said, “I have already informed the higher authorities about snag in the MRI machine.”In the absence of a functional MRI machine at Government Rajindra Hospital, patients get their scans done from outside by paying between Rs 5,000 to Rs7,000.Meanwhile, sources in the department informed that the authorities were indifferent to urgent repairs of the MRI machine. One of the doctors of the Radio Diagnosis Department said, “Every day, around 15 to 20 patients, who need an MRI, go back from the department without scans. Therefore, their treatment is delayed. The hospital authorities are not showing any urgency to get the machine repaired.”Besides, MRI scan is also required for patients, who are suffering from black fungus. Experts said an MRI scan was required before performing surgery on mucormycosis patients.It has been learnt that in January this year the department had requested the hospital authorities to sign the annual maintenance contract (AMC) service for the MRI machine. However, when asked about the AMC, Dr Navkiran, refused to comment.Dr HS Rekhi, Medical Superintendent, Government Rajindra Hospital, said, “The head of the department has already informed us. We are making efforts to get the machine repaired at the earliest.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/govt-rajindra-hospital-mri-machine-lying-dysfunctional-270882

The study in this regard was conducted by the Health Department.Contrary to popular perception, data analysis among different age groups showed that the morality rate in the younger population during the second wave was not more than the first. Rather it dipped in the second wave.The overall case fatality rate (CFR) in the district had declined in the second wave from 3.1 to 2.4. The mortality ratio among youngsters also declined during the second wave. The CFR dropped from 0.2 in the first wave to 0.1 in the second wave in the 15 to 24 years age group.Similarly, it was 0.7 for the 25 to 39 years age group during the first wave, but it dropped to 0.4 during in the second wave.Notably, the Health department conducted a detailed review of the Covid cases during the first wave from August to October 2020 and the second wave from March to May 2021.The study was carried out to find any correlation with age groups and associated mortality and to verify the common belief that the second wave affected younger age group more than the first wave.The analysis revealed that the trend of affected population was almost ‘similar’ during both the waves.Dr Sumeet Singh, district epidemiologist, said, severity of cases among the younger population during the second wave was due to the fact that the number of positive patients was two-and-a-half to three times higher during March to May 2021.When asked about the higher case count during the second wave, Dr Sumeet Singh, added, “Due to mutation, the virus is more infectious during the second wave. Therefore, the case count has been higher.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/study-negates-perception-of-second-wave-being-more-fatal-for-youngsters-270883

Hundred per cent fee waiver will be given to those scoring 90 per cent marks in Class XII exams.Officials at the centre expect the student count to go up if fee at the YCoE is kept equal to or less than that of other government engineering colleges in the area.Similarly, for the three year and lateral entry diploma course, the university is contemplating a concession ranging from 70 per cent of the total fee for those, who score above 60 per cent marks and up to 100 per cent for students getting 90 per cent and above in qualifying Class X or ITI exams.This is contrary to conditions of the Golden Heart Scholarship Scheme being run since 2004 under which the university has failed to recover interest-free loans running into crores given to BTech students.The scheme was launched to impart technical education in backward rural areas under which over 2,400 students were admitted till date. Despite launch of the scheme student count has come down with each passing year.The university Dean, External Centres, Dr Pushpinder Singh Gill, has already raised concern over financial condition of the university and demanded that the decision be re-examined. He was, however, not available for his comments.The centre director, Dr Gursharan Singh Randhawa, who proposed fee concession for students to the university administration, said the matter was being addressed. “The university has held a meeting to discuss the matter. I was also present at the meeting. We will soon take a decision in this regard,” he added.The university Dean (Academics), Dr BS Sandhu, said, “The file has moved. It is under consideration, but not finalised yet.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/cash-strapped-punjabi-university-mulls-over-fee-concession-to-btech-diploma-course-students-270884
