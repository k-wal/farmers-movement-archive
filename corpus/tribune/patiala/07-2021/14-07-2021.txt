Even the adjoining roads from where the traffic was diverted were also blocked by protesters.

However, thousands of people had, reportedly, taken the vaccine — pretending to be a construction worker.VK Junjua, principal secretary, Labour Department, said they had requested for the utilisation certificate, which was a routine matter. “If we have given funds, we should get utilisation certificate.”When asked about fake beneficiaries getting the Covid vaccine as construction workers, he said, “Yes, many have got the jabs in this manner, however, we will only pay for the registered workers. Therefore, we have asked the Health Department to return the unutilised funds.”He said around 1.90 lakh registered construction workers had received the vaccine on priority, however, they had already paid for around 2.19 lakh persons. Notably, all this happened at a time when the state is jabbing people free of cost.Meanwhile, Sardara Singh, a registered construction worker, said, “We will be filing a case in the High Court over the misuse of labour funds meant for other schemes. It is shameful that every section of the society is jabbed for free but we, the most vulnerable section of the society, have to pay for it. The Health Department should return the entire amount with interest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/labour-dept-seeks-utilisation-certificate-for-rs-7-crore-vax-fund-282820

Now, when we were again called for meeting today, the government cancelled it one more time, said the activists.“This is just a way to harass us,” said one of the protesters. The cancelling of meetings forced us to assemble outside the CM’s residence and register our protest, the protester added.“Meetings are scheduled to just prompt us to wind up our protest… because they (meetings) never take place. To add to our agony, the meetings are cancelled at the very last moment,” said the protester.Sukhwinder Singh, a member of the Berozegar Sanjah Morcha, said, “Ever since the Congress government came into power in the state, the unemployed qualified youth of Punjab have been protesting for jobs. Instead of providing jobs to the youth, the government is out to file FIRs against them.”He said the unemployed youngsters had decided to “ban the entry of the Congress leaders” into their houses during the upcoming Assembly elections.“We will not allow Congress leaders to enter our houses for campaigning. They have betrayed the youngsters of Punjab,” said Sukhwinder.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/berozegar-sanjha-morcha-activists-clash-with-punjabs-cm-security-in-patiala-detained-282757
