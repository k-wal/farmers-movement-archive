The service has been restarted after a gap of over 18 months. Officials said the van will be in Jalandhar on Friday and Saturday. The vehicle will be parked at KMV College and people can purchase books from there, they said. TNSThe directions were passed after the commission heard the Punjabi University Vice-Chancellor recently.Dr Harminder Singh Khokhar had approached the commission years ago.The Chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes said Khokhar was appointed as the APRO at Punjabi University after due process of selection in 2001 against a permanent reserve post for an SC candidate. Later, his service was made substantive in 2002.In 2003, the university, however, abolished one of the two posts of the APRO on which Dr Khokhar was working as an austerity measure to save Rs 1.5 lakh per annum.The commission pointed out that had the other post of the APRO been abolished, the university would have saved a much higher amount as the other APRO was at the stage of superannuation and was drawing a much higher salary.It also stated that while removing Dr Khokhar from the service, the fact regarding his appointment against a reserved post and him being a permanent employee was concealed.“No punitive action was taken against those responsible for concealing the facts. This prima facie indicates that Khokhar was treated so on account of being a Scheduled Caste,” the commission observed.The commission said though the university rectified its mistake and reappointed the employee in 2008, it failed to pay him the salary for the period that he was kept out. Therefore, the university is recommended to pay Dr Khokhar the salary for the period from 2003 to 2008 and submit an action taken report.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/punjabi-university-told-to-pay-five-year-salary-to-employee-287111
