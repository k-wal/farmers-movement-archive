It was first compiled by Sikh scholar and writer Bhai Kahan Singh Nabha. It took 14 years to compile the first edition which got published in 1927. It comprises entries covering religious and historical terms in alphabetical order, where each entry records the etymology and different meanings of the term according to its usage, alongside textual quotations.“We are in the process of setting up teams for all versions. The difficulty is in finding people who know English, Punjabi and Gurbani very well. Such people are very difficult to find today,” said Punjabi University Vice-Chancellor Arvind.The work of producing the corrected versions of the Mahan Kosh, also knownas Gurshabad Ratnakar Mahankosh, has been hanging in the balance forover two years. The copies produced earlier were scrapped in March 2019 over glaring mistakes.The matter related to “mistakes” in the university’s copies had been probed by the SGPC before it reached the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which had enforced a ban on its sale. Later, the university had decided to scrap it altogether.Highlighting the scarcity of scholars in the related fields, the VC said in fact, Prof Teja Singh – a known English scholar – in 1934, in the foreword written for the original version of the encyclopedia had stated that scholarship required for the compilation of such works was disappearing.“In the 21st century, it seems to have completely disappeared,” he said.The VC said the university had also procured the original version of Mahankosh that had been corrected by Bhai Kahan Singh Nabha, after it was printed for the first time by the Languages Department. It will be used for producing the latest version, he said.“For Punjabi version, we do have an authenticated version by Kahan Singh Nabha. We are facing difficulty with the English version over translations and interpretations. Once we have identified the scholars, we will decide the timeline for the completion of the work,” the VC added.Prof Arvind said he had held a few internal meetings over the issue and decision in this regard would be taken soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/compilation-of-mahan-kosh-encyclopedia-of-sikh-literature-punjabi-university-looking-for-scholars-281906

From 765 in 2019, the cases dipped to 428 in 2020. So far in 2021, the count is only 249.Notably, Government Rajindra Hospital caters to the entire Malwa belt, which has around 60 per cent of the total Hepatitis cases reported in Punjab.Similarly, at Government Mata Kaushalya Hospital here, the disruption in OPD services due to Covid has already resulted in a steep dip in the reporting of Hepatitis C patients.As per the diagnostic count, the number of Hepatitis C patients have come down from 369 in 2019 to 222 in 2020. This year, only 101 patients have reported at the hospital so far.Dr Divjot Singh, district epidemiologist, said the decline in footfall of Hepatitis C patients was due to Covid.The OPD services had to be shut for months due to Covid, said Dr Singh, adding “though the government is providing free treatment for Hepatitis C, including tests, patients seemingly fearing Covid infection are not showing up for the treatment”.He further said not only was there a decline in detection of fresh cases, there was also a dip in the follow-up cases.There were many cases of lost-follow-up, which means patients have stopped turning up for follow up, he said.“In the wake of decline in follow-up cases, the government recently decided to give medicines to patients for two or three months at once,” Dr Singh informed.He said they were making efforts to call patients for follow up so that they complete the treatment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/covid-impact-fight-against-hepatitis-c-takes-a-beating-281905

Sources revealed those applications, which had bypassed the middlemen, had been kept in waiting. The CM had announced a subsistence allowance of Rs 3,000 in May which was to be paid in two instalments of Rs 1,500 each. The first one was to be handed out immediately and another by June 15. However, thousands of workers are yet to receive their dues.Due to delay in registration and accreditation of construction workers, the Labour Department had written a letter to their staff in this regard on Saturday. The Building and Other Construction Workers’ (BOCW) Welfare Board additional secretary had also directed the field staff to clear entire pendency by July 10 or strict action would be taken against the erring officials.Meanwhile, it has been learnt that the department, in some cases, was also yet to pay two instalments of Rs 3,000 each to the workers which were announced last year.Labour activist Vijay Walia said: “It is shameful that poor workers are not being provided with financial aid in time. The CM, who is the chairman of the welfare board, should have looked into the matter.”Labour Department Principal Secretary VK Janjua said: “We have already transferred the first instalment to the bank accounts of around 3 lakh workers of the total 3.5 lakh registered workers. Due to a technical issue that emerged because of merger of some banks, around 75,000 beneficiaries did not receive the second instalment which will be given as soon the issue is resolved. Besides, pendency due to non-clearance of applications will also be resolved soon and financial help will be transferred immediately.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/construction-workers-in-punjab-yet-to-get-covid-financial-aid-281683

A police team, including two DSPs, was present with the BJP leaders, even as the Patiala DIG and SSP rushed to the town to escort them to safety.Videos from Rajpura that went viral on social media purportedly showed angry farmer union members waving black flags and attacking a BJP supporter as the police tried to escort them to safety. According to Aggarwal, he had reached Rajpura to hold a meeting of party workers from Ghanaur, Rajpura and Sanaur constituencies. “I had apprised senior police officers about the meeting in advance. However, when we reached the venue, only a handful of cops were present there,” he said.“I was told to finish the meeting within 30 minutes as farm union members had assembled outside the venue. As I came out, I was asked by the police to use a nearby lane to reach my vehicle. On the way, I along with our local president Vikas Sharma was attacked by farm union members with sticks. My personal gunman intervened to keep protesters at bay. We took shelter in a house to save ourselves,” claimed Aggarwal. “From there I called up senior officers, following which I was rescued after over 50 minutes of chaos,” he said.“When we reached the house of another BJP leader for a separate meeting, the same mob reached there. They raised slogans and threatened us,” he claimed.DIG Vikramjeet Duggal and SSP Sandeep Garg reached the spot and rescued the leaders before taking them to Patiala.Meanwhile, farm union members, including women, claimed BJP leaders were only chased after their gunman pointed a weapon at them. “Despite our warnings, they continue to hold meetings and then blame us,” they said, claiming no one was beaten up.Ghanaur DSP Jaswinder Tiwana said they were examining the claims of the BJP leader if he was thrashed, as there was ample security at the scene. “We escorted him out and asked him to leave after the first meeting. However, he insisted on holding another meeting, where farmers gathered and there was a standoff. We will take action after ascertaining the facts. As for now, there is no proof of any leader being roughed up,” Tiwana added.Democracy throttled in name of farmers, says BJPChandigarh: The BJP on Sunday condemned the attack on party workers in Rajpura, calling it “daylight murder” of democracy. BJP state president Ashwani Sharma and national general secretary Tarun Chugh, in separate statements, said BJP’s political rivals had been throttling the voice of the party under the garb of farmers. Slamming the state government for allowing such elements have a free run, Sharma asked CM Capt Amarinder Singh to give strict directions to the police to throw such elements behind the bars.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/punjab-bjp-leaders-roughed-up-by-rajpura-protesters-281690

The central power ministry now claims it has “ample power but Punjab does not have the kind of infrastructure to draw more”.While Punjab has its own generation of about 5,500 MW from various sources, including solar, it can import a maximum of 7,300 MW from the northern grid, with some temporary relief to draw more.“Under the present circumstances, the state can supply around 12,800 to 13,000 MW. However, despite ample funds available from the Centre to improve transmission infrastructure to draw more power from the central grid, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) could do little,” said All-India Power Engineers’ Federation spokesperson VK Gupta.“What is affecting Punjab more is the fact that there is power available for us and at cheaper rate too, but the management has done little to think on those lines and use central funds to improve transmission, which comes with a condition that the power corporation should not be in losses to avail those funds,” Gupta added.Speaking to the media, the central power ministry has said Punjab did not approach them for more power but only for enhancement of capacity, which was allowed. “It is our Power Secretary who is constantly asking Punjab and willing to help, but for one state, the whole northern grid cannot be compromised. They need to improve their drawing capacity,” Union Power Minister RK Singh told a news channel.A former chief engineer with the PSPCL said: “It is a colossal administrative and planning failure when it was known in advance that one unit of Talwamdi Sabo is down for more than five months.”Punjab is witnessing all-time high power demand due to a prolonged dry spell, increase in demand of power from the agricultural sector, reduced availability due to low reservoir levels/reduced generation from hydro power stations and outage of units of the Talwandi Sabo Power Limited, Mansa. “Power is not an issue. Corridor is the problem. We approached them for enhancement of available transfer capability limits. We are using the full corridor and buying power from exchange at very competitive rates. Northern Regional Load Despatch Centre increased our limits,” said PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad.The state increased buying power from the power exchange after the transmission capacity was temporarily enhanced by the Government of India by 400 MW, to 7,800 MW. The state’s transmission capacity was 6,400 MW last year, and was increased to 7,400 MW this year.“On Saturday, the PSPCL relaxed power regulatory measures on general category consumers having sanctioned contract demand up to 1,000 KVA. Industrial consumers have now been allowed to operate up to 100 KVA of load, while the earlier exemption limit was only up to 50 KVA. This shall increase the load on the PSPCL system by about 600 MW,” said Venu Prasad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/power-demand-unmet-as-dry-spell-continues-in-punjab-281695
