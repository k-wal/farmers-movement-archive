Until now, the state has already produced a total of 1,671 tonne biomedical waste (from March 2020 to June 2021) since the pandemic broke out.Following the experience of the first wave, all stakeholders were more economical in using the sources of Covid control during the second wave, say experts.According to the report prepared by the PPCB, Punjab produced the highest Covid waste (234 tonne) in the month of September — when the state witnessed the peak of the first wave. Similarly, the highest Covid waste (216.9 tonne) was generated in May during the peak of the second wave.However, many hospitals disregarded the biomedical disposal guidelines and threw biomedical waste in the open. Commenting on the flouting of guidelines, PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg said: “We have been successful in collecting all the biomedical waste generated by Covid-dedicated health facilities. There could be some minor violations at some places, otherwise most facilities abided by the guidelines.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/punjab-produces-1-671-tonne-covid-waste-in-15-months-288628
