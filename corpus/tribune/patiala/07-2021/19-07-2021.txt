In an ex parte decision, the consumer court had ordered the club to pay Rs10,000 as compensation for litigation charges and harassment while terming the matter an unfair trade practice.In their complaint, the couple had stated that after collection of the membership amount, they were informed that the club would charge an annual maintenance from them, though no such information was mentioned on the company’s website.The company was reluctant in refunding their amount after which they requested it to book two studio apartments in Manali, which they stated, were substandard. The couple claimed that the company changed the hotels after repeated reminders but those too were not good enough. Feeling harassed, they demanded a refund of their membership fee, which the company declined. Following this, the couple moved the district forum for redressal of their grievance.The firm, while appealing against the order in the Commission, argued that the order passed by the forum in allowing the complaint was illegal, void and without appreciation of the facts, documents and evidence on record. It stated that it nowhere mentioned about the star rating of any property in memberships and that studio apartments were never rated by any hotel association of India.However, the Commission upheld the order while observing that the club had failed to list its owned properties in the membership certificate. It added that no contract or agreement was executed with the consumers and that the membership certificate was an eyewash to grab their clients’ hard-earned money. It also pointed at the company’s casual behaviour and observed that it failed to respond to emails sent by the complainants.The Commission found the firm deficient in rendering its service.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/consumer-forum-order-against-holiday-club-over-unfair-trade-practice-upheld-285261

I am qualified but jobless, which shows that something is fundamentally wrong in the policies of the government. This was stated by Surinder Pal, an ETT-TET pass unemployed teacher, whose protest atop a mobile tower here completed four months today.While talking to TNS over the phone, Surinder said he won’t come down until the government issued a notification on fresh recruitment of ETT teachers.To a query, he said at times, he felt a bit scared atop the tower. Surinder said, “There was a storm the other day and I was told that old trees had been uprooted. Wind was blowing at a high speed and I was bit scared. I am here for a cause, which gives me strength.”He added that his father had said however strong might be the wrongdoer, one should always fight against the wrong in the society. “If you don’t contest the wrong in the society, then, I think, we are siding with the wrongdoer.”When asked about the future course of his protest, he said, “I am not counting days. The protest will continue though the government seems to be insensitive.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/jobless-protester-completes-4-months-atop-mobile-tower-285255

The machine circulates the essential oxygen-rich blood to the brain and other vital organs during a surgery, allowing the cardiac surgery team to operate on the vital organ. When the surgery is complete, the heart-lung machine is disconnected.It has been learnt that the machine couldn’t be installed because there was no perfusionist with the hospital to run it. A perfusionist is a certified medical technician for the operation and maintenance of extracorporeal circulation equipment.The private company, which had delivered the machine, also sent a couple of reminders to the hospital authority to install the machine. Though the government had already appointed a perfusionist, the candidate, reportedly, did not receive the appointment letter.For want of the machine, cardiothoracic surgery is not being performed at the hospital for the past over two years.When asked about the same, Dr Rajan Singla, Principal, Government Medical College, said, “I am not aware of this. I will enquire about it tomorrow.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/rs-78-lakh-heart-lung-machine-idle-at-rajindra-hospital-patiala-285252
