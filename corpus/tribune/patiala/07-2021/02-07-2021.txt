Affected by frequent power cuts, residents have now turned to second-hand generators and inverters for offices and houses.Strong winds lashed city last month, which led to prolonged power cuts in various areas, including colonies near the residence of Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh. These areas witnessed over 12 to 24 hours power cuts.Aman, who resides near Lower Mall Road, said his office purchased a silent generator after work was hampered due to power cuts. “Our office decided to purchase one generator so that work is not affected by power cuts. Other offices have also purchased silent generators. Some have taken diesel generators on rent.”Mohit Kumar Goyal, who deals in sale of silent generators and inverters on the Rajpura road here, said, “The demand for generators and invertors has increased. People are coming to purchase silent generators as their office work has been affected due to recent power cuts. The general demand is from commercial spaces and offices. Other than that, people are also purchasing generators for use at their residences.” Meanwhile, the demand is not persistent throughout the city.Dinesh, who runs a shop on the Bhadson road and provides generators to MNCs on rent said, “As such the demand for generators has not increased. Earlier, some companies wanted generators when high velocity winds lashed the city, but otherwise it has been normal.”Rajiv Madan, who runs a shop on the YPS road, said, “As such there is not much demand for generators. People do ask for second-hand generators on rent for a day or two, but otherwise the demand has not seen a major rise. At times people cannot afford generators and inverters. This is the reason why they back out.”—TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/demand-for-generators-inverters-goes-up-in-patiala-city-277175
