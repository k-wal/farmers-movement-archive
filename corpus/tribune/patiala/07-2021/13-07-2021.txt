13-07-2021||---||Residents of Bouran Kalan village lay siege to Patiala DC office||Patiala, July 12Residents of Bouran Kalan village, who are on chain fast against the district administration for the past many days, gheraoed Deputy Commissioner’s office here today. They decided to up the ante against the administration over non-allotment of one third of the common panchayat land reserved for the Schedule Caste (SC) category.The protesters, under the banner of Zameen Prapt Sangharsh Committee, barged into the main gate of the DC office in the presence of the police. Thereafter, protesters blocked the main gate by staging a sit-in at the entrance itself. In the incident, the police tried to shove protesters out of the gate, but were not successful.It has been learnt that Cabinet Minister for Social Justice, Empowerment and Minorities, Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, happened to be at the DC office to attend some meeting at the time of the protest. He had to leave the office from another gate owing to the protest at the main gate.Ironically, the minister did not deem it necessary to meet protesting villagers despite later being from his constituency.Mukesh Maluad, zonal president, Zameen Prapt Sangharsh Committee, alleged that SC residents were being deprived of their right over one third of the common panchayat land by the panchayat in connivance with some influential people of the village. Despite protesting for past many days, the administration didn’t even try to solve the issue, he added. Attacking Cabinet Minister, he said they would be holding ‘Poll khol’ rallies in villages to expose Sadhu Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/residents-of-bouran-kalan-village-lay-siege-to-patiala-dc-office-282386

Members of the Contractual Employees Welfare Association, therefore, suggested mentioning of employees, who were working under various foreign projects.The association also objected to the clause of regularisation only against existing sanctioned posts. Why provision had not been extended to new posts, which could be created in future, the association added. Besides, the association also objected to inclusion of only Class B and C staff for regularisation thereby excluding Class A and B employees. There were many Class A and B employees, who were working on contractual basis, under various World Bank projects, said the association.There wouldn’t be any growth in their career, the association added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/water-supply-sanitation-staff-oppose-draft-of-employees-bill-282388

They handed over keys of truck, buses and other vehicles for the Chief Minister.Earlier, activists held a protest march covering several kilometres on trucks, which culminated at YPS Chowk.Addressing party members on the occasion Prof Chandumajra said the BJP-led Centre Government and Congress-led state government were directly responsible for manifold increase in prices of petroleum products. The Centre was not reducing custom duty on these products, he said Capt Amarinder Singh-led state government had imposed highest VAT in the country on petroleum products, he added. Levying VAT and custom duty together meant Rs 55 per litre tax on petroleum products, he said. Both governments should slash taxes by 50 per cent so that people could get respite upto Rs30 per litre, he added.After coming to power, Capt Amarinder Singh-led government dissolved truck unions in state, reduced loading charges and increased oil prices manifold, which destroyed the transport sector, he said. More than 40,000 trucks and 65,000 taxis had already been sold in scrap during last four and a half years of the Congress rule in state, he added.Fazilka said the situation was such that owners of trucks, buses and other transport vehicles were not in position to run them. “So, we decided to handover keys of these vehicles to the Chief Minister,” he added.
