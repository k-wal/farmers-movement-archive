29-01-2022||Patiala||Punjabi University teachers demand uniform transfer policy||Assistant professors of Punjabi University’s constituent colleges have demanded a uniform transfer policy for its employees. The university recently decided to transfer a number of assistant professors, which led to a protest by them. Later, the matter was postponed in view of spread of Covid-19 disease and ongoing academic process.Assistant Profs, associated with the PUCTA, said the university should adopt a uniform transfer policy so that transfers could be carried out in a transparent manner.A spokesman of the university said we had started exercise in this regard. “We are in favour of preparing a rational transfer policy. This will ensure that faculty members either regular, contractual or others are uniformly deputed at all its colleges and campuses so that the students’ education does not suffer,” he said. The spokesman said a number of teachers had earlier utilised political patronage and allegiance to get themself transferred from rural areas close to the cities for their own benefit. “This led to lapses as many colleges are understaffed, while others have more than the required number of teachers. The university has started working on it ”, he said. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/punjabi-university-teachers-demand-uniform-transfer-policy-365207

The youngster spares no smiles and assurances as he reaches out to voters, his social media team in tow.Campaign trailAs the Assembly elections get interesting by the day, Congress stalwart Brahm Mohindra’s heir Mohit Mohindra has embarked on a tough political journey. His father, a prominent Hindu face of the state politics, is also a Cabinet minister, has been a six-time MLA in his over 40 years of public service.Mohit, who is a former cricketer and an advocate, has a daunting task of carrying forward his father’s five decades old political legacy. “I have been nurtured in an environment, where I had always seen him meeting constituency people or visiting villages. I always wanted to carry forward my father’s dream of nurturing his constituency’s people,” says Mohit, who is making a debut in electoral politics.One of the youngest politicians in the polls, he is in fray on a Congress ticket from Patiala Rural, where his father is a sitting MLA. Mohit, 31, faces a stiff competition from incumbent Mayor Sanjiv Bittu, who is contesting on the Punjab Lok Congress ticket, Jaspal Singh Bittu Chatha of SAD and Balbir Singh of AAP.His rival SAD’s Jaspal Singh Chatha is banking on the “good work” done by the party in Punjab during its 10-year rule. AAP’s Dr Balbir Singh will be trying his luck second time in the polls. —                                     #BrahmMohindra||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/carrying-forward-fathers-legacy-365071

What the people here have gone through in the past is in front of everyone to see. People will punish the Congress as also turncoats who could not bring about development in the city, despite being in the Cabinet for five years,” said Juneja.“I am a common man. Covid restrictions have come in as a blessing for someone like me. I do not have large amounts of money to splurge on rallies or hiring social media managers. I have devoted my time and energy on visiting residents.”Juneja said he had already completed two rounds of canvassing in the constituency where Capt Amarinder was yet to even make his first visit in years. “I know the battle is tough, but my personal connect with people and the philanthropist work done by my father will be rewarded by people, who are done with dynasty politics,” he said.After filing his nomination papers, Juneja said a divided Congress, following the exodus of many local leaders due to their siding with Capt Amarinder, had left the party vulnerable.                                     #CaptAmarinderSingh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/juneja-banks-on-personal-connect-365070
