In the complaint, Prashant Sharma, coordinator, legal cell, PCC, alleged the officer was posted at Patiala, which is the home district of former CM Capt Amarinder Singh.Aggarwal had remained the security head of the former CM for four years and nine months and would remain in Patiala for most of the time the former CM would be there, he had pleaded. “A person who had remained posted at Patiala on official duty for over four years may not be posted at Patiala during election, as the same would be a violation of the manual on model code of conduct,” reads the complaint by PCC.The Congress has demanded that Aggarwal be transferred to a place at a distance from Patiala. Acting on the complaint, the CEO had asked the Additional Chief Secretary, Home, to get the facts of the complaint verified and send a report within 24 hours. —                                     #CaptAmarinderSingh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/plaint-over-patiala-igs-posting-ec-seeks-report-363355

The Chief Minister’s office had passed an official communication regarding the same in December, but the funds have not reached the university since.In a much-lauded announcement made by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi during his visit on November 24, he had announced that the state government would takeover Rs 150 crore bank loan of the university and increase its monthly grant from Rs 9 crore to Rs 20 crore.This was after the university had made several efforts contacting the state government for the waiver and increment in its grant over years. The university’s expenditure on salaries and other factors had been increasing by the years while it faced difficulty in discharging funds for daily activities.Officials at the campus today said it had been two months since the announcement was made. Requesting anonymity, a senior official said, “The Chief Minister’s announcement was well received and lauded by one and all. But we have not received the funds since the announcement.”University Vice-Chancellor Prof Arvind said his office was making efforts for the release of the funds. “We had received an official notification from the Chief Minister’s office wherein it decided to take over the bank loan and increase the grant. The notification was received a week after the announcement on December 1. Since then, we are making our efforts and hoping the grant will be released for smooth functioning,” he said.Four researchers bag ICSSR scholarshipFour researchers from Punjabi University have bagged the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) doctoral scholarship.

In a letter written to the Municipal Corporation, a number of office-goers explained their ordeal and said their area had been without a functional toilet facility for the past four months.The office-goers said the SCOs built at the Chhoti Baradari market area were provided common toilets long back. The condition of these toilets became dilapidated with the passage of time. Later, the Municipal Corporation started renovation of the toilets — one each for women and men. But the construction work was stopped a month ago.They say one portion of the women toilet is complete but lying locked. “The work on the other is lying halfway, leaving shop owners, workers, women employees and others without access to public toilets for the past four months,” they said.Surinderpal Singh, one of the office-goers at SCO 79 in the area, said, “We had contacted the office of the Improvement Trust who guided us to contact the Municipal Corporation over the matter. The corporation had constructed a toilet in a park at the Beant Singh Chowk as well, but it is lying locked. There is no water supply at another one which is on the other side of the chowk, while the facility behind the Beant Singh complex is under renovation. Visitors, especially women employees, face a lot of inconvenience due to a lack of public toilets in the area.”While, the Municipal Corporation Commissioner was shifted from the city two days ago, Corporation Joint Commissioner Naman Markan said he had not received the letter in this regard. “I will nevertheless check it and we will take appropriate steps at the earliest”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/public-toilets-at-chhoti-baradari-market-shut-for-months-office-goers-a-harried-lot-363340

She said, “Vaccination will not be effective if people don’t get their second dose in due course of time. Vaccine dose is available in all health centres, including small ones.”The slowing down of vaccination pace has put the Health Department in a tight spot as vaccination figures are nowhere close to the target set by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in view of the upcoming elections.Health officials told The Tribune that daily vaccination figures were quite low from the target set by the ECI. Against the daily target of 50,000 doses, the Health Department on Friday administered only 13,844 doses. Dr Veenu Goyal said that efforts were being made to motivate people to get vaccination to protect them from the deadly Covid-19.Vaccination figuresTarget population: 14.98 lakhFirst dose: 12.02 lakhSecond dose: 7.2 lakh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/only-40-fully-vaccinated-in-patiala-district-363339
