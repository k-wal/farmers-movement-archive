Consequent upon that, the department said where there were clear alternative causes of death, it couldn’t be attributed to Covid-19.The department said Covid positive patients, who died of accidental trauma, poisoning, acute myocardial infarction etc, couldn’t be listed in the list of Covid-19 deaths because the cause of death was not Covid evidently.However, sources informed that sudden rise of Covid-19 deaths in the district had prompted the Health Department to issue the said directions. The sources further informed that many people, who were getting treated at hospitals for acute diseases other than coronavirus, had contracted the virus during treatment, which led to increase in deaths.Meanwhile, Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Satinder said even roadside accidental deaths were found Covid-19 positive and listed under Covid deaths. “If a Covid positive person dies in a road accident, that cannot be categorised as Covid death. We have set up a committee of experts to declare non-COVID deaths,” he said.Patiala on Monday reported seven Covid deaths, taking the death count in the district to 681.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/health-department-redefines-covid-deaths-241489

Also, over half of April has passed but the government has failed to provide the monthly salary of the employees.”Meanwhile, students broke-into the meeting room of the university administration and held a separate demonstration against the new orders of workload allocation.Students associated with various student political parties held a protest at the administrative complex demanding revocation of the issued orders. They, then broke the lock of the hall and forcefully entered the syndicate room in an attempt to register their protest.They said the orders issued to principals and heads of various centres were against the University Grants Commission (UGC) rules.“The university has directed centre heads to allocate teaching workload to junior and senior research fellows before contractual and guest faculty teachers. This will lead to research scholars being forced to go centres and teach students rather than focus on their research,” Sandeep Kaur, student leader of the Punjab Radical Students’ Union (PRSU), said.The students added that this was the university’s attempt to reduce its expenditure.Responding on the same, University Dean academics Dr Pushpinder Singh Gill said the university was governed by certain rules and they would look into the matter and take a final decision.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/punjabi-university-teachers-students-hold-separate-protests-241494
