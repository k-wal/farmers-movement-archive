Bids were invited from across the country. Now, the Ministry of Power has stated in the RTI reply that the SBDs have still not been finalised. This reply puts a question mark over the entire bidding process of the UTs privatisation process,” he added.While in Chandigarh the bidding was for 100 per cent equity, in Dadra Nagar Haveli it was for 51 per cent, he said.The AIPEF chief patron, Padamjit Singh, said in case of Dadra Nagar Haveli, bids were opened. A private firm had claimed to have won the bid with the highest offer of Rs555 lakh against a reserve price of Rs150 lakh,” he added.“The Bombay High Court has stayed the further process in case of a PIL filed before it,” he said.In case of Chandigarh, technical bids were opened on March 18, he added. Financial bids for the UT were yet to be opened, he said. “Here also the UT Powermen Union has challenged the bidding process before the Punjab Haryana High Court and its next date of hearing is April 29,” he said.“The Union Ministry of Power has constituted a high-level steering committee headed by Secretary Power to guide and steer the privatisation of UTs electricity distribution,” said Gupta.The draft amendment Bill 2021 was circulated among selected few in February, he said. The Union Power Minister held a discussion on proposals with all state power secretaries and CMDs of Discoms and regulators, he added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/put-privatisation-of-power-dept-in-ut-on-hold-says-aipef-239660

16-04-2021||Chandigarh||Panel: Thapar varsity public authority, give info under RTI||Terming Patiala’s Thapar University a “public authority”, the State Information Commission (SIC), Punjab, has directed it to provide requisite information to an appellant.A spokesperson for the commission said RTI activist Akash Verma had sought information under the Right of Information (RTI) Act but the university refused the same, saying it did not fall within the ambit of RTI.The activist approached the SIC on December 24, 2020, by filing an appeal against the order passed by the university, which dismissed the RTI application saying it was a private deemed-to-be university under Section-3 of UGC Act, 1956, and not a public authority.The spokesperson said Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology had been established by the then Pepsu government in 1955, consequent upon entering into an agreement with the Mohini Thapar Charitable Trust with a view to promoting technical education in the state.Under the agreement, a joint Charitable Trust was created and Rs 30 lakh each by Mohini Charitable Trust and the Pepsu government were subscribed to the institute.On September 19, 1955, the erstwhile Pepsu government issued a notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act to the effect that land measuring 250 acres was likely to be required for public purposes. The land was provided by the erstwhile government free of cost for the establishment of the respondent institute, and the state government and University Grants Commission gave grants to the institution, said the spokesperson.The SIC, disposing of the appeal, cited the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of DAV College Trust and Management Society (Supra), wherein while interpreting the meaning of term ‘substantially financed’ under Section 2(h)(i) of the RTI Act, 2005, it held if an institution is established on the land given by the state it would certainly mean it is substantially financed by the government and is a public authority and is obliged to comply with the provisions of the RTI Act, 2005. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/panel-thapar-varsity-public-authority-give-info-under-rti-239598
