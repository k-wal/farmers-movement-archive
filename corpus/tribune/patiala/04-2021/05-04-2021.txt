No one from the district administration has so far approached us for talks, they said.“Our health is deteriorating with each passing day. The government should immediately fulfil our demands,” said Harjeet Singh.“The Congress dispensation has not been able to provide jobs to the qualified teachers for the last four years.

The initiative is likely to be implemented in other districts also.Patiala SSP Vikram Jeet Duggal said already resolutions had been passed by 470 gram panchayats and 37 municipal council wards of the district for not giving bail or testimony and prosecution of drug smugglers. “This means that such offenders will have to spend more time behind bars and it will help break the backbone of the nexus as these peddlers continue to supply drugs once released on bail,” Duggal said.Will stay in jail for longer durationOffenders will have to spend more time behind bars. It will help break the backbone of the nexus as these peddlers continue to supply drugs once released on bail. — Vikram Jeet Duggal, Patiala SSPThe police have already launched a special campaign against smugglers in which measures were taken to attach their assets and now such resolutions have been passed by the gram panchayats and municipal councils of the district. Officers who led the campaign said initially it was difficult to approach every villager, so they decided to get in touch with the panchayat members. “Through them we were able to ensure that our message reached all. Once we were able to convince them that the step will help us save the youth, they were supportive,” said a rural officer.Duggal said in this series, residents of Patiala made significant contribution in 96 villages and five wards of Samana, 43 villages and three wards of rural Patiala, 74 villages and 29 wards of Rajpura and 30 villages of Nabha.

05-04-2021||Patiala||Sidhu hits back at Piyush Goyal for letter urging online MSP payment||Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday said that Food Minister Piyush Goyal was a “liar” and if his letter to Punjab Chief Minister urging online MSP payment was implemented, small farmers would be the biggest sufferers. Punjab pays farmers through arhtiyas and is yet to integrate its land records with the central procurement portal. Goyal had written to Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh citing past exemptions the state was granted in this regard and urged urgent compliance.Addressing media in Patiala at his residence, Sidhu said Goyal’s actions were “part of a larger conspiracy”.He says the Centre was targeting Punjab and the recent letter by the central minister was "a bundle of lies".Direct online payment of minimum support price (MSP) to farmers highlighted by Goyal in his letter states “that the land record department of Punjab has all record of land record holdings, which is not correct,” said Sidhu. He cited a national sample survey of 2012 -13 “which says 24 per cent of farming is on a contract basis”. “It all happens on an oral contract. If Goyal’s letter is implemented in letter and spirit, no farmer will get payment. The small farmer will be the biggest sufferer,” he said.Sidhu questioned the government over direct subsidy into the accounts of farmers and also in the accounts of below poverty line (BPL) families.He accused the centre of promoting the private sector, led by “Adanis and Ambanis”.Sidhu said the move could be termed “economic blackmail of farmers”.The Centre is arm twisting farmers when they are protesting, he said.A stop on cash credit limit timing by RBI clearly shows that all institutions of the country are being used against farmers, he said.“The centre is giving relaxations to private companies to return bank loans but no such relaxation ever is given to farmers,” said Sidhu.Sidhu accused the Centre of trying to disturb the peace and the economy of Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/sidhu-hits-back-at%C2%A0piyush-goyal-for-letter-urging%C2%A0online-msp-payment-234544
