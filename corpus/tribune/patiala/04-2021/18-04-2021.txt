The mutation needs to be studied thoroughly.”The health experts, however, continue to claim that re-infection after vaccination was not abnormal, and the patient would either be asymptomatic or would exhibit only mild symptoms.Meanwhile, it has been learned that there had been many cases of Covid re-infection but only a few were being documented by the Health Department.District epidemiologist Dr Sumeet Singh said, “Only 12 cases of Covid re-infection have been reported so far.”“People can test positive for the coronavirus even after getting both doses, but the severity will be less,” he added.Disregarding normsIt has been learnt that junior and senior resident doctors living at the Government Medical College hostels were not adhering to the Covid-19 protocol. Dr Rajan Singla, Principal, Government Medical College, said, “The students have been repeatedly reminded to follow the Covid norms. I even conduct surprise checks in canteens and other areas to keep a vigil.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/jabbed-twice-patiala-doctor-infected-2nd-time-240695
