The victim, along with other staff members, has already given a written complaint to the Kauli Senior Medical Officer (SMO).It has been learned that two beneficiaries approached the health officials for getting vaccinated and were asked to wait for other beneficiaries to arrive.Health officials said they had to make the beneficiaries wait because one vial had 10 injections and once opened, all injections had to be used within a limited time. The staff said they had to do that to avoid wastage of vaccines.However, the beneficiaries got agitated and misbehaved with the staff, officials added.Kuali SMO Dr Kiran Verma said: “The staff has already given a written complaint to me. It is a very sad incident. The staff wanted to avoid vaccine wastage and that is why they asked the beneficiaries to wait.”Notably, residents of Mardhanheri village had also misbehaved with a health officer two weeks ago.Meanwhile, Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said the vaccination drive was not getting a good response in rural areas. He said the health staff had been facing resistance from eligible beneficiaries for various reasons.“Sometimes, beneficiaries do not even turn up at vaccination camps. The staff has to convince villagers because scepticism around the vaccine still prevails,” he added.Besides, rumours on social media platforms had also hit the vaccination drive, the Civil Surgeon said. “The doctors informed that there was a rumour that vaccination could make the beneficiaries impotent,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/sanour-villagers-harass-officials-during-vaccination-drives-243040
