The police today booked two Supreme Dairy employees — Umesh and Pritam Singh — in the case.“Harpreet Singh and Gurpreet, main accused, had 52 customers and were running a dairy business for five years. Two years ago, they signed an agreement with Supreme Dairy in Ludhiana, under which they supplied full-fat milk to the firm,” said Jaswant Singh Mangat, Samana DSP. “The accused had all machinery needed in the business,” he said.“Harpreet had signed a 16-year agreement with the company and was collecting milk from nearby villages. He would double the milk quantity by mixing it with poultry feed.
