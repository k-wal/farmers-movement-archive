The officials collected the samples of the dead chickens and sent to Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL), Jalandhar, for a bird flu test.Rajinder Goyal, Deputy Director, Animal Husbandry, said around 15-20 dead chickens were found in a vacant field. They had already screened the nearby poultry farms. “We are keeping a vigil on poultry farms. We have been sending out messages to the poultry farm owners asking them to report every death of chicken,” he added.Around 700 dead chickens were found at Rakhra village last week.The officials said chickens, if not properly taken care of, died naturally owing to cold weather. In fact, most farm owners have stopped giving feed to chickens due to low demand amid the bird flu scare.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/dead-chickens-found-at-sanaur-199991

To avoid any hurdles during implementation, the department has already taken consent from the medical and dental teachers’ association for the new arrangement.Experts claimed that time-bound promotion would solve the issue of faculty shortage as re-designation without pay scales would automatically create more senior faculty, which in turn increases PG seats.In the absence of the policy of time-bound promotions, many professors had been working on the same post for over a decade. Consequently, governments had to re-employ around 40 professors in two state-run medical colleges in Patiala and Amritsar.Dr Diwan Bhullar, state general secretary, Punjab State Medical and Dental Teachers Association, said it was the long-pending demand of the faculty.“We have been facing a lot of embarrassment as our students — who had been teaching in other colleges where time-bound promotions already exist — have become our seniors. The policy should be implemented immediately,” he said.Meanwhile, DK Tiwari, principal secretary, medical education, said: “The process to implement the policy is on. Necessary approvals from various departments are being taken before the implementation.”To address faculty crunch||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/time-bound-promotion-for-medical-profs-soon-in-punjab-199899
