Around 2,250 healthcare workers have already received the first dose of Covishield.The Patiala Health Department claimed that 20 per cent of the healthcare workers of the district had already been covered. Around 11,000 healthcare workers, including private sector, were identified by the department in the first phase of the drive. As many as 792 workers received the Covid vaccine shot today.In view of the improved response, vaccination centres have now been increased to 16 from just three on the first day of the vaccine rollout.However, still some healthcare workers, especially ASHA, ANMs and multipurpose health workers, are not coming forward for vaccination.Some are even opposing the drive and have demanded fulfillment of their pending demands as a prerequisite for getting themselves vaccinated. However, the senior medical officers (SMO) of all blocks in the district have been directed to motivate them for the vaccination.Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said: “To alleviate the vaccine hesitancy, I am going to meet ASHA workers on Monday. I am sure the remaining beneficiaries will be vaccinated in the coming days.”Satinder Singh further added that none of health workers, who had already received the vaccines, exhibited any side effects and the remaining healthcare workers, therefore, should come forward without any fears.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/drive-gains-momentum-in-patiala-dist-2-250-inoculated-202748
