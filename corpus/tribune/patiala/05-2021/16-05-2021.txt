The youngsters continue swimming in canals and rivers flowing through the district with the law enforcing agency turning a blind eye to the risk.Every day, from morning till late evening, children continue to dive into high-current waters, flouting all the rules and safety warnings.Every summer, three to five youth lose their lives in the canals, particularly the BML.Earlier, too, there had been hue and cry about the issue, but lack of action by the police means that the danger persists.The BML remains a favourite spot for fun-loving youth, who in their quest to find some respite from scorching sun, descend on the Nabha road bridge and the Samana-Sangrur bridge to enjoy swimming.Interestingly, at both the points, there are police posts in close vicinity.Senior police officers said swimming in these canals had been banned and they would start arresting those who flout the rules. “We will take strict action to avoid any untoward incident in future,” said a senior police officer.

Scenes of grieving family members are very unsettling.”Management committee members said the prevailing situation was the most challenging phase of their lives. We have never been engaged in such professional duties earlier, they said.The responsibility to shift and transport Covid dead bodies lies with a dedicated team of mortuary marshals, doctors from the forensic-medicine department, pharmacy faculty, and four medical officers deputed by the office of Civil Surgeon, Patiala.The team at Rajindra Hospital is being supervised by nodal officer and in-charge of the Covid mortuary Dr DS Bhullar.“The dead bodies are kept in the cold rooms of the hospital mortuary till the time they are handed over to the relatives for cremation,” said Dr Bhullar.“The whole process of disposing of the dead bodies has to be carried out in a very dignified and sympathetic manner so that the feelings of the aggrieved relatives are not hurt. However, the risk of family members turning aggressive is always there,” he said.Direct exposure to the relatives, who might be potential Covid suspects, is also a huge challenge for the staff, including the doctors on duty.“The government has totally failed to recognise our services and the virus threat we are facing. Our meagre perks are also not being paid in time,” rued one of the marshals, who has been working at the mortuary for more than a year now.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/disposing-of-covid-bodies-takes-toll-on-hospital-staff-253541

Consequently, officials had to organise a testing camp at the village today.The health officials collected 121 samples there. However, villagers are still scared to come forward for testing.Dr Davinderjit, Senior Medical Officer, Bhadson, said, “Six villagers have already died of Covid. We are regularly conducting tests. However, people are still afraid to come forward. There is social stigma and fear of hospitalisation in rural areas.”The officials said the six patients who died of Covid were hospitalised only after their health deteriorated. The patients had not undergone Covid tests before they were hospitalised, said the officials.One of the villagers said, “The panchayat is now making announcements at the gurdwara asking people to get tested and vaccinated. Earlier, we took it lightly.”Sources in the Health Department said a majority of the villagers who died of Covid were taking treatment from registered medical practitioners (RMPs), who had no expertise of Covid treatment. “These RMPs are taking advantage of villagers’ fear of going to hospitals,” said a senior official.Taranveer Singh, Sarpanch, Ajnauda Kalan, said, “Earlier, villagers were showing a lackadaisical attitude towards Covid precautions. Now, they are coming forward for testing. We have appealed to residents to follow all guidelines.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/9-deaths-in-2-weeks-fear-grips-patiala-village-253420
