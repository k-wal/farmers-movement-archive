It belongs to the council but was sold by some people through formation of an illegal committee,” said Rajpura MC Executive Officer Ravneet Singh.The MC filed a civil suit after the matter was brought to the council’s notice by Patiala resident Varun Malhotra.Abhinav Oberoi, legal advisor to the Municipal Council, informed that the council had challenged all the sale deeds and mutations regarding the sold out land.“The ownership of the land should legally be with the MC. We have challenged all the registration deeds,” he said.The current market value of the land is more than Rs 26 crore, said Malhotra.
