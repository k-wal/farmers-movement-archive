While there are already many stray cattle in the area the menace has increased manifold after shifting of mandi here.”Another city resident on a Facebook post said his granddaughter, who was playing outside their house, had a miraculous escape when she was attacked by a stray bull.“It could have been devastating for the family. The MC needs to tackle the stray cattle menace seriously,” he added on the post.Earlier, the MC had started a drive to catch and shift stray cattle to gaushalas.When contacted, Senior Deputy Mayor Yoginder Singh Yogi, who had led the drive, said, “The drive to catch stray cattle will be launched again. We will catch stray cattle and send them to gaushalas. Also, cattle left by owner on roads will not be returned to them if caught by the MC team.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/stray-cattle-pose-threat-to-motorists-in-patiala-256736

The government would be left with no other option, but to take drastic action against defaulting hospital, the DC added.He claimed that most doctors, government and private alike, had set a good example of serving people wholeheartedly during the Covid crisis.There, however, were some black sheep in the system, which had been fleecing patients and tarnishing image of the entire medical profession, said the DC.It has been learnt that many private hospitals, reportedly, have been charging a huge amount from Covid patients for admission. Besides, a private hospital in the city charges Rs1,050 for the Covid RT–PCR test, which the government has capped at Rs450.The state and district-level committees would soon be conducting a detailed audit of Covid treatment done by private hospitals, the DC added.“Anyone can file a complaint about overcharging by any private hospital on the Health Department helpline number 104 and Covid helpline numbers 0175-2350550 and 6284357500,” said the DC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/administration-to-take-strict-action-against-pvt-hospitals-in-patiala-256735
