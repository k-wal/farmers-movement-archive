The farmers sat in straight lines ensuring social distancing, wore face masks, carried sanitisers and water bottles.Leaders of the Union said the state and the central governments, both, have failed in executing their duties in relation to the spread of Covid-19.General Secretary of BKU Ugrahan, Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, said, "People are dying but the governments have not been able to ensure availability of ventilators for them. We have proved time and again that farmers in Haryana or elsewhere have not been the reason for the spread of Covid-19. In fact, farmers and their families who came to the protest sites have been saved from Covid-19 because we have been warning them and informing about ensuring safety and social distancing."Responding to a question, he said actor Deep Sidhu along with others is responsible for trying to derail the farmers' protest.About 'Mission Fateh' launched by the Punjab government, he said, "The government had failed in ensuring facilities for people. The centre and state governments want to divert the attention of the people from important questions of the state. They have failed to ensure facilities in relation to the spread of Covid-19 because of which the people are scared of its infection and are not questioning the authorities."Manjit Singh Nyal, district Patiala president of BKU Ekta Ugrahan said, "We will continue this protest for three days. We will also ensure that guidelines in relation to Covid-19 are followed. Farmers in far more numbers want to gather but we have decided to keep the gathering to a maximum of 1,500 to 2,000 only."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/farmers-converge-in-patiala-allege-governments-failed-in-duty-against-covid-19-259837

All efforts will be made to follow the social distancing norms,” he said, adding the central and state governments were responsible for the plight of the farmers.Meanwhile, health officials said holding such an agitation at this juncture was ill advised as many villages had been declared containment zones and if farmers from these villages attended the event, it was likely the virus would spread further. “We have recorded a spike in cases in the rural areas. If they attend gatherings now, chances of its spread increase further, putting others at risk,” said an official.However, farm unions are adamant as thousands of protesters are camping in Patiala. “The dharna will be held to expose the government on unfilled vacancies in the health sector and how the poor were being fleeced in the name of treatment. Where were the governments during rallies and similar gatherings?” said a farm leader. — TNSJyani serves notice on private channel||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/farmers-agitation-hundreds-set-to-join-three-day-patiala-dharna-259496
