The MC had started working on the implementation of the public parking policy for municipal corporation towns of the state after it was notified in 2018.According to the policy, the Municipal Corporation will subdivide the city into multiple parking zones or parking management areas, which will be the main units for ensuring parking regulations and management. All areas will be notified as “paid parking”, “free parking”, “no-parking zones” and “public off-street parking”. Also, residential parking permits for on-street parking will be issued to residents living in a parking zone.Officials in the Municipal Corporation said the MC had started holding meetings over the matter. A number of spaces have been identified for the purpose. Overnight parking will also be allowed on notified roads in a manner that it does not cause congestion in residential areas.Senior Town Planner (STP) Gautam Kumar of the MC said: “We are holding preliminary meetings to decide parking and no-parking zones in order to prevent congestion on streets. A particular width of streets to be earmarked for parking is also being decided upon.”The officials said various private and government parking spaces would be utilised for general parking of vehicles in off-hours while a few new parking spaces would be created at the Ghas Mandi, Ragho Majra and other areas.“Roads will be identified where temporary parking will be allowed from 9 pm to 6 am the next day. This will also clear the way for ambulances in residential areas. Also, parking area of the district courts adjacent to Mata Kaushalya Hospital among others will be used for general parking from 5.30 pm to 9 am when there are no office employees and advocates using the space,” an official said.“We are also working on utilising land of Sanskrit Vidyalya at Sirhindi Bazaar for parking purposes and a piece of land belonging to a dera behind the AC market might also be used,” they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/mc-works-on-implementation-of-parking-policy-247554

Traders claim that the state police had uncovered instances of manufacture and sale of illicit liquor in recent months when authentic liquor was not allowed to be home delivered like other items.“We fear with no home delivery of liquor and curtailed hours of wine shops, the illegal trade will only mushroom as they would smuggle and drop liquor at homes,” said a liquor trader.“Usually, 85 per cent of liquor sale takes place from 6 pm to 11 pm after factories and shops are closed. During the day, only 15 per cent sales are reported. Imposition of lockdown since April 26 and complete lockdown from Friday 6 pm to Monday 5 am has hit the sales badly,” said another trader.The letter reads: “We request the government to waive the licence renewal fee for the month of April 2021 as liquor trade, restaurants and other eating joints are already facing losses due to fresh restrictions.”A Venu Prasad, Principal Secretary, Excise and Taxation, said: “As of now, no decision has been taken in this regard. We will look into the issue.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/liquor-traders-in-punjab-want-relief-in-lieu-of-curbs-247360

The reason: shortage of manpower, especially, anaesthetists to use these ventilators. Many ventilatiors were purchased during the first wave of pandemic.As per the health department, around 121 posts of anaesthetist and 98 of medicine doctors, along with others, were advertised recently, but only few showed up for the walk-in interview.Dr Harshinder Kaur, Government Medical College, PatialaProvide these to tertiary institutesTo ease out the workload and improve quality at tertiary healthcare institutes, ventilators should be provided to sub-divisional levels for better management of patients.Dr GB Singh, Director, Health and Family Welfare Department, said only 24 specialists, including some anaesthetist, of the total 488 posts had joined the department in the walk-in interview held last week.Consequent upon the shortage of manpower, the government had to distribute ventilators to private hospitals wherein infrastructure and manpower was already available. Besides, some ventilators have been redistributed in government hospitals taking into consideration the availability of professionals to handle the ventilators in the ICU therein.Confirming the development, Dr GB said, “We have now redistributed the ventilators to private and government hospitals where required manpower was available. Ironically, some anaesthetists are already posted at sub-divisional level or district hospitals. However, they don’t have the ventilators because these have only been made available at tertiary health care institutes like Government Medical Colleges.Consequently, the three tertiary Covid healthcare institutes — Patiala, Amritsar and Faridkot — are overwhelmed with Covid patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/short-of-staff-punjab-health-department-gives-ventilators-to-private-hospitals-247371
