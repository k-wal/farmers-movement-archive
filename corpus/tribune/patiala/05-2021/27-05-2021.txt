Most of the students write down answers from previous notes and books,” pointed out another student.A faculty member when contacted said, “The university is bound to conduct the examinations through available means. They can’t hold exams in offline mode as such cheating has become unavoidable. The entire process has become a formality.”“It is for the students to ensure that they answer the paper without cheating. Marks won’t help them much, knowledge will. Also, the parents should ensure their children answer the papers truthfully without cheating,” said another faculty member.Controller Examinations Dr Jasvirinder Singh Khattar said, “We have a vast number of students in various courses. We are holding the exams through online mode because the UGC in a recent communication said the offline exams should be kept in abeyance. So the blended mode has been adopted. We also do not want the students to waste their time waiting for exams.”He said the teachers conducting the exams were ensuring that students take the exam while remaining visible in online live mode.“We can check at least that. However, it may not be possible for all courses and students.
