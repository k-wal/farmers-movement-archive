They demanded that all such allotments should be cancelled. They would protest over the matter, AAP leaders added.As per information, aides of some Congress councillors had been allotted Verka booths.A temporary employee of the Municipal Corporation (MC), two other persons and a few others considered close to Congress councillors, all drawing salaries, had been allotted booths.Recently, the Finance and Contracts Committee of the corporation had passed a resolution stating that such booths would “boost Verka sale and provide employment to youngsters”.SAD leaders had raised objections when construction and work related to one such booth started at Sheranwala Gate here. Later, Youth Congress leaders also entered into a verbal duel with their counterparts owing allegiance to SAD.Tejinder Mehta, an AAP leader from Patiala, today said, “While youths in Punjab are holding protests for jobs, local Congress leadership is allotting Verka booths to their near and dear ones. Over 20 booths have been allotted to Congress associates in a completely arbitrary and illegal manner.”Megh Chand, AAP president, Patiala district (Rural), said Verka booths had been allotted to acquire public land illegally. “If the Municipal Corporation does not cancel illegal allotments within a week, we will hold a demonstration. We will also not let beneficiaries, who have been allotted booths, carry out construction at designated sites.”AAP leaders also alleged that while allotting booths, the MC had ignored the plight of unemployed youth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/patiala-verka-booths-allotted-to-cong-leaders-associates-says-aap-312351

Before this, the allottees have already paid a cumulative of Rs 2,022 per square yard while the area remained undeveloped for years.PDA officials said land acquisition collector-cum-SDM office recently raised demands of Rs 35.90 lakh from the PDA for payments to be made to farmers. This was after the farmers demanded compensation for acquisition of their land as was awarded to landowners who had earlier gone to the court claiming they were not compensated properly.In fact, the allottees have already paid a cumulative of Rs 2,022 per square yard towards enhanced payments for the farmers in instalments of Rs 499, 560 and 963 per square yard on different occasions as per orders of the PDA. The latest amount of Rs 963 per square yard was collected in 2018 after a Supreme Courtjudgment.Vinay Bublani, chief administrator, PDA, said, “Earlier, recovery notices of Rs 963 per square yard were issued to allottees after the land acquisition collector raised a claim of Rs 141.32 crore for the enhanced compensation. However, the office has further raised a claim for Rs 35.90 crore enhanced compensation related to landowners who filed their claims for the same in 2021. Therefore, recovery notices at the rate of Rs 430 are being issued now.”SDM Charanjit Singh said, “This recovery is being made to make payments to farmers. No more recovery is pending with the PDA anymore.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/patialas-pda-omaxe-city-project-allottees-to-pay-rs-35l-more-for-farmers-relief-312243
17-09-2021||---||37K contract staff set to be regularised in Punjab||Chandigarh, September 16Over 37,000 contractual employees working in the state government as well as in the state-owned boards and corporations are all set to be regularised.The agenda for the regularisation of services of employees will be debated in the Cabinet meeting scheduled for Friday. Sources in the government have told The Tribune that the employees who have completed 10 years of services on contractual/ad hoc basis in various government departments, boards and corporations would be eligible for regularisation, as per the recommendations of a Cabinet sub-committee comprising Local Government Minister Brahm Mohindra, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal, Rural Development Minister Tript Rajinder Bajwa and Technical Education Minister Charanjit Singh Channi.It is estimated there are over 32,100 contractual employees in various departments of the state government and about 34,000 such employees in the state-owned boards and corporations. Since regularisation of services is being proposed only against sanctioned posts, only over 50 per cent of these contractual employees stand to benefit. Also, the outsourced employees are unlikely to be considered.The government has prepared “The Punjab Protection and Regularisation of Contractual Employees Bill”, which will be discussed by the ministers on Friday, along with the financial implications of regularising services of such a huge number of employees. Initially, those whose services are regularised will get only the basic salary for three years, as per the policy of the state government. Sources in the Finance Department say the total salary bill of the government will increase by Rs 900 crore.Cabinet meet todayThe Cabinet on Friday will discuss “The Punjab Protection and Regularisation of Contractual Employees Bill” along with the financial implications of regularising services of such a huge number of employees.
