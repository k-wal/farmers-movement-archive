The Local Government Department has also directed its chief engineers to take necessary action with regard to complaint.The Deputy Secretary and Deputy Director, Local Government Department, Karandeep Singh, today said the Town Planning Department had received a complaint from a Rajpura resident, which was forwarded to offices concerned for necessary action.The letter issued by the department states, “All NGOs and animal welfare organisations recognised by the AWBI are not eligible for dog sterilisation programmes as they lack basic provisions for the same. Therefore, it’s necessary for them to seek separate permission from the AWBI for such programmes.”The department has directed offices concerned to stop allocating tenders for dog sterilisation and anti-rabies vaccination to such firms which don’t have separate permission for both programmes from the AWBI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/only-firms-permitted-by-awbi-to-sterilise-vaccinate-dogs-in-punjab-309660

These are important factors for their poor mental health,” said the team.“It is essential to value mental health especially depression that is characterised as one of the main mental diseases that affect women of the rural population. Our policies should shift their focus beyond maternal or reproductive health by incorporating mental and physical healthcare,” said Dr Naina.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/psychological-distress-more-among-rural-women-finds-punjabi-university-research-309665

It has been learnt that the Dental Council of India had regularly inspected the college and told the authorities to recruit faculty.New buildingIronically, a new building worth crores has been constructed on the college premises wherein one entire floor has been dedicated to the oral surgery department, but the college has no oral surgeon.Consequently, majority of the patients at the hospital are being looked after either by interns or post-graduation students. A professor said: “A medical college, just a few metres away from here, recruits faculty every year. Though crores have been spent on constructing a new building, no serious efforts are being made to hire faculty.”Dr Renu Bala Sroa said: “Despite shortage, students are being taught. The hospital is also being managed by the staff available.
