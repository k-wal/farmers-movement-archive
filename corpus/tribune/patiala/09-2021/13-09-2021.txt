It is clarified that no land which is earmarked for hadda rori… as per revenue record falls within the walled premises of the dairy project.”The civic body also said it had come up with the dairy project at Ablowal village for proper management of dairies operating within its limits.MC officials, meanwhile, said the construction of plots at the new site was going on. They also said the dairies would not be allowed to function within the city premises after September 30.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/land-for-project-not-part-of-graveyard-patiala-mc-310357

Now, it seems that it was just an election gimmick because qualified youngsters without jobs are on roads,” he said.Dhilwan also informed that one of the protesters – Manish Fazilka – had been protesting atop a water tank at the Sangrur Civil Hospital.Later in the evening, the protesters lifted the dharna after a written assurance of a meeting with Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla and Sandeep Sandhu – OSD to Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh.Meanwhile, commuters were at the receiving end due to the road blockade by the protesting teachers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/protesting-teachers-block-bathinda-chandigarh-national-highway-near-jahlan-village-demand-jobs-310360

Late night, victim’s brother Gurpreet Singh (14) succumbed to the injuries.According to the police, a cracker manufacturing unit was being run illegally from the house. The roof of the house was blown apart in the blast.The blast at the illegal cracker unit being run from the house of Krishan Kumar — father of the injured children — has sent shock waves across Patiala district. Illegal production of crackers continues unabated in the district with Rajpura emerging as a hub.Crackers were being manufactured, stored and sold without regulation. Fire officials said they had not given permission to produce or store crackers.In 2017, a person died and three others were injured in a blast at a cracker unit in the Mirch Mandi area of Rajpura. A week before Diwali in 2017, a 13-year-old girl had lost her life while making crackers in another factory. A shop in Balbera had also caught fire in 2017 leading to loss of lakhs of rupees.“The cracker business picks up pace after the rainy season. Crackers are mostly brought from outside and stored in the town. We will carry out raids at unregulated shops,” said an official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/another-rajpura-cracker-unit-blast-victim-succumbs-toll-two-310247
