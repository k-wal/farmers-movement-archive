06-09-2021||Ravneet Singh||Punjabi University professor to be part of IUCN study group||Tribune News ServicePatiala, September 5Ant specialist and head of the Zoology Department at Punjabi University here Dr Himender Bharti has been nominated as a member of a specialist group approved by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).President of the International Network for Study of Ants (ANeT), Dr Bharti will work on conservation of ant species of the Asian region, along with seven other leading scientists from across the globe.Bharti, who has completed 11 major research projects sanctioned by the Ministry of Science and Technology, has till date discovered 100 new species of ants, including two potential red-list species. Ninety per cent of these species are endemic to the Indian region.It is for the first time that an ant specialist group has been established by the IUCN, which is the world’s most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of vertebrates and invertebrates, said Bharti.“We will work on enlisting existing species of ants, their distribution, prioritising disturbed areas, threatened and invasive species. We will also formulate an action plan for the conservation of the ecosystems,” he said.“My focus will be on Asian ants,” Bharti added.Till now, ants had been under-represented on the red list, he said. But now they have been recognised for their significance in the global ecosystems.“We need to explore the bio-diversity and create an action plan to conserve healthy ecosystems as many species are threatened and going extinct due to invasive species and human intervention,” said Bharti.The invasive species are highly adaptive and modify the ecosystem they invade, resulting in ecological imbalance, he informed.Till now, over 15,000 ant species have been reported world over and scientists expect over 20,000 more. Of the total, about 900 are from the Indian region, which Dr Bharti says is under-explored.“We published a comprehensive checklist of 828 species from India in 2017,” he said.“Human intervention in the environment is also taking place at a fast pace. Coupled with climate change, if it continues at the same scale, it is possible that many species might go extinct before being discovered,” he said.Apart from Bharti, scientists from the USA, Australia, South Africa, Brazil and the United Kingdom will be a part of the study that will span around 7-10 years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/punjabi-university-professor-to-be-part-of-iucn-study-group-307317

We have already expressed our desire to address all issues of farmer leaders and are willing to answer their queries,” said Chandumajra. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/lathicharge-on-farmers-during-sad-event-a-conspiracy-claims-prem-singh-chandumajra-307311

We want the government to implement the CSR as mentioned in our recruitment letters or merge us with the Education Department. The teachers’ services were regularised under the Punjab Information and Communication Technology Education Society after five years of contract work in 2011. But the following year, various facilities, including holidays, medical reimbursements and compensation to the family in case of death of a teacher were withheld, they said today.As such, nearly 7,000 such teachers have been staging protests, demanding implementation of the civil services rules (CSR) as incorporated in their joining letters. The teachers who congregated in Patiala on Teacher’s Day today, said a computer teacher, Sarbjit Singh of Kapurthala, died in an accident on way to school regarding a computer-related work and another teacher from Bathinda died after being infected while hewas deputed on Covid-19 duty, but their families were not compensated.Jaswinder Kaur of Patran in Patiala, who is MA, BEd and TET-pass, said her husband Baljit Singh was a computer teacher since 2006 and the sole breadwinner of their family of five. “He died due to Covid-19 in May this year. My father-in-law died a week after. The government did not compensate us. Since then, I and my 11 and 2.5-year-olds are forced to live in difficulty. I have no job and want the government to grant me a job to be able to take care of my family,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/families-of-70-deceased-punjab-govt-school-staffers-await-benefits-307168
