Though no monetary compensation can relieve anguish of the victims and their dependants, it enables the victim to start life afresh”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/justice-in-context-of-court-judgment-discussed-310914

Teachers of government schools attacked the Punjab Government for using school exams for their political gains through a “government advertisement” in a question paper.Citing an instance, the teachers alleged that the government smartly highlighted the increase in social security pension from Rs750 to Rs1,500 in the Punjabi exam of Class V that was held today.The Democratic Teachers Front (DTF) said the Education Department had been using the exam as a “PR tool” ahead of the Assembly elections.Vikram Dev, president, DTF, said the government had stooped to a new low by using question papers as a platform for their political advertisements. He said: “This is shameful. We strongly condemn this. They deliberately have chosen government ad, which has been widely used across the state.”Dev said over two lakh students took the examination today, and they took the question paper home while answer sheets (OMR) were submitted at the centre.The teachers said the Education Department had played tricks and directed the teachers, students and parents to like, comment and share the posts which were uploaded by the department on Facebook.Meanwhile, Harinder Kaur, District Education Officer, said: “The questions are prepared by the state Education Department. Therefore, I am not in a position to comment.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/punjab-government-advertisement-on-question-paper-raises-eyebrows-310913

The allocation of the site by the Municipal Corporation has invited the ire of residents and political parties alike who questioned the decision, stating that it is government land adjacent to the road and there is already a lack of parking space in the area.Residents and employees of various office in the area said while there was already a lack of parking space at the site, the corporation was allocating space used for parking of vehicles, for the setting up of a booth.A resident said: “Many shops in government projects of the Improvement Trust and others in the city are gathering dust as they have been lying ignored years after their construction and expenditure of public funds on these. There are no takers for them. The corporation is allocating public land of footpath and parking space for the setting up of Verka booths in an already congested spot.”Harpal Juneja, a leader of the SAD, said he was on his way when he stopped to look at the site. “They are raising a Verka booth by encroaching on public land here. This is government land. Leaders of the Congress are encroaching on here, while the party-led corporation is itself breaking pavements built in front of houses.”Juneja said: “This construction and erection of the booth is in complete violation of municipal norms. Therefore, we have decided to take up the matter with the MC Commissioner’s office. If it all fails, we will launch a protest over the matter.”Meanwhile, MC Commissioner Poonamdeep Kaur said the land was earmarked and allocated by the corporation after taking it up at a meeting of general House. “The House had given its approval for setting up a Verka booth here. The permission for the erection of a booth was given only after that.”Asked about residents’ claims that it was public land, she said Verka booths were usually designated on roadside only. She said: “Those who have concerns with it should give a representation in writing to the MC, which will be considered.” — TNS‘Matter approved by MC House’Municipal Corporation Commissioner Poonamdeep Kaur said the land was earmarked and allocated by the corporation after taking it up at a meeting of the General House. “The House had given its approval for setting up a Verka booth here.

However, both were immediately rescued by divers.After the incident, fellow protesters blocked the Patiala-Bathinda highway.The unemployed ETT-qualified youth were protesting against the state government for not holding the Punjab State Teachers Eligibility Test (PSTET) on a regular basis, thereby, leaving them in-eligible for the current recruitment.The protesters claimed that they could not apply for the ongoing recruitment of 6,635 teachers in the Education Department because they couldn't clear TET exams, a criterion to apply for the job, for no fault of theirs.Rajni Sharma, a leader of the ETT-pass Unemployed Union, said the government did not hold the PSTET for 2019, 2020 and 2021. She said: “The PSTET-2018 was held in February last year. Owing to the failure of the government to hold the PSTET, we have been rendered in-eligible.”They should do away with the PSTET eligibility for the ongoing recruitment.Later in the evening, the protesters called off their dharna after an assurance of meeting with MP Singh, who is OSD to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/2-ett-qualified-youths-jump-into-bhakra-canal-in-patiala-310905

Comparing the data with the corresponding period in 2020, Ludhiana reported 650 accidents against 749 in 2019; Patiala 495 in 2020 and 670 in 2019; and Mohali 358 in 2020 and 363 in 2019.The number of accidents reported in 2020 was less due to Covid-induced lockdown. All these cases were assisted by 108 emergency ambulance services.Saikat Mukherjee, Project Head, Ziqitza Healthcare, Ambulance 108, said Ludhiana reported the highest accidental cases in the last two months. “Our staff ensured that all victims were admitted to hospital in time and were given medical support.”Dr Kamaljeet Singh Soi, member of National Road Safety Council, said damaged roads and poor drainage system were main reasons for the rising number of accidents.“We don’t have rain water drainage system in Ludhiana and roads are in bad shape. During monsoon, roads are waterlogged almost all the time and in some places potholes remain filled with water, posing health risks too. Whenever a car/ two-wheeler drives through such pool of water at high speed, drivers lose control, resulting in accidents,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/at-1-280-ludhiana-sees-max-accidents-310797

Further, we will allow non-fiscal incentives to such industry in terms of availability of ‘panchayat’ land for storage of paddy straw with 33-year lease agreement,” said officials.Sources say the government plans to ensure they manage to cut farm fire incidents by half this season by using various means. “Punjab wants to add to the farm income by diverting additional farm stubble to such units due to rising cases of farm fires,” said a source.“We welcome the move and it’s a positive step and but its success will depend highly on the farmer getting a suitable price for the stubble,” said Satnam Singh Behru, president, Consortium of Indian Farmers’ Associations.According to the government data, in 2020 over 76,500 farm fires were reported in Punjab. In 2019, the number stood at 52,900, while in 2018, over 51,700 incidents were recorded. Every season, over 15 million tonnes of paddy straw is burnt in open fields ahead of winter sowing.“To curb the menace of paddy straw burning adding to poor air quality, the state government is working to present ‘paddy straw’ as a resource that creates value and wealth for industry and the farming community,” said a top official.Meanwhile, starting Wednesday, over 8,000 village-level nodal officers appointed for the current paddy season will monitor farm fires round the clock using a mobile app. In addition, over 76,626 advanced machinery will be available in the state.However, experts suggest this year, stubble burning can start as early as mid-September, given early sowing in parts of the state, and these are not good signs amid the Covid pandemic, which affects patients with weak lungs.The state Agriculture Department is banking on 76,000 machines, which will take care of the 20 lakh hectares of agricultural fields with stubble. “This year, we expect 40 per cent less cases of stubble. However, ensuring cooperation from farm unions is crucial,” said a senior agriculture official.“With elections round the corner, soft approach towards punishing erring farmers could be a deterrent to ensuring ‘no farm fire policy’,” added the official.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, stubble burning contributes significantly to air pollution in Delhi and NCR every post-paddy season.Distilleries to benefitWin-win for allThe government is working to present paddy straw as a resource that creates value and wealth for industry and farming community. — A govt official||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/rs-25-cr-sop-for-industry-to-curb-farm-fires-in-punjab-310755
