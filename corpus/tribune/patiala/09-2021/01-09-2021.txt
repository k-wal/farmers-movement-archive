01-09-2021||---||Extend Punjab Assembly session: Bir Devinder Singh||Patiala, August 31Former Deputy Speaker Bir Devinder Singh today termed the calling of one-day Punjab Assembly session on September 3, a “legislative fraud”.The session will be held without a Question Hour and legislative agenda.A “legislative fraud” is being committed “in order to circumvent the discussion on important issues confronting Punjab”, he said.“Technically, one day session of the Punjab Legislative Assembly under Section 173 (1) of the Constitution, meets the statutory requirement of the Constitution to hold session of the Assembly within six months of the last sitting of the House. But the deceptive exercise does not correspond with the expectations of the people of Punjab, rather it sounds like a sham,” Bir Devinder Singh said in a release issued here.The government may use the session for the remembrance of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji on his 400th birth anniversary, “but why scuttle the legitimate deliberation on other important issues expected to be discussed in the House”, questioned the former Deputy Speaker.“The one-day session of the Punjab Assembly must be extended in deference to the expectations of the people and also as demanded by the collective opposition, including the PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/extend-punjab-assembly-session-bir-devinder-singh-304900

01-09-2021||---||Shifting of Dairies: Patiala farmers approach Akal Takht||Patiala, August 31Nearly three years after the Patiala Municipal Corporation allocated tenders for the ‘dairy shifting project’ at Ablowal village, the process has been stalled over the allegations of “infringement of the right to religion of dairy farmers”.The farmers, who had earlier moved court over the shifting of their dairies to Ablowal village, have now approached the Akal Takht, claiming that their right to religion was being violated.Advocates representing the dairy farmers said the land, where the dairy farmers were supposed to shift to, belongs to a graveyard and it could neither be used for residential and religious purposes by Hindu and Sikh families nor for setting up gaushalas.Ravneet Singh Joshi, one of the advocates representing the farmers, said they had also raised the issue with Patiala MP Preneet Kaur, Mayor Sanjeev Sharma and the Chief Minister’s Office.“The dairy farmers’ right to religion should be protected. They are being forced to shift to the new site. We will also get in touch with the Hindu Mahasabha over the issue,” said Joshi.Joshi said they had raised a number of issues with the Municipal Corporation in a previously sent legal notice, including that there was only minor development at the new site and high tension wires crossed the area.“At the same time, part of the land belongs to a graveyard. This information came to light at the time of the allotment of plots,” said Joshi. “It is really baffling as the MC had been carrying out the works for the dairy shifting project since years.”Joshi said they had written to the Akal Takht seeking its intervention as religious activities of Sikhs could not be carried out on such land.MC Commissioner Poonamdeep Kaur said: “The land for the project was identified over 15 years ago.”The matter is being raised after a court order has already been delivered in relation to the shifting. The issue was not raised in the legal notice as well, she said.‘Protect our rights’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/shifting-of-dairies-patiala-farmers-approach-akal-takht-304880
