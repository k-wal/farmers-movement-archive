05-02-2021||Patiala||Docs on hunger strike against ‘mixopathy’||Doctors associated with the Indian Medical association (IMA) in the city today held a hunger strike as a mark of protest against the Centre Government’s proposal to allow mixing of various treatments and procedures carried out under the modern science along with those of ‘Unani’ and ‘Ayush’.Under the “Save healthcare India movement” doctors said they had launched massive awareness drives across the country as the government proposal was a threat to the safety and healthcare of the people. Doctors across the country are holding relay hunger strikes from February 1 to February 14.Part of the protest, Dr Neeraj Goyal, president, IMA, Patiala, said, “The Centre Government through its recent notification aims to allow practitioners of traditional sciences to carry out procedures, part of the modern sciences, to increase number of available doctors. This will affect the healthcare system as they are not well taught with procedures we carry out and study for since the MBBS. We are not against other sciences, but the government should not allow ‘mixopathy’.”“The government aims to allow practitioners of ‘Unani’ and ‘Ayush’ among others to carry out over 130 procedures, including dental, general, piles-related, major, abdominal and other surgeries,” he added.The association said they were joined by members of the dental association while the IMA had directed its Medical Students’ Network (MSN), Junior Doctors’ Network (JDN), IMA Women’s’ Wing, IMA Hospital Board, in-service doctors and medical colleges to participate in the movement.“On the last day of the fasting, the IMA will launch ‘capital chalo’ movements in each state,” the association added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/docs-on-hunger-strike-against-mixopathy-208165
