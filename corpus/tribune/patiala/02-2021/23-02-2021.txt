He said the government was adopting anti-people and pro-corporate policies.He said: “Public sector banks need to be strengthened instead of privatising them. A lot of private banks have already collapsed, jeopardising the savings of common people.”Yadvinder Gupta said: “We can’t forget the scams of the past where private bank owners became the borrowers and looted public money. When banks were controlled by corporates, they were catering only to the rich and affluent while common people had no access to the banking services.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/patiala-bankers-protest-privatisation-move-216403
23-02-2021||---||Doctors: Health Minister Balbir Sidhu’s remark irresponsible||Patiala, February 22A day after the Punjab Health Minister issued a warning to get the vaccine jab or lose quarantine leave, doctors today termed his statement “irresponsible”.Condemning the remark, the Punjab State Medical and Dental Teachers’ Association (PSMDTA) said the minister could not put a condition for Covid vaccination. The minister, as per isolation guidelines, could not deny quarantine leave and free treatment, it said. The association said the statement of the minister was a “dictatorial one”.Talking to The Tribune, Dr DS Bhullar, state general secretary, PSMDTA, said, “This shows the attitude of the state government towards Covid warriors. If the government wants to deny legitimate allowance for not getting the jab, the ruling should be extended to all government departments and not to health workers only.”State president Dr Vijay Bodal said, “When the health workers are taking all precautions, the minister need not worry about their safety.”Meanwhile, new recruits of the Health Department said instead of using soft measures such as incentives, the government was resorting to coercion. Meanwhile, the PSMDTA appealed to health professionals to shun hesitation and come forward to get vaccinated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/doctors-health-minister-balbir-sidhus-remark-irresponsible-216233
