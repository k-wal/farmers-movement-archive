The action by the department is said to have been taken after an NGO blamed the hospital for cheating blood donors.An NGO, Vande Matram Dal, which has also filed a complaint to the Patiala SSP, said the blood bank of Amar Hospital here was taking extra blood from donors without bringing it to their knowledge. Gurmukh Singh, a member of the NGO, alleged that employees of the hospital were selling the extra blood collected from donors to other private hospitals without maintaining any record. He said: “The poor donors are not aware what quantity of blood is being withdrawn. If a donor is healthy, they would withdraw extra blood without putting it to his knowledge. It is a fraud.”Meanwhile, while talking to The Tribune, the Patiala Civil Surgeon, Dr Satinder Singh, said: “We have marked an inquiry into the matter. A committee will submit its report within five days. Further action, if required, will be taken after looking into the inquiry report.”Notably, two officials of the Health Department visited the blood bank after the NGO allegedly caught an employee red-handed on Saturday. A team of the department seized video recordings and documents.Dr Gurpreet Singh Battu, Chief Operating Officer, Amar Hospital, said: “The allegations are being looked into by the district health authorities, therefore it will not be appropriate for me to make any comment.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/department-orders-inquiry-against-private-hospital-206468
