25-02-2021||---||Education Dept slaps  notices on teachers||Patiala, February 24The Education Department today slapped slapped show-cause notices on Government schoolteachers, who exposed irregularities in the mid-day meal ration.In the wake of the exposure of the wrongdoing by said teachers, the department had to suspend the school principal. However, principal was reinstated within 10 days before the completion of the inquiry.In notices issued by the Education Department it was stated that teachers instead of informing the higher authorities about irregularities straightaway called the media to school, which brought a bad name to the department.On the other hand teachers claimed that they had first informed the higher authorities, including Education Secretary and Education Minister, but they simply ignored the matter.As per the audit team of the Education Department, which conducted a physical verification of the mid-day meal ration on December 17, 2020, irregularities were found therein.Meanwhile, the Democratic Teacher Front (DTF), a teachers’ union, blamed political pressure for the decision to issue show-cause notices to teachers.The inquiry officer-cum-deputy director, mid-day meal cell, IPS Malhotra, said, “The school principal was suspended on the basis of the preliminary inquiry report. However, regular inquiry is still pending. I can’t comment on the decision to reinstate school principal because it is up to the government to revoke suspension.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/education-dept-slaps-notices-on-teachers-217314
