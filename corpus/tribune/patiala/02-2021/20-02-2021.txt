They had been raising this demand with the administration for over 25 years, but to no avail, pastors and members added.Pastor DV Stephen and pastor Rajeev said members of the Christian fraternity would resort to hunger strike if the administration failed to meet their demands.“The present graveyard on a land measuring 2,000 square yard in the city is 125 years old. Governments in the past have assured us that more land will be allotted for the purpose, but failed to do so. The situation is so bad at the cemetery that graves of other people are dug-up while digging new burial pits and human bones come out,” they added.“People who go to graveyard for last rites are forced to stand on graves due to lack of space. We were given assurance that land will be allotted at the Ghalori gate, but it has not been done,” they said.“If our demands are not met, we will resort to hunger strike to mark our protest,” they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/christian-fraternity-demands-land-for-graveyard-in-patiala-214998
