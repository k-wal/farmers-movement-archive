Don't get distracted from our ultimate aim—repeal of farm laws.”Attacking the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Punjabi singer Pammi Bai, said: “Until now, the PM has been silent on our 175 farmers, who lost their lives in the agitation. This—insensitivity of the PM—is very shameful for the country.”Appealing to the youngsters, he said: “Farmer’s agitation is a peaceful protest, therefore, they shouldn't indulge in any violence at all.Reacting to tweets by Bollywood and American singer Rihanna’s post, Punjabi actor Binu Dhillon, said: “They should have some conscience.

All right-thinking citizens are now on warpath, to oppose the three draconian agri laws.”Government school teachers—under Democratic Teachers Front—took part in the protests at various parts of the district.Vikram Dev, state president, DMF, said: “Government school teachers in Punjab have been protesting all along against the three Agri bills.
