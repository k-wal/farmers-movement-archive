21-03-2021||Aman Sood||The ‘winged man’ who plays host to sparrows||Tribune News ServicePatiala, March 20The chirps of house sparrows, which used to be ubiquitous, are no longer heard, but this man has been on a mission for over two decades.“Scooting behind their nests, waiting patiently, it swoops in and starts to peck at the grain scattered on the narrow wall. I find sweetness in this chaotic exchange. They never stop chirping. So much that I do not need an alarm to wake up,” says Lakshman Das Kashyap, more popularly known as Toni.Toni, who works with SBI, observes sparrows in his free time. A small tree outside his house, and specked with bird houses inside and around the porch, his house is an abode to about 150 sparrows.“The bird houses,” he says, “are a suitable habitat for birds that live near human settlements.” “I used to wake up and feed the sparrows outside my house at Lalbagh first thing in the morning,” Toni reminisces.“But when I moved to my new house, I realised what a sorry state of affairs this is. The sparrow has lost its natural habitat to human greed. It’s time we save them,” he said.While sparrows have been slowly disappearing due to rapid urbanisation, the number of these little visitors thronging Toni’s house has been increasing over the years. From planting a sapling, which grew into a tree, to providing shelter at night and hanging fake sparrows on it to attract birds, his endeavours have bore him sweet results.“It was a few years ago when my wife and I saw a sparrow perched on the tree. We fed it regularly and in less than two months, the tree came alive with the twittering of about 60 sparrows. Every month, we get food for the birds along with our groceries,” Toni said.“More and more people are installing birdhouses in their homes and despite having to clean bird droppings multiple times in a day, people have stuck through with preserving sparrows. I have myself donated over 200 such houses from my savings,” he says.“I hope that with time, the trend catches on with the youth and this endangered species makes a comeback,” he says, adding: “It’s their home. I do not believe in capturing them and keeping them in cages. They return because they want to. Everyone lives for their own self. I want to devote my life to my winged friends.” Abode to about 150 sparrowsToni, who works with the SBI, observes sparrows in his free time.
