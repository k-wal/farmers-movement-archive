The owners throw garbage and dairy waste into the drain which causes so much inconvenience to the people living in the area,” said a Jattan Wala Chontra resident.Another city resident, showing a photograph of the waste lying out in the open, said, “The sewerage in the area remains blocked due to disposal of dairy waste. Municipal Corporation workers come and clear the choked drain but they leave the waste in the open. Today we complained to senior officials of the MC after which the issue was resolved.”Meanwhile, Senior Deputy Mayor Yoginder Singh Yogi, whose area is the most affected, said, “We have given an ultimatum to all dairy owners to shift the dairies by August 31. Else, we will start imposing fines on them.”“Of the 16 dairy owners in my area, 14 have deposited the earnest money. In total, 46 owners from across the city have deposited the 5 per cent earnest money to begin work on their plots. More people are expected to deposit the money and begin the work. The work will be carried out as per the plan for the benefit of city residents,” said Yogi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/mc-to-shift-dairies-out-of-city-by-august-end-231948

They are against the checklist issued by the university and this is delaying our promotions as well,” said one of the staffers who did not wish to be named.Another member of the teaching staff said, “Our promotion should be the result of our hard work. It should not be stalled because others have pending cases against them. The university should look at the matters individually. Many teachers are of this view. As a result, the teaching fraternity is a divided house.”PUTA president Dr Nishan Singh Deol said, “We want the university to take up all pending promotion matters collectively and not pick and choose.”“The court cases pending against some officials pertain to their appointments or other issues, but this has never been a criteria for promotion in the past,” said Deol.Acting Vice-Chancellor Ravneet Kaur said, “None of the over 200 promotion matters has been stopped. But we can’t consider all 200 matters in one go, so we have decided to hold a Syndicate meeting every month to clear the matters one after the other. The PUTA members should cooperate in it.”Ravneet Kaur further said PUTA had moved court stating that her appointment to the top post was illegal and she should not be allowed to hold the Syndicate meeting, and now they want her to take up all previously pending matters in the Syndicate. She said her office had issued a 20-point checklist to provide all important information to the Syndicate. “The information about a candidate having done PhD/NET or having any pending inquiry or complaint is important,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/pending-promotions-pbi-varsity-teaching-staff-a-divided-house-231949

The study shows even educated youngsters spent lakhs on the process, many leaving their families under debt.The paper, “Socio-economic and demographic analysis of international migration from rural Punjab: A case study of Patiala district”, points out that along with unemployment and the desire to earn more, the drug menace has become a significant reason for migration.Out of 297 migrants from 207 households of five randomly picked villages of Patiala, 52.03 per cent left the country due to unemployment, 46.28 per cent with a desire to earn more, 42.57 per cent for better living conditions and 9.12 per cent left due to drug menace, it said.The paper published by serving and former faculty members of Punjabi University and its colleges adds that most migrants opted for education as the purpose of migration and used family savings, took bank loans and sold their properties for it.They also spent Rs 15-20 lakh on the purpose, while some reported spending Rs 20-25 lakh as well. But only 34.12 per cent of all sent home remittances to their families, the study points out, adding that 65.88 per cent migrants sent no remittance.Dr Gian Singh, former professor, Punjabi University, said this had left over two-thirds of all such families under debt, including 4.35 per cent households reporting a debt of over Rs 20 lakh.“Among indebted households, 45.55 per cent were under a debt of Rs 5-10 lakh,” he added. The study also states that as most migrants shifted to developed countries of the west, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US and Italy, as such their age, level of education and cost of migration had also significantly affected the state negatively.The study found that three-fourths of all who migrated were youths aged between 20 and 30 years, followed by those between 15-20 years and 30-35 years. Also, most were educated till secondary level or had a graduate and post-graduate degree. Dr Singh said: “This is causing brain drain, capital drain and loss of demographic dividends.”The study also evaluates migration on the basis of caste and states that 91 per cent who migrated were from general category Punjabi Jat families.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/debt-misery-hits-families-as-youth-fly-abroad-231808
