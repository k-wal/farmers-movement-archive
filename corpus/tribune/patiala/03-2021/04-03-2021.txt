They alleged that the government intends to ultimately abolish posts.The Education Department under the garb of online transfer policy was hiding vacant posts at respective schools by suppressing information about sanctioned vacancies, said teachers. However, the government has attributed it to technical error.Hardeep Toderpur, a government school teacher, said, “Instead of filling vacancies, the Education Department is trying to abolish already sanctioned posts.”Meanwhile, Virkam Dev, state president, DMF, said, “The Education Department lacks transparency on teachers post. The numbers of posts keeps changing on the portal thus raising doubts about department’s intention. Rationalisation of teachers should be done only as per the 2018 policy.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/teachers-protest-accuse-edu-dept-of-hiding-posts-220284
