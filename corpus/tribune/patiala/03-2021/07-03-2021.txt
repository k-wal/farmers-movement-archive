However, heavy police, deployed at YPS Chowk, stopped them from marching ahead.After a minor scuffle broke out between the police and the protesters, the police resorted to lathi charge. Over a dozen protesters received injuries. One of the union members is also believed to have suffered a fracture on his hand.The members of the morcha were out on the streets for their long-pending demands —disbursement of DA instalments of government employees, introduction of old pension scheme, regularisation of contractual employees, implementation of the sixth pay commission report and minimum wages for ASHA facilitators and midday meal workers.Davinder Punia, convener, Punjab and UT Mulazam Sangarsh Morcha, said: “Lathi charge on women is the government’s gift to them on International Women’s Day.

Several efforts were made to trace his home, however, they failed as the boy did not speak might be out of fear, she added.However, last year, the boy somehow revealed that he came from Nepal, which helped us trace his parents, she said.“We continued our efforts and in December last year the boys parents were identified. The child could not be deported to Nepal as the matter related another country,” she added.“Consequently, the Punjab State Legal Services Authority, SAS Nagar, took up the matter with the state government and the Ministry of External Affairs, Northern Division, New Delhi, for repatriation of the child to his country. And the efforts bore fruits,” she said.“Initially, it was tough as the kid did not speak much. However, we kept on searching about his parents. On getting information that he belonged to Nepal, we found his parents,” she added.With collaborative efforts, the boy, identified as Prem Thapa, was handed over to a representative of an NGO “Kin Nepal” in New Delhi. The Nepal-based NGO will now take the child to his country and hand him over to his parents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/nepali-boy-repatriated-home-after-two-years-221652
