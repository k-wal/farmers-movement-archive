Moreover, PRTC faced financial losses during the COVID lockdown and had already sought relief from the government, however, nothing was granted.Nirmal Singh Dhaliwal, general secretary, All India Trade Union Congress, and former PRTC employee, said: “We don’t object to any social welfare scheme, however, the government should ensure that it reimburses the payment – timely.”Nitish Singla, Additional Managing Director, PRTC, said: “Though things will be clear after notification will be issued, however, the government has allocated a separate budget for this. Sometimes, there has been a delay in the reimbursement, however, we do get the payments from the government.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/govt-fails-to-clear-pending-dues-concession-of-free-travel-for-women-college-students-may-put-prtc-in-tight-spot-223266
