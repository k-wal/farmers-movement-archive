29-11-2021||---||Punjabi University?s research scholars want degrees to be awarded during convocation||Tribune News ServicePatiala, November 28Punjabi University’s decision to give away PhD degrees to only those students who had passed out from the institution in 2021, during the upcoming convocation, has miffed a number of former scholars.The research scholars said they were trying to contact the Vice Chancellor and the Higher Education Minister to make a change in the decision. The VC office though said they had not received any representation till date.Punjabi University will hold the convocation ceremony after a gap of six years on December 9.In a recent notification, the university had announced to give away medals and degree certificates of PhD to only those students who had passed out in 2021.Expressing his displeasure, Amandeep Singh of the Punjab Student Union said: “The PhD degree should be given to scholars during the convocation ceremony only. The university has decided to provide the degrees to students through their respective departments. The once in a lifetime moment of a researcher receiving the degree during the convocation ceremony should be honoured.”Hardeep Toderpur of Democratic Employees Federation said the university officials were telling students to collect the degrees from their respective departments as the number of recipients was enormous.“But this is a mistake on part of the university. Why haven’t they held the convocation for the past so many years. Students should not be made to pay for this lapse,” he said.Various students’ union leaders also announced to hold a rally parallel to the convocation ceremony if their demands were not met.Vice-Chancellor Prof Arvind said: “I have not received any representation from anyone regarding the convocation ceremony. Those who have reservations against the decision should contact my office. We will address their issues.”He said the university was open to all options, including holding a separate ceremony and extending it as per the need.“We will try to accommodate all genuine demands that reach us. Till now, no one has approached my office,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/punjabi-universitys-research-scholars-want-degrees-to-be-awarded-during-convocation-344110
