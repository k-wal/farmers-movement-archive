They accused the state government for the financial slump of the university and said it was working on the agenda of privatisation of the institution. They said they decided that the state government should waive the university’s loans and increase its monthly grant. The activists said: “The increase in fees should be rolled back while action should be initiated in relation to pending matters of inquiry.”SYFI activists protestAlleging that the university administration has failed in initiating action in matters of inquiry, student activists of the Secular Youth Federation of India (SYFI) ‘gheraoed’ the guest house where the press meet was organised. The activists had organised a protest on the campus during the day as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/punjabi-university-marks-probe-into-scams-340151

Insiders suspect horse-trading from both sides.The ‘rebel’ councillors held a meeting with Congress general secretary Harish Chaudhary and Mohindra in Chandigarh for over two hours. A parallel meeting was organised at MP Preneet Kaur’s New Moti Bagh Palace, where, sources said, over 17 councillors were present.The councillors in their no-confidence notice to the Mayor, a copy of which was forwarded to other officers and the CM, said: “Almost all members of the House have lost confidence in you. It would be appropriate for you to resign on moral grounds.”Talking to The Tribune, councillor said: “We have lost confidence in the Mayor due to his ‘anti-party’ activities. We stand with the party and will accept its decision. Nearly 40 were present at the meeting in Chandigarh today.”On his part, Mohindra said: “The party high command had given a go-ahead to the councillors to take their decision for the betterment of the city. Now, the onus is on him (Sharma) to call a meeting.”Sharma accused the minister of instigating the councillors to ensure a party ticket for his son from his constituency. He said: “Mohindra acted as a dictator in 2020 also when he shifted 26 wards from the MC to the Improvement Trust.
