We will be providing world-class treatment at the super speciality wing.”Notably, heart patients, in the absence of said facility, had to either rush to private hospitals and shell out a fortune or go to the PGI in Chandigarh for treatment.Dr Gautam Singal, a cardiogist who did his super specialisation from Army Hospital Research and Referral, New Delhi, said heart treatments would be available at minimal rates. He informed that another experienced cardiologist, Dr Saurav Sharma, had also joined the department.Angiography at the hospital will cost between Rs5,000 and Rs7,000 while the same medical procedure costs around Rs15,000-Rs20,000 in the private sector. Similarly, angioplasty, an invasive endovascular procedure used to widen narrowed or obstructed arteries, will cost Rs75,000 at Rajindra Hospital, which is too less than Rs1.25 lakh to Rs2 lakh charged by private hospitals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/catheterisation-laboratory-starts-at-government-rajindra-hospital-in-patiala-337829
