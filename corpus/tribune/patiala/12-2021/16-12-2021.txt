Notably, the Gynaecology Department is the one that on nursing staff depends more than others.In the wake of the strike, the authorities have already conveyed to nearby government hospitals not to refer patients to Rajindra Hospital.Confirming the development, Dr HS Rekhi, Medical Superintendent, Rajindra Hospital, said, “The entire nursing staff has gone on a strike following which we had to close the gynaecology Emergency. In the absence of nursing staff, it is unlikely that we will be able to run the gynaecological Emergency.”The situation is said to have turned more grim after nursing students and contractual staff joined the striking nurses in the afternoon.To mark their protest, the protesting employees also blocked the Chandigarh-Bathinda national highway outside the hospital for half an hour. The nurses have been demanding that their pay scale should be increased from current Rs3,200 to Rs4,600. Besides, they (the protesting staff) are asking that their designation should be changed from nursing staff to nursing officer. They have also been demanding that they should be included in Grade B instead of Grade C as per the Sixth Pay Commission of Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/rajindra-hospital-shuts-gynaecology-emergency-350950

Patients have to take the help of at least two or three persons to visit the doctor on the first floor of the OPD block.Dr Sandeep Kaur, Medical Superintendent, admitted that the building lacked a ramp for the differently-abled. She said, “Ever since I joined the post, there has been no ramp. I am not aware of why the building lacks ramps for the differently-abled.”Vijay Walia, a visually-impaired person, said, “It is inhumane on the part of the authorities concerned that differently-abled patients are not facilitated to visit a doctor at the government hospital. Action should be taken against the officials concerned for not protecting the right to equality as per the Disabilities Act.”Varinder Tiwana, District Social Security Officer, said, “Every government building needs to have ramps for a barrier-free access to differently-abled people. I will look into the matter.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/patiala-mata-kaushalya-hospital-not-differently-abled-friendly-350949

Now, the population of the Urban Estate area is nearly 1.5 lakh. So, we want the government to establish a primary health centre here.”Isha Singhal, Additional Chief Administrator, PDA, Patiala, said her office was aware of the residents’ demand for dispensaries in the area. “We are already working on the matter and it is expected to be implemented soon. A dispensary will most likely come up in Urban Estate-2 or Urban Estate-3, if the matter gets through.” She added that residents had not approached her for any other matter. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/building-violations-urban-estate-residents-for-one-time-settlement-350941

If there is any written complaint, we will look into it.” It has been learnt the practice is being done with international travellers, who have already booked flight tickets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/private-lab-violates-norms-350866
