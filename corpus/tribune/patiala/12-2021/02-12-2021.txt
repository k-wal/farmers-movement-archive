He said, “We, including Rahul Gandhi, were not aware that he had colluded with Badals. Therefore, we are apologising to the people of Punjab for waking up so late.”Lambasting the Badals for looting Punjab by spearheading different mafias, Warring said he was not afraid of anyone when it came to taking on those who shackled the state’s bright future by gobbling up its resources through tax evasions.Training his guns at the Delhi Chief Minister, Warring said that Kejriwal had promised before 2017 to take on Majithia within 15 days of coming to power, but he shamelessly later on apologised for what he did and said about Majithia. He said, “There was no need to extend a shameless apology.”Assuring the people at the behest of Charanjit Singh Channi-led government’s proactive approach towards overall development, Warring said, “It is my duty as a minister to ensure the development of each and every part of Punjab.
