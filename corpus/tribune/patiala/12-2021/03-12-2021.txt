Prof S Anantha Ramakrishna, Director, CSIR-CSIO, (Central Scientific Instruments Organisation) was the chief guest during the inaugural ceremony on Thursday.He said in coming times artificial intelligence and machine learning would have multifarious and pervasive applications in different fields that would directly impact the common man. He emphasised on the need of building a machine learning model to train unmanned vehicles. “The artificial intelligence and machine learning can play a key role in the area for defence applications”, he said and mentioned various initiatives taken by the Central Government in the regard.He said the increase in availability of inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provided an opportunity for wildlife experts to use aerial sensor platforms to monitor wildlife and tackle challenges to accurately estimate species abundance. He added, “The use of UAVs, that can perform flight paths autonomously and acquire geo-referenced sensor data, has increased sharply for agricultural, environmental and wildlife monitoring applications.”Department head Raman Maini said, “Data science is heading towards a new technological paradigm shift where one can teach machines to learn from existing data and derive a variety of useful insights. Machine learning has become one of the most prominent areas of research in computer science, information technology and all other disciplines.”Punjabi University Vice-Chancellor Arvind said the artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies would better the healthcare facilities and help in combating such types of situations in future.Prof Vincenzo Piuri, University of Milan, Italy, and Prof Radu Prodan, Institute for Information Technology, University of Klagenfurt, Austria, who joined the conference through online mode, were also part of the event.More than 300 research scholars and teachers are participating in the conference.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/conference-on-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-begins-at-punjabi-university-345784

Also, a US-based not-for-profit organisation, PATH has donated the genome sequencer and supportive equipment as part of its on-going Covid-19 response support to the state.”The director said that the lab was also a member of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 consortium on genomics (INSACOG), a group of now 28 national laboratories that was established by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, for carrying out genomic sequencing and analysis of circulating Covid-19 viruses and correlating epidemiological trends with genomic variants.Dr Rupinder Bakshi said the WGS facilities at the laboratory would aid the state in gearing up and recognising Covid-19 strains circulating among its population, including the B11529 strain renamed as Omicron, in order to devise appropriate and necessary containment measures and strategies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/covid-19-patiala-hospital-gets-first-genome-sequencing-lab-345783

The Delhi government has given jobs to only 414 persons during its tenure in office. Kejriwal should tell why he is anti-employee in Delhi and pro-employee in Punjab. Now liquor smugglers are working closely with Rajpura police and managing supply from police stations. This is a serious issue”, he said.Majithia highlighted the poor track record of the Delhi government which even earned a rap from the Supreme Court which noted that its mohalla clinics and hospitals utterly failed to provide succor to the people during the Covid pandemic.On the issue of Navjot Sidhu, Majithia asked Pradesh Congress Committee president Navjot Sidhu to tell why he had failed to take up his challenge and appear in the court in the drug case. “I had challenged him but he preferred to run away. I again challenge him to announce Charanjit Singh Channi as the party’s chief ministerial candidate if the former is doing such a good job,” Majithia said.The SAD leader said Chief Minister Charanjit Channi was trying to escape responsibility for the abject failures of the Congress government by blaming former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh for the same. “The fact is that Channi was part of the team which swore on the Gutka Sahib along with Capt Amarinder. Channi has been a cabinet minister all along,” he said.Majithia said the Chief Minister had been changed but the Congress party was the same. “It is the party which has betrayed each and every section of society by reneging on its promises, including conducting a complete farm loan waiver, providing one job in all 65 lakh households in Punjab, starting unemployment allowance of Rs 2,500 per month, providing power at the rate of Rs 5 per unit and increasing all social welfare benefits,” he said.Majithia also participated in the Akhand Path held here in memory of more than 700 farmers who sacrificed their lives to save farming and farmers. Senior leader Surjit Singh Rakhra was also present on the occasion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/implement-promises-in-delhi-first-majithia-dares-kejriwal-345762
