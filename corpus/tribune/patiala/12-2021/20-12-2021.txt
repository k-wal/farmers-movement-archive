Of the total six members, only three were present in the meeting. As per the Punjab Government rules, the corporation requires presence of a minimum two-thirds of the total members to hold a meeting.MC officials, requesting anonymity, said it would be the first time that Section 58.3 of the Municipal Corporation Act would be invoked, as it allowed holding a meeting without the presence of the necessary number of members. “Some officials are not even clear about the law and provisions. The matter will be taken up at the time of the meeting tomorrow,” an official said.Bittu said the meeting would be held as various public works were pending for long. “We will discuss floating tenders for works worth over Rs17 crore,” he said, adding that the meeting being held after a previous meeting was adjourned due to lack of quorum, did not require the presence of a minimum number of members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/mc-finance-panel-meeting-today-352441
20-12-2021||Karam Prakash||Government Medical College, Patiala, not friendly to differently abled||Tribune News ServicePatiala, December 19Despite the provision of Central Government for grant-in-aid to state to provide a barrier-free environment to the differently abled, and spending over Rs100 crore on infrastructure over the past few years, Government Medical College here lacks ramps for the students using a wheelchair.Ironically, despite being mindful of a quota for differently abled in the seats for the MBBS course, the college authorities have over the years failed to build a ramp so as to make such students attend the class hazard-free.Will issue notice: OfficialAs per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, all public spaces, including government buildings, must have the infrastructure to make them accessible to the differently abled. We will issue a notice to the college. —Varinder Tiwana, District Social Security OfficerThe upper story of the old college building has classrooms and lecture theatres for medical students. However, there is no ramp for students on a wheelchair.A differently abled student at the college said, “It has been over a year that I am suffering the agony of going upstairs daily to attend the class, but the authorities concerned turned a blind eye to the situation.”“No doubt, it is a heritage building and any alteration may not be possible, but there is an urgent need for provision of lifts and ramps for differently abled students,” said Dr DS Bhullar, president, Punjab State Medical and Dental Teachers Association.“It is totally inhumane and an act of criminal negligence,” said a lab technician working in the medical college lab for years.Unfortunately, the newly constructed building, worth Rs35 crore, also lacks a ramp for differently abled.District Social Security Officer Varinder Tiwana said, “As per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, all public spaces, including government buildings, must have the infrastructure to make them accessible to the differently abled. We will issue a notice to the college.”Meanwhile, Dr Harjinder Singh, Director-Principal, Government Medical College, said, “We will send a proposal to build ramps for differently abled students at the earliest.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/government-medical-college-not-friendly-to-differently-abled-352442

The government said, “It is intimated that the government, after reconsideration, has to withdraw the benefit of weightage of up to five additional marks for experience, given to teachers working in the government colleges of Punjab, by withdrawing clause 4 (3) of the advertisement. This decision has been taken in view of certain writ petitions in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, challenging this provision of weightage. Hence, the entire selection would be based upon merit of the written test only.”Earlier, the state government had decided to give weightage of one mark (up to five marks) per completed academic year of teaching experience to part time, guest faculty and contract teachers of government colleges.No additional marks for govt teachers||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-govt-merit-sole-criterion-for-selection-of-assistant-professors-352192
20-12-2021||Ravneet Singh||Patiala Urban: Major projects far from complete||DESPITE being the home turf of former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, this seat has suffered on account of the sitting legislator’s absence for over four-and-a-half years. Though the city received two new state universities during the Congress regime, major projects launched over the last five years have remained incomplete.These include the Rs 503-crore canal-based clean drinking water project, Heritage Street, shifting of dairies outside the city and construction of the new bus stand. Residents complain of regular blockage of the sewerage system and flooding of the internal city roads during rains. Kundan Gogia, an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader, said: “Every rainy season, water enters houses and cars get damaged. It also affects businesses.”Traffic snarl-ups are commonplace in the city owing to regular protests by unions. The clearance of the garbage dump at Sanauri Adda also remains pending. The only silver lining remains the rejuvenation of the iconic Rajindra tank lake after a gap of 15 years. With Capt Amarinder forming the Punjab Lok Congress (PLC), the constituency is likely to witness a keen contest among the Congress, AAP, PLC and Shiromani Akali Dal candidates.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/patiala-urban-major-projects-far-from-complete-352209
