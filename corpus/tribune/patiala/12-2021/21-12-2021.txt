Meanwhile, the MC authorities have said the work of projects would proceed only after taking legal guidance of the Local Government Department.The F&CC met after previous meeting called on December 16 could not be held due to lack of quorum.

The guidance in this matter will be solicited from the department.”Officials said the Corporation otherwise allocated works of construction and renovation of dharamshalas, old age homes, streets, playgrounds and laying of interlocking tiles in various wards of the city.The MC also cleared further proceedings of a number of matters related to installation of street light poles and affixation of AC in the Corporation office.

Both have been demanding promotion and regularistion of their jobs. University security guards have been protesting for over four days now.The security staff said they blocked university’s main entry gate over their demand for promotion. The university had failed to bring the security staff under its ambit despite its 2012 resolution to do so after completion of their service on daily wages for five years, they added.“In 2012 the authorities had decided that outsourced workers, who completed five years of their service would be brought under the university’s ambit, but they failed to do so. We have been protesting for past many days. Now, we will go on a hunger strike from tomorrow,” the security staff said.Jatinder Kala, leader of cleanliness workers on the university campus, said workers had been demanding regularisation of their jobs for a long time. “The university should follow the state government’s provisions for regularising workers. The university authorities said they will issue letters for regularisation soon, but we want them to do it before the implementation of the code of conduct. So, workers today dumped garbage on the campus in protest,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/cleanliness-workers-dump-garbage-security-staff-block-pbi-university-gate-352899

The percentage of children suffering from anaemia has been increasing over the past few years, because in 2015, the percentage was only 49 in the district.As per the World Health Organisation, anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the haemoglobin concentration is lower than the normal. Haemoglobin is needed to carry oxygen to the entire body to generate energy. And if there is not enough haemoglobin, blood will have decreased capacity to carry oxygen to body’s tissues.The condition causes symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness and shortness of breath, among others.Dr Harshinder Kaur, paediatrician, Government Rajindra Hospital, said, “Among all other deficiencies, anaemia is the one that affects the growth of children to a large extent.”Notably, the government had conducted the said survey in two phases: pre-lockdown (January 5, 2020 to March 21, 2020) and post-lockdown (December 6 to March 31 2021). In Patiala, information was gathered from 841 households, 981 women, and 142 men.Dr Veenu Goyal, nodal officer, said, “Covid could be one of the reasons for anaemia because Anganwadi centres had remained closed during its peaks. Though dry ration and iron syrups were provided to households, Covid did affect the health programme.”Meanwhile, Dr Amandeep Kaur, a resident of Nabha, said, “Merely giving free health insurance schemes wouldn’t help. There is a lack of political will to address the issue. Data in the 2015-16 report was a wakeup call, but people at the helm did nothing and the situation worsened. Now, public will have to be a pressure group to make the health issue a part of agenda.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/76-7-kids-anaemic-in-dist-reveals-survey-352900
