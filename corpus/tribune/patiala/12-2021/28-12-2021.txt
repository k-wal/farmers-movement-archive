Ravinder Singh and Jagmeet Singh became friends due to exchange of views and both became active in this illegal activity, he said.Accused Jasveer Kaur’s family background is also allegedly linked to terrorism.

The case is under investigation and in the near future there are likely to be major revelations about who else is a partner in this crime and who is helping them from home and abroad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/woman-among-three-khalistani-sympathisers-arrested-in-patiala-355505
