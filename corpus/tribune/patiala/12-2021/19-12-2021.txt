JRs stopped attending emergency services while they had already withdrawn from OPD services last week over delay in the NEET PG counselling.Notably, the nursing staff is already on strike and around 86 senior doctors, including the medical superintendent of Rajindra Hospital, are on winter break. The remaining doctors of the hospital are likely to go on vacation from December 31. In the wake of the shortage of medical staff here, patients – especially the poor – have been running from pillar to post to get treatment.One of the patients, said, “I was referred to Rajindra Hospital from Rajpura Civil Hospital. Now, Rajindra Hospital is referring me to the PGIMER, Chandigarh. The government should step in and provide relief to the poor people like us.”Chaotic scenes were witnessed at the hospital as patients were seen roaming helplessly for treatment.Following the paucity of staff, patients at the hospital are being, reportedly, asked to shift to other hospitals, because as of now, only senior residents and a few consultants are managing the hospital.Meanwhile, Dr Harjinder Singh, the Director Principal, Government Medical College, and Rajindra Hospital, himself has decided to work during both winter vacations keeping the shortage of staff.Dr Harjinder said they would cancel vacation if there was an emergency situation. He said, “The staff was not granted summer and winter vacation for over a year now in view of the Covid pandemic. However, if the need arises, we can call them back.”The situation was quite grim, Dr Harjinder added. He was already talking with senior officials about the prevailing situation at the hospital, said Dr Harjinder.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/shortage-of-staff-spells-chaos-at-govt-hospital-351985
