The matter will now be heard on December 20.The present situation has evolved as the decision on Mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu’s court case over his ‘suspension’ as the first citizen, as per proceedings of the MC General House, is pending. The Department of Local Government is yet to take a call on the House’s decision of November 25.Lately, Bittu and Senior Deputy Mayor Yoginder Singh Yogi both have claimed to be the Mayor and acting Mayor, respectively.Harvinder Singh Nippi, one of the councillors and petitioner in the present case, said they went to court as all works of the corporation remained pending after the MC General House ‘suspended’ the Mayor. He said the councillors in their petition prayed to the court to direct the state government through the Principal Secretary, Department of Local Government, and also the Director, Local Bodies, Punjab, to take action on the MC General House’s resolution.“We have also demanded that the court direct all three respondents, including the MC, to take appropriate steps so that the civic body can function as per law. The MC should ensure that its business transactions do not get hindered,” he said.Nippi added, “A majority of the councillors are still against Bittu, as 35 of us are complainants in the present case.”MC officials said they were preparing a response to be furnished in the court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/councillors-move-hc-over-mcs-functioning-349030

They threatened that they would take the addicts along with them and block the national and state highways in the coming days if their demand was not met.Karamveer Singh, senior vice-president of the union, said, “We have worked during Covid scare while wearing PPE kits, but the government only gave us assurances. We will intensify our protest in the coming days.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/treatment-of-addicts-hit-as-rehab-centre-staff-on-strike-349034
