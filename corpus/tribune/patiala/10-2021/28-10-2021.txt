Therefore, each area is covered once a week. Our officers are conducting fogging in the hotspots on a daily basis.”Dr Sumeet Singh, district epidemiologist, said a majority of the fresh cases were reported from the hotspots only. “Since, the hotspots are continuously reporting positive cases, fogging is required.
