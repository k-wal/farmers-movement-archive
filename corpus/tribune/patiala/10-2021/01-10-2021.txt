The directions were issued by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi to the Patiala Deputy Commissioner in a late-night development on Thursday after a meeting with dairy farmers of the city in Chandigarh.The dairy farmers, as per orders of the Municipal Corporation, Patiala, were supposed to shift to the new site by September 30. The Corporation was also devising a plan to ensure compliance of its orders after over a month-long spree of issuing challans to them for various violations, including dumping waste into the city’s sewerage lines and others.In a video, the Chief Minister can be heard directing an official on the phone that the dairy farmers be shifted to the new site only after the access road and internal roads are proper along with facilities, including water supply and others.On the request of the dairy farmers, he said, “The Patiala mayor says the dairies will be evicted forcibly, but that should not be allowed. The needs of the dairy farmers should be taken into account,” he said.When contacted, Deputy Commissioner Kumar Amit said he had received the verbal order from the Chief Minister in a late-night phone call. “We have been directed to provide all basic facilities to the dairy farmers at the site before shifting them. As such, all facilities will be provided to the dairy farmers as per the Municipal Corporation act.”The Deputy Commissioner also held a meeting with the dairy farmers on Friday morning. He said, “A meeting with officials concerned with the project will be held soon and lapses, if any, will be dealt with.”The project: Apart from being a necessary project of the city to ensure proper clearance of the city’s sewerage system that remains clogged during rains, the dairy shifting project is also twined with political turns of Patiala. It has been hanging fire since 2004 after it was first announced by then chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. It was cleared during the government of Shiromani Akali Dal in 2016, but was mooted after the local government department decided to make amendments to the plan after the Congress came to power in 2017.  The work at the site started only in 2020. While the roads and sewerage connections have been provided, other facilities as per devised plan of the Corporation are yet to be completed. Local SAD leaders recently raised questions on alleged lapses on part of the Corporation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/provide-necessary-facilities-to-dairy-farmers-before-shifting-them-cm-channi-tells-patiala-admn-318736

According to research they are not driven towards any physical activity, which could affect their overall life and reproductive activity.A four-member team, including Dr Ritu Lehal, Dr Naina Sharma, Dr Shivani Thakkar and Dr Parveen Balgir, carried out study under a project granted by Impress ICSSR to the Women’s Studies Centre of the university. The study has been published in The International Journal of Indian Psychology.The researchers collected data of 320 college and school students with a mean age of 20 years from rural parts of the district through a self-administered and close ended questionnaire.They found that over half of the respondents were obese, overweight or underweight. Similarly, 55 per cent of the total respondents led a physically inactive life. Overall, 75 per cent girls reported lack of awareness on reproductive health, a percentage which was much higher among school-going girls, who responded to specific questions. Importantly, as for reproductive tract infections (RTIs), 53 per cent girls reported vaginal discharge while 27 per cent experienced a burning sensation while urinating.The professors said, “Prevalence of such symptoms is high among girls.”Dr Naina said, “We found that despite programmes initiated by the government, there are still taboos regarding menstruation. India has a plethora of policies that are designed to influence reproductive health, but unfortunately gaps exist.”“There is a need to set goals and identify strategies to reach out to everyone. Education related to reproductive health improves general behaviour. Education is necessary for young rural girls as it will reduce RTIs and improve their long-term health,” she added.Dr Ritu Lehal, director, Women Studies Centre, said, “Education of youths, parents and teachers is vital to allow accurate information dissemination related to reproductive health. ASHA, health and Anganwari workers can be used to improve the knowledge on STI/RTI through door-to-door visits.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/50-physically-inactive-girls-in-rural-areas-of-patiala-district-dont-have-normal-bmi-study-318635
