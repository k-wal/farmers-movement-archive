Despite recent orders by the District Magistrate, house owners are not coming forward to get their tenants registered thus putting the lives of innocent citizens at risk.The recent arrest of many gangsters from various parts of the state have highlighted how these gangsters lived as students after taking a room or house on rent.While the district administration has launched verification drive for migrants, time and again, they have failed to check the mushrooming of unidentified tenants in the residential areas as landlords are not too eager to get the verification of the tenants done. While the recent orders to check the movement of unidentified migrant workers have been passed, the police are yet to check the persons staying at rented houses and as paying guests, despite recent terror attacks in the state.In a recent order, the Patiala Deputy Commissioner-cum-District Magistrate had passed written orders for verification of tenants, staying in the city from outside Punjab and from other districts, in the nearest police station within 15 days. However, not much has been done and many residential areas in the state are now full of residents living as tenants.Senior police officials said that they would launch a special drive to check illegal paying guests. “It is a serious issue and we will not take any chances”, they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/police-yet-to-begin-tenant-verification-drive-in-patiala-332297
