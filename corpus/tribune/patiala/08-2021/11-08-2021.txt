Activists associated with student organisations SFI, AISF, PSU, DSO and AIRSA held the protest.Pictures of Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, PCC Chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, MP Preneet Kaur, Finance minister Manpreet Singh, Higher Education minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Congress party leader Harinder Pal Singh (Harry Mann) have been pasted on the flex boards.The students said the state government should provide a special grant to the University, while the University should roll back its decision of increment of fee for all courses.They demanded that the decision of implementation of GST on educational services should also be rolled back.A student activist, Vikram Singh Baghi, said: “We started a protest from the university library, went to the VC office after which the protest ended near the entry gates of the campus.”The students said the state government should provide grants to the University rather than the University increasing the fee for every course to fill its coffers.“The state government had announced a grant of Rs 90 crore to the University. The complete funds have not been provided yet”, they retorted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/punjabi-varsity-students-protest-over-grants-increased-fees-296175

The employees’ associations have written to the Chief Minister’s office for the release of grants.In a letter sent to the Chief Minister’s office, the Punjabi University Employees’ Association (B and C Class) today demanded that the state government release Rs200 grant to the university.They said Punjabi University was one of the important universities in the Malwa region. Most of 25,000 students studying at the university were from the rural background and the university’s income in respect of their fees was meagre.The students would be burdened if the fee for various courses was increased. “About 50 per cent students come under the post-matric scholarship scheme and do not pay the fee at the time of admission,” they said.The university was not able to meet its expenses from the fee collected from the students, due to which the salaries of the employees got delayed.Manoj Bhambri, one of the employees, said: “The state government should release a special grant for the university. Despite the issuance of previous grants of Rs50 crore twice, followed by a special grant Rs20 crore and others, the university’s financial status is not good.”He added: “The employees have been waiting for their salaries for two months now.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/2-months-on-punjabi-university-employees-await-salaries-296070

It is an approach towards turning the DISCOMs financially sick and later sell those to private distributors at throwaway prices.“This Bill will also put the future of over 25 lakh workers at present employed with DISCOMs in the dark. Instead of benefiting consumers, the Bill will benefit private distributors as they will choose to serve only such consumers from whom they can earn a maximum of profit. It should be scrapped without any further delay,” said the council leadership.The council has also expressed its serious concerns regarding the delay in implementation of various decisions taken during a meeting held with the PSPCL management. “We caution the power management to do the needful without any further delay to contain the discontentment among power junior engineers,” they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/junior-engineers-protest-electricity-amendment-bill-in-patiala-296067

11-08-2021||Patiala||Navjot Singh Sidhu, Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh misleading on power issue: Bir Devinder||Former Deputy Speaker and SAD (Sanyukat) senior vice-president Bir Devinder Singh has questioned PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu and Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on making “absurd and deceptive statements” regarding the cancellation of PPA (power purchase agreements).Bir Devinder said Capt Amarinder’s position in the case of PPAs had been suspicious from the very beginning of his second term as Chief Minister.Former Power Minister Rana Gurjit Singh made a statement in 2017 that the government would review, all excessively unjust PPAs, but nothing happened. Punjab CM Capt. Amarinder Singh made an announcement soon after the Governor’s address in January 2020 that his government would bring “white paper” on the cost of the power and PPAs. The so-called ‘white paper’ has not seen the light of the day to date. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/navjot-singh-sidhu-punjab-cm-capt-amarinder-singh-misleading-on-power-issue-bir-devinder-295935
