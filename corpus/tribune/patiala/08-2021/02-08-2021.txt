Our post is equivalent to the BDPO since its creation in 1975. However, except the 4th Pay Commission, the state government has not treated both posts on a par.”The officers had met Cabinet minister Aruna Chaudhary, who holds the portfolio of Social Security, Women & Child Development, to press for their demands.Bangar demanded that their pay matrix level should be raised to 17 which was equivalent to 5,400 pay grade.Pay scale issueThe protesters said it was a great injustice to them as the Sixth Pay Commission had downgraded their pay scale from 15 to 13.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/cdpos-protest-beneficiaries-at-receiving-end-in-patiala-291654
