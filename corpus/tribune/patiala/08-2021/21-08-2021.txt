Their kitchens are set up in cramped places and they often don’t have toilets in their households,” he said.Elaborating on their financial health, Dr Singh said: “The new agriculture technology, involving harvesters, combines and other equipment, has only stolen the livelihood of farm labourers and they are forced to seek loans for their sustenance.”Discussing the solutions to pull the farm labourers out of the existing mess, he said: “Co-operative farming along with providing land for farming to such families on individual basis can be a viable option.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/92-farm-labourers-in-punjab-from-dalit-families-says-expert-300076
