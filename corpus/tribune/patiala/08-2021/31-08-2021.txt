The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), along with the agriculture department, will start monitoring air quality from September 10.Experts say the cases may rise this year as farmers are angry over farm laws and the government not paying the Supreme Court-ordered financial incentive. “Despite best efforts, Punjab can manage only 50 per cent of the produced stubble, leaving no option but to burn it. Any action against farmers is challenged by unions,” said a top official attached with the anti-stubble burning drive.In 2013, the National Green Tribunal prohibited the burning of paddy straw, saying: “The guilty would be liable to pay environmental compensation ranging from Rs 2,500-15,000 per incident.” However, farmers continue to burn stubble in the absence of any strict action against them.PPCB member secretary Karunesh Garg said: “We are already sensitising farmers not to burn stubble and will start monitoring from September 10. We are trying to reduce the cases this season.”Punjab saw 76,590 incidents of fire in 2020 as compared to 52,991 in 2019 — an increase of 44.5 per cent.State got 76K machines to manage residueAgriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had recently told the Rajya Sabha that between 2018-19 and 2020-21, Punjab was given 76,626 machines under the Central Sector Scheme on Promotion of Agricultural Mechanisation for in situ management of crop residue||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/expect-farm-fires-in-punjab-by-mid-sept-say-experts-304258

The teachers claimed that the government was procrastinating over their long-pending demand of regularisation.The teachers said they recently held a meeting with Chief Minister’s OSD MP Singh, wherein, they were assured that the government would meet their demands, however, no action was taken by the government thereafter. Consequently, they had no option but to protest, the protesters said.Notably, the protesting teachers are the ones who have been working on contract basis under the Society for Promotion of Quality Education for Poor and Meritorious Students at 10 meritorious schools in the state.The meritorious schools, a pet project of the previous SAD government, were launched in 2013 to cater to the poor students, who are good in academics. The purpose of these schools was to impart quality education to meritorious students, who score 80 per cent and above in Class X.The teachers said the government had invited applications to regularise them, along with SSA/RMSA, in 2018. However, they had been waiting for regularisation since then, they said. The protesting teachers said they would intensify their struggle in the coming days if their demand of regularisation was not met.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/patiala/patiala-teachers-of-meritorious-schools-clash-with-police-for-regular-jobs-304400
