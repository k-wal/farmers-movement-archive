07-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab farmer bodies slam Centre for not resuming goods trains||Farmer bodies protesting against the farm laws on Saturday slammed the Centre for not resuming goods trains in Punjab even as they stuck to their stand of not allowing passenger trains.They also accused the Centre of adopting a “stubborn attitude” and alleged that it wanted to cause “harm“ to Punjab on the economic front for raising voice against the three legislations enacted recently. The railways on Saturday declined to resume goods trains in Punjab, saying it will either operate both freight and passenger trains or none.The train services in Punjab are suspended since September 24, when farmers started their “rail roko” agitation against the central laws. Goods trains had resumed in the state briefly after farmer unions on October 21 announced exempting them from their “rail roko” stir but the railways suspended them again, saying farmers are still blocking the tracks.“We strongly condemn the stubborn attitude of the railways and the Centre for not resuming goods trains in the state,” said Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal.However, the 30 farmers’ bodies protesting the farm laws maintained that they will not allow passenger trains. “The farmers’ bodies have already announced they will allow only goods trains and not passenger trains,” said BKU (Dakunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill. “The central government wants to harm Punjab on the economic front by making baseless excuses,” he further said.The Punjab government on Friday had said, “The rail network all across the state of Punjab is presently totally clear for uninterrupted movement of goods trains.”The suspension of goods trains has led to a power crisis as coal supplies to thermal plants have been hit. It has also adversely affected the supply of fertilisers for rabi crops, movement of foodgrain stocks besides impacting the state industry which is unable to get raw material and send finished goods outside.  — PTI
07-11-2020||London||British Sikh group loses High Court challenge for census ethnicity tick-box||The High Court in London has dismissed a challenge brought by a British Sikh group against the UK Cabinet Office for its failure to incorporate a separate Sikh ethnicity tick-box in the next census in 2021.Justice Akhlaq Choudhury handed down his judgment on Friday to conclude that the census, as currently designed, will not prevent people from identifying as ethnically as Sikh as a write-in option.“In coming to that view, I do not underestimate the importance to the Claimant of having a specific Sikh tick-box under the ethnic group question.However, the census, as currently designed, will not prevent any respondent who wishes to do so from identifying as ethnically Sikh. The write-in option, with the auto-fill function in the online version, will enable the respondent to do so,” the ruling notes.“It cannot be right that any challenge to executive decision-making should require the decision maker to cease ongoing work, particularly in respect of a project of the scale of a national census,” it reads.Sikh Federation UK, represented by the law firm Leigh Day at the Royal Courts of Justice, had earlier claimed that it would be “unlawful” for the Cabinet Office to lay before Parliament a Census Order based on the proposals set out by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) in its December 2018 White Paper, which had rejected the need for a separate tick-box.Justice Beverley Lang had earlier dismissed a previous High Court challenge to that on the ground that it is "premature", leading to an appeal against the Cabinet Office's Census Order as being “unlawful”.The judge points out that his ruling this week is not concerned with whether or not there should be a Sikh tick-box in the census form or with the respective merits of the arguments for and against such a tick-box.“Such matters are not for the court to determine. This judgment is concerned solely with the question whether, as alleged by the Claimant [Sikh Federation], the Cabinet Office, which has responsibility for laying the necessary legislation for the 2021 Census, has acted unlawfully in the process leading to the making of the Census Order,” the judge said.Sikh Federation UK said that although the High Court has rejected its claim, refusing to quash the census legislation, its battle for a separate tick-box continues.“While we are disappointed with the court's decision, we look forward to working closely with MPs and government bodies to find another solution to ensure the specific needs of the Sikh community are not overlooked in the allocation of public resources and policymaking,” it said in a statement.Sikhs are recognised as a separate religion in the optional religious question introduced in the 2001 Census.The UK's Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 placed an obligatory duty on the country's public authorities to monitor and positively promote race equality in the provision of public services.According to Sikh Federation UK, which claims the backing of hundreds of UK gurdwaras, public bodies tend to only reference the ethnic groups used in the census and demand a separate Sikh ethnic tick-box to ensure Sikhs have fair access to all public services.The issue has triggered a war of words between different British Sikh groups, with the Network of Sikh Organisations saying that: “Sikhs are adequately recorded in the census under religion, and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) made the right decision in rejecting the Sikh Federation UK's calls for a Sikh 'ethnic' tick box.”Meanwhile, the ONS, which conducted a consultation ahead of the next UK census, stresses that as the religion question will have a specific Sikh tick box response option, everyone who wishes to identify as Sikh in response to the ethnicity question will be able to do so through a write-in option in the next 10-year census.“No group will be missed out in the digital-first 2021 Census,” the ONS said.

07-11-2020||New Delhi||Our doors are always open for discussion with farmers: Central ministers||Top central ministers have said they are always open for any talks with Punjab farmers on the three “pro-farmers and pro-agriculture” laws enacted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Centre. “The government’s doors are always open to farmers for any discussion on the three Central Acts,” Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal said in an informal interaction.The proviso appears to be that the discussion should be about farmers and not guided by politics. The three Acts that have resulted in a prolonged stand-off between Punjab farmers and the state government led by Congress’ Amarinder Singh and the BJP-led NDA at the Centre.On October 15, farmers’ organisations had walked out of a meeting with Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal claiming they were called for an interaction where not even one minister was present.  Agriculture Ministry officials however said the meeting was scheduled to be held at the “level of the Secretary about which farmers were well aware”.  “Various issues related to farmers welfare were discussed for about two hours. At the end of this meeting two memorandums on behalf of the farmers’ unions were given to the Secretary. The Government of India is always committed to protect the interest of farmers and is always open for discussions,” they said. Apparently, the Centre does not appear to be much worried by farmers organisations's efforts to expand the ambit of protests to other states with a ‘Dilli chalo’ call later this month. Citing the “outcome” of the all-India ‘chakka jam’ (road blockade) on November 5,  ministry officials say the agitation is limited to Punjab because of “political reasons and that farmers across the country are well aware of the positive changes the three laws are bringing in their lives and the agriculture sector”.

07-11-2020||Bathinda||Gangster found in possession of mobile phone in Bathinda jail||Officials at the Bathinda Central Jail found a notorious gangster in possession of a mobile photo inside the jail---a development that once again brings to question authorities’ alertness within the jail premises. The gangster in question, Harvind Singh, was arrested in December 2017 with two of his associates from Bathinda’s Gulabgarh village.Jail officials claimed that they found Singh in possession of a Samsung phone within the barracks of the jail.He has been booked under Jail Manual Act, police officials said.This is not the first time Harvinder Singh has made headlines from within the jail---last year, he and two other gangsters lodged in the prison had been accused of cutting off security camera feeds within the jail premises.Saturday’s development is particularly significant given that the prison’s authorities have reported found and confiscated over 100 mobile phones from within the jail premises over the last two years.A notable instance was last year, when four gangsters had used a mobile phone to make a ransom call a Rajasthan-based businessman from within the jail. On being alerted by the Rajathan Police, a team from Bathinda Police conducted raids and found a phone, battery and a SIM card with the four suspects.Sources in the jail claim that policemen are aware of the presence of mobile phones inside the jail, and even secretly tap into calls to get “information”. Such spying is now getting harder, sources said, because inmates have begun to use Whatsapp for voice calls.

Our party has done nothing wrong, but our political opponents are spreading misinformation,” said Kalia.Since farmers have already been protesting in front the residence of Barnala district BJP president Yadwinder Shanty for last many days, when Kalia along with other leaders reached at Shanty’s residence, protesters informed other farmers. Hundreds of more farmers gathered in front of the residence and started raising slogans against BJP government.“Kalia has come here to challenge us and we have accepted his challenge. Had his government been serious for farmers, the PM and other senior Ministers would have conducted meetings with us. But central BJP leadership is sending junior leaders to talk to us, which is unacceptable,” said Rup Singh, a BKU Ugrahan leader.Another protesting farmer, Kulwant Singh said they have come prepared to fight for years and the Central government should not think that their agitation would end in days.Shanty said, “Manojranjan Kalia is our Punjab BJP core committee member also and he had come here to meet farmers to share exact information with them about farm laws. Initially, farmers gheraoed him, but later they allowed us to share information we have with them. Farmers allowed Kalia and other leaders to leave after our leaders assured them that our party would protect farmers.”

He was taken under full police protection after the government had taken into consideration all aspects,” he said.“You have asked about Babaji (Ram Rahim), but hundreds of prisoners are being given parole daily. There is a law regarding this. We cannot change it,” the minister added.He said that had Ram Rahim sought parole for a larger period, the government would have taken several factors into consideration, since court cases were still pending against him, but this was for just one day for which the jail superintendent had the powers to allow parole.Asked was it in his knowledge, Ranjit Singh replied in affirmative and added that he knew from the Day 1.When a reporter asked whether Ram Rahim would also be allowed to visit his Sirsa dera and residence on parole in future, Ranjit Singh said that the government would consider the request when it comes. The Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana on October 24 had granted a day's parole to controversial Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for raping two of his disciples and has been denied bail several times by the courts. Sources said that Ram Rahim was granted parole on his wife Harjit Kaur's plea that his mother Naseeb Kaur, 85, suffering from a heart disease was seriously ill. The Dera chief met his mother, who is hospitalised in Gurugram.

He apprised me that the maryada and religious affairs will be looked after by PSGPC as it is being done in all gurdwaras and only administrative and development work would be looked after by Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETBP), a govt body with Muslim members,” said Kanwar Pal Singh .Harpal Singh Cheema and Narien Singh, heads of both the organizations called upon Sikh Sangat to participate in the anniversary event. “Indian government’s argument of Covid crisis is nothing but lame excuse. The entire country is buzzing with social, religious and political activities”, they said.Kartarpur Sahib corridor is a 4.7- km long passage, which was inaugurated by Prime Ministers of both the countries last year on November 9. Pertinently, Dal Khalsa dedicated the Nanakshahi calendar of the current year to the corridor.

The companies which had hired them are not calling them back to work leaving them in choppy waters as they have been in India for nearly eight months.Having spent Rs 18 to 25 lakh on their studying fee for over three years and now paying an average of Rs 30,000 monthly rentals from here for the safety of their belongings back in New Zealand, the youth said it had become really taxing for them. The youth, who had gathered at Desh Bhagat Yadgar Hall to lodge a protest holding placards, want the Indian External Affairs Ministry to take up their issue with their counterparts abroad.The agitating youngsters included those from Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Patiala, Nawanshahr and Batala. Sandeep Kaur, a resident of Ludhiana, said it had been six years since she moved to Gisborne in New Zealand. “I did a course in business management in New Zealand after which I got a job at a restaurant. I had returned home for 20-25 days in March as the restaurants had got closed due to the lockdown but could not return. I have been contacting the NZ embassy for the past eight months for a return but to no avail,” she lamented.Sukhchain, who hails from Amritsar, said that he was working as a store assistant in NZ but his company hasn’t rang him up for work an he’s now stranded here in trouble.

07-11-2020||---||HC upholds Punjab DGP Dinkar’s appointment||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 6The Punjab and Haryana High Court today overturned the Central Administrative Tribunal’s judgment to uphold the appointment of 1987-batch IPS officer Dinkar Gupta as Punjab Director-General of Police.The Bench also upheld UPSC’s Draft Guidelines-2009 followed 28 times across India while appointing DGPs. All DGPs would have to been ousted as fallout of the CAT judgment, in case of a contrary view by the Bench — at least this is what was argued. Setting aside Gupta’s appointment as the DGP, the tribunal had about 10 months ago held the guidelines to be invalid.But the HC Bench of Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Sant Parkash ruled that the guidelines — on procedure and modalities for selecting panel for DGP’s appointment — were not opposed to, and in violation of, the SC direction in Prakash Singh’s case on police reforms. “The tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction regarding judicial review of the selection process by transgressing in the expert domain superimposing its own opinion and is against the settled law on the subject,” the Bench ruled.The Bench passed the orders on appeals by Gupta and the state through Advocate-General Atul Nanda, Additional Advocate-General Rameeza Hakeem and senior advocate Maninder Singh. The UPSC was represented by Additional Solicitor-General Aman Lekhi and Alka Chatrath.It further ruled the guidelines could not be held to be lacking authenticity or legality and the findings so recorded by the CAT were erroneous.

The Railway Board has made it clear that goods trains will be resumed only if passenger trains too are allowed a safe passage through Punjab.Won’t end protestWill not end protest but will move from tracks to the area adjacent to railway lines. -  JS Ugrahan, BKU leaderWith representatives of the state government today clinching a deal with the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) and Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, it was believed that the blockade would be lifted and train services resumed forthwith. However, during talks with Punjab Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan, Railway Board Chairman VK Yadav made it amply clear that the tracks must be cleared for both passenger and goods trains.“Trains cannot be run selectively. The Railways is looking to resume freight and passenger operations,” he said at a press conference, pointing out that there were 22 spots in Punjab where the tracks had been blocked or where dharnas were within the circulating area of railway stations. The Chief Secretary said they were trying to resolve the issue at the earliest.A meeting was also held between DGP (Law and Order) Ishwar Singh and senior officers of the Government Railway Police, Ambala and Ferozepur Divisions.

According to sources, with goods trains off track in the state due to farmers’ protest, the steel producers are facing shortage of scrap resulting in high prices.An industrialistExporters worst hitThe farmers’ protest led to disruption in rail traffic. Besides impacting the arrival of steel in the state from primary steel producers, it also hit consignments of scrap meant for steel producers. This has led to increase in pricesOn an average, monthly consumption of steel in Punjab is around 6 lakh tonnes. Out of this, three lakh tonne is imported from primary steel producers. Another two lakh tonne is produced from scrap by steel companies in the state. As much as 70% of the scrap is imported and the rest is sourced from other states. Further, one lakh tonne of scrap is procured from within the state and is converted into steel.“The farmers protest led to disruption in rail traffic. Besides impacting the arrival of steel in the state from primary steel producers, it also disrupted consignments of scrap meant for state-based steel producers. This has led to increase in prices,” said sources.“In the past one month, prices have increased by Rs 3,000-4,000 per tonne which is not sustainable. We are already facing labour shortage and high transportation cost as we are compelled to send consignments by road. The increase in steel prices has come as a dampener in the way of exports,” said Amit Goswami, a Jalandhar-based exporter.Exporters who have committed orders in hand are the worst hit as they are unable to execute the orders due to high steel prices. The increase in prices has hit steel-consuming industries such as bicycle, fastener, auto parts, sewing machines, machine tools and hand tools. The construction sector is also facing the heat as the cost of steel has increased manifolds.Badish Jindal, another industrialist, said primary steel producers located in other parts of the country have also increased the prices.

While Harjot Kaur, Kumar and Pabla are posted in other districts presently, Chauhan is still working as the Ropar DFO.Bhandari also wrote to the Ropar SSP seeking action against five workers of a contractor who were found present on the illegal nakas by the team. The mafia had set up nakas in August last year at various places in the district to collect protection money from tippers loaded with sand and gravel. After the issue was highlighted in the media, the Ropar Deputy Commissioner formed a five-member committee to look into it.Meanwhile, one Bachittar Singh moved the High Court seeking removal of the ‘goonda’ tax mafia from the district. Ropar Chief Judicial Magistrate had submitted a report to the court in March, confirming illegal nakas were operational in the district.Following this, the court directed the CBI to investigate the matter. In its preliminary report submitted before the court on September 8, the CBI stated that the nakas had been set up in the past and recommended further probe.Bhandari, in his letter to the Chief Secretary, has stated that the committee in its report had submitted that “the checking was being done by workers of contractors but no ‘goonda’ tax was being collected.” Accordingly, the Mining Department XEN had filed an affidavit in the court. “The findings of the CJM and CBI didn’t match with the report of the committee, hence the disciplinary proceedings against these officers,” he said.

The MPs are also likely to point out that there was a strong possibility that farmers’ agitation was linked with terrorist outfits. — TNS
07-11-2020||---||Need roadmap to tide over farm crisis, Navjot Sidhu tells govt||Amritsar, November 6Former minister and MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu today appealed to the state government to prepare a roadmap to address the agrarian crisis that had arisen due to the newly enacted farm laws.To make farmers ‘self reliant’, Sidhu said a ‘small farmers’ model’ should be constituted. He said the state never offered a procurement model for any other crop, apart from wheat and rice, and lacked storage capacity or marketing ability.“The state should come forward for the farmers’ cause. A cooperative model should be there, in which the farmers will decide the crop pattern and sell the produce on their terms. I believe that in one to three years, the farming community will be able to stand on its feet,” he said.“The state should make one cold storage after every five villages,” demanded Sidhu. He suggested that stubble could be utilised to make renewal energy and bio CNG. “Stubble burning pollutes the air. The state should come out with alternatives and incentives, so that farmers refrain from burning it. Initiatives should be started to make constructive use of stubble that can generate income for the farmers,” he said.He said the Centre’s tailor-made policies favoured corporate houses, which could never benefit the farmers.“In the absence of storage facility, the farmers sell their crop at a throwaway price, fearing that it may get destroyed due to inclement weather conditions,” he said. Batting for diversification of crops, he said it would motivate farmers to grow vegetables, fruit, oilseeds and pulses.

There are thousands of armed forces personnel from Punjab posted all over the country who had planned to travel home during the festive season. Even those posted in Punjab or up north in Jammu and Kashmir are facing similar difficulties.According to state government sources, around 1.5 lakh personnel in the armed forces belong to Punjab. “Even if 20 per cent of them have availed leave, the number of affected persons is quite high,” a senior Punjab Government official said. “Over the past few days, we have received a large number of queries from the military fraternity, seeking information of the situation and the possibility of travelling to the state, but there is little we can do to help them,” he added.Even those who want to travel from Jammu and Kashmir to other parts of the country are stuck as the only rail link from the newly created union territory lies through the narrow corridor along the Jammu-Pathankot axis in the north-western corner of Punjab.Earlier during the year, soldiers could not travel on leave due to the lockdown imposed in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and some other restrictions imposed on grant of leave.Earlier this week, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had written an open letter to BJP national president JP Nadda stating that the festering imbroglio could have dangerous consequences not just for Punjab but the entire nation, including the armed forces in Ladakh and Kashmir. He had also warned that the armed forces were likely to be badly affected with the onset of winter, as they could run out of supplies and other requisites once snow blocks the roads to Ladakh and Kashmir. Large quantities of supplies and equipment are moved to and from the western sector, areas in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan, via trains. Even formations and units based in Punjab have been affected due to the suspension of rail traffic.

He wants this issue to linger on so that attention is diverted from the failures of his government. However, the Chief Minister is playing a dangerous game which can well push the state into an era of social unrest and economic instability,” he said.Sukhbir further said the Chief Minister would be personally responsible if farmers did not get power to sow the wheat crop. “Even though power at cheaper price is available in abundance, the state government is not purchasing it and deliberately imposing power cuts to turn Punjabis against the farmer organisations,” he claimed.He also criticised the state government for its alleged delay in giving an undertaking to the Railway Ministry that all tracks were clear and that train services to the state should be restarted. “Through the delay in giving the undertaking, Amarinder has not only caused a huge loss to the industry but also delayed the arrival of fertilisers needed for the wheat crop,” he said.

07-11-2020||Chandigarh||High Court: Maintenance tribunals can restore property to elderly||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has restored the powers of eviction to maintenance tribunals set up under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizen Act.In a clear-cut departure from an earlier judgment that took away eviction powers from district magistrates, Justice Arun Monga ruled the tribunals under the Act had jurisdiction to entertain senior citizen’s complaint and enforce his rights for protection of life and “property” against transgression by his children and relatives.Key findingsThe ruling, liable to reduce a senior citizen’s travel time to justice, came on a widow’s petition against additional deputy commissioner-cum-maintenance tribunal’s order asking her to vacate her matrimonial home on her 82-year-old father-in-law’s complaint.Her counsel argued the impugned order was not sustainable as the tribunal did not have power to pass ejectment/eviction order because it was meant only for providing maintenance to senior citizen.Going into intent of the applicable law’s framers, Justice Monga asserted the tribunal could declare property transfer void at the option of a senior citizen, who found himself neglected after transferring his property subject to the condition that the transferee would provide basic amenities. The property transfer, subsequent to the Act’s commencement, would be deemed to have been made by fraud or coercion or undue influence.Justice Monga held: “By necessary implication, the tribunal’s power to declare the transfer void and restore ownership, includes the power to restore possession of the property to the senior citizen.”Justice Monga further held it would be against logic and common sense to say that the tribunal did not have the power to evict a senior citizen’s child or relative in his property’s illegal occupation and restore its possession, while having larger power under the Act to restore its ownership and possession.Justice Monga added statutory protection/provision under the Act would be meaningless, if a senior citizen could not peacefully possess and enjoy his property and protect it from illegal occupation or trespass by a child or relative.
