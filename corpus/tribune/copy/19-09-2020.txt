Countless times, as during the Emergency, we turned down outright offers of power as a price for silence against injustice.“We always spurned such offers and preferred to stand by the country and principles, and filled jails for that. That tradition will always live on,” the five-time former chief minister of Punjab said in a statement here while reacting to SAD’s stand against the farm sector bills.Parkash Singh Badal described the SAD’s decision to pull out of the Union cabinet and fight alongside the farmers as “a proud and a landmark moment in the party’s long history of standing up for principles and of always being on the side of the people whenever a line is drawn”.“Farmers of Punjab always came to the country’s rescue when it needed to be saved from the ignominy of famines and dependence on other nations. They did so by sacrificing their natural resources—water levels and soil fertility. Today, it is the country’s turn to stand by the farmers,” he said.The SAD patriarch congratulated Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who is also his daughter-in-law, for “speaking out boldly for the farmers and for promising to stand by them”.The proposed legislation on marketing of the farmers’ produce needed wider consultations, especially with the stakeholders, the farmers, as well as with parties like the SAD, he said. Parkash Singh Badal said he was satisfied that as a “mature” representative of the people, the SAD tried to convey the sentiments of farmers to the Centre and tried its best to persuade it to refer the proposed legislation to an all-party select committee of MPs for wider consultations with farmers.“The party tried to act as a bridge to find an amicable way to fully accommodate the farmers’ interests. But I am glad that when that did not seem possible, and a line had to be drawn, the SAD stood on the right side of the line and did the only thing that its proud heritage demanded—quit the government.“The SAD could never be a party to anything which harms the interests of farmers,” he said.Badal appealed to Punjabis and all political parties to stand with farmers, during this “struggle for justice”.

19-09-2020||Chandigarh||Amarinder lashes out at Akalis for ‘misleading’ people on farm Bills||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday asked Akalis to stop “lying and misleading” the people of the state by “picking selective portions” of the Congress manifestos, saying it did not even remotely propose any of the anti-farmer moves that the BJP-led Central Government was trying to push on poor farmers to promote the interests of “their rich corporate friends”.Instead of flashing the copies of manifestos at journalists, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) should have made efforts to read their relevant parts first, said the chief minister, taking on the Opposition parties over their alleged “unsubstantiated and blatantly false allegations” against the Congress on the issue.Referring to the Congress manifestos for the Lok Sabha as well as the last Punjab assembly elections, the chief minister said nowhere had the party spoken about bringing any of the changes that the Centre was trying to impose on the nation with its ill-intentioned legislations.In fact, the manifestos had clearly talked about strengthening the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) system to make it even more beneficial to the farmers, he said in an official statement here.The state Congress manifesto of 2017 had stated that the updation of the APMC Act would be done to ensure direct access of farmers to the national and international markets through digital technology without tinkering with the existing MSP system, he said.The LS manifesto, on the other hand, had gone a step forward to talk of further strengthening the marketing system by repealing the existing Act and bringing in new provisions that would provide for the establishment of thousands of Kisan markets to provide easy access to farmers within 2-3 km range, he said.“Only liars could interpret this to mean that the Congress had meant to abolish the APMC Act,” said the chief minister.“When and where did the Congress ever talk of replacing APMC with contract farming and private procurement?” the chief minister asked, lashing out at the Akalis and AAP for “blatantly misleading” the people on the issue.The Punjab Congress manifesto had categorically promised that the “State Government will ensure lifting of food grains within 48 hours and payment by procurement agencies within 3 days for the procured food grains,” making it amply clear that there was not even a remote possibility of changing the procurement system, as the Centre’s new laws are seeking to do, he said.“Picking up sentences and misrepresenting the communication is an art that the BJP has mastered, and the Akalis are now emulating,” said Singh.

19-09-2020||New Delhi||Centre rejects study that claims India is world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide||The Environment Ministry on Saturday rejected the findings of a study that claimed that India is the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide (SO2) and informed the Rajya Sabha that 18 units for flue-gas desulphurisation were installed in the country.Congress MP Ripun Bora had sought to know whether the government is aware that India is the largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide from coal burning that causes air pollution.In his reply, Union Minister of State for Environment Babul Supriyo said: “No sir, it has been reported in one of the study of environmental NGO Greenpeace that India is the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide (SO2) and coal-based thermal power plants are the major contributors. Government facts do not agree to this”.He said the ministry, through its December 2015 notification, stipulated norms for emission of sulphur dioxide from thermal power plants apart from other pollutants.“There was no SO2 emission norms for coal-based thermal power pants prior to this notification and regulated through stipulating the height of discharge/emittance through fixing height of chimney,” Supriyo said in a written response.Asked whether India has flue-gas desulphurisation technology installed in coal plants that will help in reduction of air pollution, the minister said two of the commonly acceptable technology for flue-gas desulphurisation of coal-based thermal power plants---wet scrubbing in alkaline media and dry sorbent injection (DSI)---are installed in India.“As on August 31, 2020, 16 units on wet scrubbing and two units on DSI technology are installed for de-sulphurisation of flue gas from coal-based thermal power plants,” Supriyo said.According to the data, of the 16 wet-scrubbing units, eight are in Maharashtra, three in Gujarat, two each in Haryana and Tamil Nadu and one in Madhya Pradesh. The two DSI units are in Uttar Pradesh.In August last year, a study by environment NGO Greenpeace India had claimed that India is the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide, which is produced from coal burning, and greatly contributes to air pollution.The Greenpeace India has released an analysis of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) data saying India has more than 15 per cent of all anthropogenic sulphur dioxide (SO2) hotspots in the world detected by the OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite.“The major SO2 emission hotspots in India are Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh, Neyveli and Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Talcher and Jharsuguda in Odisha, Korba in Chhattisgarh, Kutch in Gujarat, Ramagundam in Telangana and Chandrapur and Koradi in Maharashtra.“The vast majority of plants in India lack flue-gas desulfurization technology to reduce their air pollution,” it had said.

Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan presented a detailed status note of COVID-19 on all these states with particular focus on the number of tests being conducted in each state and UT, their positivity rate and their average daily case fatality rate, availability of health infrastructure and their district wise oxygen availability.Bhushan had earlier said there was no dearth of oxygen availability in India but states needed to issue alerts of stock outs in time to ensure the supplies were not interrupted.India as of today has 53,08,014 COVID cases, of which 42,08,431 have recovered and 85,619 people have died.

The ordinances became the basis of the three controversial Bills---The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020.Farmers across the country have been holding protests against the three bills. The central government claims the Bills will open up the agricultural sector to beyond the Agriculture Produce Market Committees, and will bring down trade barriers.  Critics however fear that it would reduce the bargaining power of Agriculture Produce Market Committees and will in effect leave them at the mercy of private commissioning agents and traders and not guarantee a fair price.  They also see this as a method to end the MSP system.

19-09-2020||Aman Sood||Police register FIR against guests, host and management of Patiala club||Tribune News ServicePatiala, September 19A day after The Tribune reported on a private function held at Rajindra Gymkhana and Mahendra Club (Maharani Club), the district police registered an FIR against the host, guests and the management of the club “for violating COVID 19 related guidelines”.Following a preliminary probe, an FIR under sections 269, 270, 271, 188 of the IPC; Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act; and Section 3 of the Epidemic Act 2020 was registered at Lahori Gate police station against host of the function Bhupinder Singh, unknown persons present at the function and the management of Maharani Club.Police said following the video and some news items flashed in print media, the FIR was registered.“Prima-facie it was found that above-mentioned persons organised a function at Rajindra gymkhana and Mahindra club where guidelines related to COVID-19, issued by the district administration, were flouted,” said Patiala SSP Vikramjeet Duggal.Police said a thorough investigation of the incident will be carried out. “Last week, over 20 persons in the club were found corona positive and ideally such an even should not have happened against the government norms. We will see how many more such functions were held during the lockdown and add them to the case,” said a senior official.According to the information gathered by The Tribune, a private member of the club had booked two rooms claiming that he would invite a total of around 30 guests. However, a video of the function shows that not only couple dance was held but elderly and children at the private function, held as part of a herbal company were seen without masks.Interestingly, even the staff and waiters of the Maharani Club were seen serving without masks on. “How can such parties be allowed, when the gatherings are limited for marriages and deaths. Such gatherings are illegal and in addition to the management of the club a case should be registered against the host and staff, catering at the venue,” said a club member.Patiala is already performing badly to contain the virus spread with hundreds of fresh cases in the past two weeks. Earlier such parties in Rajpura had led to community transmission following which government had banned all such avoidable functions. As per government guidelines, only marriage and death related gatherings that too limited to less than 30 persons with social distancing norms are allowed.Interestingly, president of the club JPS Walia is also a doctor and he had claimed that he would examine the matter and had allowed two rooms be booked for a lunch with 15 guests in each room.Following queries by The Tribune, Patiala SSP Vikram Jeet Duggal had marked an enquiry into the whole incident to the Patiala SP City following which the FIR has been registered.The club is one of north India’s oldest clubs with hundreds of people from across the country as its members. “However, it has lost sheen in the past few years due to many violations and even the way its management holds elections,” rue members.

Normally, the containers used for imports are deployed for exports as exporters have to bear additional transportation cost if they bring empty containers from the ports.According to industry, there has been a surge in industrial activity in Ludhiana and surrounding towns after the lockdown was lifted. It also led to surge in exports as the traders had to meet export obligations. As a result, the demand for containers also shot up.“There is a shortage of containers in Ludhiana because imports have dropped and exports have started picking up,” said Amit Goswami, director, Euro Forge (Punjab).Ludhiana has five fully functional Inland Container Depots (ICDs) with a capacity to handle over 25,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit) per month. The corporates located in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and J&K are dependent on Ludhiana ICDs for exports besides Delhi.“During the pre-Covid days, the ICDs in Ludhiana used to handle around 500 containers for imports and 300 containers for exports per day and the containers were available instantly. However, due to the trade disruption the scenario is entirely different now and almost 400-500 containers are required for exports daily,” said Ajay Thakur, a customs clearing agent.In July, the fall in imports was steeper at 28.4%. Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust in Mumbai — the country’s largest container port — saw exports exceeding imports by 41,600 TEUs in July.Trade insiders said the container shortage will persist until imports from China and other countries pick up. “It is anticipated that an increase in imports ahead of Diwali may increase container availability and help cool off freight,” said another customs clearing agent.

19-09-2020||Aditi Tandon||Mizoram, Punjab happiest states; Andaman Nicobar happiest UT: Report||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 19Mizoram, Punjab and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have emerged as the top three ranked states and Union Territories in the first ever annual India Happiness Report measuring national wellbeing and people’s happiness.The study conducted by India’s leading management strategy expert Rajesh Pillania is based on a nationwide survey covering 16,950 people between March and July 2020 and tracks the impact of COVID-19 on people.In the final happiness rankings, Mizoram, Punjab, Andaman and Nicobar Islands are the top three states and UTs while Odisha, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh are the bottom three.Among the big states, Punjab, Gujarat and Telangana lead the happiness rankings while among the smaller states, Mizoram, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh are at the top.The research names the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Puducherry and the Lakshadweep as the happiest Union Territories.“Happiness is a subjective concept and the differences in rankings are due to differences in the components of happiness across the states and the UTs. This study used six components to measure happiness — work and work-related issues such as earnings and growth; relationships, including family and friends; physical and mental health; philanthropy; spiritual orientation; and the impact of COVID-19 on happiness. All these components are found to be significant in the regression analysis and explain the differences in happiness scores,” Pillania, currently teaching at MDI Gurugram, told The Tribune.He also found that India sustained well through the COVID-19 pandemic.“The spirit of India is quite resilient and the impact of COVID-19 varied across states and UTs. Maharashtra, Delhi and Haryana showed the worst possible impact of COVID-19 on happiness; Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir remained neutral while Manipur, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and the Lakshadweep showed the best impact of COVID-19 on happiness,” said the researcher whose report includes signed articles by top happiness experts in the world.Pillania found that while correlations between gender and happiness were not significant, marital status, education, and incomes were positively related to happiness. “Results show married people are happier than unmarried people. A long-term Harvard study that followed people through 70 years also found that those in stable relationships were happier than others. I plan to publish the India Happiness Report every year,” says Pillania.Asked what prompted his project, the academician said though the World Happiness Report Covered India, it was insufficient for a diverse country like ours.Research makes a strong case for supporting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with measures of subjective well-being and happiness.India’s first Happiness Report’s instant objective is to create more interest in the topic and long-term objective is to inform policy.

Now, the BKU (Ugrahan) has sufficient quantity of essential commodities for its both protests.Earlier, the BKU (Ugrahan) had announced its protest from September 15 to 20, but now it has decided to extend it till September 25.“We made announcements in villages before the start of our protests. Within hours, a majority of residents reached us with bags of flour, packets of sugar and vegetables. Since we cannot store supplies at the protest sites, we have kept these in villages and sending it to protesters as per their requirement,” said Dharminder Pashore, Lehra block president, BKU (Ugrahan).The union has set up stage management, langar and transport committees to ensure timely distribution of food, tea and water among protesters daily. As per a rough estimate, around 2,000 members have been included in the committees to ensure smooth completion of all work. “I have contributed 20 kg flour and one kg sugar. Many others have contributed groceries as per their capacity as it’s our fight against the Central Government,” said Balwinder Kaur, a resident of Pashore village.Apart from residents, gurdwaras have also been preparing langar and supplying it to protesters. A gurdwara committee from Sangrur supplied rice to protesters in Patiala today. “Many gurdwara committee members are calling us as they want to supply langar to protesters. We are preparing a list so that the food does not go waste,” said Rajpal Singh, a BKU leader.Apart from participating in the protest along with union members, many farmers have been reaching the protest sites in their own vehicles to express solidarity with farmers.

They (SAD) should be with either farmers or the BJP; the decision is theirs.”He added that they (farmers) would not let the members of political parties enter the villages if they (parties) do not come on roads and protest along with them.

It will stay and every grain of the farmer’s produce will be purchased by the govt.State BJP president Ashwani Sharma, while talking to The Tribune, said: “We firmly stand by the farm ordinances and there is no question of any compromise, locally, on the Bills. As far as the alliance with the SAD is concerned, we have nothing to say. A call will be taken by our high command.”Calling the ordinances revolutionary, Sharma said “the political parties showing opposition are misleading farmers. The Congress, particularly in Punjab, wants to divert the attention of farmers from its failure to address the issues of illegal mining, illicit liquor and joblessness, besides others”. The state president said the party would visit villages to readdress any misgivings about the Bills among farmers. — TNS

Sources said the victim’s family was under Rs 10 lakh debt.A large number of farmers, including women, have been lodging their protest since September 15 by pitching a tent near the Badals’ residence at the village.Earlier, Mann said: “One of the protesters, Pritam Singh, from Akkanwali village in Mansa district this morning consumed some poisonous substance at the protest site, a reflection of how the Centre had forced the farmers to die. He had been protesting from day one.” Meanwhile, a large number of cops had been deployed at the village and the road to the Badals’ residence barricaded.Protest extended till September 25The farmers, already on a six-day protest, on Friday decided to extend it by five days i.e. till September 25.

19-09-2020||---||Farmers reject parties’ offer to join stir||Chandigarh, September 18With all political parties in Punjab trying to prove themselves to be most farmer-friendly, farmers have rejected their offer of joining their state-wide stir.From the beginning of this week, all prominent farmer unions have been protesting against the three farm Bills passed by the Lok Sabha. Two major dharnas are going on, one in Patiala, the hometown of CM Capt Amarinder Singh, and second at Badal village, outside the residence of Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal. Farmers have also been laying siege to national and state highways.Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of BKU (Rajewal), said they want to fight on their own. “There is no way that we will take support from the politicians, who change colours once voted to power. If the farmers can feed the entire country, they can also fight for their cause and bring the country to a halt. Any politician who fails to support us and favours these Bills, will be taught a lesson,” he said.Gearing up for a joint meeting of all major farmer unions at Moga tomorrow, Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), said political histrionics and changing stands on the Bills do not impress them. “Our livelihoods and the future of farming as a viable employment avenue is at the stake. Politicians, cutting across party lines, are only concerned about their votes. Once they get elected, they forget about farmers and start favouring corporates. After all our votes help them come to power and the corporates’ money keeps them in power. That is why we have rejected offers from the politicians to be part of our protests,” he said.Yesterday, an AAP delegation had offered to support the farmers’ six-day dharna at Badal village. Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, general secretary of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), said they outrightly rejected the offer. “Politicians want to use our protests for their political gains. Just as we are protesting, let these parties, too, launch similar agitations if they support us. Their political statements will not suffice. If they are serious, they need to do much more to save the farm economy,” he said. In the coming days, the unions intend to start “rail roko” campaigns, while a complete bandh call has been given for September 25.

The two parties have been allies for over three decades but differences over the farm produce-related Bills have led to the resignation of senior Akali leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal from the Union Cabinet.Sticking pointsWhile the BJP, both at the Centre and Punjab, has said the alliance will remain intact, there are strong voices within the SAD that want an immediate separation from the saffron outfit.Party sources said members were angry at the BJP leadership’s ‘inflexible’ attitude in tabling the farm Bills despite opposition by the Akalis. Also, members said they were peeved at the speed with which the Union Government accepted Harsimrat’s resignation.A party spokesperson said the core committee would meet in a few days and deliberate on the issue.He said the Akalis had told the BJP leadership they stood by the issues of the Sikhs, Dalits, Punjabis and farmers, and won’t compromise on these.
19-09-2020||---||Farm laws part of ‘kisan maaru,  Punjab maaru’ conspiracy: Punjab CM||Chandigarh, September 18Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday alleged that the farm Bills were part of the ‘kisan maaru, Punjab maaru’ (destroy farmers, destroy Punjab) conspiracy of the BJP-led NDA, of which the Akalis continue to be a part at the cost of their own state and people.Capt Amarinder Singh, Chief Minister‘Delhi has to rethink’Delhi has to rethink as these legislations will spoil the peaceful environment of the border state.“I don’t know what enmity the BJP and the Akalis have with Punjab and why they are out to destroy us,” said the Chief Minister while launching the Virtual Kisan Mela of the Punjab Agriculture University, Ludhiana.The launch, held virtually at 100 locations, was attended by farmers and their representatives, ministers, MLAs, PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar and other stakeholders.Warning again that the farm laws would lead to growing angst among the people in the border state and give Pakistan the opportunity to stoke more fire, the CM said the anti-farmer move would spoil the ‘abo hawa’ (environment) of Punjab.Rejects Nagra’s resignationA day after Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra resigned as Congress legislator over the passage of the farm Bills in the Lok Sabha, CM Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday rejected his resignation. The Fatehgarh Sahib MLA said he respected the party’s decision.“The legislations would undo the sacrifices made by Punjab and its farmers over 65 years to make India self-sufficient in food,” he said, notwithstanding the Centre’s denials that these new laws would pave the way for the elimination of the MSP regime. Rejecting the BJP and SAD claims that Punjab was on board on the farm ordinances, Capt Amarinder waved the draft report shared with the state, which made no mention whatsoever of the ordinances.

A senior officer with a vast field experience is already probing the case.Much more than meets the eyeDeputy Director Niranjan Singh, who has over three decades of field experience, has been asked to stop further probe and the case has been shifted to Delhi. Surely, there is much more than meets the eye. — An ED officialSources said almost three weeks after the ED stepped in to investigate the illicit liquor trade in Punjab after the August hooch tragedy, the Central Government today paved the way for shifting the entire probe and related investigations to the Delhi headquarters.“We were anticipating this given the large-scale involvement of politicians who control over 70 per cent of the legal liquor trade, while the liquor mafia continues to make over Rs 2,500 crore per annum at the behest of certain politicians,” said a top ED officer.Proves Congress-SAD nexusCongress and SAD leaders are directly involved in the liquor trade and therefore they ensured this probe is shifted to Delhi and delayed. This proves their nexus as no financial recovery has been made to date. — Harpal Singh Cheema, leader of Opposition“Surprisingly, the case pertains to Punjab, accused are also from the state and even the court jurisdiction will be here, but the ED office has decided to take away the files. This will not only delay, but also hamper in-depth probe,” said the official.On September 3, the Central investigating agency had registered an enforcement case information report, kick-starting probe into the tragedy, which claimed 125 lives, and also the role of officials, politicians and accused who made crores of rupees through illegal trade. The ED has sought details of the FIRs filed by the Punjab Police in the case to verify a possible money laundering angle.“Even the investments made by the accused and politicians protecting them would have been probed for money laundering. Our officer Deputy Director Niranjan Singh, who has over three decades of field experience, has been asked to stop further probe and the case has been taken away to the National Capital. Surely there is much more than meets the eye,” said an ED official.Interestingly, SAD and some Congress leaders have already demanded a CBI probe, claiming Congress MLAs are directly running the trade. On the other hand, Congress claims the probe is already on.Two days ago, ED Jalandhar Joint Director Ashok Gautam had denied any move to shift the probe to Delhi. However, the official orders were received today in Jalandhar.The AAP has alleged the shifting of the case outside Punjab from an experienced team that probed the multi-crore drug trade shows the Congress and SAD are playing a friendly game.

The flight had resumed in May 25 when domestic flights were allowed with certain restrictions.However, the passenger load remained low during the May-August period as business and industrial activity in the city were adversely affected post the lockdown and only a few passengers were travelling by air to Delhi. Even when the flight restarts from September 24, its continuity will depend solely on volume of passenger load because the three-year period of ‘viability gap funding’ by the Centre and state government under the UDAN scheme also expired in the first week of September, an official said.

However, the members can attend the annual budget session which has been scheduled for September 28. The SGPC executive members were also directed to sweep the street leading to the Golden Temple ‘deori’ from Gurdwara Saragarhi Niwas for one hour for three days.Giani Harpreet Singh said it was “shameful” that the staff members misappropriated the ‘saroops’ under the nose of the SGPC and no efforts were made to check the ledgers of the Publication Department that prints and manages the holy scriptures.Admitting administrative carelessness, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal submitted a public apology. Longowal said though they were not being called up, they had unanimously decided to seek pardon for the lapse in managing the ‘saroops’.As revealed in the probe report, Longowal sought pardon while admitting that the officials and staff members issued the ‘saroops’ without putting them on record and pocketed the ‘bheta’ (the amount charged at the time of issuing the ‘saroops’).About skipping the ‘pashchatap path’ (remorse prayers) following the May 2016 fire incident at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib that left several ‘saroops’ destroyed, Giani Harpreet Singh termed it a “bajjar galti” (serious mistake).The then SGPC executive members appeared for penance. All of them submitted a public apology. Then senior vice-president Raghujit Singh Virk was questioned for the lapse of not performing remorse prayers. All of them were directed not to occupy any position in the SGPC for the next one year and the SGPC executive was directed to enure compliance of directions. The members were also directed to listen to ‘sehaj path’ and perform ‘sewa’ at a local gurdwara as per their physical capacity.The existing SGPC executive was also directed to conduct a session of ‘sehaj path’ prayers at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib, where the incident had occurred, and another one at Akal Takht.In another case, SGPC member Gurinder Pal Singh Gora, former Dharam Parchar committee members Rattan Singh Jafarwal and Sarchand Singh were strictly warned against having any association with former SAD minister Sucha Singh Langah. Langah was excommunicated by Akal Takht on October 5, 2017, after his objectionable video with a woman had gone viral.

||For child’s care, granny gets bail in murder case||Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 18 For a two-year-old, life could not have been more unfair. After losing her mother, the infant was compelled to remain incarcerated on the jail premises with her grandmother — an accused in a murder case. Coming to her rescue, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has now granted bail to the grandmother on compassionate grounds after observing that there was little chance of the trial getting completed in a reasonably short period in view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Justice Sudip Ahluwalia of the High Court asserted the petitioner was a woman and had to look after the minor child, who was compelled to remain incarcerated on the jail premises as she was in the petitioner-grandmother’s custody. Justice Ahluwalia said the court, taking into consideration the facts of the matter, was not inclined to detain the accused-grandmother any further at the current stage. The matter was brought to the Bench’s notice after the accused filed a petition through counsel Ravinder Bangar for bail in the case, registered at he Basti Jodhewal police station in Ludhiana on May 5 last year for murder and other offences under Sections 302 and 201 of the IPC.

19-09-2020||Sukhbir Singh Badal||Akalis feel betrayed by NDA govt over farm legislation, says Sukhbir Badal||The Shiromani Akali Dal fears that NDA government’s farm legislations will destroy the country’s federal structure as well as Punjab’s economy. A day after his wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal quit the Union Government, party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal spoke exclusively with Jupinderjit Singh of The Tribune on the chain of events leading to the resignation.Your alliance with the BJP is more than three decades old. How do you feel about the turn of events?I am saddened. It is a dark day for the farmers in particular and the country as a whole. My father Sardar Parkash Singh Badal was among the founder members of the National Democratic Alliance which was forged to take on ‘anti-people’ forces like the Congress. It all started from the Tihar Jail where my father was imprisoned for raising his voice against the anti-people policies of the Congress government. But I have the satisfaction of having stood by the farmers. Our party is of the farmers, for the farmers and will fight for the farmers.Does Harsimrat’s resignation from the Union Cabinet mean the SAD-BJP alliance is over?Members of the SAD core committee will sit together, analyse the situation and take a decision accordingly. Sadly, we were not consulted on the farm ordinances. There is a feeling of betrayal within the party.Are you surprised at the haste shown in accepting the resignation?No. We left no room for reconciliation. We were firm in our opposition to the ordinances. I repeat we were not consulted on the issue. The SAD is the only party that represents the farmers. I am a farmer, my father is a farmer and so is my son and more than 90 per cent members of the party. Yet we were not consulted.Why did your party support the farm ordinances earlier?We never supported the ordinances. Harsimrat marked objections on the inter-ministerial note. The issue, not listed on the Union Cabinet agenda, was tabled at the last minute. She objected and demanded that the matter be deferred. She was told that these were only ordinances and the government would have enough time to make any amendment before Bills replacing the ordinances were tabled in Parliament. Amendments were not made and farmers’ viewpoint was disregarded. So, she had to resign. We cannot be a part of anything that is anti-farmer.Did you take up the issue with the government before the ordinances were tabled?We talked to the farmers and told the government about their misgivings. We got a letter from the Union Home Minister, saying the MSP regime would stay. The farmers were not convinced. There were objections to the dismantling of Punjab’s mandi system. We told the Modi government that the Punjab mandi system was the best in the country and must be replicated elsewhere. We have invested a lot on raising agri infrastructure in the past 50 years.The multi-nationals will finish all that hard work. The farmers will benefit initially, but once the multi-nationals have a monopoly, they will think only of their profit.Why do you think the Modi govt is in such a hurry to pass these Bills?That is a big question. We wanted the Bills to be referred to a select committee. After a discussion with all stakeholders, the government could have taken an informed decision. But none of that happened. When people are not happy with a law, why bring that law?The Congress and other parties say the resignation is too little, too late. Your comment?We don’t need a certificate from the Congress. The Akali MPs voted against the Bills. The Congress MPs walked out, which only helps the government during voting. In fact, the Congress is equally responsible. Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh should resign for deceiving the farmers.The Congress promised the same legislation in its 2019 poll manifesto. The Punjab Government has already approved the setting up of private mandis. Captain was among the seven CMs on a committee that discussed the ordinances before these were tabled. Why did he not object then?
