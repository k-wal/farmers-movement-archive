07-01-2021||GS Paul||Farmers took right decision of not letting any political party to occupy their stage: Manjit Singh GK||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, January 8At a time when the elections of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) are approaching, its former president Manjit Singh GK believes that its results would set the tone for the SGPC and 2022 Punjab Vidhan Sabha elections, as well.GK, who was here to pay obeisance at the Golden Temple, said his purpose was to pray and perform ardas for the success of farmers’ struggle in the New Year.He advocated the farmers’ move of not sharing their stage with any political party while contesting the farm laws.“Otherwise, the political parties who had lost their grounds, would have misutilised the farmers’ platform for their political gains while tarnishing the farmers’ cause,” he said.He said many rounds of talks were there between the farmers and the Centre leadership, but these remained inconclusive. “I appeal to the Centre to resolve the issue shortly, especially when the farmers with their elders, children and ladies were holding protests amidst the adverse weather conditions,” he said.Launching a scathing attack on SAD, the president of JAGO (Jag Aasra Guru Ott) party said that Badals’ downfall was started in 2014 when Arun Jaitley could not succeed in Lok Sabha elections from Amritsar.“Badals have lost the credibility among the Sikhs who could never forget the flip-flop decision to pardon the controversial Sirsa Dera cult and series of sacrilege incidents that led to killing of innocent at Barghari. The DSGMC would witness the elections in three months and its results would clear air about Badals’ future. I foresee Badals being totally wiped out from the DSGMC, followed by the SGPC and the Assembly.”
07-01-2021||New Delhi||Punjab student travels from US to stand with farmers||Had it not been for the farmers’ protest against the new agri laws that began over a month ago, 22-year-old Navpal Singh would have never planned a trip home at this time from Texas in the US, where he is a student.“This protest forced me to come here,” said the mechanical engineering student whose father and grandfather are farmers.“The last time I had come home was less than a year ago...in March, so I had no plans whatsoever to visit again, but the way this protest has taken over this country and also the world, I couldn’t stay away,” he said.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at multiple Delhi borders against the new agri laws.Singh arrived in India on Monday and has been travelling between Singhu and his ancestral village in Punjab’s Jalandhar every day since.Even though he is not a farmer himself, Singh felt the need to be part of the protest because of his farming roots that have provided for his education.“People might think I have no direct connection with farming...that I am studying in the US, I will also work and get married there, but my father and grandfather are farmers.“I wouldn’t have been able to have my life in the US without the farmers. And now it is my responsibility to come forward and stand with them in their fight for their rights,” he said. Several rounds of talks with the government have failed to break the deadlock with the government pushing the new legislations as important reforms in the agricultural sector.The next round of talks is scheduled on Friday.The farmers on the other hand have maintained that they want the three laws to be repealed. They have also threatened to enter Delhi on January 26 if their demands are not met.About the stalemate between the government and the farmers, Singh said it was the former’s way of “breaking their spirit”.“By scheduling talks after talks, the government is trying to simply drag the protest as long as it can, and hoping that it would eventually break our spirits, but they are mistaken.“A movement like this does not happen every now and then. Today’s rally alone has shown our strength and numbers,” said Singh, who will return to Texas on January 18.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the “mandi” (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

He showed willingness to share information in connection with the case.Accordingly, he appeared before the CIU on Thursday to record his statement," the official said.The alleged scam came to light when the police seized a DC Avanti, a sports-car manufactured by Dilip Chhabria Design Pvt Ltd, in south Mumbai on a tip-off that its registration number was bogus.The car's owner produced documents which were found to be genuine and showed that it was registered at Chennai.However, another car with same engine and chassis number was found to be registered in Haryana, police had said.The probe revealed that loans averaging Rs 42 lakh per car were availed by Dilip Chhabria Design Pvt Ltd for DC Avantis manufactured by it in the name of bogus customers, it said.As many as 120 DC Avanti cars have been sold in India and abroad, and at least 90 of them were allegedly used for obtaining loans fraudulently.The cars were on paper hypothecated to the finance firm but were already sold off to customers, the investigators claimed.Various Non-Banking Finance Companies including BMW Financial Services were duped in this way, police have said. — PTI
07-01-2021||Chandigarh||Farmer leaders have political aspirations, say Punjab BJP leaders||With the stalemate continuing between farmer unions and the Union government, two Punjab BJP leaders mediating for talks have launched fresh attack against the farm leaders. BJP leaders Surjit Kumar Jyani and Harjeet Grewal after meeting with Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday said that many of the leaders leading the agitation have political aspirations and they want to contest elections after returning to Punjab.Both the leaders are scheduled to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah in the evening. Earlier, on Tuesday they had a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well. Jyani said the current leaders do not want people to go back home peacefully and they are doing this out of political aspirations. They want repression on people, so that they could become bigger leaders with wider acceptability. “But their attitude will not lead anywhere.” Jyani said there are practical problems while dealing with the 32 leaders.“Now it has become leaderless. Nobody is ready to listen. We agree that they represent 32 organisations, but now they should choose their leader,” he said.However, Harjit Grewal went a step ahead and questioned the credentials of the leaders.“Who is Joginder Singh Ugrahan, he belongs to a Marxist-Leninist group, a Naxalite faction called Nagi Reddy group in Punjab.”     He also questioned Yogendra Yadav and CPM leader Hannan Mollah’s presence among the farmer unions.  However, reacting to this, farmer unions have called it just another name calling.“Earlier, they called as Khalistanis, then Maoists. Now they call us politically aspired move. Their new propaganda will also bite the dust like previous ones. It is part of our constitution that neither any of our leaders can contest the elections nor we support any political party,” said Jagmohan Singh, General Secretary, BKU (Dakaunda).Another farmer leader Rajinder Singh, vice president of Kirti Kisan Union, challenged the BJP leaders to go back and hold a public meeting to level the same allegation in a Punjab meeting.“The entire Punjab has stood up against BJP and its leaders.”

We are ready for polls.”“Earlier, the state government had communicated to the State Election Commission to complete the election process by February 13. But after the Local Government department sought a few more days beyond February 13, the government has decided to complete the election process by February 20. It had been mentioned that Deputy Commissioners had sought the time for conduct of the elections,” said a senior government functionary.Initially, the government had decided to hold the election in October 2019, but due the pandemic it was delayed.A senior leader said with the BJP writing to the Punjab Governor to postpone the civic body polls citing the law and order situation, it had become all the more important to go for polling to prove the saffron party wrong. The Chief Minister has already stated that BJP was making a frivolous ground of law and order situation as it was trying to divert attention from the farmers’ agitation.“With almost four years of governance and General Election due in 2022, the civic body polls will be a litmus test for the Congress government in urban areas and the right time to take on the BJP,” said the leader.

07-01-2021||---||Farmers hold tractor march, say govt has time till Friday to repeal agri laws||New Delhi, January 7Ahead of the meeting with Union ministers on Friday, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said the government can try as much as it can, but the farmers will not go back home till the three Acts are repealed.“The government has time till tomorrow. It can make a law on MSP and take back the three laws."Today's tractor march was a trailer, the entire movie will be shown on January 26," he said.Not expecting any breakthrough before the eighth round of talks with the Union Government, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha in a show of strength started took out a tractor rally.The protesting farm groups started their tractor rally on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) expressway.Armed with Google maps and contact details of points-persons appointed to guide them, the farmers descended on the KMP from four different locations. Those camping at the Singhu and Tikri borders will be entering the expressway from Kundli and Sampla, respectively. The two groups will then meet mid-way before returning to their respective bases.Similarly, the farmers camped at the Ghazipur border will meet farmers coming from Rewasan in Palwal and return to their campsites later in the day.Shingara Singh Maan, president of Haryana unit of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan), said the tractor rally was only the start of a long-drawn-out battle for their rights.“This rally is an example of our strong resolve because we know this will take a long time and we are prepared to sit for many more months. Today’s show of strength will only empower our farmers to join in,” said Maan, who is leading the group from Tikri border towards Palwal.Maan said they were not expecting any breakthrough from the scheduled eighth round of talks with the Union Government’s representatives led by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar.“We don’t think we will get anything substantive from the meeting. Kal kuch nahi hona (nothing significant will come out of the meeting). We have known for a while that this will be a long-drawn-out battle to get those bills repealed and all of us are prepared for that,” he added.
07-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmers' protest: Security increased along Delhi borders||Security was increased along the borders of the national capital ahead of a tractor rally of farmers on Thursday morning.The farmers will hold the rally at 11 am at four borders of Delhi in protest against the Centre's agriculture laws. They had on Tuesday deferred their proposed tractor march from January 6 to January 7 due to bad weather forecast.The city has been receiving rain sporadically over the past four days.Braving severe cold and sporadic rain, thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and some other parts of the country have been camping at several Delhi border points for over 40 days, demanding repeal of farm laws, a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops and two other issues.The seventh round of talks between protesting unions and three central ministers ended inconclusively on Monday as farmer groups stuck to their demand for the repeal of three laws, while the government listed out various benefits of the new acts for the growth of the country's agriculture sector.Since the farmers arrived at the national capital's borders, the Delhi Traffic Police has been posting alerts on its official Twitter handle to inform commuters about road closures across the city.In a series of tweets, it had said Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli and Mangesh borders were closed for traffic movement."Please take alternative route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK Road & NH-44."The Chilla and Ghazipur borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests. Please take alternative route for coming to Delhi via Anand Vihar, DND, Bhopra & Loni Borders," the traffic police said.It said Tikri and Dhansa borders are also closed for traffic movement."Jhatikara Border is open only for LMV (Cars/Light Motor Vehicles), two wheelers and pedestrian movement," another tweet read.According to the traffic police, people travelling to Haryana can take the routes via Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders.

07-01-2021||Vibha Sharma||What to expect from eighth round of talks between Centre and farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 7Ahead of the eighth round of talks with Union ministers on Friday, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said the government can try as much as it can but farmers will not go back home till the three Acts are repealed. “The government still has time till tomorrow. It can make a law on MSP and take back the three laws and fulfil demands of the agitation.“The tractor march today was a trailer, the full movie will be shown on January 26 (Republic Day when farmers have planned a tractor parade),” he said. Meanwhile, slamming the “attempts to defame the agitation”, Dr Darshan Pal of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha said “few anti-social elements are disturbing the protests by various activities”.“The discipline committee is investigating reports and individuals concerned will be handed over to the police. We are again reminding the government ahead of tomorrow’s meeting that these laws should be completely repealed and remunerative MSP should be made into a legal right of all farmers. We will never accept the amendments offered by government and towards fulfilling our demands, we will continue to intensify the protests,” he said, making clear unions’ stance at the meeting. While after the January-4 talks, it is more or less clear the government has ceded all it intends to persuade farmers to end the agitation speculations are it may offer or propose the choice of implementation of the three contentious laws on States, giving them the power/freedom to enforce them.Farmer’ leaders say after what Punjab BJP leaders said after their meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that “Maoists have infiltrated the movement, the PM knows best and farmers should listen to him, it is clear the government has not understood the gravity of the situation”. “It is not about which party is in power in which State, it is about farmers,” they say. However, while farmers threaten escalation it seems the government too is prepared for a long haul. Sources say the government has already relented on the proposed Power Act, the Ordinance on stubble pollution and offered amendments to the three Acts. “They (farmers) should tell us something new, we are ready to discuss the three Acts clause by clause,” they say. Given the kind of support/traction the agitation has received from common people, the matter has moved out of the hands of unions’ leaders for any resolution on lesser terms, this farmer and government negotiators know well. “It is now a people’s movement,” says a union leader.  But as Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has also pointed on many occasions, for the government “it is the matter of the entire country and not just Punjab and Haryana”. Politically, it is the question of 23 Lok Sabha seats of Punjab and Haryana and it remains to be seen how far the BJP-led Centre is willing to go to save those. Small and marginal farmers comprise almost 80 to 85 per cent. Plus if the government relents any further, it risks the chance of opening fronts of other such protests.
07-01-2021||Aparna Banerji||Farmers' agitation: Soaked in blood, letters continue to stir the ‘unstirred’||Tribune News ServiceJalandhar, January 6Revolutions can’t succeed without shedding blood, it is said. At Singhu, it’s being done literally!For the 15th day on Wednesday, 48-year-old Taranjit Singh Nimana sits with a thin wooden straw in his hand; its tip soaked in red. He is penning a letter to the leaders of the country. On a nearby table lies 10 more letters — red on white — in Punjabi. But in place of ink, what he writes with is the blood of farmers!Since December 20, the Bhai Ghanaiya Ji Mission Sewa Society, a Ludhiana-based NGO, has been penning letters in blood of farmers exhorting the top leaders of the country to withdraw the three farm laws. Everyday an array of blood-soaked letters are handed over to farm leaders. This blood is donated at the NGO’s blood donation camps being held behind the main stage of the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha at the Singhu border.The NGO, which has won the state award nine times for its contribution in the field on blood donation, is headed by its president Taranjit Singh Nimana. Nearly 1,000 farmers have donated blood across the 15 blood donation camps held so far. Letters have so far been sent to the Prime Minister, Home Minister, President, Vice President and the Chief Justice of India, but to no avail. Nimana now plans to send a letter written in his blood to the UNO on his birthday tomorrow (January 7) in honour of those, who died at the Delhi protests.On his recent visit to the Singhu border, environmentalist Seechewal also called upon Nimana, his old acquaintance, after Seechewal’s speech on stage.Such is the spirit that after a storm uprooted the backstage tent and damaged the mattresses and equipment at the camp, it has been shifted to a safer shed, where the camp resumed today.Nimana, says: “Ehnan chitthiyan vich kisanan da khoon raleya hai. Asi bhejde rahange jad tak kale kanoon vapas nahi hunde. Singhan de hausle chikkar vich vi buland ne. (These letters are soaked in farmers’ blood. We will keep writing these until the black laws are withdrawn. Singhs are full of courage even in mud).”Nimana adds: “We sent back doctors yesterday. Our backstage tent lost its roof. It was very windy and the tent ended up dripping in rain. We resumed at another place today. It’s my birthday on January 7. In memory of lives lost at Singhu, I shall donate blood and write in blood to the UNO to get the laws withdrawn.” Blood collected from the camp has been donated to blood banks at Ludhiana, Patiala and now to UP, Delhi and Haryana (Faridabad, Rohtak, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad, Delhi (Mayur Vihar).“While there is already a blood shortage during the pandemic, we would want the blood to be used for any emergency case. Anyone who needs blood is free to take it from us,” Nimana says. While Nimana planned to send blood-soaked letters to the PM from Ludhiana, he shifted to Singhu border when the idea was discussed with morcha leaders, who asked the NGO to shift base to Singhu.

07-01-2021||Aparna Banerji||At Singhu border, Seechewal pitches for organic farming||Tribune News ServiceJalandhar, January 6“Organic farming is the only way forward for the health of coming generations. It is a necessity for a strengthened farming community,” this was the exhortation of environmentalist Balbir Singh Seechewal, who visited the farm protests at the Singhu border on January 3.Visiting the site with 10 quintals of groundnuts and 200 tarpaulins for farmers braving the rains, the environmentalist appealed to farmers to take to organic cultivation. Addressing farmers at the rain-washed Singhu border, Seechewal while backing the farmers agitation, took up the issues of depleting groundwater, crop diversification and organic farming in the state. While it was Seechewal’s first visit, jathas from his village have been heading to Delhi since the protests started.While a bevy of politicians, activists and leaders have been heading to the site, Seechewal is the first to bring up the issue of organic farming from the main stage of the protests.Raising organic farming decibels at Singhu, Seechewal said, “Punjab farmers have filled the country’s granaries with grains but lost their own water resources. Punjab’s soil and air have been polluted. The state is in the throes of a crippling water crisis. Cancer is spreading rapidly across villages. Only organic farming can ensure we leave a healthy state for our coming generations. The governments will not frame policies which will facilitate farmers to take organic and cooperative farming. Community farming will only succeed when the foundational structure of cooperative farming is strengthened.”He also appealed the Modi-led government to agree to their demands. Addressing farmers’ groups from the main stage at the Singhu border, Seechewal, who is credited with reviving the dying Holy Kali Bein at Sultanpur Lodhi, appealed to farm union leaders to encourage farmers to take up organic farming.Notably, Seechewal had also been aiding farmers with various boats from his dera pressed into service during the Punjab floods. While the environmentalist had also been working with farmers from Shahkot and Lohian belt to strengthen the bandh to prevent floods in future, the bandh’s work was kept on hold ever since the farmers’ agitation started as all cultivators from the region headed to Delhi.At Singhu, Seechewal visited along with followers from his dera bringing essentials which were disbursed among protesting farmers. Notably, the environmentalist had been sending rations and supplies and jathas from his village, including kabaddi players and the village sarpanch had also been setting up langars ever since the stir began.

07-01-2021||Chandigarh||Repeal farm laws, Capt Amarinder urges PM Modi||Stressing that there was nothing wrong with the demands of the farmers, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately repeal the new farm laws in order to resolve the crisis.Categorically rejecting as “highly irresponsible” reports in a section of the media that Punjab had already implemented the new laws, the Chief Minister said Food Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu’s statement had been mischievously twisted by one newspaper, with others picking it up.Punjab was the first state to have opposed the Central farm laws and, in fact, passed amendment Bills to negate their dangerous impact on agriculture, he pointed out, slamming the AAP for “spreading misinformation on the issue with its propaganda machinery”. He said, “The Governor should have forwarded our Bills to the President for assent, which he has not done.”The Chief Minister, in a media interview, made it clear that Punjab would not allow the lives of its farmers be ruined by the new laws. “We will do whatever possible to help the farmers and their families, for whom the state government had already started two helplines on which they can reach out in case of any emergency,” he said.Urging the Prime Minister to withdraw the controversial laws and talk to the farmers, Captain Amarinder said, “The farmers have made their stand very clear — that the laws should be repealed. It is the job of the Government of India to listen to them.” The Centre could bring in new laws after due consultation with the farmers, he said, pointing out that the Constitution had been amended many times and it could be done again for the revocation of the recently enacted farm legislations.Noting that farmers from across the country had joined the protests against the farm laws, Captain Amarinder said after six or seven meetings, it was time that the matter was resolved.The Chief Minister lambasted those calling the protesting farmers as “Naxals and terrorists”, terming it as wrong and irresponsible.
07-01-2021||Chandigarh||Murder bid charge in dung dump case withdrawn||Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today ordered withdrawal of Section 307 against protesting farmers who dumped cow dung outside an ex-BJP minister’s house.Capt Amarinder, who also holds the Home portfolio, has also ordered transfer of the SHO who had registered the “attempt to murder” case, which is now being probed by a Special Investigation Team (SIT).The CM said the SHO had gone overboard in registering a case under Section 307 of the IPC. “There was no attempt to murder,” he said, referring to the Hoshiarpur incident in which a group of protesters had unloaded a trailer full of cow dung in front of former Punjab minister Tikshan Sud’s residence.Meanwhile, the Chief Minister has termed as correct and justified the arrest of Punjabi singer Shree Brar for promoting gun culture in a music video. “Promoting gangsterism and gun culture in this manner is absolutely wrong,” he said, adding that the case had been registered correctly in the matter, which related to an old song of the singer. — TNS
07-01-2021||Amritsar/Muktsar||Tractor marches across Punjab||A tractor march was organised by residents of the Vallah area in Amritsar to spread awareness about the farmers’ cause and their call for conducting a tractor rally in Delhi on January 26 against the farm laws.On the other hand, supporting the farmers’ movement, Sikh outfit Dal Khalsa today declared that their activists would burn the copies of the controversial laws on Lohri and participate in the tractor parade in Delhi.Prof Sardara Singh, who accompanied the tractor march, said the parade had been organised as a protest against the ill-conceived anti-farmer policies of the Centre. “It is a pity that crores of rupees have been siphoned off by the so-called bigwigs who took shelter on foreign soil with impunity whereas the farmer, who fills the food basket of the nation, has been fighting for his right to get MSP on his produce,” he said.In Muktsar, a large number of farmers took out a tractor march. The march passed through various markets. Meanwhile, the commission agents welcomed the farmers in the grain market and promised full support. The farmers appealed to everyone to support them in their ongoing protest against the Centre over the contentious farm laws.A similar march was carried out by the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Sidhupur) in the villages of Khuyiansarwer sub-tehsil in Abohar. Convener Gunwant Singh said the march was carried out to mobilise maximum number of farmers for participation in the protest, which was to be organised by farmers organisations’ joint front in Delhi on January 26. The tractor march started from Panjawa village and passed through Tootwala, Kallarkhera, Maujgarh, Gidderanwali, Dalmirkhera, Daulatpura, Khuyiansarwer, Telupura, Haripura and Diwankhera villages. Farmers greeted the participants and served fruits and snacks to them.
07-01-2021||Patiala||Farmers to protest land acquisition for  expressway in Patiala||Members of the Delhi-Katra Expressway Sangharsh Committee today said they would hold a protest march here against the acquisition of land for the project. During their first press conference at the Patiala media club in the city, they said they had decided that they would not give their lands for the project, as construction of the highway would be detrimental for farmers.Sukhdev Singh Dhillon, state president of the committee, said the expressway would be constructed for transportation of industrialists’ goods from their godowns. “The government wants to acquire lands of farmers at low rates for the benefit of the industrialists without rehabilitating the farmers. Trees will be razed along with houses. We are not allowing private surveyors to come to our villages. We are willing to talk with the government only after the farmers’ protest in Delhi comes to an end.”The farmers said they had met several ministers and MLAs in this regard. “We also met PWD Minister Vijay Inder Singla and expressed our concerns, but we have not received any response. Now, after a number of press conferences, we will soon decide the date of the protest march in Patiala. Further steps will be decided after talks with farmers’ unions protesting at the Delhiborders,” Dhillon said.
07-01-2021||Patiala||Youth mobilise support for tractor rally on Republic Day via social media||Youth in several villages are connecting through social media and phone calls, while some are convening meetings. The purpose is to ensure that youth in large numbers reach the Delhi borders before the Republic Day, when farmer unions plan to hold a tractor rally in the National Capital.Last week, farm unions had announced that thousands of protesting farmers would enter Delhi on January 26 and carry out a tractor parade if the three controversial laws were not repealed.Unions, youth, farmers, labourers, arhtiyas and landlords are mobilising support for making the January 26 rally a success.Congress leader Mansimrat Singh Riar said, “We are reaching out to everyone. We stand in solidarity with our elderly people, who have been sitting on fast in Delhi.”He dismissed the BJP’s claims of the agitation being politically motivated. “First and foremost, I belong to the farming community. Politics takes a backseat when it comes to farmers’ struggle. This protest is of every farmer, who has been toiling hard in fields,” said Riar, who has spent a few days at the Delhi border.For Ludhiana’s Baddowal resident Tarandeep Singh Grewal, the agitation has given him an opportunity to keep the youth of his area involved. He was doing his bit by keeping them informed about the ground reality of the protest at the Delhi borders.“I, along with some other villagers, have been meeting youngsters and farmers who own tractors. We plan to reach the Delhi borders two days before the proposed tractor rally. However, I do hope that the matter is resolved soon and our brothers and sisters protesting in this biting cold return home. In case we need to go, we are ready. The tractor rally will be historic and apolitical,” he said.Not only Punjab residents, but farmers and labourers, who live near the Patiala-Samana border in Haryana, are also supporting the agitation.
07-01-2021||Amritsar||Politics behind Diljit’s criticism, says Navjot Sidhu||Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu today expressed solidarity with actor-singer Diljit Dosanjh who has been supporting the farmers contesting the agricultural laws at the Delhi borders.On Diljit’ 37th birthday, Sidhu tweeted his feelings, saying, “Every Punjabi stands by Diljit Dosanjh with pride and all those criticising him are mostly computer bots with no following. It is much better to be loved by a sea of humanity and rule hearts than be criticised by politically motivated puppet robots, who troll baselessly.” — TNS

Instead of organising seminars or any other function to remember him, all organisations decided to join hands and organise a protest-cum-chetna (awareness) march he re to support farmers.”Prof Anit Gupta, one of the protesters, said: “The Centre has introduced some draconian laws without consulting farmers. The economic fabric of the state is at stake, so they want the government to reconsider these laws by taking public opinion.”He said what hurt the most was the “apathetic and irresponsible” attitude ofthe government towards farmers. — TNS
07-01-2021||Patiala||YAD: Singer arrested for writing ‘kisan anthem’||The Youth Akali Dal (YAD) today alleged that Punjabi singer and lyricist Shree Brar was arrested and tortured by the state government on the directions of Union Home Minister Amit Shah as a punishment for writing the “kisan anthem”.Terming the arrest, torture and subsequent isolation of Shree Brar by the Patiala police as vindictive and against policing norms, YAD president Parambans Singh Romana said the singer had given a major boost to the “kisan andolan” by penning a song that had becomeits unofficial anthem.“The song “Swaraja piche barigate paaye hoi ne” inspired lakhs of people to join the movement, which was not liked by the Centre as well as the Home Ministry. This is why Shree Brar has been singled out for punishment with relation to another song he wrote a month ago,” Romana said. — TNS
07-01-2021||Jalandhar||Anxiety palpable among farm labourers as impasse continues||Israil (45) from Purnia district in Bihar is having only one conversation with his fellow farm labourers these days and that is the impact of agricultural laws. He doesn’t know anything in detail but believes in one thing: If farmers suffer, he will too. Israil has been coming to Punjab to work in the fields for the past 20 years.He is working with farmer Rupinder Singh in Mirpur Maari village. Many labourers are looking after the fields of farmers and have started fearing for their future.Israil said the Covid lockdown and farm stir had an adverse impact on them. “I don’t know how we will feed our families. We get paid by the farmers and if they will not be given their dues, who will give us ours?” he said.Rupinder said already big machines had limited the need of labourers in fields. “Now they ask me what will happen when big companies step in and machines replace everything?” he said. Another farm labourer Munna Paswan said, “If no one will buy the farmer’s produce, how will he pay us? We support farmers.” Nakodar-based farmer Sukhwant Singh said anxiety was palpable among the labourers.
07-01-2021||---||Gurdaspur villages bury hatchet to fight ‘common enemy’||Dera Baba Nanak, January 6Personal enmities, decades-old family feuds, property disputes and political differences have been pushed aside by warring villagers to ward off the common enemy — the “black” farm laws.Crime rate down, say policePolice officers said the crime rate had dropped significantly as peasants were engaged in a rare show of camaraderie and comradeship. “Historically, December and January are months when disputes and crimes are regularly reported from villages. There have been 65 per cent fewer FIRs registered last December as compared to the corresponding period in 2019,” said Rajinder Singh Sohal, Gurdaspur SSPIn almost all 1,200-odd villages of Gurdaspur district, and observers say in the entire Punjab, seven to 11- member committees have been constituted solely to ensure that the work of farmers protesting at the Delhi borders does not suffer.Caste lines, too, stand blurred. Old-timers say this is a unique phenomenon, something which has “rarely been witnessed in the past”.“The last time any adversity glued villagers together was the 1971 war. Farmers then had buried their differences and took comfort in each other amid high decibel noises of shells,” said Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Cabinet Minister and local MLA.He cites the example of a family in Ransika Mira village of his Assembly segment, whose loyalty to the Akalis is well-known. “This family abhors Congressmen. The war against the farm laws has changed things. Now the same family is irrigating the wheat crop of its known adversary, who is camping in Delhi. It is in times like these that we discover who we are and what we are made of,” said Randhawa. He said similar reports flowed in from other villages.Cabinet Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa recounts how his party men are helping farmers owing allegiance to the Akalis by loading and then transporting their sugarcane crop to the Paniyar sugar mill. “Villagers have joined hands knowing well that if they don’t, they will perish. The other day, a dyed-in-the-wool Congress worker took out his tractor-trailer and transported the sugarcane harvest of his political rival to the mill,” said Bajwa.
07-01-2021||Chandigarh||Finance Minister blames technical glitch for salary delay||Defending the delay in releasing the salary of state government employees, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal today said despite the financial constraints, the state had not made any deductions in the salaries of its employees, and had ensured that it was disbursed on time.He said, “Amid pandemic, many states had deducted salaries of their employees, but we never resorted to any such measures.”On being asked about the delay in releasing salaries, he said, “The salaries were delayed on a few occasions due to technical reasons. When we switched over from the TCS to the NIC software — the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) — for approval and disbursal of salary, there was a technical glitch, which caused the delay. Also, the salary of a certain department was withheld on some occasions, which resulted in the delay as they had failed to provide us the details of employees.”However, Davinder Singh Punia, state president, Democratic Teachers’ Front, said, “On an average, the salary has been delayed for two to five days for teaching and non-teaching staff since October.”Meanwhile, highlighting various reforms undertaken by the Finance Department, Manpreet said the state had not gone into overdraft for even a single day in the current financial year. The state remained in overdraft for 179 days in 2016-17, 100 days in 2017-18, 63 days in 2018-19 and 47 days in 2019-20. There had been interest saving of nearly Rs 10.75 crore in 2017-18, Rs 21.7 crore in 2018-19 and Rs 5 crore in 2019-20.The present government took over at the time when the RBI had shut down the state treasury, that too at the end of financial year from March 29, 2017, to March 31, 2018, he added. The government avails immediate cash from the RBI at the existing repo rate under the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) facility. However, it has to return it within 90 days. If the WMA exceeds 90 days, it is treated as overdraft.He said the department manually built its own cash forecasting methodology for better management of state finances. The state had started investing in the consolidated sinking fund to pre-emptively mitigate the rollover risk or reinvestment risk, he said.
07-01-2021||Chandigarh||Soon, online database of govt property||The government will soon introduce GPMS (Government Property Management System), a web-based application for creating a single database of properties, including land and buildings, owned by the government in its various departments. This will make a ready database of infrastructure available with the government and assist it in making better policy decisions for optimum utilisation of infrastructure.“At the moment, we don’t have any database of government properties. In fact, we don’t know how many buildings or land we own across the state. So, we are creating a web-based application which will be launched in a month or two that will enable us to know the details of properties at the click of a button,” said Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal at a press meet on the achievements of the government.He said the database would help in optimum utilisation of resources. He said for expenditure rationalisation, the state shifted 470 government offices from private to government buildings, which led to annual savings of Rs 6.42 crore. — TNS

School Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla said after reopening schools, online learning would continue to be the preferred mode of teaching and attendance would not be mandatory. TNSThe study, conducted in hospitals by the Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, and the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, has revealed that while the risk of exposure through airborne transmission in closed rooms is higher if more infected persons are present, in normal situation the virus is not found more than four feet away from an infected person.After 14 days, UK returnee dischargedPatiala: After waiting for around 14 days for the test result of the new Covid strain of a UK returnee, the Patiala Health Department discharged the patient. The patient had already completed the mandatory 14-day isolation. The patient had already raised questions over the untimely delay in the report from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. The department had sent the sample to the NIV to confirm whether the patient was carrying a mutated strain or not. TNSThe transmission of SARS-CoV2 was initially believed to be mainly through close contact and fluid droplets sprayed while coughing, sneezing or speaking. Some studies also reported transmission among people who were suitably distanced but were present at the same time in enclosed spaces like a room or a vehicle.Final vaccine dry run in all districts todayLudhiana: Moving another step towards Covid vaccination rollout, which is likely to begin next week, another dry run to check the systems and processes put in place will be held in all 22 districts of the state on Friday. The one-day mock exercise will be the third and final trial after successful dry runs already conducted in Ludhiana, Nawanshahr and Patiala recently, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, Hussan Lal, told The Tribune on Wednesday. TNSResearchers collected 64 air samples from different locations in six hospitals in Chandigarh and Hyderabad and another 17 samples from closed rooms occupied by infected people who were without masks and asked to speak to each other. Four samples taken from Covid wards of hospitals and one from the closed room were found to contain the virus. The virus was not detected in any of the non-Covid areas.According to the research, the virus could not be picked up at a distance of even four feet when Covid-positive persons spent a short time of about 20 minutes in the room, suggesting that short duration of exposure may not put an individual at high risk. Samples collected at eight feet and 12 feet were also negative.

Announcing only to contest from Ward No. 28 on Monday, Pakka had also joined the Bathinda Social Group. The cases were registered against him in 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020. He was stealing power for domestic use. He owes a fine of Rs 7 lakh for electricity theft. TNSThough a formal announcement of the schedule for conduct of the elections is still awaited, the government would be writing to the state Election Commission after Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh takes a call on the file moved by the Local Government Department.Some Deputy Commissioners have reportedly been asked to make arrangements for smooth conduct of the civic body polls, as issues related to delimitation of wards in some of the civic bodies were being sorted out.Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief Sunil Jakhar, who has started holding meetings of party observers to sort out friction among the aspiring candidates, said: “The party is ready to go to the polls. As per my knowledge, the elections should be held in February.”He, however, said there were issues related to reservation of wards and efforts were being made to sort out differences among different groups. “The entire exercise of shortlisting the party candidates has to be completed by January 15,” Jakhar said.The BJP had recently written to the Punjab Governor to postpone the civic body polls citing the law and order situation. The Chief Minister was quick to hit back at the BJP for making a frivolous ground of law and order situation as it was trying to divert attention from the farmers’ agitation.Last month, the CM had convened a luncheon meeting of his Council of Ministers to decide the conduct of the civic body polls. “With almost four years of governance and General Election due in 2022, the civic body polls will be a litmus test for the Congress government in urban areas and the right time to take on the BJP,” said a senior party leader.Meanwhile, Congress leader and Bathinda Market Committee chairman Mohan Lal Jhumba’s security has allegedly been withdrawn. Sources said Jhumba had objected to the MC ticket distribution for Bathinda at a party meeting in Chandigarh on Tuesday.

Her counsel had claimed that the complainant was married to the petitioner’s younger brother in October 2011, while her marriage was solemnised in November 2005. Since then, she had been residing in Bahadurgarh in Haryana, around 300 km away.The counsel said she was not given any share in the family property in a partition soon after the complainant’s marriage because of the prevalent customs that everything goes to the sons.He said she would have asked her father or brothers for her share when the partition took place, if she was nursing greed for properties/money. As such, there was no occasion for her either to demand dowry from the complainant or instigate her brother to maltreat her.Justice Sangwan asserted the Supreme Court had repeatedly held it was common tendency to involve the family, especially the married sister-in-laws, to exert pressure, while registering an FIR for breach of trust and cruelty.“The fact was not appreciated by the Additional Sessions Judge. Therefore, it calls for an explanation as to how the anticipatory bail application of the petitioner was dismissed,” he said. Justice Sangwan asked the judge to carefully read the entire FIR and the partition deed before submitting an explanation.The judge was asked to explain whether the petitioner’s marriage was performed five years prior to the complainant’s wedding and that too at a place about 300 km away, and whether there was an occasion for her to demand dowry from the complainant after nine years, if she did not raise claim over the family property.
