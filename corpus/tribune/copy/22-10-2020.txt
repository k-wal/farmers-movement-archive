22-10-2020||Chandigarh||Harish Rawat says role for Sidhu in Punjab, calls him Cong’s Rafale||AICC general secretary Harish Rawat on Thursday indicated a “role” for Navjot Singh Sidhu in Punjab where polls are due in a little over a year and called the leader, who has been staying away from party activities after resigning as cabinet minister last year, as Congress’ Rafale.Rawat, who is the party’s in-charge of Punjab affairs, said the Congress MLA’s worst critic cannot deny his usefulness while indicating that there were no differences between the cricketer-turned-politician and Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.Sidhu had on October 4 taken part in a ‘tractor rally’ against Centre’s farm laws in Moga in the presence of party leader Rahul Gandhi, Amarinder Singh and other leaders after Rawat met him at his residence in Amritsar.Sidhu had been at loggerheads with Amarinder Singh and resigned as cabinet minister soon after he was stripped off key portfolios in the cabinet reshuffle in June last year.This week, he attended the state assembly session after a long gap and drew praise from party leaders, including Amarinder Singh and Harish Rawat, for his speech when the Congress government had moved a resolution and brought bills against the Centre’s new farm laws.Punjab Assembly during its special session had on Tuesday passed four bills and adopted a resolution to counter the farm laws.“At the national level too, he is a very useful person. I had recently said he is like a Rafale in our armoury,” Rawat said comparing Sidhu to the French multirole fighter aircraft.“In the state too, he has his usefulness and even his worst critic cannot deny that. In politics, it happens that many people sometimes do not like you, but because of your usefulness they have to accept that fact, this is politics. So, between all this, we will find a role for him and at an appropriate time,” Rawat, the former chief minister of Uttarakhand, told reporters here.On Tuesday, Rawat had participated in Sidhu’s birthday celebrations and also brought a cake for him.“I would like to bless Sidhu for the way he spoke in the Vidhan Sabha and appreciated Capt Amarinder Singh,” he said.Rawat also praised the chief minister saying, “He invited Sidhu to speak after him (on resolution/farm bills), this shows he kept his confidence in him.”“I have seen Captain Amarinder’s work culture. Recently on farmers’ issue, I saw how he got everyone involved... I have also learnt some new things from him,” he said.On a question related to Amarinder Singh’s bete noire and senior leaders—Pratap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo—Rawat said, “They are pillars of our party. Nothing can be created by demolishing the pillars.”Commenting on the amendment bills of the state to counter Centres’ farm laws, Rawat said, “We have clearly indicated our intention to private buyers that they cannot purchase below the MSP (minimum support price). We have strengthened that shield”.Attacking the Centre over the laws, he said, “Farmers’ apprehensions about MSP, mandi system and procurement system are not unfounded, that is why they want Centre’s guarantee on MSP.”“We feel the fight is not only for MSP but saving the country’s federal structure. In one stroke, they (Centre) snatched state’s right to impose tax. Then they made laws on agriculture, which is a state subject. Slowly, they are encroaching on the rights of the states,” he added.Rawat also attacked Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, saying, “He should not make statements to criticise what Punjab has done to counter Centre’s farm laws. Rather, he should get his own bills to show where he stands on the issue of farm laws.”To a query, he said Punjab Congress’ organisational structure, which was dissolved earlier this year, will be finalised over the next fortnight or so.“I have already visited Amritsar, Jalandhar, Sangrur, Patiala and Derabassi and will be touring two-three districts more to take feedback,” he said, adding the revamped structure will have his stamp of approval. Meanwhile, hitting out at the BJP-led government in Uttarakhand, he alleged that it has failed on all fronts.“BJP has failed in providing a sensitive government. There is no development and unemployment has risen. This government has failed on all fronts,” Rawat said, adding that people from the hill state are missing the good governance of the previous Congress regime. — PTI

If you were so keen to make it legal why did your party not do so for the 55 years it was in power....who stopped you from making it legal, including it in the Act,” Nadda said accusing Congress of “fueling agitation because they know nothing except politics”. Nadda said the same party de-notified fruits and vegetables out of the APMC in 2014 and mentioned in their 2019 manifesto that they said they would make trade of agriculture produce, including exports, etc. free from all restrictions.Reiterating the party's oft-repeated assurance about the MSP, the BJP president said subsequent governments remained indifferent towards farmers but Prime Minister Narendra Modi changed that by implementing several pro-farmer programmes.With the three new agricultural Acts continuing to pose a challenge, the party has tasked ministers, MPs, spokespersons and local leaders to reach out and spread the message about their benefits among farmers and general public.A number of farmers’ leaders and organisations of BJP are also engaged in the job.  Farmers of 360 villages of Delhi on Thursday presented a note of thanks to Prime Minister Modi for bringing the agricultural laws.While general secretary Tarun Chugh is holding meetings with farmers in villages of Punjab, spokesperson Sambit Patra has also been entrusted with the responsibility of communicating with farmers’ leaders and organisations and establishing the party-line, say sources.A liaison committee of eight members has been formed, they add.Meanwhile, party leaders also claim that eventually the Punjab Government will have to “withdraw the counter Bills”.

They told us that thousands of paddy filled trucks from UP were heading towards Punjab. We have detained the drivers and operators and will not let them go unless police files FIR against the suppliers and the mill owners who ordered this illegal consignment,” he said.“After going through documents, we found that one of the truck operators managed to reach here without proper documentation. This proves the whole administrative and police machinery is involved in this illegal trading,” he said.Also read: MSP system under question after official-trader nexus comes to light in PunjabDilbagh Singh, who owned 10 acres of land, claimed that 1509 variety of paddy lot had been lying at his home for the want of buyers.He said that the paddy was being supplied illegally to “kill the Punjab’s mandi system” and make way for invasion of corporate houses.“In UP, the open market culture, against which we all have been protesting here, prevailed for long. Due to this, the farmers and traders look to selling their produce outside their state,” he said.Elaborating further, another agitating farmer Harjit Singh said that in UP, the paddy was available for Rs 900-1,200 per quintal, whereas in Amritsar mandi the minimum rate is between Rs 1,788-1,888 per quintal.“Going by the difference in procurement price (between Rs 500-700 per quintal), one truck load of paddy would fetch a profit of between Rs 2 lakh-Rs 2.5 lakh,” he said.Another farmer and press secretary of the Kirti Kisan Union Jaswinder Singh Chhina said that the quality of the UP produced crop was quite inferior to what was produced in Punjab.Truck driver Santosh Kumar, who hails from Aligarh, meanwhile, said that they were being harassed unnecessarily. “Neither the supplying firm in Aligarh is picking up the phone nor the receiver here. We have got stuck,” he said.

22-10-2020||Chandigarh||Will reject central farm acts after SAD forms govt in Punjab: Sukhbir Badal||SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday said his party will not allow implementation of the Centre’s farm laws when it comes to power in Punjab.Badal, who presided over a core committee meeting here, also said that it was the duty of the government to ensure that farmers’ produce was procured at the minimum support price for all 22 crops.“We have been demanding that the assured marketing at MSP must not only continue but it should also be expanded to cover all the 22 listed crops. When SAD forms a government in the state, we will ensure that this demand is converted into an achievement,” he said.“When the SAD forms government in the state, we will totally reject and block the implementation of (PM Narendra) Modi’s anti-farmer acts in Punjab, declare the entire state a principal market area and repeal the APMC Act 2017 enacted by (Chief Minister) Amarinder Singh,” Badal said here.He said the members of opposition were shocked to see how the chief minister had allegedly defrauded Punjab by “betraying” the unanimous resolution passed by the assembly.“This resolution mentioned that it outrightly rejected the Centre’s acts and committed the state government to declaring Punjab a principal market area. But Bills which were subsequently brought by the Amarinder government carried none of these provisions. He is guilty of misleading and betraying the trust of the House,” Badal alleged in a statement.He further claimed that farmers’ bodies have rejected the Bills brought by the Punjab government in the assembly to negate the central farm laws.      The Punjab Assembly on Tuesday had adopted a resolution rejecting the Centre’s new farm laws and passed four Bills, it said, will counter the contentious legislation enacted by Parliament. PTI
22-10-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||MSP system under question after official-trader nexus comes to light in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 22The release of purported chat between a district manager of the PUNSUP and a trader regarding allowing the sale of paddy procured at lower rates from outside Punjab to procurement agencies at the higher Minimum Support Price (MSP) has exposed the misuse of the MSP system in the state by some unscrupulous dealers to make quick profits.Some traders in the state are buying paddy at Rs 1,100- Rs 1,200 per quintal from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. They then transport it to Punjab, and after tying up with officials in mandis, procurement agencies and commission agents, fake records are made to show the paddy was procured from local farmers. The produce is then procured at the MSP, which is Rs 1,888 this year.In the chat, which has now gone viral, the district manager of the PUNSUP at Patiala discuses how much he should be paid by the commission agent to allow the entry of paddy bought from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar at Rs 1,100-Rs 1,200 per quintal, to be sold to government procurement agencies at Rs 1,888 per quintal.The chat also talks about having an inspector of the traders’ choice posted in the Patiala Mandi.The PUNSUP official in the chat also talks of negotiating the bribe with the trader, saying it has to be shared with the minister and for organising the visit of former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who had come here earlier this month. The chat is claimed to be of October 4.Since this chat became viral, the official has been placed under suspension by the Food and Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and proceedings to dismiss him from service have been initiated.The minister has denied any role in the controversy, and says his name is being misused. “The moment I learnt of it, I suspended him showing zero tolerance to such frauds,” he said.The now suspended official has also approached the police, claiming that it is a “fake” chat.The revelation has come at a time when Punjab Vidhan Sabha has passed three Bills, which among others makes buying of crops at MSP mandatory.The expose is now being used by the BJP-led Centre to point at the chinks in the MSP system for buying foodgrains, and the need for replacing it with the laws enacted by the Parliament last month – allowing private purchase of grains outside the mandis.Sources in the Food and Supplies Department and the PUNSUP say that the practice of buying cheaper paddy from states, where MSP on crops is not given, and selling them to government agencies here at the MSP, has been going on for quite some time.“No wonder, the paddy bought in Punjab in each procurement season is more than the paddy produced in the state,” a PUNSUP official said requesting anonymity. “Last year, 11.82 lakh tonnes of paddy, over and above the production of 152 lakh metric tonnes, was recorded.”KAP Sinha, Principal Secretary, Food and Supplies, said that the department had asked the police to register cases against illegal transportation of paddy into the state.“Around 200 trucks have been seized and action initiated against unscrupulous dealers, while a similar number of trucks are being examined. I have written to all District Managers to keep a strict vigil and seek police help wherever an anomaly is detected,” he said.

Later, they were released.Talking to reporters, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Som Parkash said the protest rally was organised against the alleged multi-crore post-matric Scheduled Caste scholarship scam and "atrocities" on Dalits."We wanted to wake up the state government from its slumber on these issues through this rally," Parkash said.Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma said the party will continue to fight till the SC community gets justice.Former Union minister Vijay Sampla said that stopping the BJP's protest rally was “unconstitutional”.BJP leaders had been demanding a CBI probe into the alleged scholarship scam in which the name of minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot had figured.After the allegations of Rs 64 crore misappropriation in the SC scholarship scheme had surfaced, the chief minister had directed the chief secretary to conduct a thorough enquiry.The chief secretary's report, based on the findings of the three-member panel of IAS officers led by Food Secretary KAP Sinha, had exonerated Dharamsot. — With PTI inputs

Farmer leaders said passenger trains would not be allowed to run. The rail roko programme would continue till November 5 and they would be meeting again on that day to chalk out the future course of action.As the agitation at the Buttari railway station entered the 21st day on Wednesday, the farmers passed a resolution demanding action against those smuggling paddy from Uttar Pardesh and other states.The protesters said traders in UP and Bihar were purchasing paddy at half of the MSP and then smuggling it into Punjab and Haryana, where the crop was again sold at the MSP.“The practice is not in the interest of farmers as during the data calculation, the paddy from UP is added to the total produce from Punjab. It gives inflated figures about per acre yield in our fields,” said farmer leaders.Meanwhile, the protest at toll plazas and petrol pumps operated by Reliance Group continues. As the toll operators have closed the fast tag intersections, long queues of vehicles can be seen on slip roads alongside the toll barriers.Though most farmer organisations have hailed the state Assembly’s move of passing three Bills to counter the farm laws enacted by the Union Government last month, some unions, especially the Kirti Kisan Union, have expressed dissatisfaction claiming that the state government’s laws are “toothless and will not benefit farmers in large”.

Inside the House, after the first Bill on vesting of proprietary rights was tabled and came up for discussion, Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot got up to thank the Chief Minister. He was interrupted by Akali MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu. As the slanging match between Akali MLAs and the Congress MLAs turned ugly, the former stormed in the well of the House to protest. Later, they staged a walkout.Dharamsot was also targeted by AAP. However, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh said the inquiry conducted by an officers committee had found nothing against the minister.Later, as the Punjab Vigilance Commission Bill came up for discussion, AAP MLA Aman Arora got up to speak. He wanted that his suggestions on amending the Bill should be included, which was not allowed by the Speaker.This led to acrimonious scenes in the House as Leader of Opposition Harpal Cheema intervened and demanded that leader of Opposition and a representative of Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court be included in the Commission. On being disallowed to speak, he accused the Speaker Rana KP Singh of favouring the treasury benches and muzzling the voice of Opposition. This led to many Congress MLAs storming the well of the House and demanding his apology. Irate, AAP MLAs walked out of the House after raising slogans against the government.When the Punjab (Welfare and Settlement of Landless, Marginal and Small Occupant Farmers) Allotment of State Government Land Bill was tabled, Akali MLA NK Sharma and rebel AAP MLA Sukhpal Khaira accused two ministers and some MLAs of illegally occupying land by arm twisting land laws.Cotton growers ignored: AAP MLABathinda Rural MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby on Wednesday said the Bills only talked about wheat and paddy and ignored 21 other crops. “Cotton belt farmers have been completely ignored in the Bills,” the MLA said, adding she raised the issue of non-expeditious procurement by the CCI in Bathinda.SAD legislators slam lunch inviteAs the ruling Congress government invited all legislators for lunch, SAD MLAs boycotted it, saying there was nothing to celebrate. The AAP MLAs could not attend the lunch as they had staged a walk-out during the session when the Speaker made an announcement regarding lunch.Cong plans ‘Thank you Captain’ driveWith focus on Captain Amarinder Singh’s intent and ability to take pro-farmer decisions, the party is launching an awareness campaign at the village-level “Thank you Captain” .

He added: “All this is being done under a conspiracy between the state government and the Centre… with no responsibility for purchase of the crop.”Majithia asked how the state government would help the farmer if the private player and the Centre didn’t buy the crop at MSP.He said the Bills had created new problems for the farmers as their sale below MSP would be “invalid” and they couldn’t claim payment if the buyer backed out.

Why did they support and vote for our Bills?” asked Captain Amarinder, reacting to SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia and AAP leadership’s statements. They had both accused the Chief Minister of misleading the people, citing his remarks on the possibility of the Governor/President not signing the Bills.“If I had to fool the people, why would I openly talk about the possible scenarios instead of feeding them with lies, as the Akalis and AAP are used to doing?” Capt asked.The Chief Minister reiterated he didn’t not care if the Centre dismissed his government, but he would fight to protect the rights of the farmers till his last breath. — TNS

This is merely wishful thinking with the eyes on 2022 elections.”Mann said, “the battle has begun but we have a long way to go to win it.”

But with passing amendments to the Centre’s agricultural laws, Punjab had given a voice to the concerns at the national level, he said. “I hope the Centre respects the voice of the common man and finds an amicable way forward,” Rawat said while talking to The Tribune.Hitting out at the BJP, Rawat said the saffron party was damaging the atmosphere in the state for the sake of vote bank consolidation. He said the agenda of the BJP was polarisation of votes by vitiating the peaceful atmosphere and blaming the protesting farmers for the same.Meanwhile, Rawat said Sidhu’s speech in the Assembly has energised the party cadre. As Capt Amarinder and Sidhu address each other as brothers, the way forward was that both should go together, he said, adding, “Though I am a younger brother of the Chief Minister, I feel that it should be his concern to make all leaders walk with him. Sidhu has shown the patience for the last one-and-a-half years.” He termed the appointment of Sidhu as the state president or his induction into the Cabinet as media speculation.

22-10-2020||Patiala||Stubble burning: Dip in air quality takes toll on villagers’ health||With a rise in stubble burning incidents, air quality has dropped sharply in the countryside and villagers are facing health problems.The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has about 48 manual machines to record air quality, with 24 located in villages. The machines put air quality in the “poor to very poor” category in terms of particulate matter. The data compiled from the manual stations, a majority of them in rural Punjab, shows that air quality is deteriorating.The Tribune revealed air quality in majority of the villages had deteriorated from “moderate” to “poor” in the past month following a rise in fire incidents.Each year air quality in the state deteriorates after paddy is harvested, but the PPCB has “no mechanism to record the air quality index (AQI) and get real-time data in villages” where a majority of the stubble is burnt.The data compiled by the manual machines installed confirmed that the pollution-level was high in villages, especially in winter.For the past few years, the state is banking on modern air monitoring stations located in Ludhiana, Khanna, Mandi Gobindgarh, Patiala, Amritsar and Jalandhar which give accurate real-time AQI data. However, none of these five stations are located in rural Punjab, where most of the stubble is burnt.A senior PPCB official said an AQI station required an investment of Rs 1 crore in addition to the running cost.A senior official claimed that there was no denying fact that the date from the manual stations in villages was alarmingly high as the wind speed was low and the farmers continued to burn stubble.“The manual machines record air quality every alternate day and its average reading can be hit in case of a thunderstorm or stubble being burnt nearby,” he added.Confirming the developments, PPCB member-secretary Karunesh Garg said the pollutants in villages were high due to residue from paddy flying in the air and also due to residue from grain markets impacting the air quality.“Villagers in the state are more prone to fall sick due to the poor AQI and it is high time they shun stubble burning completely as it is impacting their health,” he said.

After verifying facts, the SSP wrote a letter to the DGP requesting him that Hardeep with belt number 47 should be considered for the award.“I am holding a probe to ascertain the truth. How can a non-deserving candidate replace a deserving one? I know of Hardeep’s tales of valour and was stunned to discover that his name was not in the list. The Army had awarded him with the ‘Sena Medal’ for individual acts of exceptional devotion to duty,” said the SSP.

22-10-2020||---||Haryana BJP chief Dhankar takes on Punjab for passing ‘restrictive’ farm Bills||Chandigarh, October 21Haryana BJP chief OP Dhankar today criticised the Punjab Government for passing “restrictive” farm Bills in its state assembly and said farmers, instead of being free, would find themselves in a bind.Addressing a press conference here today, Dhankar said the provision of punishing a trader or a company with imprisonment and fine would be to the disadvantage of the farmer and could be open to misuse.“If a farmer decides not to sell all his produce and decides to hold on to it for a better price and the market falls, any buyer taking the produce would either have to buy it at the MSP or face punishment. In such a situation, the farmer will be stuck with his stock,” Dhankar said.He added that either the government should open shops where it can be the last buyer of such leftover produce or this would go against the farmer. “If the Punjab Government does not make a provision of such shops, that means the government is only making empty promises. Also, it is against the farmers’ interest,” Dhankar stated.Maintaining that a lot of buying and selling was trust-based, he said the traders, sometimes, picked up the produce and released payments to farmers well beforehand. “The farmer, in such a case, can easily claim he was compelled to sell his produce. So, the Bills from Punjab have opened the possibility of registration of FIRs,” he claimed.Further, he said the Punjab Government had not taken any responsibility for buying of produce other than wheat and paddy. “The Punjab CM has passed a law for something that is purchased by the Centre. Punjab gives nothing for purchase of wheat and paddy, which is procured by the Centre. The Bills are silent on the purchase of crops such as maize, bajra and mustard, which the state government should purchase just like neighbouring Haryana buys these. The government has chosen to stay silent on this issue,” he added.PM’s effigy burntKurukshetra: Farmers under the banner of the BKU (Charuni) held a demonstration in Shahabad on Wednesday in protest against the three controversial farm laws and ‘false’ cases registered against BKU leaders. They also burnt an effigy of PM Modi.

In the meantime, the farmers will continue to hold dharnas outside the residences of Punjab BJP leaders as well as outside toll plazas, fuel stations and retail businesses run by three corporate houses which farmers believe are the intended beneficiaries of the Centre's move to "corporatise" agriculture.Representatives of 30 unions (other than the largest BKU Ekta Ugrahan), at a marathon meeting here today, decided to allow the goods trains to run. The farmers will shift their protest from the rail tracks to railway stations. While the passenger trains will be stopped, the good trains will be allowed to go.“We will ensure that no passenger train leaves station. Since we do not want Punjab’s economy to be hit any further, we have decided to allow the movement of goods trains,” explained Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).GM Singh, Divisional Manager, Railways, Ambala, said the goods trains would start moving only after they received clearance from the Government Railway Police.While the industry in Punjab is estimated to have suffered a loss of Rs 40,000 crore since September 24 when "rail roko" was launched, foodgrain stocks procured in the past two years need to be transported from Punjab to the recipient states immediately to free up space in godowns for the 170 lakh tonnes of paddy that is to be procured this season.Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who had appealed to the farmers to allow the trains to run, today thanked the unions for accepting his request.Read also:What is bothering the state farmersNo let-up, say Leaders"We are holding dharnas at 60 places, including outside the houses of 10 BJP leaders."— Joginder Singh, BKU Ekta Ugrahan"The passing of the three farm Bills in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha on Tuesday is our first victory.

After her husband met with an accident, she was compelled to take this job in order to provide good education and a better lifestyle to her children.Kanta started earning well and enjoyed her work. However, her joy of doing something for the family was short-lived. The entire country went into the lockdown amid the Covid-19 outbreak and her work was affected. The earnings remained nil for almost five months, though she played a Good Samaritan during the lockdown by extending help to the stranded people.Since I never wanted my family to suffer any more, I decided to vend cooked food. With the help of my husband, I put up a parantha stall near Doaba Chowk. We named our little refreshment corner Parantha Junction, but the customer footfall was not as per our expectations. Subsequently, I approached the MC officials, who allotted me space outside the Indo-Canadian office. It has been a week since I'm here.  —Kanta Chauhan“Although I wasn’t laid off from my job, but I stopped getting bookings as social distancing has become a new norm now. I tried for other jobs, but most companies refused saying they are not hiring amid the crisis. My husband, who used to be delivery man, was also unemployed. Soon we started running out of savings,” said Kanta.“Since I never wanted my family to suffer any more, I decided to vend cooked food. With the help of my husband, I put up a parantha stall near Doaba Chowk. When Good Samaritans got to know about us, they helped us in getting a cart and gas cylinders. We named our little refreshment corner ‘Parantha Junction’. Although we received customers daily, the footfall was not as per our expectations. We used to cover 15 km to reach here. Subsequently, I approached Municipal Corporation officials, who allotted me space outside the Indo-Canadian office, near the bus stand. It has been a week since I’m here. Being the most visited area, and due to its location, the daily turnout of customers is satisfactory. We operate our stall from 6am to 6pm and provide all meals to our customers as per their demand,” said Kanta.Kanta, who resides in Pratap Nagar, says she can now look after her kids, aged 5 and 10 years, as well while operating the stall. Nearly 30-40 customers visit her stall everyday.Even as Kanta has taken up this new income source, she doesn’t want to leave her previous occupation. She says when things are back to normal, she will resume her bike-taxi job for at least two-three hours, as it gave her recognition.
