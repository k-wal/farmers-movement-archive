Many such travellers have begun using village and interior roads to sneak back into Patiala to avoid check-posts on interstate borders, making tracking and testing such people that much harder.District authorities said 13 such people coming back from Delhi recently have already tested positive in the last 10 days.   Neighbours have now begun actively helping authorities---Dr Malhotra said authorities have are now getting calls in control rooms to provide information about any interstate travellers in the area.  What’s worse, say sources, said that it isn’t just the common man who hides travel information--- bureaucrats, police officers, politicians and even officers of court have been known to keep back information about their relatives’ travels.When asked about this, Dr Malhotra said: “We always guide people that people should come forward to help the government to fight Coroanvirus. Once we get know about anyone, we have tested everyone irrespective of their position”.The district has been seeing a rise in the number of interstate travellers testing positive---over 50 people who returned from Delhi and the national capital region over 10 days have tested positive so far.  Of the district’s 159 coronavirus cases, 44 per cent are people with interstate travel history.
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||HC rebukes Punjab Police for using derogatory term for African national||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has pulled up the Punjab police for using a racist slur while referring to an African national in police documents, noting that the incident brought “shame to India”.The court observed that it was “terrible thinking” on the part of police to have assumed that “every black is a drug peddler” and that visitors from the continent much be treated with dignity and respect.The single-judge bench of Justice Rajiv Narain Raina has asked the Punjab Director General of Police to notify instructions in order to ensure that offensive terms are not used while referring to black people.Justice Raina said he was “appalled” to find the term “Negro” used while referring to an African national in the challan papers presented under Section 173 (Report of police officer on completion of investigation) of the Criminal Procedure Code before the trial court in a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.“This is a highly offensive word across the globe and no one has any business to use it, and much less the police. Hence, it is directed never to use the unprintable word in any police document including in challans or anywhere else on case papers including in investigation reports,” the court said in its order dated June 12.People from Africa should be referred to by the country of their origin in case papers, the court ruled.It directed that police personnel should be sensitised and warned on the issue by ensuring that no person should be looked down upon on the basis of the colour of his/her skin.“This brings shame to India and hatred for the country. The police appear to have assumed that every black is a drug peddler and should be treated as such. This is terrible thinking,” Justice Raina observed in his order dated June 12.“They deserve the dignity and respect in a foreign land as visitors or students in India from Africa temporarily living in our country, which prides itself of many peoples of all colours of the skin ranging from white to black and aboriginal,” the order stated.The bench noted that “all Africans are our friends and when they come to India either as visitors or students, they are our valuable guests and we should be reminded that India is rich in its traditions of ‘mehman nawazi’ and ‘attithi sanskar/satkar’ and prides itself on this”.Justice Raina further said Mahatama Gandhi was politically nurtured in South Africa for two decades, pioneering the apartheid movement and fighting against colour discrimination and for freedom against black laws just as he fought during India’s freedom struggle.“Let us follow that inspiring precept and pay due respect to each other and other people,” the court said: “We are, professedly, a tolerant sub-continent of browns in all its shades, but more often than not, display a perverted and primitive mindset looking down on others without looking within ourselves. For many centuries we have been slaves. Freedom does not lend its wings to our countrymen to fly anywhere they wish and in any manner, they like and abuse foreigners on the street calling them ‘kalla’. To the contrary, freedom teaches love for human dignity and respect for fellow man,” the court's order said.The court has fixed June 18 as the next date of hearing. PTI

14-06-2020||Washington||Anmol Narang becomes first observant Sikh to graduate from US Military Academy at West Point||Anmol Narang has made history by becoming the first observant Sikh to graduate from the prestigious United States Military Academy at West Point, and the Second Lieutenant is hopeful that her efforts to represent her religion and community will encourage Americans to learn more about Sikhism.US President Donald Trump on Saturday addressed the 1,107 graduates, including 23-year-old Narang, who gathered for the academy's annual commencement."It's an incredible feeling. It's a humbling experience, I have never worked harder for anything in my life. Being a Sikh woman is a very important part of my identity and if my experience can play a small role in being an inspiration for others, regardless of career field, that will be wonderful," Narang told CNN.A second-generation immigrant born and raised in Roswell, Georgia, Narang had an early appreciation for military service due to her maternal grandfather's career in the Indian Army.Also read: First Sikh woman to graduate from US Military Academy at West PointAfter she developed an interest in military service during high school, she began the process to apply for the West Point after her family visited Pearl Harbor National Memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii.At the Saturday's ceremony, the graduates socially distanced 6 feet from one another across the Plain Parade Field to accommodate COVID-19 public health requirements instead of congregating at Michie Stadium, the ceremony's traditional location. Family and friends were not allowed to attend the ceremony but could watch it online, the report said."This premier military academy produces only the best of the best—the strongest of the strong—and the bravest of the brave. West Point is a universal symbol of American gallantry, loyalty, devotion, discipline, and skill," Trump said in his address."To the 1,107 who today become the newest officers in the most exceptional Army ever to take the field of battle, I am here to offer America's salute. Thank you for answering your nation's call," he said.While other Sikhs have graduated from the academy, that Narang is the first observant Sikh to have graduated from West Point.She hopes that her efforts to represent her religion and community will encourage Americans to learn more about the Sikh faith, the fifth largest religion in the world, the report said.In 1987, the US Congress passed a law that prohibited Sikhs and several other religious communities from maintaining their articles of faith while in the military, despite a history of diverse service and simple accommodations.The Sikh Coalition said that for 30 years, the visible Sikh articles of faith—including unshorn facial hair and turbans—were banned, despite being core tenets of the faith.In response, for more than 10 years, the Sikh Coalition has led a campaign, in partnership with other Sikh and civil rights organisations, litigation partners, and like-minded advocates, to ensure equality of opportunity for Sikhs Americans in the US Armed Forces."I am immensely proud of (Second Lieutenant) Narang for seeing her goal through and, in doing so, breaking a barrier for any Sikh American who wishes to serve," said  Simratpal Singh, US Army Captain and a family friend of Narang."The broader acceptance of Sikh service members among all of the service branches, as well as in top tier leadership spaces like West Point, will continue to benefit not just the rights of religious minority individuals, but the strength and diversity of the US military," Singh said in a statement.Singh's 2016 suit over his own right to maintain his articles of faith in uniform spurred a critical change in the Army's accommodations policy in 2017, which streamlined the accommodations process for Sikh soldiers and ensured that accommodations would stay with them throughout their career.In 2020, after granting a series of individual accommodations to Sikh airmen throughout the year prior, the US Air Force implemented a similarly updated policy. Since the Army and the Air Force changed their policies, at least 60 observant Sikhs are serving in those two branches of the military. The work continues to ensure equality of opportunity for Sikhs in the US Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, a media release said on Saturday.There are an estimated 500,000 Sikh-Americans in the US.There have been several attacks on Sikhs in America. Two Sikh Americans were killed in two separate incidents in one week in California in July 2017.In March 2017, a 39-year-old Sikh man was shot in the arm outside his home in Kent, Washington, by a partially-masked gunman who shouted "go back to your own country".In 2015, an elderly Sikh-American man was brutally assaulted and left with severe facial injuries by an assailant who yelled racial slurs like "terrorist" and "Bin Laden", in an apparent hate crime just before the US commemorated the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.According to a 2009 Sikh Coalition report, 41 per cent of Sikhs surveyed in New York City had been called derogatory names, such as "Osama bin Laden" or "terrorist".

His government is mulling ways to make entry norms more stringent, given the increasing number of positive cases in the state, said the Chief Minister, adding that of the total of 2,986 cases in Punjab, 1,471 could be traced to outsiders and their contacts.Though the state is still performing relatively better than many other states in the country, cases in Punjab are also continuing to spiral up, necessitating tough measures, the Chief Minister said.He promised to scale up testing to 20,000 a day soon. Pointing to the spike of 117 cases in a single day in the state, the CM attributed it to the huge influx of people into the state. As many as 43,000 people entered the state in just one month. — TNS43K arrived in monthCapt Amarinder promised to scale up testing to 20,000 a day soon.

14-06-2020||Saurabh Malik||NRI moves High Court over ‘refusal’ by hospitals to admit nephew||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 13In what could be an indicator of major inadequacies in Covid testing and healthcare facilities, a “harassed” NRI doctor has moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court alleging that his ailing nephew died after being refused hospitalisation during the lockdown period and virus tests were not carried out after the child’s death despite specific requests to the health authorities.He also alleged that a quarantine notice was rather affixed outside his house and he was being threatened to take back the complaint, compelling him to move the High Court for protection of life and liberty.Issuing notice of motion to the state and other respondents on the petition filed by Dr Dheeraj Singh Manhas, Justice Jaishree Thakur of the High Court directed the Pathankot Senior Superintendent of Police to file by way of an affidavit the status report, along with an inquiry report, if conducted. “In the meantime, let it be made sure that the petitioner herein is not threatened in any manner whatsoever,” Justice Thakur ordered.Taking up the petition through videoconferencing, Justice Thakur recorded in her order the facts stated in the plea before passing the order. She observed the petition was filed by the doctor, visiting India from the United Kingdom and living in his parental house at Sujanpur, Pathankot. It was, inter alia, alleged in his petition that the doctor took his ailing nephew from one hospital to other to get him treated. But either doctors were not present in the emergency ward or hospitals refused to admit the child. He ultimately suffered a cardiac arrest and died.

The treatment of a Covid patient should not cost several lakhs of rupees — Balbir Singh Sidhu, MinisterHe said the state government would soon fix charges for Covid treatment keeping in view the interest of both patients and private hospitals. “But at no cost will the government allow exploitation of the patients during this critical situation by the private hospitals,” he said.“This is a catastrophic crisis when everyone is fighting for survival and some unscrupulous private hospitals have tried to resort to open loot of the helpless patients,” Sidhu said in a strong statement issued here today.The minister said his attention had been drawn towards unprecedentedly high charges imposed by private hospitals. Sidhu warned that the licences of all such hospitals would be cancelled and all their facilities would be withdrawn.Besides, he added, the government reserved the right to withdraw the land provided to these hospitals at highly concessional rates.The Minister has called a special meeting on Monday to decide the charges. He said all factors would be taken into consideration. “We do not want the private hospitals to suffer any financial losses. At the same time, we will not allow extortion of patients at any cost,” he clarified. “The private hospitals will need to display the charges on their premises,” he said.Sidhu said failing to get any treatment in Delhi, symptomatic persons were coming to Punjab.

14-06-2020||---||17 Punjab cops have tested +ve since June 1||Chandigarh, June 13A total of 17 police personnel have tested positive during random sampling of 7,165 staffers posted in police stations and frontline duties. A special RT-PCR Covid testing drive was ordered by DGP Dinkar Gupta amid apprehensions of a spike in cases.This translates into around 0.9 per cent positive cases of the total samples from the police force, as compared to the average of 2 per cent positive cases for the entire state, said Gupta, pointing out that the state’s higher percentage among general population was understandable since testing of citizens was normally carried out either for symptomatic individuals or for their contacts in contrast to the random exercise for asymptomatic police personnel.Nearly 48,000 police personnel have been working on the frontline for the last three months.The DGP said of the 17 positive cases, 14 belonged to district police, two (including a cook) were from state armed police/Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) and one from Punjab Home Guards (PHG). Sangrur has reported the maximum number of positive cases, said the DGP.While 1,868 of the 7,165 samples collected till June 12 had tested negative, the results for 5,280 were pending, said Gupta, adding that the sampling process started on June 1, and efforts were being made to test a maximum number of police personnel posted in police stations and high-risk areas. He further said all infected cops were in isolation, either in civil hospitals or in the Covid care centres established by the Health Department.
