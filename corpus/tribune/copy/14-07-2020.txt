14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Dera’s support to SAD in 2017 polls ‘exposed ties’ between the two: Punjab Congress chief||Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar on Tuesday said the Dera Sacha Sauda representatives’ statement that they had supported the Akali Dal in 2017 assembly polls have “exposed the ties” between the SAD and Sirsa-based sect.“The statement of Dera representatives that they had extended support to Sukhbir Singh Badal-led Shiromani Akali Dal in 2017 elections has exposed the ties between the two,” Jakhar told reporters here.Days after jailed Dera Sacha Sauda sect chief Gurmeet Ram Ram Rahim Singh was named in the 2015 theft of a copy of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara in Faridkot, Dera representatives on Monday had claimed that they were possibly being “targeted” for supporting the SAD in 2017 assembly polls, Jakhar alleged that under the “deal” struck between the SAD and Dera Sacha Sauda, the Akalis had got the sect chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh pardoned in a blasphemy case, got his film released and “influenced” investigation into sacrilege incidents.“In lieu of this, Dera followers supported Akali Dal in 2017 assembly elections,” claimed Jakhar.The Punjab Congress chief accused SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal of “backstabbing the ‘panth’ by “hobnobbing” with the Dera to remain in power.He alleged that Badal’s “anti-Sikh” face has been exposed by the Dera itself.The candid admission by the Dera followers that they had supported the Akali Dal in 2017 assembly polls reflects the “strong bond” between Dera and Akali Dal, he added.“The people of state in general and Sikhs in particular would never forgive Badal for this sin, which has pushed Punjab into turbulent times,” said Jakhar.Meanwhile, the SAD hit back at the Congress, accusing it of teaming up with Dera to take on the SAD with the “sole aim” of polling Dera votes in its favour in the 2022 assembly elections in lieu of giving a “clean chit” to Dera.Senior SAD leaders Balwinder Singh Bhundur, Prem Singh Chandumajra, Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Sikander Singh Maluka said the Congress government was in the process of “weakening” the sacrilege case as part of an “understanding” with the Dera.“The Congress first scared Dera Sacha Sauda and has now teamed up with it to use it for its political purposes against the SAD. However, by doing so, it has only served to expose its friendship with the Dera,” they said.Senior leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal said the Congress party was trying to “cover up” its failures and was resorting to “cheap” politics.He said SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal had already done ‘ardas’ (prayer) that nothing should remain of those who had indulged in the acts of sacrilege as well as of those who were behind it.He also made it clear that the SAD had never taken the support of the Dera during the 2017 assembly elections.“Some SAD candidates solicited the Dera support in their individual capacity. These leaders however presented themselves before Akal Takth Sahib to seek forgiveness for this act,” he said.Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh had been named as a conspirator by the Special Investigation of Punjab police in a case relating to the theft of the Sikh’s holy book Guru Granth Sahib in 2015.The Punjab Police special investigation team (SIT) is probing three sacrilege cases. These are theft of a “bir” (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from a Burj Jawahar Singh Wala gurdwara on June 1, 2015, the case of putting up of hand-written sacrilegious posters in Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on September 25 and that of tearing and scattering pages of the holy book at Bargari on October 12, 2015 in Faridkot.The sacrilege of religious scriptures had taken place during the previous SAD-BJP regime. The Akali government had handed over the probe to the CBI.Amarinder Singh-led government withdrew these cases from the central investigating agency and gave it to the Punjab Police SIT. PTI

ETPB and Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee have made special arrangements for the safety of the pilgrims.Earlier, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that Pakistan had conveyed the Indian side about its readiness to reopen the corridor in connection with the occasion of the death anniversary of Sikh ruler Maharaja Ranjeet Singh on June 29.Sources in the government of India in New Delhi had said Pakistan was trying to create a mirage of goodwill by proposing to reopen the corridor on June 29.The sources also wondered why Pakistan proposed to reopen it in such a short notice of two days while a bilateral agreement on the corridor provided for information to be shared by both sides at least seven days before the date of travel.The 4km-long Kartarpur Corridor provides visa-free access to Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit the Gurdwara, the final resting place of Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev, who had spent the last 18 years of his life in Kartarpur.In November last year, the two countries threw open the corridor linking Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, in a historic people-to-people initiative.Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in Pakistan's Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine.

14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Coming to Punjab for less than 72 hours?

However, ignoring the protocol, many officials, including judges and district education officers (DEOs), have already gone into 14-day self-quarantine.In one such instance, without the recommendation of the Health Department, the entire staff of the DEO office went into self-quarantine after the Deputy DEO tested positive. However, Harinder Kaur, DEO, said they had taken permission from the Education Secretary for self-quarantine.“We went into self-quarantine because our Deputy DEO tested positive. We had informed the Education Secretary. Moreover, we worked from home,” she said.Similarly, two judges also underwent 14-day self-quarantine after two undertrials, who were produced in their court for remand, tested positive, which the Health Department said they were not aware of. An Executive Officer (EO) in Patiala also underwent self-quarantine for seven days after a peon in his office tested positive for the Covid-19.“I was directed by the SMO for quarantine, as a peon, who tested positive, was working in my office. I joined the office three days after I tested negative,” the EO said.It has been learnt that a few Municipal Corporation and PCS officials also went into self-quarantine after a Naib Tehsildar tested positive.A health official said, “If every government employee undergoes self-quarantine on his own, what are we here for? There is a team of health officials which will analyse the extent of exposure with positive patient and then recommend quarantine.”Dr Avneet Kaur, Director, Health and Family Welfare, said, “Only the Health Department, after assessing the exposure to the virus, will recommend quarantine for government employees. I will look into the matter.”

A six-lane road along the river, while acting as an embankment against floods, will also ensure that no pollutants are let into the river by anyone. The planning of the estate will be done in a way that green units, logistics offices, workers’ residences and hotels are located near the river front,” he added.Notably, there were some media reports that the industrial development project, approved by the Council of Ministers recently, would be a threat to the forest area of Mattewara and Sutlej. — TNS
14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Gurmeet Ram Rahim, aides being framed in Guru Granth Sahib theft case: Premis||Days after their head Gurmeet Ram Rahim was booked by the Punjab Police in the 2015 case of theft of Guru Granth Sahib from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in Faridkot, representatives of the Dera Sacha Sauda today accused the Congress government of framing the dera.The dera men, led by Harcharan Singh and Vivek Kumar, claimed that the dera head and other followers were being falsely booked in the case without any evidence against them.“This is being done because the dera had supported the Akali-BJP alliance in the 2017 Assembly elections. Besides, an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the sacrilege cases is still on,” said Harcharan Singh, while addressing mediapersons here today.The dera representatives alleged there were many loopholes in the theory that was being propagated by the Punjab Police.“The entire theory is based on the confessional statement of Mahinder Pal Bittu, who was booked in a case of arson. The fact is that he was brutally tortured and faced with threat of harm to his family, so he signed the statement made by the police. Just before he was to be granted bail, he was killed in the high-security jail,” Kumar said .

It is learnt that the committee has submitted a copy of the resolution in this regard to the Takht.On the other hand, Aujla had written to the Takht to involve the state government and get the probe done through a serving judge or club the 267 missing ‘saroops’ case with the 2015 sacrilege incidents of Bargari that is under investigation by the SIT constituted by the state government.SGPC’s senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta said Aujla’s advice was a ‘politically motivated’ move to defame the SGPC.“Aujla wants to give it a political colour whereas it is a religious matter. The government machinery cannot be involved as the SGPC is competent enough to scrutinise it,” he said. — TNS

Why don’t they strengthen the banks in April itself? The Ghaggar works have become a big source of embezzlement for politicians and officers and it is the only reason that none of them is serious about it. The authorities have not conducted the repair of weak points as yet.”On Saturday, some farmers tried to release rain water from their fields into the Ghaggar through pipes, which were blocked due to lack of cleaning. This caused fissures in the pipes and around 50-feet area was eroded. As per sources, the Punjab Government has sanctioned Rs 1.10 crore under MGNREGA for strengthening Ghaggar embankments, while last week, the Drainage Department sanctioned Rs 40 lakh more for the purpose.“Every year, the government sanctions crores for the cleaning and strengthening of the Ghaggar banks. A thorough investigation should be conducted to ascertain where the money goes as clearly it is not being utilised for Ghaggar,” alleged Gagan Sharma, another farmer from the area.Chetan Roy Gupta, SDO, Drainage Department, said: “The Panchayat authorities have repaired a majority of the 60 weak points of Ghaggar. But still, if any point needs repairs, farmers should inform the authorities and quick repair would be done”. — TNS
