The students were to be given grades on pro-rata basis on their current semester’s internal continuous assessment.

23-07-2020||Chandigarh||COVID-19 hits Punjab and Haryana HC as secretary of judge tests positive||COVID-19 has hit the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The secretary of a High Court judge has tested positive for COVID-19, sending waves of apprehensions among the technical and other staff involved in the process of hearing cases through videoconferencing.Describing the development as “alarming”, a senior officer said the judge and others may now have to be tested for the virus, adding that a substantial number of High Court officers and officials, involved in the day-to-day functioning of the virtual courts, came in contact with the secretary during the past few days.The development has once again indicated the impracticality of permitting physical functioning at the level of the High Court and the lower courts.Available information suggests around 70 officers and staff members have been quarantined after July 13 till date across Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh.Prior to it more than 500 judicial officers, their families and staff in the two states and Chandigarh had been quarantined.Among the judicial officers tested positive for Covid were a district and sessions judge and three additional district and sessions judges.Confirming the information, High Court’s Registrar Vigilance-cum-PRO Vikram Aggarwal said Yogesh, secretary in the Court of Justice Alka Sarin, was tested positive for COVID-19.The health authorities were tracing all contacts. Based upon the findings, the judge, the officials posted in the court and officers who visited the court during the past few days would be tested or quarantined.The High Court and the district judiciary went into restricted functioning mode in March-end following the COVID-19 outbreak.In an attempt to prevent the period from turning into denial of justice phase, the High Court cancelled its summer vacations for itself and the subordinate courts in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh.The High Court is currently functioning at almost two-third its strength through videoconferencing.    As of now, the High Court and the subordinate courts are primarily conducting virtual hearings.But at times circumstances warrant the production of the accused before the courts or interaction between the judicial officers and lawyers, increasing their exposure to risk.Another officer further adds the court administration is in regular touch with medical and other experts. They are of the opinion that the opening of “physical” courts should not be allowed at the present stage following the upward swing in the number of COVID-19 cases after the relaxation in the lockdown.

Rooms are filthy with unclean toilets.”He added, “Doctors and nurses do not come to conduct regular check-ups or monitor condition of patients.

The government has also initiated the process of buying Remdesivir drug, which has the potential to bring down viral load in patients and expedite recovery in case of critical patients. All medical colleges and tertiary care centres have been asked to submit demand for this drug at the earliest so the state government could buy these, Dr Rajiv Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19, told The Tribune.With the new positive cases now rising daily, Health Department staff and the local administration in each district has been asked to allow patients to be isolated at home after assessing their dwelling units to ensure that all quarantine protocols can be followed. As many as 756 patients (against a total of 3,391 active cases) are presently placed under home isolation, with maximum patients in Ludhiana.The Clinical Management Manual issued by the Government of India has allowed home isolation for patients over 60 years of age as well as those with co-morbidities in case they develop mild infection (and are asymptomatic). As the state government readied its own manual based on the recommendations of an expert committee, Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan is learnt to have recommended that home isolation should be avoided for senior citizens and those with co-morbidities like hypertension, asthma, diabetes, coronary artery disease, severe hepatic, renal diseases and pregnant women and they be hospitalised for better monitoring.The state presently has 7,000 hospital beds for mild and asymptomatic patients, 5,000 for patients showing moderate symptoms and those having co-morbidities in government-run healthcare facilities.

An IAS officer is definitely uncomfortable taking part in meetings which are chaired by persons who wield political clout,” said a senior bureaucrat.Now all officers, including DCs, will have to attend meetings convened by the DPC chiefs.The DPC chiefs held a video-conference with Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Tuesday.They were also upset about the Rs 15,000 monthly honorarium being paid to them. This has now been enhanced to Rs 25,000 per month.

They alleged that even the CBI had opposed this act of the SIT and the CBI court had sought a reply from the SIT.The dera followers claimed that no permission was obtained by the SIT from the CBI court to conduct an inquiry. Other than arresting them, the SIT did not have the right to file a chargesheet in the presence of the final “untraced report” submitted by the CBI, they alleged.The court has issued notice to the SIT for July 24.Counsels for the dera followers said it was quite contradictory that on July 29, 2019, the Special DGP-cum-Director, Bureau of Investigation, on the recommendations of the SIT had written to the CBI’s Director to probe overseas and cross-border communication in the sacrilege incidents after two Pakistani mobile numbers were operational in Bargari area and one the suspect had left for Portugal. Now, the SIT had started its independent probe, they said.

23-07-2020||---||Housing policy tweaked to permit more flats per acre||Chandigarh, July 22The Punjab Housing Department has tweaked its “Affordable Housing Policy”, giving additional incentives, including allowing more flats, increased saleable area, less parking and better floor area ratio (FAR).Key Takeaways Of Affordable Housing PolicyMaximum plot size for construction of affordable houses has been capped at 150 sq yd while for EWS it will be 100 sq ydIt is mandatory to keep 10 per cent of the total number of residential flats reserved for EWSIn the tweaked policy, the department by doing away with density norm has allowed promoters to raise up to 130 flats per acre, compared to 60 flats permissible in the previous policy.“This has been achieved by allowing a realistic 60 per cent saleable area, removing mandatory school, dispensary and religious site and instead giving a community centre. Moreover, an FAR of 1:3 for group housing socities,” said a senior official of the department.Sarvjit Singh, Secretary, Housing, said the policy would give a secure alternative to people who get trapped in illegal colonies.The department has reduced saleable area from 65 per cent to 60 per cent and increased green areas from 6 per cent to 8 per cent of the project area.Clearing misconception about reduction in saleable area, an official said, “In the earlier policy, actual saleable area came to near 55 per cent against 65 allowed on papers. Now, with more incentives, the actual saleable area will be 60 per cent,” said a senior official in the town planning wing.In case of parking, equivalent car space (ECS) for a 600 sq yd plot has been reduced to 0.5 ECS from 1 ECS.For a plot above 600 sq yd and up to 900 sq yd, an ECS of one has been allowed in the tweaked policy.Explaining the new policy, an official said unplanned growth was happening on the outskirts of towns and this policy would help in curtailing it.For areas under SAS Nagar Master Plan, a minimum 25 acres and 10 acres and for New Chandigarh Master Plan minimum 100 acres and five acres are required, respectively.At present, the department has prepared a master plan of only 44 of the 156 towns.

Issuing a notice of motion, the Punjab and Haryana High Court made it clear that the process of selecting headmasters by way of direct recruitment may continue, but appointment orders would not be issued.‘Violation Of Rules’The directions by the Bench of Justice Ajay Tewari and Justice Jasgurpreet Singh Puri came on a petition against the state of Punjab and others by Jarmanjit Singh and other petitioners through counsel Alka Chatrath.Appearing before the Bench through video-conferencing, the counsel argued that the required qualifications for direct recruitments were “below those for promotion”.Chatrath argued that the respondents were proposing to fill up the posts of headmaster by way of direct recruitment, which would be in excess quota. The Bench was told that the petitioners, working as masters in the Education Department, were primarily seeking the quashing of the impugned notification dated August 8, 2018, notifying Punjab School and Inspection Cadre (Group B) Service Rules, 2018, and the amendment made vide notifications dated February 13.Chatrath argued that the quashing was being sought as providing 50 per cent posts by way of direct recruitment to persons with three-year experience as a teacher was in violation of the earlier provision under the 1978 Rules, which provided for filling 75 per cent posts by way of promotion and only 25 per cent posts by direct recruitment of persons with eight-year experience as a master. The process was being carried out without insisting on the condition of their having passed the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET), a mandatory condition after 2010.
