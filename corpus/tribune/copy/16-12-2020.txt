But last week, he posted a statement on Twitter, saying the matter was between the farmers and the government and some people were trying to stir the trouble.‚ÄúI know that many people want to take advantage of the situation and are creating problems. They are not thinking of farmers. They may have their own agenda. I stand with my party and farmers and will always be with farmers,‚Äù Deol had tweeted.‚ÄúOur government always thinks of the betterment of farmers and I am sure that the government will ensure the right outcome after holding talks with farmers,‚Äù he added.The farmers are protesting against the new agriculture laws, which they fear will end the safety net of Minimum Support Prices (MSP), or guaranteed minimum prices, and leave them open to exploitation by corporate.After Sunny Deol‚Äôs tweet, his father Dharmendra, a legendary actor who was also a BJP MP between 2004 and 2009, had posted: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm extremely in pain to see the suffering of my farmer brothers.‚Äù

16-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers' group from Punjab starts 'informal school' for local slum children||A group of farmers from Punjab's Anandpur Sahib has started an 'informal school' in a makeshift tent for local slum children at the Singhu border.Pioneered by writer Bir Singh and advocate Dinesh Chaddha, the temporary school that started on Monday is part of the multiple 'sewa' practices being offered at the protest site, where thousands of farmers have been demonstrating against three new farm laws for over two weeks now.With several rounds of talks with the government ending in stalemate, the protesters have found new ways to help each other and those living around the protest site, be it community kitchens, medical services, libraries, or this temporary school."Everything here is 'sewa'. We saw so many children from neighbouring slums roaming around for food, and thought why not also help them keep engaged in a constructive way," Satnam Singh, a volunteer, said.According to him, educated individuals among the farmers, who have bachelors or Phd degrees, have been teaching the children.About 60-70 children across age groups have been coming to them every day to read, write, draw and listen to stories, he added."The first day we had to encourage them to come and study here by giving them fruit juice and snacks, but over the last two days they have been coming on their own, and have brought their friends too," Satnam Singh said."The teachers ask them what class they are studying in and teach them according to the expected syllabi," he said, adding that they have arranged for a similar facility at the Tikri border protest site as well.As the local children speak Hindi, story books have been made available to them in the language.In the evenings, the tent is used to recreate a tradition‚Äî"Sanjhi Sath"‚Äîfrom back home‚Äîwhere the villagers gather to listen to their elders' advice.Here at eight in the evening, they discuss the orders of the day."Not every farmer here gets an opportunity to speak on the stage, so this gives them a platform to share their concerns which we forward to the leaders of the protest," Satnam Singh said.Farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. ‚Äî PTI
16-12-2020||¬†}Chandigarh||Sukhbir playing petty politics, spreading poison in Punjab: Tarun Chugh||BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh on Wednesday lambasted Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal for spreading poison and igniting communal passions in Punjab in the garb of fighting farmers' cause.Reacting to Badal's statement that the BJP had become a "tukade tukade" gang Chugh said the way Sukhbir, after parting ways with the BJP, was trying to create a divisive and disruptive narrative was strongly reprehensible."All Punjabis should wake up to the nefarious designs of Sukhbir Badal and his party", he said.¬†Chugh said the¬† BJP had always stood for Hindu-Sikh unity in Punjab and has tried to foster the brotherhood whenever there were strains of stress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken special care to address the Sikh issues, be it providing succour to the 1984 riot victims, or opening of the Kartarpur Corridor, or lifting a ban on foreign donations made to the Golden Temple, and many more like that.Even during the times of militancy in Punjab, the BJP made sure that the Hindu-Sikh relations did not suffer and the spirit of Punjabiat was kept alive.¬†Even at a time when silver spades were distributed for digging SYL and the copies of the nation's constitution were burnt, the BJP made sure that bad blood did not spread in the society.The BJP has always kept the Punjabi spirit of Hindu-Sikh unity alive even during the times when massacre¬†of Hindus was taking place in a planned manner.¬†The BJP stands for the Punjabiyat and will always stand for it."Now, when many singers are singing provocative and communally inciting songs why is Sukhbir Ji silent on them," he asked.¬†On farmers' front, he said,, the BJP was committed to doing everything for their welfare. The three farm bills are meant to double their income by 2022 because farmers had been reeling under heavy debts and have been taking to suicides in a big way. Sukhbir Badal is trying to play cheap politics by painting the BJP like that.¬†¬†Chugh clarified that the Modi government has accepted all the demands raised by farmer leaders during their talks with the Union ministers. The issues like the MSP, mandis and civil suits are all adequately resolved to the farmers' satisfaction. The Centre is still open to talks on various clauses in the bills. We hope that farmers would soon withdraw their protest.And farmers have any doubts they are welcome¬†for more talks with the Centre. We reassure farmers that the BJP would always protect their interests and work for empowering them, he added.The BJP has been contesting elections since 1952. Even in 1992 when it contested without an alliance with any other party, it polled 16.7 per cent votes which made it win¬†23 Assembly seats. The BJP is a firmly rooted party in Punjab..The BJP's base is in fact expanding because farmers who have been in distress understand that the three bills would help improve their plight. Ever since the farmers' agitation has started more than 3000 persons from other political parties have joined the BJP.¬† We are expanding our bases steadily to contest from all the 117 Assembly seats and come victorious after the elections and form the government in Punjab.
16-12-2020||New Delhi||Technology powering farmers' protest at Delhi's Singhu border||It's been over two weeks since thousands of farmers arrived at Delhi's Singhu border to demand a repeal of the Centre's agri reforms. Over the days, Good Samaritans, gurdwara committees and NGOs have pooled technological resources to ensure the agitation isn't hampered by the lack of basic amenities.Gigantic machines that belt out 1,000-1,200 chapattis in an hour, washing machines and solar panels installed on tractor-trolleys for charging mobile phones -- technology is keeping the protesters camping at this highway-turned-township going.The chapatti-makers ensure timely meals for the protesters and that 'langar' is served smoothly till midnight."This chapatti-making machine is fully automatic, you just have to put the dough inside. It cuts the dough into circles and in no time you get the chapattis."We start the machine around 7 am and it runs till 12 am. We serve meals to over 5,000 people every day," Hardeep Singh from Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, which manages one of the 'langars' at the protest site, told PTI.Living away from the comfort of their homes, another issue faced by the farmers was washing clothes. Initially, some of them bathed and washed their clothes at the petrol pumps. But as the temperatures in the national capital dipped and the number of protesters swelled, some farmers and Good Samaritans arranged for washing machines.On one of his trips back home to Ludhiana in Punjab to wash his clothes, 30-year-old Prince Sandhu decided to bring two washing machines with him so that he and his fellow protesters didn't have to worry about the chore.Soon after, someone donated another washing machine and the 'laundry Sewa' has been going on in full swing ever since."Nearly 250 people come here every day to wash their clothes. Many do it on their own. We help out the elderly who don't know how to operate washing machines," said Sandhu, who joined the protest on November 27."I wake up at 6 am and help people wash their clothes till 8 pm," he said.Not far from the laundry spot is Pushpinder Singh's phone charging station.¬†Singh, 36, said he knew protesters would face problems in charging their mobile phones and hence decided to install two 100 watt solar panels atop his tractor trolley before he set out from home in Haryana's Karnal.¬†"Mobile phones are our only source of knowing what is happening around us. I knew charging them would be a problem. So I bought these two solar panels for Rs 2,400 each before I got here. Not only are they helping us in charging mobile phones but also with lighting," he said."Now I see many others have also installed solar panels, which is good," he added.Earlier, international NGO Khalsa Aid made headlines for installing foot massagers and geysers for the protesters at Singhu border.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Delhi's neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, have stayed put at the national capital's border points since late November to protest against the new farm laws.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their products anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with mandis that ensure income, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

||BJP raking up SYL issue to divide farmers, says Jakhar||Chandigarh, December 15 The Punjab Congress today took on the Haryana BJP for raking up the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue at a time when farmers of the both the states were jointly protesting against the three farm laws.   ‚ÄúIt is typical of the BJP to indulge in the divide and rule policy to create a wedge between Punjab and Haryana farmers at a time when they are fighting together against the farm laws. The BJP is apparently trying to browbeat Punjab with such intimidating tactics,‚Äù said state party chief Sunil Jakhar.  ‚ÄúEarlier, they imposed economic sanctions and stopped trains to Punjab to sabotage the farmers‚Äô stir and now, they are trying to rake up an issue that is highly sensitive and emotive for the Punjabis,‚Äù he said. Referring to the meeting of Haryana BJP MPs with Central ministers over the SYL issue, he said it was a highly provocative and insidious act on part of the BJP leadership in Haryana. He pointed out that the SYL issue was currently pending in the Supreme Court. Jakhar said instead of resorting to such mean and divisive tactics to create a divide between farmers of Punjab and Haryana, who had shown exemplary camaraderie and solidarity with each other, BJP leaders should prevail upon the government to withdraw the ‚Äòblack‚Äô laws in the interest of not only the farmers, but the entire country. He reiterated that no matter what diversionary and divisive tactics the BJP may resort to, the Centre would have to repeal these laws that ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù the agricultural economy in the country. ‚ÄúThe sooner you do it, the better it will be for everyone,‚Äù he told the BJP government at the Centre.

As key leaders of the farmers‚Äô protest on the borders of Delhi fall prey to the cold winds, their second-in-commands have taken over, leading the protest with the same zeal.The leaders, who till now were working in the shadow of their more prominent colleagues, are vociferous in their demand for the revocation of the laws.Aware of BJP tacticsWe are monitoring which way the propaganda machinery of the BJP goes. We are cautious that except the farm laws, no other narrative is to be allowed from the stage. ‚Äî Rajinder Singh Deepsinghwala, KKUDr Darshan Pal of the Krantikari Kisan Union and Jagmohan Singh Patiala of the BKU (Dakaunda) were among the prominent leaders of the ‚Äòmorchas‚Äô outside Delhi, who have now fallen ill. Also, many other farm leaders have age and lifestyle-related ailments. It is for this reason that younger leaders like Gurmeet Singh from the Krantikari Kisan Union, Rajinder Singh Deepsinghwala of the Kirti Kisan Union and Jangveer Singh of the Doaba Kisan Committee came forward and sat on a day-long fast yesterday.Talking to The Tribune, Deepsinghwala said the younger leaders were as resolute in demanding the repeal of the farm laws as the elderly. ‚ÄúWe are monitoring which way the propaganda machinery of the BJP goes. We are extremely cautious that except the farm laws, no other narrative is allowed to propagate from the joint stage of all farm unions,‚Äù he said, adding that instructions had been issued to their cadres to practise religious beliefs and prayers only in their tents or individual resting places.Jangveer Singh echoes similar sentiments. Having led many stirs in Punjab in favour of sugarcane farmers, he says he knows how corporates operate and dominate farmers. ‚ÄúIt is for this reason that we are adamant that a stir be launched against the corporate houses who are the intended beneficiaries of the new laws,‚Äù he says.The young farm leaders are also meeting the youth and advising them to maintain the seriousness of the struggle, rather than using their time for fun.

From the ‚ÄòNo farmer, no food‚Äô stickers on vehicles to playing music in cars and at protest sites, artistic expression in its many forms has been the primary way for youth and citizens to make their voice heard. Farmers have also installed huge projection screens and are screening plays for the protesters in Delhi.Several Punjabi songs have gone viral during the ongoing agitation against the Centre‚Äôs farm laws. Many prominent singers who have supported the farmers are planning to come out with more songs to keep the spirits high. Gurpreet, a famous artist from Bathinda, has made many paintings on the farmers‚Äô issue. On Friday, he put up his work on the shutter of a beer and wine shop at the Singhu border. His work of Baba Banda Singh Bahadur and a humorous painting depicting Diljit Dosanjh and Kangana Ranaut attracted many viewers and some of his works were also sold in no time at the protest site.Theatre shares a long relationship with India, dating back to 5,000 years. Even after Independence, Indian street theatre evolved as a means to voice concerns of the common man. It had immediately struck a chord with the masses. Street plays are short and the exchange is close, direct and intimate. To be more effective, these are usually loud and larger than life. To draw crowds from all walks of life, focus is on humour as well.

||BJP raking up SYL issue to divide farmers, says Jakhar||Chandigarh, December 15 The Punjab Congress today took on the Haryana BJP for raking up the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue at a time when farmers of the both the states were jointly protesting against the three farm laws.   ‚ÄúIt is typical of the BJP to indulge in the divide and rule policy to create a wedge between Punjab and Haryana farmers at a time when they are fighting together against the farm laws. The BJP is apparently trying to browbeat Punjab with such intimidating tactics,‚Äù said state party chief Sunil Jakhar.  ‚ÄúEarlier, they imposed economic sanctions and stopped trains to Punjab to sabotage the farmers‚Äô stir and now, they are trying to rake up an issue that is highly sensitive and emotive for the Punjabis,‚Äù he said. Referring to the meeting of Haryana BJP MPs with Central ministers over the SYL issue, he said it was a highly provocative and insidious act on part of the BJP leadership in Haryana. He pointed out that the SYL issue was currently pending in the Supreme Court. Jakhar said instead of resorting to such mean and divisive tactics to create a divide between farmers of Punjab and Haryana, who had shown exemplary camaraderie and solidarity with each other, BJP leaders should prevail upon the government to withdraw the ‚Äòblack‚Äô laws in the interest of not only the farmers, but the entire country. He reiterated that no matter what diversionary and divisive tactics the BJP may resort to, the Centre would have to repeal these laws that ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù the agricultural economy in the country. ‚ÄúThe sooner you do it, the better it will be for everyone,‚Äù he told the BJP government at the Centre.

As key leaders of the farmers‚Äô protest on the borders of Delhi fall prey to the cold winds, their second-in-commands have taken over, leading the protest with the same zeal.The leaders, who till now were working in the shadow of their more prominent colleagues, are vociferous in their demand for the revocation of the laws.Aware of BJP tacticsWe are monitoring which way the propaganda machinery of the BJP goes. We are cautious that except the farm laws, no other narrative is to be allowed from the stage. ‚Äî Rajinder Singh Deepsinghwala, KKUDr Darshan Pal of the Krantikari Kisan Union and Jagmohan Singh Patiala of the BKU (Dakaunda) were among the prominent leaders of the ‚Äòmorchas‚Äô outside Delhi, who have now fallen ill. Also, many other farm leaders have age and lifestyle-related ailments. It is for this reason that younger leaders like Gurmeet Singh from the Krantikari Kisan Union, Rajinder Singh Deepsinghwala of the Kirti Kisan Union and Jangveer Singh of the Doaba Kisan Committee came forward and sat on a day-long fast yesterday.Talking to The Tribune, Deepsinghwala said the younger leaders were as resolute in demanding the repeal of the farm laws as the elderly. ‚ÄúWe are monitoring which way the propaganda machinery of the BJP goes. We are extremely cautious that except the farm laws, no other narrative is allowed to propagate from the joint stage of all farm unions,‚Äù he said, adding that instructions had been issued to their cadres to practise religious beliefs and prayers only in their tents or individual resting places.Jangveer Singh echoes similar sentiments. Having led many stirs in Punjab in favour of sugarcane farmers, he says he knows how corporates operate and dominate farmers. ‚ÄúIt is for this reason that we are adamant that a stir be launched against the corporate houses who are the intended beneficiaries of the new laws,‚Äù he says.The young farm leaders are also meeting the youth and advising them to maintain the seriousness of the struggle, rather than using their time for fun.

Farmers have also installed huge projection screens and are screening plays for the protesters in Delhi.Several Punjabi songs have gone viral during the ongoing agitation against the Centre‚Äôs farm laws. Many prominent singers who have supported the farmers are planning to come out with more songs to keep the spirits high. Gurpreet, a famous artist from Bathinda, has made many paintings on the farmers‚Äô issue. On Friday, he put up his work on the shutter of a beer and wine shop at the Singhu border. His work of Baba Banda Singh Bahadur and a humorous painting depicting Diljit Dosanjh and Kangana Ranaut attracted many viewers and some of his works were also sold in no time at the protest site.Theatre shares a long relationship with India, dating back to 5,000 years. Even after Independence, Indian street theatre evolved as a means to voice concerns of the common man. It had immediately struck a chord with the masses. Street plays are short and the exchange is close, direct and intimate. To be more effective, these are usually loud and larger than life. To draw crowds from all walks of life, focus is on humour as well.
