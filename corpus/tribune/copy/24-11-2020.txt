24-11-2020||---||Amarinder slams CBI’s latest ‘bid’ to scuttle state’s probe into sacrilege cases||Chandigarh, November 24Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday slammed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) over its tactics to obstruct the state government’s investigation into the Bargari sacrilege case with its false statements in the High Court, which had, in fact, verbally termed the agency’s actions as ‘contemptuous’.Citing the High Court’s verbal observations of Monday, the Chief Minister said the CBI’s attempts to further delay and derail the probe into the sacrilege cases had exposed the central agency’s mal intent, but the state government will not allow it to succeed in its efforts to scuttle the investigations.After itself closing the case without completing the probe into the sacrilege cases, the CBI was now indulging in politically -motivated acts to prevent the state from undertaking and completing its own probe, he said.It is notable that the Punjab & Haryana High Court had on Monday, while dismissing a review petition filed by one of the accused, had orally noted that “these actions of the CBI are contemptuous”. One would have thought CBI would mend its ways, but another affidavit is filed now stating that the CBI has informed the DoPT that the withdrawal of consent by the State is illegal, the Court observed.Either the court’s words had fallen on deaf ears or the CBI was deliberately trying to bury the case and ensure that it does not reach its logical conclusion, said the Chief Minister, adding that it was the shameful conduct of the CBI all through the case that had forced his government to withdraw consent to the agency to probe the matter and also not enter without the state’s prior permission in any other case.Since taking over the sacrilege cases, the Punjab Police have made major strides in solving it, which the CBI, working at the behest of its political masters, clearly was not happy about it, the Chief Minister added.Pointing out that the sacrilege cases were the worst kind of crimes that anyone could have perpetrated on the state and its people, Amarinder said there were evidently interests involved in trying to block the probe and protect the culprits, which he and his government will not allow at any cost.The criminals will be brought to book and justice will be given to the innocent, he asserted, adding that the CBI will not succeed in its manifest bid to stop the investigations by the state police.The Chief Minister said CBI’s failure to hand over the case files to Punjab, followed by its stand in the court, suggested a conspiracy to block the probe by the state. Neither the court nor the state government would accept the lies of the agency in the matter, he added.

Kali nitia karde lagu, oh niyat madi Delhi di” (Punjab stands with you, but Delhi has friendship just for the sake of name, they are implementing black policies, Delhi has bad intentions). The accompanying video shows old farmers and women holding protests against the three laws.Harf Cheema’s song “Tera vaah peya eh kihde naal, tainu dasange sarkare ni’ (Listen government, we’ll tell you what you are up against) is on similar lines.Another singer with a similar protest song is Jass Bajwa, who sings: “Centre di sarkaar rahi sada Jatta layi Gaddar, Jatta tagda hoja (The Centre has always been a traitor for Jatt farmer, Jatts strengthen yourselves)”.Korala Maan (“Dilliye khyal rakh layi, kitte kahi aale modhe te bandook na aa je) and Elly Mangat (Baghi Kisan) also sing about the protest. Mangat’s ‘Baghi Kisan’ tells a story about Baghel Singh, a Sikh general who attacked the Mughals in Delhi in the late 18th century. “Lagda Baghel Singh yaad tainu reha nai (It seems you have forgotten Baghel Singh),” Mangat sings.This comes as several Punjabi singers have already come out in support of farmers in the protest.

He & @sherryontopp are expected to discuss state & national politics over the luncheon meeting. pic.twitter.com/ZhonhvuE9I  The two leaders are expected to discuss state and national politics over the luncheon meeting, Chief Minister's Media Adviser Raveen Thukral tweeted.Sidhu has been lying low ever since his resignation from the state Cabinet in July last year.Political observers told IANS the efforts of Congress' state in charge Harish Rawat have borne results as he was instrumental in pacifying Sidhu.He had called Sidhu a "national asset" because of his reputation as a crowd puller and hinted at a national role for him in the party.Both Amarinder Singh and Sidhu shared the stage on November 4 at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on the farmers' issue where all Punjab Congress MLAs and ministers protested against the Union government over the recently-passed farm laws.Sidhu greeted the Chief Minister before his speech, in which he said that the "Union government wants to suppress the voice of Punjab Chief Minister and MLAs and this will not be allowed".The Chief Minister reciprocated the gesture and mentioned Sidhu's name. Sidhu and Amarinder Singh then attacked the Centre for favouring corporates over the existing system of 'mandis'. — With IANS

We are not against Dera followers or religion. Our enemies are those who are against the Sikh community and who disrespect our Guru.”After the posts, Bathinda police approached Facebook and got Lamma's Facebook page deactivated, but the gangster has now posted from another account.Four days after the murder, Dera followers are yet to cremate the body of their member deceased Manohar Lal. They are staging a protest at Salabatpura Dera in the district claiming that they would cremate the body only after police arrest the killers.

24-11-2020||New Delhi||Centre calls Punjab farmers for second round of talks on December 3||The Centre on Tuesday has said it has invited farmers’ unions from Punjab for the second round of ministerial talks on December 3 to resolve differences over the new agriculture laws.The meeting comes after farmer leaders laid a condition for another central ministerial meeting while calling off their ‘rail roko’ agitation in Punjab on Monday and lifted the nearly two-month-long blockade, allowing resumption of only goods trains.Speaking to PTI, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said: “We have called the representatives of over 30 farmer organisations for the second round of discussion on December 3 at Vigyan Bhawan at 11 am.”Also read: As trains resume in Punjab, farmers block rail traffic in AmritsarThe secretary has sent the invitation to the farmer bodies on behalf of Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar. Food Minister Piyush Goyal is also expected to be present in the meeting.Officials from Food and Agriculture Departments of the Punjab government have also been invited for the talks.The first round of talks was held on November 13 but it remained inconclusive, with both sides sticking to their ground.Punjab farmers have been demanding the repeal of the new farm laws and replace them with another set of laws framed after wider consultation with stakeholders. They also demanded a guarantee on the MSP front, as they claimed that these new laws may lead to the end of minimum support prices (MSP) procurement, which the Centre has denied.When asked about their demand on MSP, the secretary said: “Earlier laws, too, did not have any mention of MSP. Even the new agri-laws do not mention it. MSP is mentioned only in the National Food Security Act (NFSA) which has not been changed. Till Public Distribution System (PDS) is there, MSP will continue.”“The Prime Minister has also stated this and even the Union Agriculture Minister has said in Parliament that MSP will continue,” he added. “We have explained in detail to farmer unions about this issue. Hopefully, we will resolve the issue with them at the December 3 meeting,” he noted. PTI

Sarwan Singh Pandher of the KMSC said their railway blockade entered the 62nd day on Tuesday.Due to the protest, the route of the Golden Temple Express from Mumbai Central to Amritsar had to be diverted via Bias and Tarn Taran. Besides, one goods train had to be stopped at Bhaktawala railway station.V P Singh, ADRM, said the members of the KMSM blocked the railway track around 3.00 am.Also read: Centre calls Punjab farmers for second round of talks on December 3“The members of the farmer’s union insisted that they would allow the trains to move ahead only after checking the trains.

24-11-2020||Saurabh Malik||High Court raps Punjab for skipping liquor quality test||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 23Punjab has little reason to say cheers as far as its investigations into spurious liquor are concerned with the Punjab and Haryana High Court finding that the state was skipping “qualitative tests” to detect whether the liquor flowing in was fit for consumption.Taking a serious view of the omission, Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan has directed the state Director General of Police and the Home Secretary to file affidavits on providing adequate set-up for conducting both quantitative and qualitative tests. Justice Sangwan also made it clear that the police and excise departments were duty-bound to get both quantitative and qualitative tests conducted to find out the contents. If an accused sold spurious liquor in the market after marking it as branded, it could not be said that a direction by the court, the police department or the excise department was required. The assertion came more than three months after more than 100 people died after consuming spurious liquor in Punjab.Justice Sangwan asserted qualitative tests were performed by laboratories through systematic analysis to identify the contents of the samples for determining whether it was unfit for human consumption.Quantitative analysis, on the other hand, was carried out to determine the “absolute or relative substance” present in a sample for finding out the percentage of alcohol/ethyl alcohol. In case of spurious liquor, high percentage of ethyl alcohol could be dangerous.Justice Sangwan added that the SC issued guidelines to the states specifically directing the governments to establish forensic science labs for conducing the quantitative and qualitative tests.“However, it seems that Punjab is not conducting both the tests as and when the samples of liquor, whether spurious or from distilleries of a different state not meant for sale in Punjab, are recovered. An accused can misuse the branding by filling spurious liquor to sell it, leading to hooch tragedy,” Justice Sangwan asserted.

The remaining heritage buildings had been crying for attention.The Shiromani Akali Dal renovated Gobingarh Fort during its tenure and handed it over to a private firm to manage it, but historic Ram Bagh and Summer Palace remains neglected.Gobindgarh Fort located outside Lohgarh Darwaja has a treble line of defance and a deep moat around the outer wall. The fort was built in 1809 by Maharaj Ranjit Singh. The treasury of Maharaja was also kept in the same fort.The most important heritage of the city is the Summer Palace of Mahraja Ranjit Singh in Ram Bagh. The centre of the garden featured a double storey palace (construced in 1819) with a basement, which served as a cold underground chamber.The Heritage Department of the state government has been renovating the palace for the last several years. A huge portion of the garden had been being encroached upon.Rahul, an activist said, "After Lahore, Amritsar city was favourite of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He constructed fort, developed garden, built palace, made walls and gates in the city. Unfortunately, the governments are unable to take care of heritage structures. The city witnesses rush of tourists, but no one is concerned for heritage monuments."

24-11-2020||Chandigarh||No checks, Punjab residents throw mask norms to the wind||Though the state is witnessing another Covid spike, people seem to be showing laxity in wearing masks.A few weeks back, the Health Department carried out a field survey of mask compliance and it was found that a majority of population was wearing a mask though many were wearing it improperly.Majority of population in the industrial town of Ludhiana was seen without a mask. During the recent festival season, it was visible how people had thrown safety norms to the wind.A survey highlighting ‘Public Behaviour Regarding Effective Mask Usage in Ludhiana City’ was recently conducted jointly by a team of DMC Hospital and Ludhiana district police and it was found that 60 per cent of people wore a mask and now, the target was to make the remaining 40 per cent wear it.Dr Rajesh Bagha, Civil Surgeon, said if 90 per cent residents in the district started wearing masks properly, there were 80 per cent chances to control the second wave of Covid, which was expected to arrive in mid-December.A reality check revealed that the situation was not much different in other parts of the state, including Amritsar, Pathankot, Sangrur, Barnala and Faridkot, where residents were still unmindful to adopt the safety protocol. Taking note of the situation, Pathankot Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ishfaq has not only called an emergency meeting of trade union leaders but has also asked SSP Rajinder Singh Sohal to wield the stick no matter how influential the erring person may be.In Bathinda, it seems that people have shown thumbs down to masks and are unfazed by the spike in Covid cases. There is hardly any check by police personnel on the violators.Though cases are rising in Patiala, a random visit to various parts of the city showed that residents were wearing masks in markets but the same was missing in localities with low income groups. In the wake of lack of checks by the authorities concerned, the residents are avoiding masks in the old city area while commuters can be seen wearing a mask to avoid challans.
24-11-2020||Jalandhar||2 Covid deaths in CDPO office,  Jalandhar ashram on toes||The entire staff of Gandhi Vanita Ashram was tested for Covid-19 today after two senior assistants in the office of the Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) East died from the infection.One of the assistants died yesterday, while the other on November 20. Both were 50 years of age. The twin deaths have set alarm bells ringing at the ashram as the CDPO office is the hub of child development and protection services in Jalandhar.The CDPO office plays a supervisory role at the ashram which houses four shelter homes – Children’s Home, Children’s Home for Girls, Observation Home (with a combined strength of about 180 inmates) and the Widows’ Home. The offices of the Child Welfare Committee, Juvenile Justice Board and Pension Department and Government Girls High School are on the ashram premises. Officials are worried about Children’s Home (for runaway girls) which currently has 100 inmates – double the sanctioned limit. Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Das Thori said the testing of inmates had been scheduled for tomorrow.Three supervisors of the CDPO (East) are also currently displaying Covid symptoms. The office remained closed today. Alarmingly, no formal intimation regarding the deaths was made to any of the Gandhi Vanita homes or offices by the District Programme Officer (DPO).CDPO (East) Amrik Singh said: “Two of my junior assistants have died of Covid and three supervisors are symptomatic. We have all been tested today. There is no further instruction yet.”Amarjit Singh Anand, Senior Member of the Child Welfare Committee said, “We have received no formal intimation from the DPO about Covid deaths. Children’s Home houses more inmates that it’s sanctioned capacity. These are basic protocols that need to be followed in the Covid times.”“The entire staff at Gandhi Vanita and DPO office has been tested. They shall be in quarantine until test reports come.

Sekhon has gone underground.Sekhon’s cousin Supreet Sekhon was produced in the court which has extended his police remand by three days.The Amritsar rural police busted an alleged illegal liquor smuggling racket with the arrest of five persons on Saturday. They were identified as Lovepreet Singh of Kaler Kalan, Karanpreet Singh of Kaile Kalan, Pehaljit Singh of Ghuman Kalan, Lovepreet Singh of Ghuman Kalan, all residents of Gurdaspur and Baljinder Singh of Patti (Tarn Taran). Their interrogation led to the arrest of alleged kingpin Supreet Singh, alias Joti Sekhon.Supreet’s interrogation further led to the busting of around eight illegal liquor vends in Patti in Tarn Taran that have been operating without any licence. However, Dhruman Nimbale, SSP, Tarn Taran, said he had sought a report from the excise department about these vends. Excise officials in Tarn Taran said all the vends had been sealed.Police sources said the accused used to label the smuggled liquor and then sell it in different parts of the Majha region.

24-11-2020||Our CorrespondentFerozepur||Trains back on track in Punjab||The train services were partially restored today in the state, exactly two months after they were discontinued on September 24 in the wake of ‘rail roko’ agitation by farmer unions in protest against the Central farm laws.The Railways has first resumed freight and goods train movement in the state. The passenger train services would be restored in a phased manner over the next few days, starting tonight.Tentative plan readyA Lucknow-bound goods train loaded with gypsum today started from Jammu and crossed Punjab in the evening. Another empty BTPN (bogie tank wagon for loading of petrol) was moved from Jalandhar to Delhi in the afternoon.As per the information available, a tentative plan to resume 40 mail and express trains in the region has been chalked by the Northern Railway. Officials said 14 trains would remain cancelled till further orders and 39 partially cancelled or short-terminated.DRM (Ferozepur Division) Rajesh Aggarwal said the plan for the restoration was subject to track safety and clearance to be received by the respective divisions, besides from the state government and security units. In this division, a total of 17 trains would be restored, including eight for Punjab and nine for Jammu and Katra, he said.Treading cautiously, the Railways has put maximum speed limit of 60kmph for security reasons. The DRM said the rail tracks were checked throughout last night by the inspection teams. “After finding the inspection reports satisfactory, the trains were resumed”, said another official, adding it would take a few days for the rail services to limp back to normalcy.

The arrival of the train has been confirmed by the management of the thermal plant. These trains have been started under the green signal given by the Northern Railway Department after inspecting the railway lines.Faced with an acute shortage of coal following the farmers protesting on rail tracks leading to power plant at Baniwala in Mansa district, the TSPL earlier had to stall its power production as it had run out of coal stock.The farmers had been agitating on the rail tracks since October 1, leading to disruption in the coal rake movement. The situation had become serious as other thermal plants across the state had also faced similar situations, but with the start of good trains carrying coal, the situation would improve in coming days. — TNS

Later, he committed suicide by shooting himself.The deceased have been identified as Simran Kaur (20), her father Charanjit Singh Khokhar (45), who worked as a secretary at a cooperative society in Bibiwala village and mother Jaswinder Kaur (43). The youth has been identified as Yuvikaran Singh of Mansa Khurd village.Bathinda SSP Bhupinderjit Singh Virk said, “Three persons were found murdered at a house today after which teams were constituted. The police cracked the case within four hours.” He said the youth, before going to Simran’s house on Sunday night, recorded a video on his phone in which he accused Simran of blackmailing him for getting him implicated in a rape case if he did not marry her.In the video, the youth alleged that he was in a relationship with Simran two years ago but sometime back, he came to know that she was in a relationship with a man in Canada, due to which he broke up with her.Later, she started harassing him to get married to her. When he did not attend her calls, she started calling and harassing his parents. Irked, he took the extreme step.The SSP said the police had seized the weapon used in the crime. It was a licensed weapon registered in the name of his brother. After his death, the family members of Yuvikaran cremated his body without informing anyone.The incident took place on Sunday night around 8.30 pm but came to light on Monday morning when the milkman came, but no one answered the doorbell. After getting the information, the police reached the spot and went inside the house, where they found bodies of three persons in a pool of blood.
24-11-2020||Patiala||Railway porters, catering staff look forward to working again||With a glimmer of hope after a nine-month layoff, licensed porters and kiosk owners at railway stations now expect to make both ends meet as farmers have allowed train services to resume in and via Punjab.Out of business ever since the lockdown in March and later after the farmer agitation, porters and railway caterers are hopeful of coming out of their financially harsh days.An integral part of the railway station scene since the colonial times, porters have been the worst hit. “Last time, I saw a hundred rupee note was in January. Following the lockdown and trains being cancelled, I have been borrowing and eating into my limited resources,” says Bhanu Singh, a porter for past two decades. “This has been the worst year of my life when managing daily ration also became tough,” he adds.When travel restrictions were imposed in March to check the spread of Covid, coolies were among the first to lose their livelihood as there were no passengers who needed them to carry their luggage. “Life has been tough. My wife now works as a maid in houses while my son is working at a local shop as a helper,” says Pritpal, another coolie.“We have been surviving on chutney-roti or sometimes just on roti. I had to borrow money against my goats at my ancestral village but still, survival was tough,” Pritpal says. A similar situation was faced by kiosk owners or caterers selling tea and other eatables at railway platforms. What went against them was that though they work for the Railways, they are not exactly railway employees.“We get some relaxation for travelling in trains but we do not receive salary from the Railways. Though the licence fee renewal was waived after March 31, work and money stopped coming. My shop has been closed since March and when I opened it for a few days, the farmers blocked train movement and again, I suffered losses,” says Mangat Rai, a kiosk owner at Patiala railway station.There are around 20,000 coolies across the country. Of them, around 300 work at different stations of Punjab.

He has already started having “deliberation” sessions with SGPC members. Gobind Singh Longowal, the incumbent president, has successfully completed his third term. He headed the SGPC in 2017, 2018 and again in 2019.In the absence of any “suitable” face in the existing body, he might be told to continue for another term.However, speculations are also rife about a change in the command of the Sikhs’ body which has invited the ire of the global Sikh community due to the 328 missing ‘saroops’ of Guru Granth Sahib and misappropriation by its officials and staff members while indicating sheer lack of administrative control.Though the SGPC had dismissed or suspended the erring officials, submitted public apology beforethe Akal Takht and faced religious punishment, the resentment againstthe SGPC never died.Earlier too, the command was changed in 2016 after a crisis erupted due to the flip-flop exoneration of Dera Sirsa cult in 2015 when Kirpal Singh Badungar succeeded Avtar Singh Makkar. Nonetheless, SGPC’s former chief Bibi Jagir Kaur and veteran SAD leader Tota Singh are in the race for the post.Bibi Jagir Kaur (66) said that it would be the party’s discretion to choose the candidate, but admitted the administrative lapse that led to disappearance of ‘saroops’ and leniency in handling it. “Whosoever occupies the coveted seat ought to be a vigilant and a strong administrator,” she said.Tota Singh (79), the old guard of the party, said, “I am not projecting myself to head the SGPC, but I would have no hesitation if the party considers my experience.”As per information, Sukhbir Badal will hold a customary meeting with the members on November 26 before opening the cards.On the other hand, dissident Akali parties including SAD (Democratic), SAD (Taksali) and other Sikh organisations may try to incorporate their members in the 15-member executive body.
24-11-2020||Chandigarh||Cane crushing starts, growers await last year’s dues||The cane season in Punjab has begun, but without the state advised price (SAP) being announced by the government and without the dues of growers being cleared for the last year’s crushing season.As farmers begin to get their cane to sugar mills, both private and cooperative, they are accepting their cane for crushing without committing to the price at which they accept cane. For the past three years cane has been bought by sugar mills at Rs 295- Rs 310 per quintal as the state government has not increased the SAP.This time round, farmers are demanding an increase in the SAP of cane to at least Rs 360 per quintal as Haryana has raised the SAP to Rs 350 per quintal. Jangveer Singh, a cane grower from Tanda, told The Tribune that the prices of sugar were hovering at Rs 3,400 per quintal and were unlikely to fall even in the wake of high production as the Centre had allowed the use of sugar to make ethanol. “Thus farmers should get a better price for their produce,” he said. Farmers are also angry that 14 of the 16 sugar mills (nine cooperative and five private) are yet to release their last season dues. While five private sugar mills owe Rs 132 crore, cooperative mills collectively owe Rs 118 crore to the farmers.Sources in the Agriculture Department said among the private mills, Phagwara mill alone owed Rs 73.50 crore, while the one at Keeri Afghans owed Rs 37 crore to farmers. The mills at Amloh and Dasua have cleared their dues. “We have initiated the recovery proceedings against defaulters, including the owners of the Phagwara mill. Other than this, all others have assured that they will clear pending payments within 10 days,” said a senior officer.

He held a meeting with police officers and is expected to submit his report to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on the prevailing situation.The state government this time is in no mood to take any chances as Bathinda was the epicenter of the 2007 dera-Sikh clash. The Sacha Sauda sect wields considerable influence in the Malwa region of Punjab.Despite the fact that the Sukha Gill Lamme gang has taken the responsibility for the killing and there’s CCTV footage of the incident, the police have failed to make any breakthrough in the case yet.The pressure is mounting on the police as Dera followers are adamant on continuing the protest and not cremating the body till the killers are arrested.Dera followers claim seven persons owing allegiance to the sect have been murdered in the recent past and the administration has failed to bring the guilty to justice. Dera member Manohar Lal was shot dead at his shop at Bhagta Bhaika in the district on Friday. Manohar Lal is the father of Jatinderbir Singh Jimmy Arora, who is accused in a sacrilege incident at Gurusar village in Bathinda. — TNS
24-11-2020||Muktsar||FIRs fail to stop crop inflow from other Punjab||Despite numerous FIRs registered in various parts of the state, paddy and cotton-laden trucks and tractor-trailers from other states are still coming here.For instance, the district police yesterday seized a truck carrying 750 bags of paddy crop coming from Rajasthan. Further, seven tractor-trailers loaded with cotton crop from Rajasthan were seized in Gidderbaha last week.In such a situation, the farmers and officials of Punjab Mandi Board are on alert. Notably, this practice had started last month.After a report on traders buying paddy from UP, selling it in Punjab mandis’ appeared in The Tribune, the police launched a crackdown against those bringing farm produce from other states.Ranjit Singh, a farmer, said, “We are still vigilant and intercepting vehicles bringing the crop from other states. The traders are making quick money after buying the crop at a cheaper price. They are also evading the market committee fee and manipulating the figures of crop yield of our state.”In the past, the paddy crop from faraway states like UP and MP too had come here. Sources said that nearly 80 vehicles had been intercepted this harvesting season in this district alone. A senior police officer said that whenever they get any complaint in this regard, they take quick action. Normally, such cases are being registered under Section 420 of the IPC. Sources however claimed that though the cases were being registered, hardly anyone was arrested in such cases.

24-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab has power to investigate sacrilege cases, reiterates High Court||The Punjab and Haryana High Court today virtually reiterated that the Punjab Government had the power to probe sacrilege cases by dismissing a review application filed by an accused in the matter.Applicant Sukhjinder Singh was seeking review of Justice Rajan Gupta’s order dated January 25, 2019, upholding a Vidhan Sabha resolution to withdraw consent for a CBI probe. The order was upheld by a Division Bench and attained finality after the Supreme Court turned down the CBI’s plea on the technical ground of delay in approaching it.‘Issue argued and settled’Justice Rajan Gupta asserted the issue was extensively argued and settled. It was held the government was competent to withdraw pending FIR’s probe, if it was transferred by it to the CBI. For the purpose, the Bench had already interpreted Supreme Court judgment in the case of Kazi Lhendup Dorji versus the CBISukhjinder Singh, among other things, claimed the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act granted the state the power to give consent for a CBI probe. But the Act did not have a provision for permitting the state to withdraw such consent.Justice Gupta, during the course of hearing, observed the consent’s withdrawal had already been argued and settled by the High Court. As such, it was pointless to agitate the issue as the matter had attained finality up to the Supreme Court.Responding, his counsel submitted the applicant was never a party before the court during the first round of litigation. Secondly, the FIRs — subject matter of the first round — were separate. Two FIRs on the police firing were never investigated by the CBI and were withdrawn before the files could physically be handed over.Justice Gupta asserted the issue was extensively argued and settled. It was held the government was competent to withdraw pending FIR’s probe, if it was transferred by it to the CBI. For the purpose, the Bench had already interpreted Supreme Court judgment in the case of Kazi Lhendup Dorji versus the CBI.Punjab Advocate General Atul Nanda submitted a Division Bench dismissed appeal filed by original writ petitioner Charanjit Singh. The applicant was not a party to the original writ petition and could not file a review. Nanda also relied on three Supreme Court and High Court judgements on the issue.Meanwhile, Justice Gupta’s Bench was apprised about a letter dated July 29, 2019, by the Special DGP, Directorate of Bureau of Investigation, to the CBI, forwarding certain new/relevant information on sacrilege cases. Questioning Nanda on the letter’s veracity, Justice Gupta asked whether the action amounted to contempt of courts and a breach of Vidhan Sabha privilege.Nanda clarified that the action was without jurisdiction and an Additional Chief Secretary had written to the Union Secretary, DOPT, with a copy to the CBI Director for return of cases to the state.

Parents of thalassaemia-affected children have written to the AIIMS, Bathinda, requesting them for treatment.Notably, HIV-positive blood was transfused to three children and a woman over a period of two months here.Many patients who have received blood here in the past over 8 to 10 months have started getting themselves tested.President of a city-based NGO said, “Fearing their safety, donors are scared to even visit the vicinity of the Civil Hospital here where the blood bank unit is situated. Whenever we get calls for blood requirement, we further call prospective donors, but now, nobody is interested. Apart from us, there are four more NGOs in the city that are working to arrange blood for needy patients, but after this incident, things have changed.”As per records of the blood bank unit, 92 units of blood are available which are lesser than the required volume. There has been a significant decline in blood donations. A senior functionary at the blood bank unit said, “After the incident, there is a sense of fear among both donors and those who need transfusion.”Dr Manjit Singh, Director, Health and Family Welfare, Punjab, said, “A probe committee constituted by the Health Department has submitted its report to the Principal Secretary and further to the Health Minister.”

||The limited impact of the roko agitation||The farmers’ agitation in Punjab has shown us the limits of roko andolans in contemporary India. They inevitably peter out unless they are for a just cause. This would be the second major roko andolan to happen in the past year. The previous one was the Shaheen Bagh protest in Delhi, where mostly Muslim women blocked an entire market street against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019. The anti-CAA protest fizzled out after a hundred days.It was Gandhi who perfected andolan techniques during the non-cooperation movement in 1920-22. The andolan has to be for satya — truth — Gandhi would say. Erik Erikson, the psychiatrist who studied Gandhi’s techniques of non-violent protest, pointed out that before launching an agitation, Gandhi made efforts to build bridges with his opponents. His success came from the fact that he put in great effort to formulate a non-negotiable demand which was also just. It was just not from the point of view of the protestors, but also that of those against whom the protest was being carried out.However, not everyone has the stamina, wisdom or ability to reach out to opponents as Gandhi had. The leaders of farmers today certainly don’t have it.Farmers in Punjab came out on the streets on the September 25, to protest against the farm laws that the Modi government had brought in. In Punjab, which prides itself on being a farming state, the cause was emotive enough for a large number of people to come forward to support the farmers. Patwaris, traders, unions of various state government employees, commission agents, dairy farmers, singers, artistes and all major political parties came out in support. Even many from the BJP announced their support. How far this support was because people genuinely believed in the cause is anyone’s guess.The farmers’ leadership, coming from some 31 different politically active groupings, insisted that unless the laws were withdrawn, the farmers would stop work across the state — and also force other people to stop work. This has been a fairly common way of protesting in India. Usually, it meets with a fair amount of social approval, if not indifference, leaves the participants quite elated, irrespective of whether it achieves its goals or not. But then, achieving a goal is seldom the objective of such a protest. Showing annoyance is.In the present instance, the first step in this protest was to stop all movement on major roads. With more than 50,000 trucks entering Punjab every day just from the Shambhu barrier, the stoppage of roads was bound to have a serious impact. It did. Not on the economy or the government or the political parties, but on the truckers manning these vehicles. Their trucks were stranded. Within a few days, reports came in that the truckers had started an agitation of their own. They wanted the roads to be opened so that they could go back home. That was the first major setback for the farmers’ agitation. They had to open the roads.The farmers did ensure that all movement became toll-free. This, however, would have hurt only the concessionaire and none else. The concessionaires were not bothered about losing revenue in this way since their contracts state that they can collect revenues till such time that they recover the cost of the roads, plus a little more. If stopping toll collection pleased the farmers, made them imagine that they were empowered, then the concessionaire wasn’t going to disabuse them of such fancies. The losses could always be recouped at a later date from the same farmers.The farm agitation then shifted to the railway tracks. Stopping the movement of trains is a preferred action in any agitation in India. Once in a while, trains are also burnt to demonstrate the intensity of the agitation. One such burnt train has been standing on the sidings in Jalandhar since 2009, when the locals had decided to express their annoyance at a happening in far off Vienna.The agitating farmers in 2020 hadn’t burnt any train. But their insistence on stopping all trains did cause hurt all around. Some trains had been stopped since September 24. Meanwhile, the initiative of the Punjab Assembly to pass laws that tried to rescind the impact of the laws that the Parliament had passed did not seem to appease the farmers, though they welcomed the Assembly’s initiative. The blockade of trains was extended to all tracks on October 1.No one complained about it for a few days. The military, which was stocking up materiel in the Himalayas to challenge the Chinese incursion in Leh-Ladakh, quietly shifted to transporting its goods by trucks, though movement by truck is almost twice as costly as that by railroad. By the third week of the rail roko stir, however, some people had started complaining about shortages.Farmers, those who were cultivating their lands, complained about the shortage of fertilisers and other agricultural inputs that would have come by train. Industrialists complained about their inability to meet with export commitments since trains had been stopped. Manufacturers rued the absence of material to manufacture.None of this evoked a positive response from the farmers till the thermal power plants in Punjab reported that they had exhausted their coal reserves and, in the absence of fresh supplies, were planning to shut down the generation of electricity. The fear of power outages seemed to have had an impact. Which is surprising, considering that till just a few years ago, everyone in Punjab was living with long power outages. But this time, the issue of electricity shortage seemed to be emotive enough.On October 21, the leaders of agitating farmers announced that they would allow the movement of goods trains. Now, it was the turn of the railway management to baulk and insist that it would run trains only if all tracks were vacated and the movement of all trains allowed.As of today, the farmers remain insistent that they would suffer if the farm laws are implemented. Whether the public believes this is yet to be seen.
