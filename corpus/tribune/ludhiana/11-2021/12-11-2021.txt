The teachers said the candle march was aimed to wake up the authorities and take note of their grievances.The protesting teachers said they held a three-hour-long dharna at SCD Government College and classes were suspended to protest against the non-fulfilment of two main long standing demands of the teachers, namely inordinate delay in the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission and de-linking the pay scales of teachers from UGC pay scales.The protesting teachers claimed that the Seventh Pay Commission has been implemented in the entire country, except in Punjab. A delegation of the teachers had met Education Minister Pargat Singh and Education Secretary Krishan Kumar but nothing has been done to fulfil their demands till date due to which they carried out the candle march to mark their protest.“The apathetic attitude of the government and Higher Education Department for the past so many years is the reason behind the decline in the level of education and regular brain drain from Punjab to abroad. If the government does not do anything conclusive soon, the stir will be intensified,” the teachers said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/college-teachers-take-out-candle-march-in-ludhiana-337099

The deep excavation for two levels of basement at the site has led to several road accidents. At two occasions, cars and other four vehicles have skidded down into the dugout area during the rainy season.”Further, most of the streetlights around the site were non-functional and the abandoned project site had been converted into a garbage dump. To make the matters worse, rainwater from sewer pipes and road gullies was getting drained into the project site, which posed a big health hazard to residents with the potential outbreak of diseases, they said.The petitioners added that due to massive digging and rainwater or sewer waste accumulating in the deep pit, roads and streets around the project site had caved in a number of times necessitating repair and reconstruction of roads and streets at a heavy expenditure, which could have been avoided with bare minimum upkeep of the site.The residents wanted directions to the LIT authorities for putting up protective fence or iron sheets around the site, put proper rainwater drainage system in place and take necessary remedial steps to stop the project site from becoming a garbage dumping site.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-improvement-trust-colony-residents-move-rights-panel-over-unsafe-city-centre-project-site-337104
