As a result, vehicular traffic between Ludhiana and Chandigarh, Ludhiana and Jalandhar and Ludhiana and Delhi remained disrupted for several hours today.Motorists, bus passengers and other commuters had a tough time as thousands of vehicles remained stranded on the Ludhiana-Delhi GT Road and Ludhiana-Chandigarh road. In the traffic snarl-up, some police vehicles and ambulances were also stuck and there were reports of exchange of heated arguments between the protesters and those held up in the traffic jam.Swinging into action after protesters blocked Samrala Chowk, the city traffic police issued an advisory for diversion of traffic. Accordingly, Chandigarh-bound traffic from the Jalandhar side was diverted via Tajpur Road, while Delhi-bound vehicles were advised to take route of Jagraon Bridge and Sherpur Chowk.Senior police officials said since the police were aware of the proposed protest by Sikh organisations today, adequate timely measures were taken to avoid traffic congestion at Samrala Chowk and elsewhere in the city. “Vehicular traffic from Jalandhar to Firozepur has been asked to take the route of Ladhowal Bypass from the toll plaza, while traffic from the Firozepur side towards Delhi is being diverted through Southern Bypass to Doraha,” said a police official.Clearing the air over alleged delay in the arrest of Anil Arora, prime accused in the case registered against him and others on October 20 for showing disrespect to Sri Guru Nanak Dev, Commissioner of Police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar had issued a video message on Monday evening that till now the police had arrested seven co-accused and conspirators in the case.Bhullar had assured the city residents that the police were leaving no stone unturned to nab the prime accused and in this connection the police had raided the residence of one person here on charges of harbouring a fugitive (Anil Arora). The accused person, identified as Umesh Kumar Gandhi, was arrested and on the basis of information provided by him, a bag containing Rs 10 lakh was recovered from the house of one of Arora’s relatives. He said several police teams are on the hunt for Anil Arora and he would be arrested very soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/disrespect-to-guru-nanak-alleging-police-inaction-protesters-block-samrala-chowk-for-hours-336307

The bridge located near Chand Cinema is in a dilapidated condition.The design for the reconstruction of the bridge was prepared by Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) and the estimated cost of the project was Rs 5.84 crore. No firm came forward to place a bid for the project, according to officials.The old bridge, which is said to be more than 100 years’ old, was declared unsafe by an engineer of the GNDEC around 10 years ago but the MC has failed to reconstruct the bridge till date. However, the bridge was closed for the movement of heavy vehicles in 2018. Earlier this year, it was closed for all kinds of vehicles, except two-wheelers, by constructing a wall on the road.Superintending Engineer, MC, Teerath Bansal said no bidder came forward to participate in the tendering process, but a contractor had raised a query about the estimated cost of the project. He said the contractor claimed the estimated cost is low. “We have written to the GNDEC over a query regarding the estimated cost of the reconstruction of the bridge. After getting a reply from the GNDEC, we would take further action,” he added.Currently, the safety walls of the bridge are in a poor state, while bricks commonly fall off from the bridge on the road, with commuters passing underneath it.Keemti Rawal of the Mahatar Sathi Jagriti Manch, said, “The bridge was declared unsafe a long time ago but it has not been reconstructed till date due to apathy of the department and elected representatives concerned. The project to reconstruct the bridge was earlier ignored during the tenure of the SAD-BJP government. The reconstruction of the bridge is still hanging fire during the tenure of the Congress government. The authorities should take required steps for the early reconstruction of the bridge over the Buddha Nullah.”Commissioner, MC, Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal said they would take the required steps for the reconstruction of the bridge.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/reconstruction-of-buddha-nullah-bridge-tenders-fail-6th-time-336309

At the same time, they urged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who talks about his mind through ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme, at least once, should listen to call of the businessmen.They reiterated their main demand that if the government forms a regulatory committee, the inflation could be curbed. They said when the government itself considers businessmen as the backbone of the economy, why is it doing those things to break them. In fact, inflation has broken the backbone of the industry.The businessmen warned the government that if the industry did not survive, there would be a serious crisis of livelihood for crores of workers associated with it. The industry did not stopped working even during the Covid-induced economic crisis. Despite that, the burden of tax was imposed on them. Now, industrialists only want that the unbridled prices of raw materials should come down. Besides, electricity, diesel and essential facilities should be provided at subsidised rates. Otherwise, they will be compelled to take the path of agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-bizmen-observe-fast-of-silence-over-inflation-336313
