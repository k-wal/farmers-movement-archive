The education and health sectors will be improved too,” he said.Grewal had joined Congress before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections but returned to the AAP fold earlier this year.Meetings with peopleIn Ludhiana, AAP leaders are conducting ‘nukkad’ meetings and paying door-to-door visits to make people aware about the promises made by Kejriwal.The party also organised an event to hear the problems faced by the auto and taxi drivers in Ludhiana.After the event, AAP chief and Delhi CM Kejriwal also visited auto driver Dilip Tiwari’s home for dinner.The party is also planning to campaign through autos.
