As per the target fixed in the contract, the physical progress on the project work was expected to complete 30 per cent till October end.Under the project, the scope of work included construction of two new sewage treatment plants (STPs) of 225 MLD and 60 MLD each at Jamalpur and Balloke, respectively, six new intermediate pumping stations (IPS) on the banks of the Buddha Nullah to divert the waste water, laying pipeline along the nullah banks to carry waste water from IPS to respective STP, two effluent treatment plants (ETPs) of 2.25 MLD and 3.75 MLD capacity each for handling waste water flow from dairy complexes at Tajpur road and Haibowal, rehabilitation of two existing STPs of 111 MLD and 152 MLD on UASB technology at Bhattian and Balloke, respectively, one-time repair and overhauling of existing two STPs of 50 MLD and 105 MLD based on SBR technology at Bhattian and Balloke, besides operation and maintenance of all these components for 10 years after construction and 21 months during the construction period.As of date, the work on 225 MLD new STP was completed 16 per cent, six ILPs 10 per cent, pipeline 50 per cent, rehabilitation of existing 111 MLD STP 20 per cent, repair and overhauling of 50 MLD STP 57 per cent, and 105 MLD STP 43 per cent.“The goal of the project is to close all the outlets from where the waste water enters into the Buddha Nullah, collecting and transferring the flow of these outlets to the nearby sewage treatnebt plants, which will treat the waste water to ensure that no untreated water flows into the nullah,” said the Municipal Corporation Commissioner.The work, which was awarded to a Mumbai-based joint venture group at the capital cost of Rs 519 crore besides the operation and maintenance cost of Rs 321 crore, is scheduledto be completed by December 1, 2022.The project was launched to check the existing 625 MLD untreated domestic waste water discharged directly into the nullah and the future discharge, if any.The major work under the rejuvenation of the 47.55-km-long Buddha Nullah has been awarded for the domestic waste water management.Experienced agencyThe joint venture group, which was undertaking the project, has experience of executing several sewerage and STP projects at Aurangabad, Navi Mumbai, Nashik, Udaipur, Goa, Tiptur (Karnataka). The Aurangabad project, costing Rs 464 crore, included construction, operation and maintenance of 161 MLD STP.

Not only lungs, but cardiac problems also increase during this time of the year. Blood vessels are affected. There are chances of forming a blood clot and increase in stroke cases during this time.”Dr Mohan further said, “Those, who have recovered from Covid recently, might have a difficult time after they were exposed to high levels of pollution.

The land was a garbage dump and could not be put to use for the intended purpose.“After sustained efforts, the then government had got an estimate prepared from the civic body for lifting garbage, leveling the land, construction of a boundary wall, sheds and provisions of erecting gates, water supply, power supply at an estimate expenditure of Rs 2.84 crore. Accordingly, a grant of Rs 2.84 crore was released by the government on January 4, 2017,” Ahmad claimed.He further alleged that for unknown reasons, the work was not taken in hand nor were any valid reasons given due to which the said grant lapsed and was sent back to the government.“Muslim community has been denied the use of an amenity provided by the government for past several years just because of some administrative glitch,” said Ahmad.Deputy Commissioner Virendra Kumar Sharma, however, rubbished the allegations saying to his knowledge no such grant had been received or lapsed. He said in January 2017 the ‘Model Code of Conduct’ was in force for the Assembly elections and no grant could be released during that period. A section of the Muslim community was being misled over a ‘non-issue’ and those holding protest must get their facts right, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/muslims-protest-over-denial-of-burial-ground-on-tibba-road-in-ludhiana-337543
