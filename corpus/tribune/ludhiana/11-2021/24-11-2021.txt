24-11-2021||Manav Mander||Political narratives change as Cong goes ‘innovative’||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, November 23The Punjab politics has turned upside down in the past two months. The unexpected bang of Charanjit Singh Channi becoming the first Dalit Chief Minister of the state signalled that the next election is truly underway. The Congress has proved that it is going ‘innovative’ with its political strategies.The CM face for the upcoming poll has not been revealed yet and Harish Chaudhary, Punjab Congress affairs In-charge, during his visit to Ludhiana did not reveal party cards about the CM face and instead, said they would fight under collective leadership.Channi may not be a popular leader but with this, the Congress has indicated that they are moving a step forward by shunning away dependence on the Jat Sikh leadership. The Channi card played well, especially for the Dalit population, as the state has the highest 32 per cent of Dalit population in the country. Channi, who always portrayed himself as a ‘common man’, is trying to give a direct competition to AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal.A Dalit residing in old Ludhiana city said he never thought anybody among them could lead the state. “He is one among us and listens to people’s problems and also solves them on the spot. My heart and soul is with him.”Now that the BJP has announced to repeal the three controversial farm laws, it has created ripples in the political circles and other parties are worried if this can lead to political gain to the BJP in the coming elections.CM Channi while addressing a party workers’ meeting in Ludhiana said farmers had to remain vigilant till the draconian farm laws were repealed.He said fresh conspiracies were being hatched to harm the interests of the farmers, besides derailing progress and prosperity of the state. At the same time, Channi is also trying to strike a chord with rural population after he announced free water and low power bills after taking charge in the poll-bound state but the rural populace only wants their loans to be waived off as promised by the Congress government when it was formed.HS Lakhowal, general secretary of the BKU, said farmers could not get fooled by these announcements and now, he knows that these were also mere an eyewash. “The Congress when came to power in the state promised to waive off loans and after over four years also, the main demand of the farmers is loan waiver. We will support Channi only if he waives off the same while rest of everything is a gimmick,” Lakhowal said.Freebies’ announcement scares bizmenOn the other hand, industrialists are frightened from Channi due to freebies he is announcing since he took over.“Freebies are being announced majorly for the farm sector and those belonging to the industry is worried as to who will bear the burden of these freebies. We do not trust the Finance Minister as earlier he said the state exchequer is empty and now, he says they have money. How can the situation change all of a sudden,” said BadishJindal, president of the Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association.A senior Congress leader said: “It was Sidhu who triggered this transition. Channi is doing a good job but as everybody knows he is a short-term CM. The switch will help the party to some extent but the question now remains is that who will be the CM candidate for the upcoming poll and that can be one of the major deciding factors for voters,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/political-narratives-change-as-cong-goes-innovative-342182

For the past few weeks, my father-in-law and his sisters had been trying to throw me and my children out of the house. I had been physically and mentally tortured. Despite filling complaints, no action is being taken against the guilty, “the woman alleged.She alleged that recently her father-in-law had thrown her and four children out of the house and she was forced to stay with her mother.The woman said today she had come to hold a protest at the CP’s office where she had also planned to commit suicide by immolating herself. She alleged that after her suicide, the police might take action against her father-in-law and other suspects.When the woman was raising an alarm, Commissioner of Police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar was entering the office premises and after noticing her, he called the woman and listened to her grievances.“I have been assured by the CP that justice will be delivered either by registering a case or by making me to live at my husband house amicably. The CP marked a probe into the matter. I have full faith in the top cop’s assurance,” Harpreet said.Notably, yesterday when Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi came to Ludhiana, the woman had also attempted to meet him but the CM’s security did not let her to meet him.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-woman-threatens-to-immolate-herself-at-office-of-top-cop-342183

As I was returning home in Ludhiana, I realised that all roads were blocked.

The increase in tax rate will hamper the domestic trade as well as the exports. —  Upkar Singh Ahuja, CICU president Rajat Sood, a senior member of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) and representative of the textile industry, said the textile trade was badly hit by Covid-19 and was still struggling for its survival. “Under such circumstances, this increase in tax rates on textile will be a setback to textile Sector,” he said.CICU president Upkar Singh Ahuja and general secretary Pankaj Sharma said there was no tax on textile/fabrics for a number of years. “Bringing the textile industry under the tax net again will lend a big blow to the entire textile industry,” said Ahuja.The CICU had made a representation immediately after the last GST council meeting, in which it was proposed to correct the inverted duty structure on textile.It was requested on behalf of the industry that the status quo be maintained at five per cent. However, instead of reducing the rate, a notification was issued to increase the tax, said Ahuja.“This will not only add to the financial burden of the end user but will also affect small businessmen and will encourage tax evasion and malpractice,” he said.“This increase in tax rate will not just hamper the domestic trade, but will also affect the exports,” said Ahuja, adding that “on one hand the government talks about ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, on the other hand it levies such high taxes, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and gloom”.The Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings has also written to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, urging her to introduce a single rate without any cap and category on value.The trade body also requested her to withdraw the notification regarding increase in tax rate.This action of the government will not only boost the economy, but will create an atmosphere of hope and certainty. If this request and the condition of the textile industry is not taken seriously, the entire industry will suffer, maintained the industrialists.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-textile-industry-in-shock-over-govts-decision-to-increase-tax-342187

In many cases, even the grills put up on the foot paths are being pulled down to make these properties accessible from the main road.Harassed by the illegal construction, increasing traffic due to commercial activity and illegal change of land use by the allottees, the residents have lodged a complaint with the Principal Secretary, Local Government, Punjab, and the Chief Vigilance Officer, Local Government, Punjab, seeking their intervention in stopping the fast commercialisation of the residential colony.The affected residents said in some parts of the colony, two to three residential plots had been clubbed together to raise commercial complexes in violation of the terms and conditions of the allotment. Despite lodging complaints, no action has apparently been taken to check the menace of illegal commercial construction in the colony, they said.“The worst part is that the very officials who are supposed to regulate construction and ensure compliance with the building bylaws are conniving with the unscrupulous builders and are in a way promoting illegal commercial activity in the colony,” said a complaint.The residents have demanded a high-level enquiry into the violation of building bylaws, illegal change of land use and violation of terms and conditions of allotment of residential plots. At the same time, responsibility of the officials be fixed and strict disciplinary action taken against delinquent and negligent employees and officials, they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/sbs-nagar-residents-raise-voice-against-illegal-construction-342190
