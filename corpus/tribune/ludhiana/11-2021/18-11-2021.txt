The latter have been developing illegal colonies across the city, especially on the periphery, and hoodwinking people to invest their hard-earned money in such colonies.Officials Hand in glove with violatorsField staff and supervisory officials (of GLADA) are hand in glove with the unscrupulous developers. Most of the illegal colonies are being developed in or around Ludhiana with their tacit approval and big money is involved in the unlawful activity.—  A developerGS Lamba, president of the Punjab Colonisers and Property Dealers Association, however, disagrees and attributes the proliferation of illegal colonies all across the city, and elsewhere in Punjab, firstly to wrong policies, which had failed to meet the aspirations of the common man, and secondly to the non-implementation of policies by bureaucrats who were not accountable to people.He said getting approval and licence and thereafter payment of hefty internal and external development works for a colony with a saleable area of less than 50 per cent, had become a expensive proposition with the result that a majority of developers go for carving out unlicensed and illegal colonies.“Rather than paying hefty licence fee and other charges per acre of land, it is cheaper to develop an illegal colony, pay bribes to officials of the regulatory body and sell plots at cheaper rates and make the most of it; is the common feeling among developers,” says another property developer.The sheer official number of nearly 2,000 (unofficially the figure is around 5,000) illegal colonies in the industrial hub of the state was a statement in itself of the enormity of the problem and exemplified the inability of the regulatory body to come to terms with the situation.According to a social activist, Rachpal Singh, prohibitive prices of residential and commercial land in approved colonies make people with limited resources to go for purchasing plots in unlicensed colonies even though buyers were made to suffer due to the failure of unscrupulous developers to provide promised amenities in such colonies.“Negligence on part of the regulatory authority (GLADA in case of Ludhiana) is evident from the manner in which plots are being carved out by developers on agricultural land, and residential plots/commercial sites in these colonies are being advertised without any mention of license number or approval from the competent authority,” said Rachpal.Another property developer said in the absence of effective regulatory measures, unsuspecting people were falling prey to the wooing tactics of the developers and were buying properties in colonies that hold no promise for provision of even the basic amenities and planned development. Without mincing words he also accused GLADA officials of “dereliction” and charged them with “conniving” with unscrupulous developers.The developer maintained that lax attitude of the regulatory body towards enforcement of provisions of the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA) indeed point towards the involvement of field staff and officials of regulatory authority (GLADA) in the development of illegal colonies in every nook and corner of the city.“Field staff and supervisory officials (of GLADA) are hand in glove with the unscrupulous developers and most of the illegal colonies are being developed in or around Ludhiana with their tacit approval and big money is involved in the unlawful activity,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/illegal-colonies-mushroom-slack-enforcement-by-glada-to-blame-339678
