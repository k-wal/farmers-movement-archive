There is no information about cut-off marks and the normalisation process.”“Now, a large number of aspirants who had appeared for the written exam were feeling cheated. Those having lesser marks than us have been made eligible for the next stage. We want the government to make public OMR test sheets, written exam marks, residence addresses and other information of all candidates who have been declared eligible for the next phase of the recruitment process. Moreover, it should be made clear that whether the eligible declared candidates had passed Punjabi subject in Class X,” he said.Another protesting candidate claimed: “Some, who have lesser marks than my marks, have been declared eligible for the physical test and screening. I had been preparing for written and physical exams for long. I am not satisfied with the ongoing recruitment process. It is totally unfair.”The protesters also demanded that the government should ensure 10,000 constables be recruited in a transparent manner otherwise they will intensify their agitation.

Already, illegal colonies as well as unplanned industrial areas were lacking green belts and parks. Further, due to no checks on residential buildings being used for commercial activities, there was already an increase in the movement of vehicles in the locality, causing an increase in air pollution too.The CoE president said in the notice that in an earlier petition filed by the body with the NGT (OA 168 of 2021) against illegal conversion of green belt into 33 plots and construction of a road directions were issued to the Principal Secretary of the Local government Department which said: “We are of the view that the issue raised can be examined on merits by the Principal Secretary, Department of Local Bodies, Punjab, in coordination with the LIT, which may take a decision expeditiously and as far as possible within two months.”Asserting that in the wake of directions of the Supreme Court and the NGT, it was clear that the LIT was working in contrary to all such directions and provisions by its act of converting designated park into a parking area for vehicles, the CoE pleaded that the Trust be immediately restrain from any such act of fixing of interlocking tiles in the designated park, failing which the petitioner could move the NGT for redressal of the legitimate grievance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/engineers-body-serves-notice-on-state-344509

Even Haryana has reduced its unemployment rate from 9.3 per cent to 6.9 per cent in last three years. Punjab's position is stagnant as it just reduced unemployment from 7.4 per cent to 7.3 per cent in the last three years.A few large scale industries are availing 85 per cent subsidy. The micro and small industry is being ignored by the government. — Badish Jindal, President, FOPSIA The Punjab Government is providing Rs2,100 crore as power subsidy to industries. Besides, the government is also providing electricity duty incentive of around Rs700 crore and other benefits to industries under the Invest Punjab Scheme.The FOPSIA president, Badish Jindal, however, said, "85 per cent subsidy is availed by few large scale industries. The micro and small industry is fully ignored in the Invest Punjab Policy whereas 90 per cent employment is generated by this sector only."In a letter written to the Chief Minister, Punjab, Jindal said the Invest Punjab Policy proved to be a major failure in providing employment to the local youth in the state. The incentives were based on the power consumption or investment of the industry, he added."Instead, the government must start employment linked incentive scheme for trade and industries. The government should pay incentives such as power tariff subsidy, social security of new employees, tax, electricity duty, public procurement and capital subsidy benefits and can also provide land for setting up new units for providing fresh employment to local youth," he said."The focus shall be micro industries instead of large industries. The government should recognise large industries as ITIs or skill development centres. These industries will help in skill development of the local youth. In the rural areas MNREGA can be linked to industries for skill development of the rural population. Industries of the rural areas can provide jobs to the population residing in villages. The government can share the salary bill of industries from the funds available under MNREGA scheme for real progress," suggested Jindal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/promote-msmes-to-provide-job-opportunities-to-youth-fopsia-344516
