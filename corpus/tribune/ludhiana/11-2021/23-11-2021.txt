Those who were give the job letters are Baljinder Singh, son of late Jung Singh, Amandeep Kaur, wife of late Baljinder Singh, Prabhjot Singh, son of late Manmohan Singh, Harvinder Kaur, wife of late Jagjit Singh, and Satnam Singh, son of late Hakam Singh.The Chief Minister said there is hardly any reason to rejoice since Punjab had lost more than 700 sons and daughters during the struggle. Channi said those hailing the decision are supporting the atrocities meted out by the Union Government to the agitating farmers, which is undesirable and unwarranted.The Chief Minister said the announcement regarding repealing of black laws is baseless until and unless guarantee of MSP for crops is not made. He said the Union Government must ensure that each and every grain of the farmers is lifted on MSP so that the exploitation of farmers in hands of private players is avoided. Channi said these few days are crucial for Punjab and farmers, adding that “all of us have to be extra cautious”.The Chief Minister reiterated that the “state government will construct a memorial in name of the ‘martyrs’ to perpetuate their glorious struggle for our younger generations”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/punjab-cm-hands-over-job-letters-to-kin-of-5-martyred-farmers-341737

In his impeccable style, Channi relished the tea offered by the auto-rickshaw drivers by dipping a ‘mathi’ in it.During the interaction with the auto-rickshaw drivers, the Chief Minister assured them of considering their genuine demands. Due to huge rush of the auto-rickshaw drivers, the Chief Minister then stood on the stool and addressed the gathering amidst huge applause.Striking an emotional chord with the auto-rickshaw drivers, Channi said during his initial days he himself had driven an auto-rickshaw. Winning the hearts of the auto-rickshaw drivers he announced that new registration certificates will be issued soon to them for preventing their harassment.Channi announced that all the challans which are pending will be waived. He asked the auto-rickshaw drivers to follow traffic rules and work honestly.

Auto, rickshaw and tempo drivers also made significant contributions in the next two victories, he added.Kejriwal said the biggest role was played by putting the Aam Aadmi Party’s poster behind the auto-rickshaws. He appealed to the auto-rickshaw drivers here to display the banner on their autos and support them in the upcoming Punjab Assembly elections.He said, “During the Covid pandemic, the Delhi Government had disbursed a total of Rs 150 crore to Delhi’s auto, taxi and tempo drivers by providing them Rs 5,000 per month, which has not been given by any government in the country to the auto and taxi drivers of their states.”Drivers share grievancesDuring the programme, auto and taxi drivers shared their grievances. Lakhwinder Singh Dhillon, an auto-rickshaw union president, said the issues of auto drivers in Delhi are different as compared to Punjab. He said they have been demanding from the government for a long time to draw a yellow line for the autos but nothing has been done to date. “We don’t want anything free but we need employment and policies for betterment of auto drivers,” he said.Satish from another union said the successive governments and department concerned have collected a large amount from the auto drivers in name of challans, instead of resolving the issues. He said 30 per cent of auto drivers have become unemployed due to the wrong policies of the government.Ram Teerath, leader of a taxi drivers’ union, said their works are not being done in the government departments concerned due to which the taxi drivers are forced to go to private agents.Vipan Arora of a taxi drivers’ union alleged the traffic police also unnecessarily harass them by issuing challans. He said the elected representatives don’t hear their issues. He demanded that the government should launch its taxi app so that all drivers can work without paying any commission.The taxi drivers demanded that parking issues should also be resolved by making free taxi stands at bus stands, railway stations and other locations.Kejriwal said they would solve the problems of auto and taxi drivers of Punjab on a priority basis like the auto drivers of Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/aap-supremo-launches-ik-mauka-kejriwal-nu-poster-341741

23-11-2021||Nitin Jain||Finally, work begins on int’l airport at Halwara||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, November 22Finally, the work has begun on the much-awaited international airport at Halwara here, the administration has confirmed.CMSPEAKSThe international airport project has been taken up on a priority basis and all stops have been pulled out to ensure that it starts operations by June next. It will not only give a major boost to the economic development of Ludhiana but also improve the air connectivity of the industrial capital of the state, besides attracting more investment and jobs for Punjab’s business and industrial hub. Charanjit Singh Channi, CMWhile the construction of an internal approach road, taxiway, car parking and apron has kicked-off, bids for developing the interim terminal building will be received till Tuesday, officials have said.The development assumes significance as the much delay in the final approval from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had already missed the January 2022 deadline earlier set by the state government to make the airport operational.It was on October 22 that the AAI had accorded a formal nod to the construction of a new interim terminal building for the upcoming international airport at the cost of Rs 4,691.12 lakh.Deputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma told The Tribune here on Monday that the last date for receiving bids on tender for the construction of the interim terminal building was extended from earlier fixed November 17 to November 23.“The last date was extended following a lukewarm response from prospective bidders and enabling a couple of them to complete formalities, which they were facing due to some technical glitch,” shared a senior officer involved in the bidding process.Received bids will be opened on November 24 and the construction work for the interim terminal building will begin by December 15.The project entails construction of the interim terminal building spread over 2,000 sq m area with other associated works ,including construction of apron, taxiway, car parking and development of internal approach road.Sharma, who has been reviewing the progress of the project on a daily basis, said a six-month deadline had been fixed for the construction of the interim terminal building and associated works, to be completed till June 30 next year.According to the AAI nod, the interim building will be constructed by the state government through the state government funds, which will be reimbursed to Punjab or its designated agency by the AAI after monetisation of its land at the existing Sahnewal airport in Ludhiana.Already, the construction of the airport link road and 2,333-meter-long boundary wall has been completed.In a bid to give a boost to industrial and economic activities in the state, the state government and the AAI are jointly setting up a new international civil terminal at the Air Force Station in Halwara, which is one of the oldest frontline airbases of the Indian Air Force (IAF), close to Ludhiana.Ludhiana, which is Punjab’s largest industrial and business city with a population of nearly 4-million, is at present serviced by a small domestic airport at Sahnewal, which will be shut once the new international airport begins operations. Ludhiana also has the advantage of being at the geographical centre of the state.The Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) had acquired land measuring 161.28 acres, including 135.54 acres for airport and 25.74 acres for future development.While the work on the construction of 3-meter-high with 660-mm thick punch tape concertina and barbed wire fencing has been completed by the PWD (B&R) at the cost of Rs 301.16 lakh provided by GLADA, the widening and strengthening of the existing 5.1-km link road from Aitiana village to international airport from existing 10-feet to 18-feet width has been completed by the Punjab Mandi Board at the cost of Rs 8.17 crore. The work also included construction of two bridges, each of 8-meter span, on the Halwara drain.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/finally-work-begins-on-intl-airport-at-halwara-341744
