This retrograde step will result in cutting the state off from the mainstream of the National Higher Education System. Delinking the pay scales will adversely affect the system of higher education in Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh as they follow the service conditions, regulations and pay scales of Punjab. Already, Punjab along with Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh are the only states left in the country which are yet to implement the UGC 7th CPC pay scales.Dr KK Sharma, the coordinator and executive member of the PCCTU said they had been forced to start agitation again due to the failure of the state government to keep its promise of implementation of UGC pay scales along with pay scales of the 6th Punjab Pay Commission.He said Punjab was the only state which is yet to implement UGC pay scales notified in November 2017 and UGC regulations notified in 2018. Since 2017, the state government had been showing its commitment to implement the pay scales along with the 6th Punjab Pay Commission scales. Now, the Punjab pay scales had been implemented but those, as per the UGC, are nowhere in sight.”President of Ludhiana district of PCCTU Prof Kuldeep Batta said it was a sorry state of affairs. The teaching community, which should be given its due rights in an appropriate and timely manner, was every time forced to protest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/pcctu-protests-outside-minister-gurkirat-singh-kotlis-residence-339062

17-11-2021||Harshraj Singh||Decade after their launch, only ‘10’ city buses plying on roads in Ludhiana||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, November 16A decade after the launch of the Ludhiana City Bus Service with much fanfare, only ‘10’ out of the 120 city buses (purchased in different phases) are plying on roads at present, as per information. Just ahead of the Assembly elections, MC and Ludhiana City Bus Service Limited (LCBSL) officials are now planning to improve the bus service. However, various issues related to the bus service are yet to be resolved.Around 37 buses have been lying defunct on Tajpur Road for a long period and a number of buses in poor condition have been stationed on Hambran Road. Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said the officials had been asked to take required steps to run the city bus service in a proper manner.MC’s Additional Commissioner-cum-MD of the LCBSL Aaditya Dachalwal on Tuesday conducted a meeting with the private company that operates the buses. The Additional Commissioner said they were planning to ply all buses in the city.He said a panel had submitted its report on the estimated cost for the repair of the defunct buses. At present, 10 buses were plying on the roads.Sources said the private company official also raised the demand for increasing bus fare in the meeting today. The company had been asked to submit a proposal and then the matter would be kept before the higher authorities for further decision.When Navjot Singh Sidhu was the Local Bodies Minister, he had ordered a forensic audit of the MC, Ludhiana, that was conducted by a third party firm. In the audit, it was observed that how the LCBSL suffered ‘losses’ and its interest was apparently ignored when the contract was signed with the first firm that had suspended services in July 2014. The forensic audit report had also revealed the issue of outstanding payments and balance bank guarantee, which were to be recovered from the second firm (operating buses since 2015 till now).Notably, some councillors had then raised questions over the agreement that was signed between Ludhiana City Bus Service Limited and the private firm (second operator) in 2015.Ludhiana City Bus Service Limited had a plan to terminate the services of the private company. A notice was served on the company concerned over pending payments. The firm had then moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the notice in 2019. It is demanding an increase in bus fares. Now, the hearing in the case will be held on Wednesday.Operations Manager of the firm concerned Jaskirat Singh said: “At present, 25 buses are plying on roads. We have been demanding from the LCBSL to increase the bus fares for a long time. If the fares are increased, we would be able to run the remaining buses too.”The company recently served a legal notice on the departments, officials and ministers concerned for allegedly failing to stop illegal buses and autos on routes for the city buses.Court hearing todayLudhiana City Bus Service Limited had a plan to terminate the services of the private company.

17-11-2021||Nitin Jain||Election Commission of India rejects govt’s proposal to transfer Ludhiana DC||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, November 16In a major blow to the state government, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has rejected its proposal to transfer the Deputy Commissioner of Ludhiana, Varinder Kumar Sharma.With this, the incumbent IAS officer will continue on the post.The development assumes significance as the government’s move to post Amarpal Singh, considered a ‘blue-eyed boy’ of the former Chief Ministers Parkash Singh Badal and Capt Amarinder Singh, as new Ludhiana DC had stirred a major controversy here.The main Opposition, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had smelled foul play behind the government’s proposal. They had alleged that it belied the Congress’ promise to provide ‘corruption-free’ regime and was aimed at hampering the process to ensure free-and-fair Assembly election due early 2022.Both the Opposition parties had separately moved the Election Commission of India (ECI) against the government’s proposal. They had also threatened a mass agitation in case the present Ludhiana DC, Varinder Kumar Sharma, was transferred.Taking cognisance of the issue, the ECI examined the matter at the highest level and decided to strike down the government proposal.Conveying the decision, the ECI Under Secretary, Navin Kumar, sent a communication to the Chief Electoral Officer, Punjab, a copy of which is with The Tribune, stating, “I am directed to refer to your letter dated 12.11.21 regarding transfer/posting of officers and to say that the Commission has not acceded to the proposal of transfer/ posting proposed therein. The same may be conveyed to the state Government of Punjab.”As per the ECI guidelines, the prior approval of the commission is mandatory in case of any need for the transfer of any officer engaged in the revision of electoral rolls during an election year due to any extraordinary reasons.The row had erupted after the government sent a proposal seeking prior nod of the ECI to replace Sharma with Singh, who was presently posted as State Transport Commissioner (STC).The Opposition parties had alleged that the incumbent DC was being ‘targeted’ for working against the interests of the land mafia and wrongdoings involving the senior leaders of the ruling Congress.In a representation to the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), they had submitted that the present DC was being transferred at the behest of the state government as he had angered the ruling party leaders for stalling the sale of a prime government land at throwaway prices and ordering an inquiry into the wrongdoings of a local Congress MLA.“His actions have been exemplary, which have angered certain ministers and ruling MLAs, who now want to transfer him out without ascertaining any extraordinary reason as mandated by the ECI,” the AAP Ludhiana Lok Sabha in-charge, Amandeep Singh Mohi, had told a press conference here on Sunday.Apprehending that the government’s move smacks of ulterior motive, the Opposition parties had alleged that the ‘controversial’ officer recommended to be posted as new Ludhiana DC was close to the former CMs, one of whom had pardoned him in the multi-crore iron ore scam in 2017 and the other had promoted him to the IAS.They had urged the CEC to reject the proposal sent by the state government and order continuation of the incumbent officer as Ludhiana DC to ensure free-and-fair Assembly elections due early next year.Controversial officerThe then CM, Parkash Singh Badal, a day before the imposition of election code of conduct on January 2, 2017, had ‘let off’ PCS officer Amarpal Singh with a warning “to be careful in future”, following which former CM Capt Amarinder Singh had recommended his promotion to the IAS and later posted him as STC. Badal’s pardon was not only contrary to his previous order to impose major penalty against the senior IAS and PCS officers found guilty of causing loss of more than Rs 23 crore to the state exchequer.Earlier, then Chief Secretary, Rakesh Singh, had endorsed major penalty on IAS officer Kirpa Shankar Saroj and PCS officer Amarpal Singh as recommended by the departmental inquiry conducted against them.The case dates back to 2004-05 when during the Congress regime, New Delhi-based Reliance Polycrete Limited (RPL) duped Punjab Agro Foodgrains Corporation (PAFC) of more than Rs 23 crore in the export of iron ore.Swerving from its basic and mandated agro foodgrain business, the PAFC had entered into an agreement with the RPF on April 30, 2004, for export of iron ore. Worse still, the PAFC had also ignored the legal advice of getting the mortgage deed submitted by the RPL, registered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/election-commission-of-india-rejects-govts-proposal-to-transfer-ludhiana-dc-339067
