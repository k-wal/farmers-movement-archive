Even as the markets are still to come out of the pandemic shadow, the traders and shoppers are boycotting the Chinese items and promoting the local stuff.May it be candles, diyas, rangoli colours or electric items like fancy lights, toys and other decorative stuff, maximum variety this time on sale in the local markets is made in India and not Chinese, unlike the variety of goods sold during previous years.The markets in the industrial hub of the state, which are famous for the sale of festive shopping, are abuzz with the local made items this time.“In view of the Indo-China border standoff and in order to promote the Make in India campaign, we have decided to shun the Chinese items and go for Indian goods this Diwali,” said a leading supplier of toys, Rakesh Kumar.A leading departmental store owner, Amit Kumar, said almost 90 per cent of the Diwali sale items this time in his store are made in India.“Only a few items which were not available in the local market or comparatively costlier are from China,” claimed Gurjit Singh, who has been selling decorative items here for the past several decades.Rashmi, a shopper at the electronics store, said she has bought a local made mixer grinder for Diwali instead of that made in China.“Until and unless, we all join our hands and pledge to promote Make in India, our local manufacturers can never compete with the Chinese makers,” local general merchants’ union leader Ashok Kumar said.Crackers also localMost of the crackers on sale in the local markets are also local made and not Chinese stuff. Though the stock and sale of crackers is comparatively very less as compared to previous years, the maximum fast moving items are made in India.The district administration has allowed 37 applicants to sell the crackers as per the laid down guidelines at six different locations in the city.The administration has also earmarked the places for the sale of crackers. These include 13 at the grain market, near Jalandhar bypass, five at Model Town Extension, four at Dugri, Phase II, near Dugri police station, nine at GLADA ground on Chandigarh Road, three at Chaara Mandi in Haibowal on the Hambran road and three in a ground near the Lodhi Club road.DC, CP extend greetingsDeputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma and Commissioner of Police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar have extended Diwali greetings to the residents of the district.“All the residents must come forward and make a firm resolve to celebrate an environment-friendly Diwali,” exhorted the DC, while hoping that this Diwali would once again bring peace, prosperity and happiness to the people, besides strengthening the bonds of communal harmony, peace and brotherhood amongst them.The CP appealed to the people to celebrate the festival of lights with traditional fervour and gaiety rising above the petty considerations of caste, colour and creed thereby cementing the bonds of communal harmony, national integration and universal brotherhood.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/traders-shoppers-boycott-chinese-stuff-promote-local-334106

While everyone else will be in a holiday mood on Thursday, the duties for them will multiply, putting a squeeze on the little time they have for their families.Saying that it’s 24-hour duty for them as they are responsible for any mishap at any time in their respective beats, a woman cop, Shalini, said there is no Diwali for them as such… of course they can burst crackers at their place of posting in the open, but this festival is more of a family affair than anything else. “As everybody knows that on a day like Diwali there has to be extra vigilance in all areas, it’s our duty and we swore to do it when joining the force. So there are no two ways about it,” she says.Having a similar story to tell, a fireman, Mohan Lal, said, “Fire is almost a synonym with Diwali and to have a festival of lights with no fire mishap is almost an impossible thing”. Saying that a celebration or a holiday on Diwali is simply out of question as they are supposed to take extra measures to combat fire incidents, he recalled his early years when his children were small, they used to crib and throw tantrums to make him come home.However, for paramilitary force personnel, most of them do not have families staying with them because the majority come from places away from their posting places. A guard deployed on security duty of a local official adds: “I can still enjoy a few festive moments with the family I’m working for.”Believing in the duty before self adage, the doctors, too, have to remain away from their families on festivals. Saying, “duty is duty”, a leading orthopaedic, Dr SK Agrawal, feels that serving the patients is in itself the true celebration of Diwali. He said: “The family is always there, but somebody has to come forward to help society in such situations.”On Diwali day, single people often bear the brunt of duty, perhaps unfairly. On the excuse that there’s no one waiting for them, most of the outsider business process outsourcing (BPO) employees serving here are busy making plans with friends in similar situations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/policemen-firemen-doctors-will-remain-on-duty-to-serve-society-334107

The residents asked why the problem had not been resolved before the festival.In view of the festival, the MC recently launched a cleanliness drive at prominent markets. The MC chief had also directed officials that there should be no sewer blockage. However, residents of Garcha Colony, Dhandari Khurd and nearby colonies have got no relief from overflowing sewage.AAP leader Amanchain Singh, who is a resident of Garcha Colony, had sat on a hunger strike more than two years ago as the civic body authorities had been ignoring complaints. He was given assurance that the problem would be resolved at the earliest but he said nothing was done to resolve the issue till date.Amanchain Singh said: “People are still forced to live under hell-like conditions. No cleanliness drive has been conducted in our area before this Diwali too. A few days ago, I contacted the office of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi but to no avail. Staff of the Chief Minister’s Office asked me to contact the Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana. But, the civic body has already been ignoring the issue for a long period. Even no fogging is being conducted in affected areas here for the prevention of dengue,” he said.Sukhwinder Singh of Dhandari Khurd said: “One of the main streets in the village is still flooded with overflowing sewage. Sewer lines have not been cleaned for the past around three years. We would stage another protest soon if the situation was not improved. We also demand disconnection of sewer pipes of a dyeing unit as its sewer connection should not be linked with the domestic sewerage line.”MC’s Superintending Engineer Rajinder Singh said they were going to set up a new sewerage disposal unit to address the overflowing sewage problem in New Durga Colony and other areas of Ward 28 and tenders for the same project had been floated.“Once the disposal unit is set up, the overflowing sewage problem would be resolved. Moreover, industrial connections will be linked with a common effluent treatment plant soon and sewage problem in Dhandari Khurd village would be resolved,” he said.Cleanliness drive fails to bring reliefIn view of the festival of lights, the MC recently launched a cleanliness drive at prominent markets. The MC chief had also directed officials that there should be no sewer blockage.

Tomorrow, many of them will be enjoying a feast at a four star hotel for the first time on the occasion of the festival of lights.Advocate-cum-social worker Hari Om Jindal, who is running an NGO and teaching children for the past many years, said children from selected slums in Ludhiana would experience eating at a resort for the first time.“It will enable children to gain confidence and aspire for higher goals in life.

Hence, it was important to stop this vicious cycle of adulteration that was affecting the nation in many aspects.‘Crucial to stop adulteration’Adulteration is like a slow poison, not affecting immediately but long exposure can be hazardous to human health. Hence, it is important to stop this vicious cycle of adulteration that is affecting the nation in many aspects. —Ramneek, Dean, College of Dairy Science and Technology (CoDST), GADVASU.Dr Veena N, assistant professor, dairy chemistry, said consumers should buy products from Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) registered or licensed manufacturers only and should see that ingredients used in the manufacturing of products were mentioned. She further emphasised that consumers should be aware whether colorants and essence used in manufacturing were of food grade. ‘Sliver Vark’ was used to attract the consumers but the adulteration of it with aluminum was common. So, consumers should usually avoid sweets with silver vark or they should check whether the used vark was of good quality.Moreover, they should also enquire about the manufacturing and expiry date of the product and the storage temperature. She advised that the consumers should file a complaint if they detect any adulteration or the case of food poisoning on the FSSAI website.Adulteration could not be stopped with just consumer awareness. The manufacturers as well as food authorities also have to take certain steps. The manufacturers should know about food additives and their quantity permitted by the FSSAI for the manufacturing of specific products and not use any inferior-quality ingredients only to earn more profit, said Dr Veena. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/guru-angad-dev-veterinary-and-animal-sciences-university-spreads-awareness-on-adulteration-of-milk-products-334114
04-11-2021||Mahesh Sharma||Government staff forced to observe ‘black Diwali’||Mandi Ahmedgarh/Raikot/ Payal, November 3Families of state government employees, including officials of private aided schools, have been forced to observe a ‘black Diwali’, as a majority of them have not received their salaries for October due to the ongoing strike of unions of employees who were protesting for the implementation of their long-pending demands.Though families having alternative sources of income were able to either purchase gifts and goods, others have to limit the celebrations for lack of finances.Office-bearers and activists of the Punjab State Ministerial Services Union and the Punjab Government Deputy Commissioner Office Employees Union had been protesting for a long time against the alleged adamant attitude of the state government towards their demands.Unlocking of frozen dearness allowance, withdrawal of discriminatory policy regarding employees of the 2016 batch and resumption of the old pension scheme were cited among their major demands.While earlier the protesters were on a pen-down strike, they proceeded on mass leave for three days on Monday, further paralysing the functioning of almost all government offices.In-charges of various government schools, led by Rajesh Gupta and Viney Goyal, regretted that the government had failed to persuade the protesting employees at government offices, resulting in a situation wherein almost all government officials, including protesters, had to observe a ‘black Diwali’, due to non-payment of salaries for October.“Though we had prepared salary bills well in time and had been visiting the Treasure Office, we were not able to deposit the same for further processing,” said Rajesh Gupta, adding that the Treasury Office was found locked when he visited today.Chairman, Punjab Government DC Office Employees Union, Amritpal Pannu, alleged the unsavory situation had arisen due to the adamant attitude of the government towards redressal of genuine demands of all categories of the government employees. “Though we had given enough time for the government to find some solution through table talk, no negotiation took place in the matter yet,” he said.Pannu said senior functionaries of the union had to lend money to worst-affected employees, to help them celebrate the festival.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/government-staff-forced-to-observe-black-diwali-334115

Not to be left behind, women also take keen interest in the game of cards. ‘Trails’, ‘sequences’, ‘colours’ and ‘pairs’ – all formations of the popular ‘teen patti’ or ‘flash’ – are the topics around which the talk at the sittings of card-players revolves around. These make all the difference between winning and losing but for the uninitiated, this may be ‘mumbo-jumbo’.In fact, packs of cards had come out with the beginning of ‘navratras’ (nine auspicious days for offering prayers to Goddess Durga). While ‘lucky’ seats and ‘lucky’ companions are sought with zeal, the zodiac signs are avidly read for ‘positive’ forecasts.Though there is a slump in the business despite Covid taking a break, this has failed to dampen the spirit among the rich, middle class and even poor players. What varies is only the ‘stakes’.While ‘rummy’ is allowed on the basis of ‘counters’, which are used instead of the tables on which no cash is placed, gamblers in this “happening” city are not behind their counterparts in ‘flash’.At one go and all in hard cash, the stakes are learnt to go up to thousands, and even lakhs, at several private parties attended by the ‘players’ belonging to the upper strata. Not only the ways are found to escape the ‘prying’ eyes of the ‘taxmen’ at such ‘high-ranking’ parties, the entry is totally restricted and only reliable persons are invited.With the onset of the festive season, restaurants, hotels and clubs located in Ludhiana have also started doing brisk business. At times, groups of players are so big that some members could be seen waiting for hours together for their ‘turn’.Playing cards ‘deftly’ with their ‘manicured’ hands, women do not lag behind men in this game. Either it is an ‘all-woman’ group or male members from their relations also join in the game played by the ‘well-heeled’ females, said a regular ‘player’ Anju.Women not behindPlaying cards ‘deftly’ with their ‘manicured’ hands, women do not lag behind men in this game.
