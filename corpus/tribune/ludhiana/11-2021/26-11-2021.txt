They lifted dharna only after CP Gurpreet Singh Bhullar came out of his office and received a memorandum.Initially, Hindu outfit leaders Amit Arora and Rajiv Tandon, BJP spokesperson Amit Sarin, Gursimran Singh Mand, chairman, International Anti-Khalistani Terrorists Foundation Gursimran Singh Mand and members of gaushala committees gheraoed the DC office and sat on a dharna there for over half an hour. They were insisting that DC Varinder Sharma should come out of his office and receive a memorandum. They raised slogans against the DC for not paying heed to the cow slaughtering issue which hurt the sentiments of the Hindu community.After the DC received the memorandum, they marched towards the CP office and raised slogans against the district’s top cop and state government for failing to trace the culprits behind the crime.Joint CP, Headquarters, Harish Dayama asked the protesters to come and meet the CP but protesters wanted the CP to himself come out of his office and receive memorandum. When the CP didn’t turn up, the protesters fumed and went outside the CP office and jammed road for an hour.Later, when the CP came out of his office and received the memorandum and assured the protesters that culprits will be held soon, then they lifted the dharna.The CP told the protesters that an FIR was immediately lodged in the case and police teams are on the job to trace the culprits.Mand leaves after Shiv Sena leaders bad-mouth DCGursimran Mand, who accompanied the Shiv Sena leaders to the DC office, left the protest midway after the protesters resorted to bad-mouthing DC Varinder Sharma. “These Shiv Sena leaders are just doing politics over cow to whom Hindu community adores and they are insulting the DC by resorting to bad-mouthing. It was my mistake to be part of the Shiv Sena protest as the latter are just here to get more gunmen only and least concerned about the cow slaughtering. However the Shiv Sena leaders have denied the allegations of Gursimran Mand.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/hindu-outfits-gherao-dc-cp-offices-block-road-342946

The panel, led by Justice Jasbir Singh (retired), gave directions to the MC to ensure waste segregation in the city.Panel members along with the MC and PPCB officials inspected some static waste compactor sites in Ludhiana today. An official said the panel found that source segregation of waste is not being done by the Ludhiana MC as per its claims.Justice Jasbir Singh along with officials visited static waste compactor sites at Middha Chowk, Rishi Nagar, Sarabha Nagar and Bhai Chatar Singh Park. However, the civic body has not ensured waste segregation at even these sites. The MC has run multiple campaigns in the past but it failed to ensure waste segregation in the city.The Ludhiana Municipal Corporation has also failed to ensure the processing of waste and legacy waste at its main garbage dumping site near Kakka village. The panel members also visited the site today and gave directions to the civic body to ensure the processing of the waste.Ludhiana ranked 39 out of 48 cities (above 10 lakh population category) in the country in the Swachh Survekshan 2021 recently.

The remaining 30 per cent share, which amounts to $90-million, will be borne by the state government.Deputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma told The Tribune, here, on Thursday that the objective of the project was to shift from groundwater to surface water for quenching the thirst of Ludhiana residents on a 24x7 basis.He said the surface water supply scheme would be executed in two phases, comprising raw water system, WTP, treated water pumping, transmission mains from the WTP to overhead service reservoirs (OHSRs) and constructing OHSRs in the first leg while Phase II will entail distribution system and house service connection with metering.Divulging the current status of the project, MC Commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal said Phase I works would be executed by the civic body with the support of the World Bank while Phase II works would be taken up subsequently under other schemes.He said salient features of Phase I works include design of per capita water supply at 150 litres per capita daily (LPCD), raw water source from a distributary from the Sidhwan canal, construction of the 580-MLD capacity WTP at Bilga village, laying of 175-180-km-long transmission mainline of 150 mm to 2,000 mm and 55 new OHWRs.MC Additional Commissioner Aditya Dachalwal said the land acquired for the WTP, located near Bilga village, was adjacent to the proposed raw water source of distributary from the Sidhwan canal.He said the resolution for volumetric water tariff had been approved by the MC General House on November 10 while the House on November 1 had approved the setting up of WSS utility.The MC Commissioner said of the overall scheme cost of Rs 3,394.45 crore, Phase I works would cost Rs 1,252.51 crore, including land cost, while the Phase II projects would be undertaken at the cost of 2,141.94 crore, including Rs 700 crore for 10 years of operation and maintenance.Project reportIt was on the recommendation of the then Capt Amarinder Singh-led state government that the project was approved by the Union Ministry of Finance’s Department of Economic Affairs and was posed to the WB and the AIIB for external financing.Then Chief Secretary, Vini Mahajan, had assigned the Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Corporation (PMIDC) under the Local Government Department to initiate the PMSIP aimed at improving service delivery in Ludhiana and Amritsar by strengthening municipal governance finance and service delivery systems and capacities for the project with technical and financial support of the WB and AIIB financing.A major focus of the project will be on providing efficient water supply and sanitation services in Ludhiana and Amritsar, cities that are the engines of economic growth for the state. Improvements in the water supply will benefit over 3 million persons in 2025 and an estimated 5 million projected population in 2055. Industrial and commercial users would also benefit from the good quality reliable water supply.Project under WB reviewThe land for the WTP and other ancillaries was acquired after being reviewed at the level of the World Bank for conducting social and environmental studies.The RFP to engage contractors on the design, build, operate and transfer (DBOT) basis has also been forwarded to the WB for approval, following which tenders will be floated likely by next month.Present statusAt present, Ludhiana and Amritsar draw their water by pumping out groundwater from hundreds of borewells dug up across the two cities. Pumping groundwater directly from the borewells leads to significant water loss and wastage as households are not incentivised to save. Studies have also revealed that Ludhiana’s groundwater was contaminated with nitrates and other heavy metals while Amritsar district’s with arsenic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/land-acquired-for-rs-3-394-cr-canal-water-supply-project-342960
