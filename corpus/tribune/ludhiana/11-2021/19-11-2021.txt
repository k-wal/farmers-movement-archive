The PMIDC had also written that it must be certified whether the existing Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the Smart City Mission is ensuring and checking the quality of works or not. Recently, the project management consultant (PMC) has been replaced with the PIU in these cities.The MC Commissioner said the PIU was effectively monitoring works and ensuring quality here. In the letter, Sabharwal said the quality of works being executed under the Smart City Mission was being monitored and ensured by AECOM India Limited, a PMC engaged for the purpose. Subsequent to the discontinuation of the services of the PMC and replacing the same with the project implementation unit, professionals engaged under the PIU were effectively monitoring the ongoing works and ensuring the quality thereof, he said.Sabharwal stated in the letter that it would be an added advantage if, in addition to the PIU, a third party agency was engaged in carrying out the technical and financial audits of the works being executed under the Smart City Mission.Notably, opposition political parties had earlier also raised questions over some Smart City Mission projects, including the Smart Street project work on Malhar Road and Retrofitting of Sarabha Nagar Market. Some traders had raised questions over the design of the Malhar Road project and accused the LSCL of reducing the width of the road.
