Rape caseBy exempting the MLA from arrest, the police show their support for the accused. When any common man is booked on rape charges, the police arrest the accused immediately and put him behind the bars. — Harish Rai Dhanda, SAD leaderHarish Rai Dhanda, SAD candidate from the Atam Nagar constituency for the upcoming Assembly elections, and Gurdeep Gosha, Youth Akali Dal leader, today gathered outside the Police Commissioner office. Both leaders met the victim woman who has been sitting outside the CP office for eight months demanding arrest of MLA Bains for raping her.The chargesheet names Bains, his brothers — Karamjit Singh and Paramjit Singh — and four others — Baljinder Kaur, Jasbir Kaur, Sukhchain Singh and Gogi Sharma PA. The chargesheet has been filed under Sections 376 (rape), 354 (assault or criminal force on woman with an intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (sexual harassment), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (conspiracy) of the IPC. The FIR was registered in July this year.“Bains is an MLA from the Atam Nagar constituency. He is a public representative and cannot flee. Even other accused are also active members of his party, so their arrest may create law and order problem in the city. The booked accused should be directly summoned in the court,” the police chargesheet reads.Dhanda, while showing the chargesheet filed by the police in court in the rape case, said by exempting the MLA from arrest, the police show their support for the accused. When any common man is booked on rape charges, the police arrest the accused immediately and put him behind the bars. “If someone has committed rape, even if he is a public figure, he should not enjoy exemption from arrest. He is not above the law,” Dhanda added.There is no doubt that many police officers have forgotten their responsibilities and have been dancing like puppets of politicians but still there are police officers who have maintained their dignity and have not succumbed to any pressure and despite all obstacles, they have filed the chargesheet, said Dhanda. Dhanda alleged that the arrest was intentionally stayed at the behest of some senior Congress leaders.The chargesheet also mentions that a look out circular (LOC) was already issued against all the booked accused in the case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/why-cant-police-arrest-bains-asks-sad-337881

Once the Bill is notified, violators, whose buildings were constructed (till September 30, 2021) in violation of a sanctioned plan or without getting plan sanctioned from the competent authority, will be able to apply for a one-time settlement of non-compoundable violations in buildings by depositing a prescribed composition fee.Under the nose of the authorities of the Municipal Corporation and other departments concerned, a large number of buildings have come up in violation of the rules. Once the Bill is notified, violators, whose buildings were constructed (till September 30, 2021) in violation of a sanctioned plan or without getting plan sanctioned from the competent authority, would be able to apply for a one-time settlement of non-compoundable violations in buildings by depositing a prescribed composition fee.Col JS Brar (retd) of Maha-Sabha, an NGO, has been raising his voice against rampant illegal constructions and encroachments in the city for a long time.He said: “Corrupt officials and politicians had earlier allowed a large number of violations in buildings in the city by ignoring rules. A large number of buildings came up without ensuring parking arrangements. The corrupt politicians used to back the violators. Now, the one-time settlement for non-compoundable violations is being introduced ahead of the Assembly elections as politicians are eyeing on votes. The illegally constructed buildings should not be regularised.”Rahul Verma, a resident of Sarabha Nagar, said: “Such policies for settlement of non-compoundable violations in buildings would be proved as a ‘cancer’ for the city. There is no need of any other town planning wing if violations are to be regularised by charging a composition fee. Why the departments concerned had closed their eyes when a huge number of buildings were being constructed by violating the building bylaws?”Meanwhile, the Council of Engineers has written to the Punjab Governor, requesting him to scrap the Bill for one-time settlement for non-compoundable building violations. The organisation has demanded that the Bill should not be notified.Kapil Arora of Council of Engineers said: “As the Bill would be sent to the Governor for final approval, we have written to the Governor that such a Bill is against the fundamental rights of citizens. Such one-time settlement policies will motivate owners of those buildings which have been constructed illegally. Thus, such policies by the state government convey a wrong message and discourage law-abiding citizens. It further motivate violators/building mafia to continue to violate the rules enshrined in well-written statute.”He said: “A similar matter of the OTS Policy notified in 2019 has already been challenged by us and the matter is already sub-judice in the Punjab & Haryana High Court. If the fresh Bill is notified, we will move the court.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ngos-oppose-bill-to-regularise-illegal-constructions-in-state-337892
