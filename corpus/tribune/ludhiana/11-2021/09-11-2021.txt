He said these Covid warriors were the real heroes who remained at the forefront during the pandemic by risking their own lives.Financial assistance for ICMR projectPunjab Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu has announced a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh for a project run by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), focusing on the timely intervention in case of heart attacks to save precious lives of people. Presiding over an event at the DMCH, the minister said the amount was nothing in front of the services rendered by the medical institute to people and it was just a small token of gratitude towards their dedication and commitment in serving poor people. Ashu said doctors and health staff of the DMCH had exemplary contributed to the war against Covid-19 and saved several lives. Thanking the minister for announcing the grant for project, Dr Bishav Mohan from the DMCH said the ICMR project was being running successfully at 11 health centres of Ludhiana and added that the financial support would help to strengthen the programme and would help save more lives. He said in the coming days, the project would also be launched in the Jawaddi CHC and the Rural Health Centre, Pohir. “It aims to save precious lives from heart failure by administrating clot-buster drug tenecteplase within the golden period (first 90 minutes) of the onset of symptoms,” said Dr Mohan. He said everyone could not afford to buy tenecteplase drug being used to dissolve blood clots in the heart because of its high cost (around Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000) and under the project, the drug is given free of cost to patients. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/deep-hospital-conducts-hypospadias-surgeries-335656

It was only after Dr Boparai got elected as the MP, that the segment received grants for various development works in the region.Residents are happy that foundations stones for five roads, including Jalaldiwal-Ramgarh Sivia-Power Grid (Rs 105.70 lakh), Johlan-Lohatbaddi (Rs 85.82 lakh), Gobindgarh-Dadhahoor (Rs 55.37 lakh), Talwandi Rai-Basti-Baba Bishan Das Dera (Rs 31.71 lakh) and approach road of Buraj Naklian Firni (Rs 26.67 lakh) have been laid now and officials, led by SDO Jatin Singla, have already initiated a process for the construction of the roads.Paying gratitude to Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi for releasing massive grants for development projects in the Fatehgarh Sahib constituency in general and the Raikot Assembly segment in particular, Boparai said the officials concerned had been advised to ensure that work on the roads should be started without further delay and completed as soon as possible.“Knowing woes of residents of the region due to the poor condition of roads, I approached Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi who was kind enough to sanction massive grants for these roads. It will go a long way in helping people live a dignified life and travel comfortably and safely,” Boparai said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ray-of-hope-for-raikot-residents-as-mp-amar-singh-boparai-lays-stones-for-five-roads-335663

The work was stopped around three months ago.In March 2021, the industrialists had complained to the MC about the “poor” quality of the constructed portion of the road. Following their complaint, a notice was sent to the contractor as wet-mix was being used instead of lean concrete by ignoring PWD specifications. The Junior Engineer concerned had in his report raised questions over the lack of thickness in the middle of a RMC panel. As per the JE’s report, the industrialists had also complained that a panel of the RMC was laid without using steel at night.VS Gill, a member of the association, said: “RMC panel’s thickness was found to be 10 inches instead of 12 inches. Its strength was not up to the mark when the industrialists had got the samples tested. Road gullies were not even constructed before starting the road work while the proper level of the road was not maintained. The constructed road portion has already started breaking.”The members of the association have demanded from the government to take action on their complaint. They also wanted action against persons responsible for the poor quality road construction work.A member said: “We have been facing harassment due to the poor quality work and delay in completion of the project. The industries have suffered financial losses in crores of rupees as the road had remained blocked for the construction work for a long time but the project was never completed.”The industrialists demanded from the Municipal Corporation to demolish the poorly constructed stretch and get it reconstructed. They said the project should be completed at the earliest. They also demanded a permanent solution to resolve the overflowing sewage problem on the stretch.MC’s Superintending Engineer Parveen Singla said he would ask the Executive Engineer and SDO to take required steps.No action taken by MC despite complaintsAfter finding “flaws” and “failed” samples, industrialists had complained to the Chief Minister, Department of Local Bodies and other government authorities against the “poorly” constructed main Sua Road. However, the Municipal Corporation failed to take action in this regard.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/project-incomplete-newly-built-road-starts-peeling-off-in-ward-28-335664

This seems apt to describe the current situation of stubble burning, which has gone up 10 times in the past fortnight, the official figures have confirmed.From only 389 till October 25, the farm fire incidents in the state’s biggest and largest district in terms of area and population have touched 3,252 on November 8, the data compiled by the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC) in Ludhiana has revealed.OfficialspeakWe have adopted a two-pronged strategy involving awareness and enforcement. Besides motivating peasants against stubble burning, 725 key district functionaries have been deployed to prevent field fires and take action against the offenders. These include eight SDMs, seven tehsildars, 160 patwaris, nine DSPs, 142 cluster officers, 390 nodal officers and 9 AEEs of PPCB. Varinder Kumar Sharma, Deputy CommissionerThis has caused a dense envelope of smog in the district, leaving the air quality “very poor” and “poor” on a day-to-day basis, leading to serious breathing problems to residents, especially those suffering from bronchitis and heart ailments.The ground situation of crop residue burning also belies the resolutions adopted by all 968 village panchayats in the district against stubble burning. In a first-of-its-kind initiative, all 968 villages covered under 941 panchayats and 367 primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS) in Ludhiana district had last month resolved not to let anyone burn crop residue in their respective jurisdictions.However, all such claims went up in the smoke following the recent spurt in the incidence of farm fires.With this, Ludhiana ranked the fifth worst-hit district when it comes to crop residue burning in the state. While Sangrur topped the state with the highest of 4,093 farm fires, Ferozepur stood second with 4,080 stubble burning cases. Tarn Taran ranked third with 3,546 crop residue burning incidents, while Moga remained fourth with 3,379 farm fires till Monday.On Monday itself, Ludhiana district recorded 398 stubble burning cases during the past 24 hours, which were fourth highest after Sangrur, which reported the maximum of 625, followed by Moga 580 and Ferozepur 406.If the present trend of rising farm fires continues unabated, it may break the records of previous four years in Ludhiana district when a total of 4,330 cases of crop residue burning were recorded during the entire paddy harvesting season from September 15 to November 30 in 2020, followed by 2,532 in 2019, 2,481 in 2018 and 3,239 in 2017. However, the district had reported the highest of 7,697 farm fire incidents.The spike in the stubble burning cases was witnessed since November 4 when 292 fire events, which were the highest daily count reported by any district in the state, were recorded followed by 455 on November 5, 398 on November 6 and 394 on November 7.This has left Ludhiana the third most-polluted city in Punjab on Monday with air quality index (AQI) level touching 297, which falls under the “poor” category. Among 10 most-polluted cities, Jalandhar remained the worst-hit with AQI 356 followed by Bathinda with AQI 315, Faridkot 238, Mandi Gobindgarh 195, Patiala 177, Dhariwal 162, Khanna 155, Ropar 153 and Amritsar 151.“While the poor air quality causes breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure, the very poor AQI leads to respiratory illness,” opined an expert Dr Ranjana Agrawal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/stubble-burning-up-10-times-in-past-fortnight-in-ludhiana-district-335672
