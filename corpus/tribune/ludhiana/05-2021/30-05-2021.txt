If a family of four has to get vaccinated, it will cost Rs3,400 for a single dose. For an average family this is a hefty amount.The doctors said it is not only the social responsibility of the rich and those who can afford to contribute, it is also in the interest of their own health. “A section of the population getting vaccinated will not serve much purpose, as long as the entire eligible/vulnerable population is not vaccinated,” they pointed out, while hoping that people will come forward and contribute for free vaccination to those who cannot afford it of their own,” said Dr Grewal.On their part, the doctors said, they will not charge anything for the services they will be providing for vaccination. Besides, they said, they will not also be making any profits and will not take the hospital share for the vaccines. This is an unforeseen disaster which calls for united efforts, they said while asserting that individual safety is pointless, until everyone is not immunised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/doctors-body-calls-for-vaccine-langar-260665
