They are being attacked both in urban and rural areas.Today, a sampling team of the Health Department was attacked at Rachhin village of the Pakhowal block in the district.A member of the team, Suraaj Mohammed, a multipurpose health worker, sustained injuries on his forehead and was rushed to the Community Health Centre (CHC), Pakhowal, for treatment.In a statement, Suraaj Mohammad told the police that he was attacked with a brick by a villager, named Jaspreet Singh, while he was sensitising villagers to come forward for Covid-19 testing.Investigation revealed that the staff of a sub-centre of the Community Health Centre, Pakhowal, had organised a sampling camp at Sikhan Wala Chowk in Rachhin village under Raikot subdivision on Thursday. While healthcare workers, led by Hapreet Kaur and Suraj Mohammad, were collecting samples of residents visiting the camp, ASHA worker Ranjit Kaur was contacting residents to persuade them to get tested for Covid, so that the chain of transmission of the pathogen could be broken.Suraj Mohammad alleged that Jaspreet Singh got infuriated on being persuaded for sampling and attacked him with a brick when he was doing his official duty to check spread of Covid.The Sadar police, Raikot, have booked Jaspreet Singh of Rachhin village in Ludhiana district under Sections 353, 186 and 332 of the IPC for allegedly assaulting a healthcare worker when he was performing his official duty to prevent spread of Covid by undertaking sampling for the virus at Sikhan Wala Chowk at the village. Investigating officer Piara Singh said the accused was absconding.Terming this instance extremely unfortunate, Deputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said such acts were highly unwarranted and severest of the actions would be taken against those trying to derail the efforts of the government to contain the virus spread.Kirandeep Kaur, president of the ASHA Workers and Facilitators Association, said it was very difficult to convince the villagers for testing or come out of their houses for the survey.“They hurl abuses and sometimes even throw stones at us. Seeing an ASHA workers’ team coming towards the lane, villagers shut their doors and do not come out. They instead blame us for spreading Covid and say that we will make them positive,” she said.In August 2020, two healthcare workers posted at Jarkar village were attacked by three persons, including the organiser of a dera at Khanpur village. The team was visiting religious places to persuade inmates to get tested. The team was brutally beaten up.In June 2020, a similar incident was reported when a survey was started in urban areas. A team of ASHA workers were attacked at Krishna Colony in Bhamian Khurd while conducting a survey. The team was surrounded by the area residents and not allowed to collect data. Residents also snatched their mobile phones.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/sampling-team-attacked-at-rachhin-village-of-pakhowal-block-man-booked-259658

They alleged that the proposed industrial park was going to be set up in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act (FC Act), 1980, (EP Act), and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (EP Act).One of the applicants, Kapil Dev, had stated that the modern industrial park was going to be developed on the land coming under the floodplains and surrounded by deemed forest and Sutlej river, which are eco-sensitive zones. The applicants claimed that the area is a ‘no manufacturing zone’ as per the existing Master Plan.“The Mattewara Reserve Forest area has also been developed as a botanical and butterfly garden (BBG, Mattewara). Thus, there is a serious threat to rare species of flora due to the development in the area”, the applicants stated.The applicants have also presented some documents regarding the width of the floodplains and stated that heavy flood had occurred in Mattewara and nearby areas in 1988. Earlier also, they had filed objections to the department concerned against the proposed amendment to the Master Plan.The applicants alleged that an industrial park is ill-advised on a river floodplain.They said, “Damage to the floodplains harms the riverine ecosystem, lessens the groundwater recharge capacity and poses threats of flash floods. Ludhiana is a critically polluted area. The industrial park in the district will only add to the pollution of the city.”An applicant, Gagnish Singh Khurana, claimed: “We came to know that a large part of the land near the industrial park that has to developed is floodplains. The proposed industrial park adjoining the Dhusi Bundh is against the Environmental Protection Act, 1986.”The Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said: “We have considered the matter and heard the applicant no. 1 in person. There is no doubt about the need for protecting the floodplains of the Sutlej in Ludhiana as well as the forest areas, in accordance with provisions of the EP Act and the FC Act. This Tribunal has already issued directions for protection of floodplain zones which is necessary for protection of the environment.”The NGT Bench directed the Chief Secretary, Punjab, in coordination with the River Rejuvenation Committee to take such remedial action as may be necessary for the protection of the floodplains.“Protection of forests is covered by the statutory mandate of the FC Act and no non-forest activity is allowed in the forest area without statutory clearances, there is no reason to presume that the said mandate will be ignored. Let the authorities concerned look into this aspect and take further action as per law,” the Bench said.For the rejuvenation of 351 polluted river stretches in the country, the NGT had earlier directed constitution of “River Rejuvenation Committees” (RRCs) in all states/UTs to prepare and execute action plans, which includes protection of floodplain zones. The Sutlej is one of such 351 polluted river stretches.The applicants claimed that the industrial park near the Sutlej and the forest is going to be developed on 955.67 acres of land.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/take-steps-for-protection-of-floodplains-ngt-to-punjab-chief-secretary-259660

With no scope of increasing the already existing 450 beds in the government hospitals, the beds in private health centres were augmented by a record 155.35 per cent from 1,140 on March 31 to 2,911 on May 22.The official records showed that 1,205 beds — 150 in government hospitals and 1,055 in private institutions — were occupied in the district as on May 27. The occupants included 1,046 confirmed Covid patients (135 in government and 911 in the private hospitals), while 159 suspected cases (15 in government and 144 in private hospitals) were also occupying the hospital beds.

The MC had earlier sealed a shop at Ghumar Mandi after which a city resident had moved the court against the MC’s action.Rajinder Singh, son of the petitioner Harbhajan Singh, said they had been running the shop since 1980 on rent but the MC had sealed the shop without even serving any notice on them a month ago.He said they had requested the MC authorities and elected representatives but they did not pay any heed to their pleas. He alleged that the action taken by the MC’s building branch officials was totally wrong.When they moved the court, a notice of motion order was issued asking the MC to file a specific affidavit under what provisions of the Act the shop has been sealed and further in compliance with a direction that if no legal justification is given by the MC, it will be burdened with heavy costs. The MC later unsealed the shop on May 26.But, the counsel for the petitioner stated that the shop had remained sealed for a period of one month and the petitioner suffered substantive loss as the shop was the only source of income for his family. The Judge ordered that for illegally sealing the shop of the petitioner, the Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana, through its Commissioner, was directed to pay the costs of Rs 25,000 to the petitioner. The Assistant Town Planner (ATP), M S Bedi, said they had already unsealed the shop. However, he claimed that they had not received the order to pay any compensation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/pay-rs-25-000-for-illegally-sealing-shop-hc-tells-ludhiana-mc-259665

Another reason for the rush is that the traffic police have not made enough arrangements to manage the traffic.It was also noticed that rush in the markets had increased in the past few days as residents now have more time for shopping due to relaxation in curfew timings.“Since the curfew relaxation has been extended by three hours, we received more footfall of customers today. Some customers even came just before closing time,” said a garment shopkeeper.“To deal with the rush after 3 pm, the traffic police should deploy more officials at the Clock Tower road, Ghumar Mandi, Jassian road, Gill road, Rajpura chowk, Civil Lines, Kesar Ganj Mandi, Books market, Gurh Mandi. These are the places where people throng in large numbers to buy household items,” said a resident.Another shopkeeper said he appreciates the decision to extend curfew relaxations but the administration should also give some time to people to reach home without a hurry.“People rush home immediately after 3 pm immediately to prevent getting challaned. The rush will obviously create traffic hurdles. When people know they have some more time to reach home, roads will witness less traffic jam,” said Gurbaz Singh, a garment showroom owner near Clock Tower.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/huge-rush-on-ludhiana-roads-as-curfew-norms-go-for-a-toss-259707

So, the claim that 5G trials or networks are leading to the spread of virus is baseless,” the Department of Telecommunications said.The association has also written to Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan in this regard.Dr Bishav Mohan, senior cardiologist, DMCH, said: “Whosoever is spreading this false information should be put behind bars.
