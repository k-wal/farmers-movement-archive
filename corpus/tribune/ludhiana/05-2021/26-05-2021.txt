26-05-2021||Ludhiana||Principals worried about health of students, teachers||Confusion over conducting Class XII board examinations has teachers from across the country worried and confused.While state governments, in association with the CBSE, are yet to take the decision on how to conduct board examinations within the next few days, principals of schools in the city remain worried about the health of students and teachers.Many principals believe that if offline exams are to be taken, then exams of all subjects should be held and not only the main subjects.“It doesn’t matter whether you come to school for three days or five days. Students can get infected even if they come to appear physically for the main subjects only. The final decision has to be taken by the CBSE but I personally feel that offline exams should be conducted for all subjects for the betterment of students,” said a teacher of a school in BRS Nagar said.The principal of Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School, Sarabha Nagar, Sister Reshmi, however has a different opinion. She said exams should be conducted offline.“We have waited for over three months for the second wave of Covid to get over. In my opinion, we should for another month for cases to fall further. The CBSE can conduct exams then with less preparatory holidays between exams. But if a hasty decision is taken at the moment and exams are conducted within the next few days, who will be held responsible for the health of teachers and students if they catch the infection?” she added.Voicing similar views, principal of Nankana Public School, Harmit Kaur, said she was in favour of conducting exams in the offline mode. Offline exams can be conducted once the Covid curve flattens, she said.“Students should not be promoted without exams. Future of Class XII students depend on the marks they score in their board exams. Students should be promoted on merit and not on assessment basis,” she added.Students, however, are divided on this issue. Many students are in the favour of appearing for exams physically while others are of the opinion that since classes were held online and concepts could not be cleared, exams should be held online as well or not at all.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/principals-worried-about-health-of-students-teachers-258622

But, the work is also done in the morning during the curfew relaxation hours, causing traffic snarls on the Old GT Road stretch. Also, the commuters are forced to pass through the wrong side as the stretch has been dug up at different points.Under the project, storm water drainage pipes are to be installed between Rekhi Cinema Chowk and an old drain near Bhadaur House on Old GT Road to resolve the years-old problem of waterlogging during rains near Clock Tower. Residents said the MC must take the required steps to resolve the issue.Varinder Kumar, who is a teacher at a nearby school, said the Old GT Road is one of the busiest roads in the city. “If possible, the work should be carried out at night time these days or the MC should make proper traffic diversion plan so that the commuters don’t face any inconvenience,” he added.A shopkeeper said, “Due to restrictions amid the Covid-19 pandemic, we are allowed to open shops for only limited hours from Monday to Friday. The shops remain completely closed on Saturday and Sunday due to the weekend curfew. Now, the traffic snarls have increased the woes. Moreover, dust keeps coming into the shops. The project is also very much important for the area. To avoid any kind of problem, the work should be conducted only after 1 pm daily or at night.”A Congress leader, Parminder Mehta, said, “The traffic snarls are being witnessed as no planning was done before starting the project. Clock Tower Chowk is a major point in the city as thousands of commuters pass through this way. The MC should carry out the project work at night time so that the commuters do not suffer any more.”Ward councillor concerned Rakesh Prashar said he would talk to MC officials in this regard. Despite repeated attempts, the MC’s Superintending Engineer Rajinder Singh could not be contacted for comments. Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said he would ask the officials and contractor to carry out the work at night time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/storm-water-drainage-project-at-clock-tower-leaves-commuters-a-harried-lot-258575

But instead of appreciating our efforts, the government has not paid two hoots to our demands. The probation periods were so long that the jobs of teachers were not being regularised deliberately. They were given meagre salaries and have been exploited by the government at every step.”The teachers demanded that the government should provide compensation to the families of teachers who had lost their lives due to Covid.

26-05-2021||Ludhiana||‘Teach elderly benefits of technology to maintain mental well-being’||In the present scenario of widespread Covid pandemic, it is important that elderly people, especially above 60 years of age, should be properly taken care of.Dr Dinesh Jain, professor of medicine at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, said senior citizens were susceptible of having weak immunity with advancing years so it was strongly advisable that caregivers for such people should adopt certain measures if they displayed symptoms such as fever (with or without bodyache), new onset of symptoms, continuous cough, shortness of breath, unusually poor appetite and inability to eat.Caregivers should keep in mind“Senior citizens are advised not to step out of their house and isolate themselves at home. They can easily interact with other family members by adopting proper Covid-related precautions. To keep their mental well-being in better shape, they can rediscover old hobbies such as painting, reading and listening to music,” Dr Jain added.Proper nutrition of the elders should be ensured through home-cooked food, fresh meals, maintaining hydration levels in the body, giving fresh juices and adequate amount of water to boost immunity.City-based clinical psychiatrist Dr Rajeev said elderly people, who had an active lifestyle, were likely to feel lonely as they were missing their walks, chat sessions and evening tea talks with their friends.“The biggest fear during lockdown is to be left alone. Grandchildren can teach grandparents the benefits of technology and help them set up online chat group sessions, book spiritual classes among other activities. If anybody’s parents are living alone, it becomes the responsibility of the caregivers to book their doctor’s online appointments and get groceries, medicines and other essential items to them,” added Dr Rajeev.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/teach-elderly-benefits-of-technology-to-maintain-mental-well-being-258599
