He said the government had decided to keep weekend lockdown only for the safety of people and people should respect the decision of the government and follow it wisely.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/highest-single-day-toll-20-dead-in-ludhiana-246626
01-05-2021||Ludhiana||98% L3 beds, 76% L2 beds occupied in Ludhiana hospitals||The second Covid wave, which rapidly continues to cause a devastating crisis, has set the alarm bells ringing in Ludhiana district, with hospitals failing to cope up with the unprecedented patient load, oxygen supplies running short and young and old, men and women falling prey to the deadly virus, some even before seeing the doctors.The grim situation turned grimmer on Friday when almost no Level-3 (L3) hospital bed was left available, while nearly 80 per cent of the Level-2 (L2) beds in the district’s government and private hospitals remained occupied.The official figures compiled by the district administration till this evening, a copy of which is with The Tribune, made it evident that Ludhiana was passing through the most difficult and trying times.“As of now, we are in control of the situation but I appeal to the people to cooperate in bringing down the mounting positivity rate,” said Deputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma, while maintaining that if all the hospital beds remained occupied then the district would be in a difficult situation in the coming days.He added that the district was arranging 2,300 oxygen cylinders daily from its own local sources, besides the additional supplies by the state government.Taking cognisance of the serious situation, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, along with Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan, reviewed the present state of affairs in Ludhiana and five other worst-hit districts in the state. The CM has asked the state officials to rope in the Army and BSF for providing manpower support and creating more hospital beds.The bed availability data in the district compiled at 5 pm on Friday showed that 448 of the total earmarked 457 Level-3 beds at all 70 hospitals — 68 private and two government — were occupied, leaving only 9 beds vacant.Similarly, 1,109 of the total earmarked 1,459 Level-2 hospital beds in the district were full, leaving only 350 beds available.In this way, over 98 per cent Level-3 and more than 76 per cent Level-2 beds were officially occupied in the district till 5 pm with the inflow of more critical patients in need of beds continuing unabatedly, leaving no Level-3 beds available and less than 20 per cent Level-2 beds remaining vacant till the reports last came in.The plight of critical patients in dire need of hospitalisation and life support could be gauged from the fact that the health infrastructure is completely hard pressed and unbearably full with leading and prominent hospitals like the DMC, Fortis, SPS, Ivy, Max and Lord Mahavir among 44 of the total 68 private facilities and both government hospitals left with no vacant Level-3 bed even before 5 pm. Another top hospital CMC was left with only two beds available till 5 pm.While Level-2 hospital beds have oxygen facility, Level-3 hospital beds are equipped with ventilator support as well.Following the Ludhiana way, the other five high caseload districts are also having almost total hospital bed occupancy. While Bathinda reported 100 per cent Level-3 bed occupancy, Patiala was left with 9 per cent, Mohali 11 per cent, Jalandhar 14 per cent and Amritsar 40 per cent Level-3 hospital beds. In a comparatively better situation for those requiring Level-2 beds, Patiala and Amritsar were still left with 62 per cent beds, Jalandhar 55 per cent, while Mohali was reporting 86 per cent occupancy and Bathinda’s 74 per cent Level-2 beds remained occupied.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/98-l3-beds-76-l2-beds-occupied-in-ludhiana-hospitals-246627
01-05-2021||Ludhiana||Despite price cap, pvt ambulance operators charge exorbitant rates||District is witnessing a surge in the Covid cases and a steep rise in the demand of the ambulance service has been seen. Instead of cutting down the charges amidst the pandemic, these private operators are busy making some quick bucks out of the miserable condition of the people and charging exorbitantly high for shifting patients to hospitals or bodies to the crematoriums.Rates fixed by administrationOn Monday, the families of two Covid victims were unable to arrange an ambulance and left with no other option they took the bodies to the crematorium in an auto-rickshaws and a hand-pulled cart. Ambulances were asking for Rs3,000-4,000 for taking bodies to crematorium.After this, on Wednesday, the district administration constituted a special cell to ensure proper transportation of bodies and cremation and also fixed the prices per kilometre for the private ambulances but not giving two hoots to the price cap, these operators are busy minting money from the people who are already passing through a tough time.Today when The Tribune correspondent posed as a family member of a patient approached an ambulance operator outside a private hospital at Model Town to enquire about shifting of Covid positive patient from Mullanpur to a city hospital, she was told different prices according to the requirement.For shifting the patient from Mullanpur, the operator asked for Rs3,200. “Although a few provide ventilator but we can arrange that and it will cost Rs5,000 in an ambulance with a ventilator for shifting patient to the hospital,” he said.He said if the bed in the hospital had been booked then it would cost Rs5,000 but Rs4,000 extra would be charged for going from one hospital to another in search of a bed.Another private ambulance operator near the DMCH demanded Rs4,000 for shifting patient from Mullanpur in an oxygen cylinder-fitted ambulance. He cautioned me to bring the patient only when I have prior booking of the bed in the hospital, otherwise going from one hospital to another will cost a heavy sum.Another ambulance operator was enquired about shifting the patient within the city and he quoted Rs2,500 for the same. When asked why he was charging so heavily he said they have added the cost of PPE kit and oxygen cylinder also. “Oxygen cylinders are available at inflated rates and we have to charge for that also,” he said.Judgepreet Singh, manager of the Samvedna NGO, said their five ambulances were on round-the-clock duty and they were not charging a single penny from the families. “Due to increase in number of deaths, we are only moving bodies to the crematoriums so that they get a respectable farewell,” he said.There are fortyone 108 Ambulances in Ludhiana and on an average they are ferrying 150-170 patients/bodies daily.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/despite-price-cap-pvt-ambulance-operators-charge-exorbitant-rates-246628

01-05-2021||Ludhiana||Majority of buildings lack fire safety arrangements in Ludhiana||Despite hundreds of fire incidents taking place in the city every year, no audit has been done to check the fire safety arrangements at factories, commercial complexes, institutes and other buildings in the city.Several persons have lost their lives, while goods worth lakhs of rupees have been gutted in the fire incidents in the past. But, majority of buildings have not ensured fire safety arrangements. Even required arrangements have not been made at government offices, including the civic body’s own offices.According to information, a very less number of buildings have obtained fire safety certificate/no-objection certificate but there is no check on the buildings violating the norms.After a plastic-manufacturing factory near Suffian Chowk had gone up in flames and collapsed in November 2017, killing 16 persons, including nine firefighters, MC officials had announced that a survey would be conducted to check violations and fire safety arrangements in the buildings, but to no avail. However, a few buildings were checked in 2018 by the fire wing of the MC but no survey was conducted in the entire city.In January 2020, the MC had issued instructions to the coaching centres in the city for ensuring fire safety arrangements as per chapter 4 of the National Building Code (NBC)-2016. But, sources said many such coaching centres, running from multi-story buildings, had not made fire safety arrangements.There is no check on the hosiery units, factories, godowns and commercial units running from the narrow streets of the city. The fire tenders can’t even move in such streets. In 2015, a major fire had broken out at three units at Dal Bazar, near Chaura Bazar, but the fire could be doused after three days as the fire tenders could not enter the narrow streets where these units were located.A former councillor, Parminder Mehta said, “Multi-storey commercial buildings, markets or factories have come up in the narrow streets of Dal Bazar, Talab Bazar, Gur Mandi, Pindi Street, Mochpura Bazar, Mohallan Suddan, Daresi and other areas in the old city but there are no fire safety arrangements. There are no emergency exits in most buildings. A number of fire incidents have taken place in narrow streets. The MC and its fire wing should take necessary steps to avoid fire incidents in such areas.”Mehta said many water hydrants that had been installed in the old city were not functioning properly. The authorities should take steps to repair these hydrants, he said.There is no check on illegal or improper stocking of harmful chemicals and hosiery waste in factories or godowns. Major fire incidents have taken place in several buildings where such chemicals or waste were stored. Sources said out of the total fire incidents every year, around 70 per cent of incidents take place at industrial units.Municipal Town Planner SS Bindra said the fire wing staff was responsible for checking the fire safety arrangements. Punjab Fire Services officials had earlier claimed that a survey to check the buildings would be done once a separate Fire Directorate in Punjab was set up. In 2017, the then Local Bodies Minister had also announced that the Fire Prevention and Fire Safety Act would be enforced strictly.An official of the fire wing said, “We check the buildings whenever any application is submitted for obtaining the no-objection certificate. At present, we have no power to take action against the buildings that lack no-objection certificates. A separate directorate for fire services is yet to be set up.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/majority-of-buildings-lack-fire-safety-arrangements-in-ludhiana-246632

Bindra, in a notice, alleged that three building inspectors concerned had played an important role to allow such violations.Bindra said: “These buildings are being constructed without the approval of any building plan.”The MTP has given a three-day time period to the ATP concerned to submit a report and files regarding all types of buildings in Zone B.“If any mishap takes place due to illegal constructions, the ATP and building inspectors concerned will be held responsible. After I receive the report, I will hold a surprise checking in the areas, and if violations are found, action will be taken against the ATP, building inspectors and other employees concerned,” said Bindra.Earlier, MLA Sanjay Talwar had raised questions over the illegal constructions and stated that if any mishap, involving any building constructed against the bylaws took place, then officials of the district administration, the MC, and police officials concerned will also be held responsible along with building owners.Sources said illegal constructions were rampant in Zones A, B, and D but elected representatives concerned were silent over such violations.The residents have also been complaining against commercial buildings in residential areas of BRS Nagar, Sarabha Nagar, Model Town and others but the MC has failed to take any concrete action against the same.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/mtp-finds-100-buildings-being-built-without-approval-of-plan-in-ludhiana-246634

However, majority of consumers and patients hailed from Ludhiana district. Steep demand by patients quarantined at homes and alleged wastage by unprofessional users had resulted in further scarcity of the lifesaving gas.Subdivision office nodal officer Lovish Bansal confirmed that officials had taken stock of the situation regarding supply of medical oxygen to designated Covid hospitals situated in localities falling under Sangrur district. However, none of the healthcare centres in Mandi Ahmedgarh subdivision had been approved as Covid hospital.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/new-oxygen-supply-guidelines-asthma-patients-worst-sufferers-246635

The last received ration supply is also yet to be distributed by schools to the beneficiaries.Fearing ration would go stale, many schools have started visiting homes of students to distribute ration on their own. School authorities say the last received ration supply, which was to be cleared till March/April, is still lying in schools.The schools have been shut for over a year now. Though they were opened for a few days, the state ordered to shut them again owing to increase in Covid-19 cases.A middle schoolteacher said the ration supply had been lying in the school for a long time now and had to be distributed.“We have come to know that the next stock will also arrive soon. We have limited containers to stock the next supply. When the last lockdown was imposed, schools were instructed to distribute the ration among registered students but this time, we have not received any instructions. We cannot take a call on whether to distribute the last supplied ration or not,” said the teacher.A few other schools said they are not left with any ration. The headmaster of a government school maintained that they had distributed the ration to registered families. A senior teacher at Government Senior Secondary School, Jawahar Nagar, said they also had distributed ration to students and were left with no stock.Talking to Ludhiana Tribune, DEO Lakhvir Singh said the department was putting all possible efforts to distribute ration among the registered students and transfer the cooking amount in the bank accounts of families.“In many schools, ration was received in March. There must be only a little stock of ration lying in only a few schools, otherwise all others have already distributed it to registered families,” said Lakhvir Singh. Despite repeated attempts, Prabcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-day Meal Centre, Mohali, could not be contacted for a comment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/mid-day-meal-ration-stock-piles-up-in-schools-246649

Even after extending date for submission of applications for 50 residential plots and sale of five commercial sites (SCOs) through e-auction till April 27, 2021, only 10 applications were received for plots while just two SCOs were sold.According to GLADA officials, in response to the latest offer, 10 applications (all under general category), including seven for plots measuring 100 sqyds and three for 125 sqyds, were. Not even a single application was received for the nine plots reserved for economically weaker sections (EWS).Similarly, out of five SCOs put up for sale in the e-auction, which concluded on April 27, just two were sold while no bids were offered for the remaining three SCO sites.Glada Estate was launched in June last year with high hopes of attracting buyers, but even after an year at least three offers made for allotment of residential plots and sale of commercial sites through e-auctions had received a tepid response from buyers.In the draw of lots on March 1, 2021, only 17 plots were allotted to 19 applicants (under the general category) against the offer for 70 plots. Of the nine plots reserved for the EWS, no application was received.Likewise, the offer for the sale of SCOs had also failed to evoke a positive response as only four SCO’s out of the total nine were sold. According to offer documents, the residential plots carried a reserve price of Rs29,000 and Rs26,100 per square yard for the general and EWS categories, respectively, while the SCOs had a floor price of Rs87,000 per sqyd (total reserve price of Rs1,20,06,000 each).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/no-buyers-for-residential-plots-commercial-sites-in-new-colony-246655

They said through posters they would question the government regarding poor arrangements in hospitals and zero benefits to people during the pandemic.Speakers, including Gurdeep Singh Gosha, Sunil Mehra, Vinod Jain, Rubal Dhall and Bittu Gumber, said it was shameful that there were no beds in hospitals, oxygen was scarce and private hospitals were fleecing Covid-hit people.“Healthcare system has totally collapsed and the government has no arrangements to save lives of people,” they lamented.Leaders of the morcha said the government had imposed restrictions and the entire business community was adversely affected. Under such circumstances, the government had not provided any relief to people, they asserted. The least the government could do was to provide relief in electricity bills, loan installments and other taxes, they added.They said due to policies of the Centre and the state government, traders, industrialists and businessmen were forced to shut their shops while the ruling dispensation was watching the dismal scenario like a silent spectator.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/traders-start-poster-drive-to-press-for-demands-246658
