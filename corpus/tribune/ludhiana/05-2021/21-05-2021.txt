We were given a slip of Rs4,500 and we were told that the remaining amount was for PPE kits that were used for the cremation,” he said. They cremated the body at the crematorium using the LPG.“It’s difficult for families with marginal income to pay such a huge amount,” he said.Kamaljit Singh, a resident of Arjan Nagar, succumbed to the virus at Arora Neuro Centre and his family bore charges of Rs3,000 for performing the last rites and Rs2,400 was charged for the PPE kits. The body was cremated at a traditional crematorium where wood is used for cremation.“I was the only one from the family who went for the cremation but I was charged for three PPE kits. The volunteers who helped me in cremating the body also wore the PPE kits and I was charged for that also,” said Inderpreet Singh, son of Kamaljit.Jaspal Kumar, a resident of Jawahar Nagar, said he lost his father, Mulakh Raj, to Covid and cremated him at one of the gas-operated crematoriums in the city.“Ambulance service was free of cost and at the crematorium we were asked to pay Rs9,500. We paid Rs6,500 and an amount of Rs3,000 was waived off on request, which we were being charged for PPE kits,” he said.Ranjodh Singh, president of the Ramgarhia Educational Council, which manages the gas crematorium at Dholewal, said families are charged Rs4,500 for one funeral which include charges for cylinder, sanitisation and if they need PPE kits, they are charged extra for that.“After cases of overcharging were reported to me, I have fixed the charges. Now, Rs2,500 is charged for four PPE kits and sanitisation, if families do not bring their own kits,” said Ranjodh Singh.The crematorium at Dholewal has four gas chambers and one more will be made operational by Tuesday. One commercial cylinder costs Rs 1,500 and two-three cylinders are used for performing the last rites of the body.“The new gas chamber is made using advanced technology and will reduce gas consumption to 25 kg and cremation time to one hour. The cost of the same will be fixed at around Rs3,000-3,500,” he said.Anil Bharti, president of the Swami Vivekanand Swarg Asharam Trust, said they have fixed the price at Rs4,500 and if anybody was being charged more they should report to them.“I request everybody should take the slip from the Trust so that there is no chance of overcharging,” he said.Gurmeet Singh Kular, member, Swarag Ashram Shivpuri, Dana Mandi Back Side Arora Palace, said they had fixed the rate at Rs3,000 for one cremation and they don’t keep PPE kits at the cremation ground and people bring them on their own.“The team that comes with the body according to the protocol charges Rs2,400 from the family for kits and sanitisation,” he said.Judgepreet Singh, member, Samvedna Trust, an NGO, who is also a member of the cremation cell formed by the district administration, said the ambulance service was provided for free and in addition to this, five PPE kits were given to the marshals for their own selves and the family members of the deceased from the Civil Surgeon office.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-kin-of-covid-victims-forced-to-shell-out-more-for-performing-last-rites-256147

The police have booked the doctor, his team and assistants under Sections 428 and 34, IPC, and Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty against Animals Act on the complaint of the dog owner, Baljit Singh, a resident of Shahpur Kalan village in Sangrur district.In his complaint, Baljit said he had brought his Rottweiler (a German breed) dog for treatment to the GADVASU’s vet clinic on Wednesday morning as the dog was shedding water from his eyes. “In the course of treatment, the doctor and his team covered the dog’s mouth with a muzzle so tightly that after some time it started feeling suffocated and blood started oozing out of the mouth of the dog,” he alleged while adding that his repeated pleas to remove the muzzle from the mouth of dog were ignored.The police said the matter was being investigated and further action would be taken on the completion of preliminary investigation.Meanwhile, the GADVASU Teachers’ Association has taken a strong note of ‘ill-informed’ information regarding the death of the dog in the GADVASU hospital and registration of FIR in the case.Dr Ashwani Kumar, president of the association, said the GADVASU teaching hospital received approximately 30,000 cases from throughout the Punjab and North India, and clinicians were working round the clock to provide the best possible services to farmers and pet owners even during the pandemic and lockdown period.He said the reported case belonged to a senior government official and was presented to the hospital by the guards of the ‘VIP’. “The attendants were unwilling to handle and control the animal. Similarly, the alleged use of jute bag during handling is concocted version whereas the fact is that animal was restrained with muzzle by the guards,” he claimed.According to Dr Kumar, the said dog was suffering from ocular discharge and subcutaneous nodule on chest and the post-mortem had revealed the dog to be tentatively suffering from liver cancer.He asserted that the views reported by the pet owner (or his guard) being diametrically opposite to actual ground position and based on distorted facts, the GADVASU faculty members would continue to hold protest till the FIR against the teacher was not withdrawn.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/vet-team-booked-for-dogs-death-due-to-negligence-256149

Higher officials said teachers were leaving no stone unturned to attract parents to enrol their wards.According to the data available with the department in the district, as many as 900 students have been enrolled in Ludhiana district alone.Expressing concern over new admissions, principals and teachers said: “It is good that government schools are able to attract students but the problem of accommodating new admissions still needs to be dealt with. How can the new students be accommodated in schools where there is no scope of further expansion of infrastructure?”Student strength in govt schoolsThe student strength in government schools across the district is as follows: Jawaddi has 1,343 students; Dhandari Khurd 2,027; Lohara 1,826; Dhandari Kalan 1,622; Giaspura 4,688; Sherpur Kalan 1,295; Sherpur Khurd 1,541; PAU 1,441; and Indrapuri 903.“In many schools, there is no scope of infrastructure expansion and the number of teachers in some schools is also less than the required strength. How can we provide quality education to students with incomplete infrastructure? We immediately require more classrooms to accommodate new admissions. This is also the perfect time to expand infrastructure as schools are closed right now and construction can be done easily. But once schools open, accommodating the new admissions will become a major issue,” said principal of a government school, where more than 250 new admissions took place.A senior teacher of another government school said there school, too, did not have sufficient number of teachers.“We are giving admission to new students but if teachers will not be available, how can quality education be provided? Vacancies should be immediately filled by the department by next year otherwise all those who have taken admission this year, may leave and the purpose of enrolling more students will be defeated,” the teacher said.The schools in Chetsingh Nagar, Shimlapuri, Indrapuri and Chanandevi have only one building.“Chandar Nagar has about 450 students and the school is being run is in a 150-200 square yards area. Where will we make students sit if more new admissions take place?” said another teacher.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/enrolment-in-full-swing-govt-schools-sans-infrastructure-256155

It matures about three to four earlier than the long-duration varieties (Pusa 44, Peeli Pusa and PR 118). Due to a shorter duration for maturation, PR 126 escapes abiotic stresses as well as the incidence of insect-pests and diseases, thereby, leading to lower cost of cultivation. The straw load of this variety is also lower than that of long duration varieties.”Dr Mangat also laid stress on adopting water-efficient and economically-viable technologies of paddy production. Amongst such technologies, the selection of short duration variety (such as PR 126) and adoption of improved agronomic practices were the important inputs, he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/agriculture-expert-dwells-on-cultivation-of-rice-variety-256157
