Many teachers tested positive for the virus with some of them losing their life to the virus, they added.“There are no official orders issued asking teachers to report for duty during the summer vacation. Only verbal instructions are being forwarded to teachers to report to their respective schools for various duties,” a teacher said.Democratic Teachers’ Front state president Digvijay Pal Sharma and secretary Sarwan Singh Aujla said it was uncalled for by the department to call teachers during the break. The teachers said if they were to be called, official letters should be issued for that.“We are called to schools and asked to persuade parents for enrolling their wards in government schools. This exercise has already claimed lives of many teachers during the door-to-door campaign and meeting with parents. When the government has declared summer vacations, then why are we being called on verbal unofficial orders?” a teacher of a middle school in Haibowal said.Another teacher said even online meetings during the break were unjustified. “We have done exceptional work in the recent past to strengthen enrolment in schools. These holidays are for us too. We, too, need a break from our hectic school routine. We are not ready to report during the holidays. This autocratic approach will not be tolerated,” the teacher added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/teachers-express-resentment-over-working-during-vacation-259117
