The MC’s Secretary Jasdev Singh Sekhon said the daughter-in-law of the deceased had contacted the cell as she had expressed her inability to cremate the body.“It was a shocking moment for us when we reached the victim’s house and learnt that the husband and son of the deceased were at home but they did not come forward to perform the last rites. The body was lying on the first floor of the house. They were not ready to go near the body fearing infection. We took the body to the cremation ground and performed the last rites of the woman,” said Sekhon, who is the nodal officer looking after safety protocols at cremation grounds.Similarly in a few other cases, when kin of those persons, who had succumbed to coronavirus, were either refusing or unable to perform last rites amid Covid-19 crisis, the Municipal Corporation’s Covid Cremation Management Cell ensured the dignified last rites of the dead.The Covid Cremation Management Cell is operating under the supervision of the MC’s Joint Commissioner Swati Tiwana. A group of about 10 youngsters has been helping to perform the last rites of the persons, who died of the virus, for one year. This act of humanity of the MC is being appreciated.In another case, a call was received at the cell that a man who came from outside Punjab died of the virus at his relative’s house in Ludhiana. As the relatives were not ready to cremate the body, the MC ensured the last rites.“In some cases, kin did not go near the cremation site due to fear of catching infection but they were seen making videos from a far distance,” said an official.Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said, “It is really sad when someone dies of Covid-19 but it is more heart-breaking when their families do not come forward to pay last respects and tributes. The Covid has exposed the dark side of society with some families in Ludhiana disowning their dear ones who die of Covid. In one case, the family of Covid-19 victim requested the MC for a video call while performing funeral.”Sandhu said, “The cremation cell was working from arranging ambulances, fixing cremation time, firewood or LPG to getting the paperwork done and lighting the pyre. The MC has hired 10 youngsters on the DC’s rate and all of them are performing their duties adhering to Covid protocols.”The MC Commissioner, Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal, said, “The cremation/burial while wearing PPE kits is really a tough job, especially when the temperatures are soaring high but the MC team is doing this job considering service to humanity. The MC will not step back and will make best efforts to cremate bodies in a respectful manner according to rituals/protocols.”Officials of the MC and councillor Mamta Ashu exhorted those families disowning their deceased family members to shun their fears/myths about contracting the infection while cremation/burial and give respect to their loved ones for one last time. “Everybody would die one day and none would stay forever,” they added.Joint Commissioner, MC, Swati Tiwana, who supervises the Covid Management Cell, which is being operated from Lord Mahavira Civil Hospital, said, “Anyone can contact the cremation cell’s helpline numbers 9501500101, 7719712797 and 9501500102 for ensuring that the families of deceased persons face no issue in performing the last rites.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/kin-disown-covid-victims-mc-performs-last-rites-249333

The stock was received by the district this evening and was distributed to the hospitals.A patient admitted to a private hospital was prescribed Remdesivir by the doctor and when the family member went to the pharmacy inside the hospital to get the same, there was no stock.“I was told that I should arrange the injection on my own or else I will have to wait. When I met the doctor, I was told that they have less stock of Remdesivir injections with them. The injections are being given on priority to those patients who are already getting the dose. New patients will have to wait for the stock to arrive,” he said.A man said the first dose of Remdesivir injection was to be given to his father, who had been admitted to a private hospital.“Doctors said although it is required but they will have to wait till more stock arrives. Today the dose was administered to those who had already got their first or second dose as it cannot be discontinued. Patients getting the first dose will be given once they have more stock available with them,” he said.Zonal Licensing Authority Kulwinder Singh said the district did not receive its stock of Remdesivir injections on Wednesday due to which these problems occurred.“We have received the stock and will be distributed to the hospitals in evening.

He had also misled him about the regularisation of the 410 assistant professors in aided colleges. The Higher Education Department vide its September 2019 and August 2020 notification has directed college managements to complete the process of the regularisation of these 410 assistant professors at their own end and submit their salary claims to DPI Colleges. But to date, many managements have held back the regularisation of teachers,” the union president alleged.The members said in spite of the fact that the Education Minister was always positive in his response to the teaching community, the officials in the Department were never ready to listen to teachers’ concerns despite repeated pleas.The PCCTU has warned that it will intensify the agitation against the officials if their issues were not resolved at the earliest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/college-teachers-protest-continues-for-second-day-249348

07-05-2021||Kuldip BhatiaLudhiana||Revenue Dept to continue registration of title deeds||In another development that could have far-reaching ramifications on regulation and enforcement of prevailing laws on illegal colonies across the state, the officials of the Revenue Department here have refused to accept the plea made by the Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) to stop registration of title deeds of plots and buildings located in unlicensed/illegal colonies.The Deputy Commissioner’s office (HRC branch) had written to the additional chief administrator of GLADA on November 26, 2020, that the submission about stopping the registration of title/sale deeds of plots and properties located in Bholpaur village was not feasible in the light of directions made by Special Secretary, Revenue, Rehabilitation and Disaster Management Departments (Stamp and Registration branch) Government of Punjab, vide his office letter December 12, 2019.Citing the aforesaid letter, the DC office maintained that no sub-registrar could refuse to register title/sale deed presented before him. “Therefore, you are requested not to make any further correspondence on this subject,” the DC office wrote to GLADA.Earlier, the state Department of Revenue and Rehabilitation had issued a circular on January 24, 2018, in which it reiterated: “No registrar or sub-registrar appointed under the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908, shall register sale deed or any other document regarding sale of land or plot or building situated in a colony in respect of which licence has not been obtained from the competent authority.”Again, on March 22, 2018, the Revenue Department issued another circular laying down that updated list of illegal colonies and an NoC of entire colony was a pre-requisite and not the NoC of plot/property for the purpose of registration of the sale deed.However, as the state government failed to heed to the recommendation of the Revenue Commission in the early 2019 to amend the Registration Act, 1908, in order to ban sale deeds, the Revenue Department took a volte face and issued a fresh notification dated December 12, 2019, superseding all earlier notifications on the subject, and practically gave a free hand to officials for the registration of sale deeds in illegal colonies without NoCs.Property developer Saurabh Aggarwal said due to legal lacuna, the Revenue Department officials continued to register sale deeds in illegal colonies while claiming that the Registration Act, 1908, being a Central Act, the Department was not bound to abide by the amendment made in the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA), 1995.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/revenue-dept-to-continue-registration-of-title-deeds-249362
