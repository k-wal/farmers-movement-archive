In the letter, association president Badish Jindal said recently a few officers of the department had shown some courage to break the chain of bogus billing, but at ground level the situation was worse.Jindal alleged that evidence showed that even during VAT regime, state’s bogus billing crossed Rs50,000 crores and the trend remained same during the GST regime.“To our shock, the accused officers of the department (as per list provided to us by under RTI) are promoted to important positions. The unbilled sale of finished products, bill swapping and bogus billing is on high rise in the state, which is proving a havoc for state industries and exchequer as well,” said Jindal.“Auto parts, hardware, electrical, bicycle, garments, tools, household equipment and construction-related material is openly sold unbilled in the market,” Jinday alleged.“We have sent complaints with evidence of unbilled receipts, but the department still remains mum on the issue. There is no doubt that without officers connivance such activities are not possible,” said Jindal. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bogus-billing-punjab-small-industries-association-writes-to-capt-amarinder-243487

I am 86-year-old. Many senior citizens above 70 years often go to the post office for personal work. But, at this stage of life, it is difficult for such people above 80 years to climb 23 stairs. Some suffer from breathlessness while climbing stairs.”“Earlier, I had requested post office officials to ensure redressal of grievances, but to no avail. Moreover, at the Janta Nagar post office, the width of stairs is less due to which it is hard to cross another person,” he added.Sher Singh, who is also, a former president of the Northern Railway Pensioners Welfare Association, said, “I have requested the higher authorities to shift the Janta Nagar post office to the ground floor without any further delay. If any person collapses while climbing stairs the responsibility will be of thepostal authorities.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/shift-janta-nagar-post-office-to-ground-floor-says-octogenarian-243485

Unscrupulous developers now openly and aggressively advertise their colonies in print, electronics and social media. Most of them try to befool the gullible members of public with false claims that their colonies are approved by the GLADA .Even after a couple of policies having been launched by the state government for regularisation of illegal colonies across the state which were developed till March 2018, the official number of illegal colonies which failed to avail of the scheme stood at nearly 2,000.“In the intervening period (March 2018 till date) several hundred more colonies have come up which are sparing no attempts to woo the buyers with some of these unscrupulous developers claiming their projects to be approved by GLADA with the regulatory body and its field staff watching the situation like a mute spectator,” says Harbir Singh, a property dealer in Dugri.Advising members of public not to fall for misleading and false claims of unscrupulous developers, senior GLADA officials said the buyers must confirm the status of the colony and bona fides of developers before investing their hard-earned money to purchase residential plots or commercial property in illegal colonies.“We have already recommended registration of criminal cases (FIRs) against many such developers of colonies on Dugri-Dhandra Road and some other locations,” said an official of engineering branch of the GLADA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/developers-openly-advertise-illegal-colonies-in-ludhiana-243484

Large stocks of wheat, which has already been procured, is lying in the open in grain markets,” the leaders wrote in the memorandum.Party leaders urged the Governor to ask the state government to expedite the procurement process by making proper arrangements for gunny bags. Wheat lifting should be ramped up and farmers should be paid for their crop within 24 hours, the SAD leaders urged.Youth Akali Dal district president Gurdeep Singh Gosha said the party would not give up till the issues of farmers were resolved.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/sad-slams-govt-for-tardy-wheat-procurement-243483
24-04-2021||Ahmedgarh/Raikot/Payal||Rain delays wheat procurement at Ahmedgarh||Intermittent rain today delayed procurement and lifting of wheat at grain markets in the region falling under Ludhiana and Sangrur districts causing much inconvenience to ‘galla’ labourers, farmers and commission agents.Shortage of ‘bardana’ (gunny bags) added to woes of all stake holders as the procurement season will now be stretched further.While ‘galla’ labourers will now be required to put in extra labour, commission agents have been asked to arrange more tarpaulin sheets to cover heaps of wheat and stacks of filled bags lying in the open in various mandis. Stakeholders, including farmers, commission agents and labourers, remained busy in making extra arrangements to minimise the loss caused due to wetting of the produce. While commission agents were making arrangements to protect the crop dumped in their yards, labourers were busy draining stagnant water from the vicinity of the stacked produce, which was left open for drying.The Ahmedgarh Galla Mazdoor Union president alleged that successive governments had failed to solve problems of labourers handling unprecedented situations arising at grain markets during every procurement season.Ravinder Singh, a farmer from Lehra village, said, “When officials know that ‘bardana’ is required for filling of procured foodgrain and subsequent lifting, why don’t they make sufficient arrangements in advance?” argued Singh.Justifying issues raised by labourers and farmers, the Mandi Ahmedgarh SDM, Vikramjit Singh Panthey, said commission agents and officials concerned had already been asked to strengthen arrangements to protect the produce in case of inclement weather.—OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/rain-delays-wheat-procurement-at-ahmedgarh-243482

24-04-2021||Harshraj Singh||Ludhiana city bus service gets off track||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, April 23As the authorities concerned seemed to be not serious to improve the Ludhiana city bus service, nearly 70 per cent of the city buses are not plying on road at present. Under the city bus service that was launched with much fanfare in 2011, 120 buses were purchased in different phases by the Ludhiana City Bus Service Limited under the MC, Ludhiana.Around 35 city buses with missing parts have been already lying defunct on Tajpur Road for more than the past five years. Many of the new buses got defunct within a short period. As no lesson has been learnt, now more city buses (mostly big buses), which have been stationed near Dairy Complex on Hambran Road, are gathering dust.Under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) Project worth Rs 65.20 crore, there was a plan to buy 200 buses but only 120 buses were purchased. A demand to start city buses on the routes to various localities and also to educational institutes has been ignored for a long time.There is no direct bus or auto-rickshaw service available to a number of city areas and also several colleges. The MC had earlier planned to start buses on new routes, but to no avail.Col JS Brar of Maha Sabha (NGO) said, “It is a matter of big concern how the new buses had got defunct in a short period. A criminal case should be registered against those responsible for the same. Those who failed the service should be exposed.”“A huge amount was spent on purchasing these buses. The city bus service must be improved and all the buses should be run on various routes for the convenience of residents,” said Col Brar.A forensic audit report prepared by a third-party firm had earlier also highlighted that how Ludhiana City Bus Service Limited had suffered losses and its interest was apparently ignored. But, no action was taken to improve the bus service.When the bus service was launched, the MC’s Ludhiana City Bus Service Limited used to operate the service itself and generating profit. In 2013, it had handed over the bus service to a private firm that operated buses till July 2014.When the city bus service was stalled for some months and tyres and other parts of a number of city buses were getting damaged in 2014, Congress leaders had protested to awake the then state government and Municipal Corporation authorities. To highlight the issue, some Congress leaders had also cleaned several buses at that time. But, even at the time of the Congress government in the state at present, the city bus service is still crying for attention.A BJP leader, Inder Aggarwal, said, “The civic body has not collected pending dues from the current private operator. Despite spending crores of rupees, more city buses are getting damaged but no action is being taken to improve the service. Why the Congress is silent over the poor condition of the city us service now?”In January 2015, the MC had signed an agreement with another private firm that is still operating the buses. Jaskirat Singh, MD of the private firm, said, “The MC had handed over 83 buses to us. Now, we need only 55 buses as per the availability of the routes. We have written to the authorities to take back the remaining buses. At present, we are plying 37-38 city buses (mini) on four routes. If we are given permission of new routes up to the areas located outside the MC’s limit, we can run buses in an easy way.”Senior Deputy Mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra said, “We will look into the matter once the Covid-19 situation improves.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-city-bus-service-gets-off-track-243477
