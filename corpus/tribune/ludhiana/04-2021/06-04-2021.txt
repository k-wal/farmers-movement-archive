According to information, no permission was taken by the owner of Jasmail Singh & Sons’ auto-parts manufacturing unit to raise the level of roof by using jacks.Municipal Corporation officials said the raising of the roof level by using jacks was against the rules and no permission could be granted for the same.The raising the level of roof is a very common practice in the city and has been going on for years, but no action has been taken to stop such violations.Inquiry report not made publicn After 16 persons had died in a plastic manufacturing unit fire and collapse incident near Suffian Chowk in 2017, CM Capt Amarinder Singh had ordered an inquiry, which was conducted by the then Divisional Commissioner, Patiala. Kin of a firefighter, who had lost his life in the incident, had demanded that the inquiry report should be read before public at the tragedy site. However, that inquiry report has not been made public.An official of the MC’s Building Branch, who was present at the incident site, said, “It seems the level of roof was seven feet on the second floor and the factory owner wanted to increase it to 10 or 11 feet. Jacks were used for raising the roof level. For every one jack, one person is placed for support. It seems the walls of the factory building were also weak. Along with the roof, the walls of two sides of the building also collapsed.”Advertisements for raising roofAdvertisements of contractors who use to raise the level of roofs have been displayed at various locations in the area where today’s incident took place. Sources say the work to raise the level of roof is common in some areas of the city, especially where the level of road has risen with re-carpeting without removing old layers of roadMunicipal Town Planner SS Bindra said, “No permission can be granted for raising the roof level as per the rules. Raising the roof by using jacks is a risky work. We are looking into the factory roof collapse incident.”Bindra said, “The factory where today’s incident took place is said to be around 30-35 years’ old as per the neighbours.”Rashpal Singh Gabria, whose office is located in the area, said, “The MC should conduct a survey of the under-construction or already constructed buildings in the area. Required action should be taken against the violations of building by-laws in the factories.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/raising-roof-using-jacks-not-permissible-ludhiana-mc-235357

He said during his earlier tenure, he enjoyed the full confidence of Late PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Dr Manmohan Singh in all major policy decisions and development issues related to Punjab.Centre not sincereHad the Centre been sincere about finding a workable solution to the problem, it would have either consulted the Punjab Government or farmers. —Capt Amarinder Singh, CMVirtually launching the two-day kisan mela organised by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, the Chief Minister expressed his solidarity with the farmers against the farm laws and stressed the Centre should have taken them into confidence before their enactment.The Chief Minister categorically said Punjab, which was initially not even a part of the deliberations on the agricultural reforms, was included in the high-powered committee only after he wrote to the Centre. Even after that, there was no mention of these laws at the committee’s meetings.Pointing out that 144 farmers have died so far during the agitation, he said his government was giving Rs 5 lakh and a job to the next of kin of the deceased farmer, while the Centre continued to be insensitive.On the growing problem of scarcity of surface as well as underground water, he urged the farmers to go for drip irrigation in a big way to save the state from becoming a desert in the near future. “The fast depleting water table is a major challenge for the state and the only solution is to get out of the paddy-wheat cycle to save this precious resource,” he said. He further stressed efforts should be made to adapt to horticultural crops which have a global market with chances of enormous profitability.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/punjab-cm-reiterates-support-to-farmers-arhtiyas-235032
