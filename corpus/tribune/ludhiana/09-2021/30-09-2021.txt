The businessmen looked divided in opinion. While a few said they are already getting good governance and the only issue is that of uninterrupted cheap power, a few others said since the Punjab industry has seen every governance, there is nothing bad if the AAP, too, is given a chance.During his interaction with the industrialists and traders, Kejriwal said before elections, politicians come to businessmen for funds, but today he (Kejriwal) had come to seek the support of the businessmen, traders and industrialists of Punjab. Arvind Kejriwal promised to provide a 24-hour helpline service to the industrialists and businessmen for a permanent relief from the ‘inspector raj’ and best law and order for a peaceful atmosphere.He said if China and other countries are to be left behind in the industry, trade-friendly decisions should be made by the traders, businessmen and industrialists and the AAP government would implement them.Kejriwal said the ‘inspector raj’, corruption and goonda tax continue unabated, which will be stopped. He said no politician or official will be able to intimidate businessmen. Making another big announcement, he said on the lines of the Delhi Government, businessmen will not have to go to government offices for their work. An officer/employee of the department concerned will come at the doorstep of businessman’s house and the work will be done by sitting at home.Kejriwal also announced 24-hour cheap power supply to industries if the AAP forms government in the state.Arvind Kejriwal said, “Because industrialists, businessmen and traders have some common and many different problems, when the Aam Aadmi Party forms the government, there will be a panel of industry and business representatives, which will meet the Chief Minister every 15 days. All the relevant bureaucracy will also be present there. Whatever decisions are made there will be implemented immediately.”He said, “Our country and traders have immense potential but it has not been fully utilised. It will be a miracle if this ability can be put to good use in the true sense.”Kejriwal said, “I have come today to invite you industrialists to join the Aam Aadmi Party and the future AAP government. You will run the government. You make the decisions. We (the government) will implement those decisions as we are doing in Delhi.”Speaking on the occasion, AAP’s Punjab president and member of Parliament, Bhagwant Mann said, “Other political parties make their election manifesto by sitting in AC rooms (drawing rooms), but the Aam Aadmi Party does not make election manifesto like this. That is why we have come to seek suggestions from Punjab industrialists for the party’s manifesto.” Mann said no country or government could function without industry and trade but industries and trade from Mandi Gobindgarh to Dhariwal (Gurdaspur) in Punjab are closed.Meanwhile, Pankaj Sharma, general secretary, Chamber of Industrial & Commercial Undertakings (CICU), said there is no problem with the ruling government. Industry is not facing any inspector raaj, or bad law and order situation, etc. Only thing of concern is the cheap and uninterrupted power supply. “Had there been any big announcement, then things would have been different,” he said.While Amarvir Singh, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association here, said industry has given chance to all political parties, one chance could always be given. “See that there are no airs among the ministers in Delhi, we want that atmosphere. We want that someone should listen to the traders and industrialists for their betterment,” he said.To announce his 2nd guarantee today||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/be-partners-in-aap-govt-in-punjab-arvind-kejriwal-to-industrialists-318022
