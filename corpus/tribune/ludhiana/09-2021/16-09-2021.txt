It has demanded a probe in the allotment of land for the BJP office in the city.During the previous SAD-BJP regime, the then LIT Chairman Dr Subhash Verma (of the BJP) had allotted a 1,000-sq yard land in Model Town Extension at a concessional price of just Rs 4,375 per sq yard, which was many times low than the then prevailing market price.In a counter-attack on the BJP and SAD, that had been targeting the Congress government for the sale of the prime land to an industrial house and realtor at a throwaway price, senior Congress leader and former councillor Parminder Mehta has alleged that the BJP had purchased the land under political pressure.“The said piece of land was meant for commercial purpose but BJP leaders had got the land use changed and thereafter, got it allotted at a nominal price,” Mehta said.Mehta ridiculed the BJP leaders for questioning the sale of land through e-aucion by the LIT at a price of over Rs 60,000 per sq yards during the previous month in the same locality where the land for its office was allotted to BJP at less than 1/10th of this price. He asserted that the allegations of corruption and financial irregularities being levelled by the BJP and other opposition parties were politically motivated as these parties were making a desperate bid to distract the attention of people from real issues concerning the public.He said a complaint to this effect had been lodged with the Additional Chief Secretary, Local Government, Punjab, the Commissioner of Police, Ludhiana, and the Punjab Vigilance Bureau, demanding a high-level probe into the allotment of the land to the BJP, which had cause a financial loss of several crores to the exchequer.Mehta said his complaint lodged with the DGP, Punjab Police, had been marked to the Joint Commissioner (Hq) of Police in the Ludhiana Police Commissionerate for further necessary action as per a communication received by him from the Punjab Police headquarters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/now-land-allotted-by-ludhiana-improvement-trust-for-bjp-office-under-lens-311928

Pain in shoulders and spine-related issues too have started emerging as the prominent side-effects of remote working.According to medical experts, without proper care around 20 per cent people with acute low-back pain will have persistent symptoms for more than a year. Dr Harpreet S Gill, Director, Advanced Orthopaedic Institute, Aykai hospital, said people were facing ortho-related problems as physical activity had decreased and majority of people were working from home. Number of patients coming these days has increased by 10-25 per cent as compared to pre-Covid times. “Due to limited outdoor activity, the deficiency of Vitamin-D is increasing, leading to ortho-related problems. Spine issues, which were earlier reported only in elderly persons, are now prominent in youths too,” he said.POOR POSTURE, LONG SITTING HRS TO BLAMEDr Shubhang Aggarwal, orthopaedic and robotic joint replacement surgeon and Director, NHS Hospital, said despite downtrend, cases of new or worsening back, neck, leg and shoulder pain had emerged among the youths.“Remote working has led to many spine-related issues in young adults in Punjab. Poor sitting ergonomics, such as leaning, slouching, or using a workstation that is too high or too low, can lead to muscle and joint pains. The incidence of spine-related issues, especially in the IT professionals, reception and desk workers have surprisingly increased and needs sharp observation to diagnose. Once suspected, aggressive behavioural modification with exercises should help. Then even when actual physical offices start, the posture changes that we had adapted our bodies to during work from home, need to be tackled,” he said.“Many patients are surprised when I tell them their bedroom or couch seating arrangement is contributing to their pain. Fluffy furniture is comfy. However, slouching over your laptop or lying down while typing is hard on the body. Choose a chair that delivers both support and comfort to your lower back and hips,” Dr Aggarwal advised.“Use a four-inch foot stool under the desk if lower back hurts. Stretch properly. Have an arm support,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/amid-pandemic-work-from-home-becomes-pain-in-the-neck-literally-311655
