The BJP activists were protesting against the sale of prime land in Model Town Extension by LIT through e-auction at very low rates in comparison to prevailing market price of commercial land in that area.Addressing the protesting workers and party activists, district president of the party, Pushpinder Singhal, said the lock on the LIT office was a symbolic gesture to tell the city residents that the LIT no longer served their interests and under political pressure government properties and land were being given on a platter to land mafia.Singhal and other party leaders said the protest would continue till the auction of land conducted on August 16 was cancelled and FIR was lodged against LIT Chairman Raman Balasubramaniam and his patron Cabinet Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. He said when public landand properties were being looted by those in power, the party could not remain a silent spectator.Bikram Singh Sidhu, state executive member of the party, who had held a protest and burnt effigies of Trust chairman and Cabinet Minister Ashu on Wednesday here, demanded that all sales, auctions and allotments of residential plots, commercial and institutional sites and built-up commercial properties conducted during the regime of the incumbent chairman be probed by an independent agency.“At the same time, an enquiry should also be conducted into the financial transactions of the main beneficiaries of the present Congress regime and nexus of realtors and political leaders which was out to usurp government land/properties,” added the BJP leader.Among others present at the protest were state vice president Parveen Bansal, Gurdev Sharma Debi, Sunil Moudgil, Lucky Chopra, Kantendu Sharma, Mahesh Sharma, Vineet Pal Singh Monga, Ashwani Bahl and Rajesh Kashyap.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/e-auction-row-bjp-activists-lock-ludhiana-improvement-trust-office-309159

The teachers demanded his suspension and raised slogans against him. They also flayed the DEO for not taking any stern action against the official.Talking to The Tribune, a teacher said during zoom meetings and other occasions, the Deputy DEO deliberately spoke rudely and arrogantly against women. “We are simply tired of his behaviour. He speaks rudely and uses derogatory language and teachers are unable to handle such pressure. Earlier, one of our fellow teachers had complained against him to the Education Minister and recently, a teacher in Sahnewal suffered a panic attack as Saini spoke rudely to her. We are all educated and such behaviour will not be tolerated,” the protesting teacher said.Unhappy over the dilly-dallying behaviour of the Education Department and the minister concerned, the teachers gathered at Bharat Nagar Chowk to put pressure on the government to immediately take stern action against the official. The traffic was disrupted for about half an hour. Even the mild rainfall could not dampen the teachers’ spirits and they kept the agitating going.It was only after they were assured of a meeting with the Education Minister on Tuesday that the teachers lifted the protest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/teachers-up-in-arms-against-rude-ludhiana-deputy-deo-309160

He lamented that in many cases of dairy loans, the farmers had paid all instalments but due to non-payment of subsidy by the state government, the bankers were harassing them for payment of the balance amount. “For no fault of theirs and solely due to the delay on part of the authorities concerned in releasing the promised subsidy amount, the dairy farmers are being termed defaulters,” he rued.Citing examples, he said several dairy farmers of Jargari village in the district had approached the BKU to complain about the delay in payment of subsidy. There must be thousands of such dairy farmers in other parts of the state who had availed bank loans under subsidy scheme for diversification and adopting allied professions. However, the government apathy had come as a wet blanket on the diversification plans and dairy farmers were made to suffer at the hands of the banks, he added.The affected farmers asserted that the government should make necessary arrangements for timely payment of all subsidies to the farmers, dairy farmers and others who had taken up allied professions because the subsidy amount was calculated towards overall cost of production. Non-payment of subsidy was a betrayal of the farmers and such policies would discourage any further diversification of agriculture.Meanwhile, bank officials assured the protesting farmers that they would ascertain the status of balance susbsidies of all outstanding dairy loans by September 30 and further decision in this regard would be taken thereafter. In the meantime, there would be no harassment of farmers for repayment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/dairy-farmers-protest-non-payment-of-subsidy-309169

However, a number of city roads have still flooded with potholes.According to the information, Rs 55.38 crore were spent during 2015-16, Rs 79.30 crore in 2016-17, Rs 27.96 crore in 2017-18, Rs 22.11 crore during 2018-19 and Rs 27.50 crore in 2019-20 for the maintenance of roads in the city. Besides, an amount of Rs 176 crore was spent on new road works during these five years as per the information.RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal had complained to the Chief Vigilance Officer, demanding a probe into the matter. He had alleged that there could be a scam as the large amount has been drained out from the public exchequer from 2015-16 to 2019-20 but the condition of several roads was still poor.The complainant had also alleged that the B&R branch had not maintained the record properly. “There is no proper record available that where these Rs 212 crore were spent. It is not clear that how many roads were maintained by spending this huge amount”, the complainant alleged.After receiving the complaint, the director of the Department of Local Government had written to MC in February 2021 to send a report along with the record within 10 days in this regard but the MC had failed to follow the orders. The department had then sent reminders to the MC too but the CVO office had not received any reply to date, according to the CVO office.Now, the Chief Vigilance Officer has asked the MC Commissioner to instruct the Superintending Engineers of all four zones to make sure their presence along with the proper record (including tender documents, estimates, measurement books, etc.) regarding the amount spent on construction and maintenance of roads as per the complaint at the CVO office on September 15.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/irregularities-in-road-works-cvo-asks-civic-body-ses-to-bring-records-309170
