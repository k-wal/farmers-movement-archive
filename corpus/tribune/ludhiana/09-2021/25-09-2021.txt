An underground wire was also visible at one of the cave-in sites. Now, the work is on to repair the stretch.Around a 10-20 feet long portion of land, outside a house, had caved in after rainfall in August 2020 at Dugri Phase 2 as the same old sewer line was passing beneath there too.Now, the residents are demanding from the civic body to take required steps to install a new sewer pipe line by replacing the old system to avoid any mishap in the future. According to civic body officials, the dart sewer is more than 40-year-old.Varinder Pathak, who lives near the damaged road portion site, said: “A similar incident of road cave-in had occurred last year too. Chances of more such incidents can’t be ignored in the future as the old sewer line is made of bricks.

As the rate has been reduced from July 1, 2021, officers retired during the above corresponding period are in a state of dilemma as to what percentage of NPA they will receive on pay revision from January 1, 2016,” averred Dr Walia.Dr Nitin Kumar Gupta, former CEO, Punjab Gau Sewa Commission, stressed that the said notification was unjust and would not stand scrutiny of lawand would unnecessarily increase litigation.He urged the Chief Minister to intervene in the matter so that justice would prevail.He said the development agenda of the government could be implemented by employees.“Instead of a policy of confrontation, the new CM is requested to fulfil the just demand of doctors of Animal Husbandry and Health departments to implement the NPA notification from January 1, 2016,” he demanded.Dr Sanjeev Khosla, former Director Animal Husbandry, Punjab, lamented that due to the delay in notification of pension revision, there was great unrest among the pensioners.“It should be issued immediately so that at the fag end of their lives, they could lead honourable lives post-retirement,” he stressed.Former Deputy Directors Dr Bimal Sharma, Dr Rajinder Kumar Vasdev, Dr Nirmaljit Singh Mahal, Dr Raghunandan Sharma, Dr Rajiv Bhandari andDr Ramesh Sofat were among those others present in the meeting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/npa-notification-erroneous-say-vets-seek-charanjit-channis-intervention-315856
