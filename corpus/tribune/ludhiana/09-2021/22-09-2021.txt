Because of which they are unable to cope up with the dual stress-the NAS preparation and completing the regular syllabus. The teachers feel though many topics have been covered under the NAS project, there were many topics that had not been covered so far. Teachers are finding it difficult to complete the syllabus.Talking to The Tribune, Ramanjit Singh from the Democratic Front said because long gap came between the regular studies of students, they were finding it difficult to cope up with everything.“But still we are making every possible effort to prepare them well for the NAS. But honestly, we too feel confused at times as syllabus is yet not covered and we are just focusing on NAS to be held in November,” he said.The top rank among states and union territories bagged by Punjab in the recently released Performance Grading Index has given a boost to the Education Department and the state seems fully geared up to strengthen its top rank by achieving first position in the NAS, said Dr Devinder Chhina, media coordinator here.The Learning Outcome-based question banks and quizzes of different subjects have been prepared on the pattern of NAS question papers. Besides, questionnaire for teachers and people have also been prepared. The Education Department has started organising special training workshops for DEOs/Dy DEOs, District Parho Punjab coordinators, Cluster Master Trainers (CMTs) Block Maater Trainers (BMTs), Zila Sikhiya Sudhar Teams, District and Block Mentors of different subjects, school heads, subject teachers, private and government aided school teachers to sensitise them to the NAS.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/preparations-for-nas-in-full-swing-at-government-schools-314632

Passing through the pandemic, doctors have observed that post-Covid recovery, patients are facing problems of memory loss and brain fog.“On this World Alzheimer Day, I want to discuss how after recovering from Covid, patients are facing problems of memory loss and brain fog. The problem is seen across age groups and nearly 30 per cent of the recovered patients are facing the issue. The problem is more in elderly patients,” said Dr Monika Singla, associate professor of neurology at the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital.She said recovered patients are complaining of headache, memory loss, lack of attention and lack of enthusiasm. Many people have complained of feeling sluggish and unable to think properly. Some patients are also getting into depression, having mood swings and mental fatigue.“After recovering from Covid, patients should take plenty of rest and accept body’s limits. Besides, practising meditation and yoga can also prove helpful,” Dr Monika said.Another city based neurologist from a private hospital said patients after Covid recovery were facing issues such as memory loss.“The best way to overcome this is to start practising attention-enhancing activities such as playing scrabble, chess and sudoku, one time in a day. Most important is to give your body rest and let it recover and heal but keep the brain working,” he said.A Covid-recovered patient while sharing his experience said Covid had taken a toll on his confidence as now, he is less productive than earlier and had been missing deadlines at work and unable to focus on his projects. “Sometimes my mind just goes blank and find myself lost in thoughts while doing some important work or attending an important meeting,” he said.Tips for Covid-recovered patientsEarly signsPreventing alzheimer||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/30-per-cent-of-recovered-covid-patients-facing-memory-loss-314631

The commuters blamed the authorities concerned for turning a blind eye towards the poor condition of the road.Questions are already being raised over the role of the MC and other departments concerned for ignoring the poor condition of various roads in the city. The badly broken road (Bachan Sing Marg) that links Hambran Road with various colonies and villages falls under the jurisdiction of the PWD.Residents alleged that the road has not been repaired for the past nine years by the department concerned and the condition has turned worse on the stretch this rainy season.A resident, Anoonp Singh, has met with mishaps on the badly broken road multiple times. He has raised the matter before the authorities concerned in the past too but to no avail. “I pass through the stretch in routine but it has not been re-carpeted or reconstructed in the past nine years. Even the potholes have not been repaired leaving the commuters to face inconvenience. Accidents generally take place on the stretch but the authorities concerned and elected representatives keep ignoring our pleas. We demand from the state government to direct the department concerned to reconstruct the road without any further delay.”A commuter said, “We suffer more during the rainy season as the water remains accumulated in big potholes. Mishaps are common on the badly broken and slippery stretch these days. Moreover, vehicles are getting damaged while passing over the dilapidated road. We pay taxes but we are deprived of the basic amenities. It is very shameful for the government for failing to get the road even repaired. The responsibility of the government authorities should be fixed.”Executive Engineer, PWD, Charanjeet Singh Bains said tenders have been floated for the road work and it would take some more time to start the road work.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/big-potholes-on-bachan-singh-marg-causing-mishaps-314612

The intending buyers of residential plots can now submit their applications till October 13, 2021, while bids for the SCOs would be accepted from eligible bidders till 1 pm on the same date.From among the residential plots being offered for allotment, 25 plots, measuring 100 square yards each, would be free hold with a reserve price of Rs 29,000 per sq yd, whereas five plots of the same size are reserved for economically weaker section (EWS) applicants who would get these plots at Rs 26,100 per sq yd.Five SCOs to be sold through e-auction have a floor area of 138 square yards each and carry a floor price of Rs 87,000 per square yard.GLADA had launched this residential-cum-commercial scheme with much fanfare in June last year but contrary to its expectations, buyers did not evince much interest in residential plots and commercial sites in the much-touted new colony. Even after having made four offers for sale of plots and SCOs in June last year and then again in March, April and July this year just 121 residential plots and seven SCOs could be sold.GLADA apparently seemed to be desperate to sell the remaining residential plots and SCOs, and understandably so, because the colony was conceived as a self-financing scheme and not so enthusiastic response from the buyers is now draining GLADA resources in terms of carrying out internal development works in the colony.As per offer document, the applicants for residential plots would have to pay 10 per cent of the total cost of plot as earnest money with the application, while the eligibility fee for participating in the e-auction of SCOs has been fixed at Rs 3 lakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/now-apply-for-plots-scos-in-glada-estate-by-oct-13-314611

A senior citizen, Satish Sachdeva from Punjab Mata Nagar said, “All the officials should work as ‘sewadars’ for the public. Along with ensuring their presence at offices for public dealing, the officials must also ensure redress of public grievances in a time-bound manner. The public-friendly environment should be maintained at all government offices. Routine checking or surveys should be done to get feedback from the visitors at the government offices.”A resident said, “The officials should work with honesty so that the issues of people are resolved timely. Private agents are often seen at various government offices and the visitors are forced to visit such agents when their works are not done.
