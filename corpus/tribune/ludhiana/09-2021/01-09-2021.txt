Some repair/construction work was carried out in 2016, but the quality of material and workmanship left much to be desired and soon, the road was again dotted with potholes.The affected residents have been taking up the matter with PWD officials concerned, the Municipal Corporation (as a part of the stretch falls within the city limits), and even the Chief Minister’s Office, but to no avail.In a recent representation to the Grievances Cell of the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO), Varunesh Kumra and other area residents said there were discrepancies in the reapir work carried out in 2016 and the estimated project cost was slashed from Rs204.81 lakh (fixed in 2014-15) to Rs132.80 and finally, the work was executed for Rs80 lakh.“For cutting the cost and reduction of total expenditure by 60 per cent, specifications, quality of material and workmanship was not up to the mark, water drainage system was not put in place. To sum up, the repair and maintenance work was shoddy,” said the residents.They said the road width was not increased to cope with the traffic volume. The area residents have called upon the state government to order a probe into the reasons for curtailment of the budget and poor workmanship for repair and maintenance carried out in 2015-16. “At the same time, directions should be issued to the PWD authorities for reconstruction/strengthening the road,” says the representation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/noorwala-road-in-a-shambles-residents-blame-official-apathy-304879
