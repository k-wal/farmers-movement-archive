The Sahnewal Nagar Panchayat has been able to cover selective wards or streets while others are still waiting for it, the residents complained.Despite the fact that fresh dengue cases were being reported now and then, the civic body seemed to be adopting a lenient approach.“Each day, dengue cases are being reported from the city. But the administration here seems to be just watching the situation, which needs immediate and urgent attention. They just watch the show, allow the situation to get worse and swing into momentary action thereafter,” rued Harbans Singh Sains, a resident of Ward Number 7.Balwant Singh, a resident of Ward Number 12, said “No fogging has been carried out in our ward. The situation is grim, and we have to pay sweepers from our own pocket as the Nagar Panchayat’s safai karamcharis do not even enter the ward. Sewage and filth has jammed the sewers in the area, making the environment ideal for flies and mosquitoes to breed.”Manjinder Singh Bhola, a resident of Ward Number 2, said, “The town seems to be left entirely at the mercy of God. Lack of regular fogging is aggravating the situation. Residents are falling ill but the council is least bothered. On the one hand, there are instructions from the administration to undertake fogging while on the other hand, we are yet to see it happening in our wards.”Executive Officer of Sahnewal Gurbakshish Singh said, “Fogging is being conducted regularly. I have already made a plan as per which employees are supposed to cover particular wards on particular days. We shall ensure fogging in every nook and corner of the town. I shall personally see to it that not even a single ward or locality is left out.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/dengue-fogging-yet-to-be-undertaken-in-many-sahnewal-areas-312437
