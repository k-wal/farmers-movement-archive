The party also slammed the government’s policy of evading legitimate demands of employees.Balkrishnan Kirti, Sukhdev Singh, Gurcharan Singh Lapar and Joginder Shehzad also addressed all those present at the meeting.—OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/mcpi-united-to-support-sept-27-bharat-bandh-call-315514

As the situation has improved the government has asked businessmen to deposit the Goods and Services Tax and generate e-way bills. If businessmen fail to deposit the Goods and Services Tax, they won’t be able to generate e-way bills and will be blocked by the department concerned.There are few others, who believe that if businessmen have charged the Goods and Services Tax from the buyer, why should there be any delay on their part to deposit it with the government?These businessmen believe that those, who do business in a transparent manner and pay all taxes, will never think twice before depositing the Goods and Services Taxon time with the government.“The particular demand to not to stop their e-way bills is coming from those businessmen, who don’t pay due taxes and are engaged in circulating fake inputtax credit (ITC),” say genuine taxpayers.Talking to The Tribune, Rajan Garg, vice-president, Small Scale Steel Re Rollers Association, Khanna-Mandi Gobindgarh, said, “We believe that the government should not give relaxation for any period. If we are doing any business honestly, then there should be no problem with paying taxes to the government. If Goods and Services Tax returns are filed on time, tax is deposited and genuine businessmen get the input tax credit in a transparent manner. When we collect tax from customers, why should we hesitate in depositing it with the government?”Welcoming restrictions, another businessman Badish Jindal said, “Strict implementation of the Goods and Services Tax system will eradicate the menace of bogus billing in the country. Good companies will file return on time. Firms, which issue fake invoices and don’t file returns, will be blocked from getting e-way bills. Besides, the government will also monitor all such fraudulent companies (online) so that genuine businessmen do not suffer.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bizmen-favour-filing-regular-gst-return-to-generate-e-way-bills-315511

Builders have also removed grills installed alongside pavements in block C and E of the colony to gain access to the main road,” said complainants. Affected residents of the area wondered as to how all this construction of commercial buildings was going on because as per the building norms in normal course, officials concerned were supposed to inspect all under-construction structures to issue completion certificate at the foundation level, then till the door level and finally at the lintel level.Residents of SBS Nagar have demanded that the menace of illegal commercial buildings in the colony be sternly curbed, a probe be initiated to fix responsibility of guilty employees and officials and violators be brought to the book.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/no-check-on-construction-of-illegal-buildings-at-sbs-nagar-315508

Commuters struggled while passing through badly flooded main and internal roads of the city.Several vehicles, including cars and two-wheelers, were stuck after developing snags in the knee-deep water on the roads. Also, some two-wheelers slipped on roads. Some people were seen helping others by pushing their vehicles stuck on waterlogged roads. The rainwater entered slums on Old GT Road near the Buddha Nullah bridge. Rainwater entered some houses at Shivaji Nagar, Hargobind Nagar and other low-lying areas. Meanwhile, there were reports of rainwater entering shops at Talab Bazar, Gur Mandi, etc.It was difficult for commuters to pass through heavily flooded Link Road near Preet Palace. The situation was almost similar outside the MC’s Zone C Office and other parts on Gill Road, Ludhiana, Hambran Road, Panj Peer Road, BRS Nagar, Transport Nagar, Old GT Road, Dholewal, Rekhi Cinema Chowk and many other areas. Sewers overflowed too at different locations. A flooded underpass near Chand Cinema was closed for traffic movement.As the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) failed to take the required steps as major waterlogging occurred on the Ludhiana-Delhi highway, Ferozpur Road and Chandigarh Road, leaving the commuters to face a lot of inconvenience. The storm water drains are lying defunct on the highways. Meanwhile, some persons also shared videos of waterlogged roads with “Smart City Ludhiana” status on social media.Leader of Opposition in MC House Harbhajan Singh Dang slammed the Municipal Corporation after heavy waterlogging occurred in various parts of the city. Dang also criticised the civic body for failing to repair the potholed roads due to which the commuters suffered a lot.“The situation has turned worse in the city these days. There is no proper drainage system in the city, while the civic body failed to ensure the timely cleaning of road gullies,” he added.About 89 per cent area of the city lacks a storm water drainage system. However, the MC and elected representatives failed to resolve the waterlogging problem in many parts of the city.Municipal Corporation officials and employees visited different areas to get the accumulated water drained from roads. Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu also inspected city areas.Road caves in at Dugri Phase IIA road in Phase II, Dugri, caved in at four points on Thursday.
