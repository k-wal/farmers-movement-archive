But ultimately the LIP chief would have to go to jail for his crime against a widow and hapless woman,” said Dhanda.Former YAD president Gosha made a scathing attack on the city police and ruling Congress leaders for their overt and covert support to the rape accused (Bains). It was due to the support of ruling party leaders that the police had still not arrested the LIP leader and he was permitted to mock the law.“Our party is standing rock-solid behind the rape victim and we will take the matter to its logical conclusion,” Gosha said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bains-lodging-false-firs-against-rape-victim-kin-sad-leaders-310918

Announcements are being made through loudspeakers at religious places and other sources to alert the residents to protect themselves from the dog.A video of the black stray dog attacking a girl in Chandar Nagar on Saturday afternoon has gone viral. A few women came to her rescue but she received multiple injuries.In another incident, Priya (35) was bitten by the same stray dog near her house. She is currently under treatment at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). “I have received deep wounds in the attack by the stray dog. I was admitted to the hospital on Saturday night. When I reached the hospital, I came to know that the dog had bitten eight persons before me,” Priya maintained.Subash Sood (70) said, “A black stray dog attacked me just outside my house on Saturday night. The dog bit both my legs and then ran away. I have got a dose of anti-rabies vaccine. The government must take the matter seriously as some other persons have also been attacked by the dog.”Residents, along with teams of the MC, were trying to find the dog but it is yet to be caught. Activist Keemti Rawal said, “In Chandar Nagar alone, at least eight persons have been bitten by the suspected rabid dog.
