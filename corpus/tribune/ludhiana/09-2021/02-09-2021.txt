To sum up, the repair and maintenance work was shoddy,” said the residents.They said the road width was not increased to cope with the increasing volume of traffic.The area residents have called upon the state government to order a probe into the reasons for curtailment of the budget and poor workmanship for repair and maintenance carried out in 2015-16. “At the same time, directions should be issued to the PWD authorities for reconstruction/strengthening the road,” the representation stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/noorwala-road-in-a-shambles-residents-blame-official-apathy-305407

In order to finish the VIP culture of private unaided schools, action as per law should be initiated against private unaided schools also for knowingly violating the mandatory provisions of the statutory act and submitting vague self-declarations, Sabharwal had complained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/take-action-against-schools-violating-rte-act-deos-told-305405

Harnek Singh Dhalliwal, convener of the action programme, claimed that companies and contractors providing services at the dry port had started supporting the farmers’ struggle. “Some of them have requested us to allow themto remove their machinery and material, which we will allow, provided they give in writing to boycott the port,” said Dhalliwal, maintaining that some heavy machinery was allowed to move out after taking undertakings.He further said that the organising committee comprising office-bearers of various kisan unions had categorically declined the administration’s appeal to lift the dharna or shift the venue on pretext of a case filed by Adanis in Punjab and Haryana High Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/firms-support-farm-stir-move-machinery-from-adani-dry-port-at-kila-raipur-305404

The daily positivity rate, a key indicator of virus surge, plummeted from a whopping 13.44 per cent in August 2020 to 0.06 per cent this August, which was the lowest-ever monthly hit rate recorded in the district so far.August 2020 vs August 2021Covid cases dip from 6,976 to 168Deaths down from 325 to 4Daily hit rate plummets from 13.44% to lowest-ever 0.06%The official figures compiled by the district administration, which are available with The Tribune, revealed that Ludhiana district reported 6,976 Covid cases at the daily average of 225.03; 325 deaths at the daily average of 10.48 and daily hit rate of 13.44 per cent in August 2020.This August saw only 168 virus cases at the daily average of 5.42, four deaths at the daily average of 0.13 and daily positivity rate of 0.06 per cent.While last year had recorded maximum daily cases of 462 on August 21 and minimum of 78 daily infections on August 2, the maximum daily cases this year remained 34 on August 11 and no virus case was reported on August 24, 28 and 29.The compilation of average positivity rate showed that Ludhiana district had recorded 0.8 per cent in June and 0.1 per cent in July, which was much lesser than the state average of 1.8 per cent in June and 0.3 per cent in July.The safe trend has been persisting since June when the district had made a remarkable turnaround by recording the daily positivity rate even below 1 per cent.The development holds significance as Ludhiana had earlier assumed the dubious distinction of being the worst-hit district with the maximum number of daily Covid cases and deaths till May.If it was mayhem in May when the second Covid wave had rapidly slid into a devastating crisis with the health facilities unbearably falling short, oxygen supplies running low and many dying even without seeing a doctor, June had given a sigh of relief with the signs of gradual retreat and impact of deadly virus plateauing and the safe trend continued in July and August when the hit rate further dipped to as low as 0.06 per cent, which was lowest-ever, last month.This U-turn was all the more significant as the daily positivity rate has dropped by a whopping 19.51 per cent from the highest-ever ratio of 19.57 per cent in the past three months. The district had touched its peak of virus surge on May 2.The daily hit rate has been plummeting constantly since the last week of May.Ludhiana’s positivity rate had started at a high of 18.92 per cent on the first day of May, further rising and touching its peak of 19.57 per cent on May 2.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/year-on-ludhiana-district-sees-massive-dip-in-covid-cases-305403

However, the LIT authorities turned down the proposal without citing any solid reason for doing so,” he asserted.The BJP leader said it was not the solitary instance of bungling in the sale of land and property as only recently Trust land in BRS Nagar and Rajguru Nagar were sold on a throwaway prices by the LIT Chairman in connivance with his political masters.“Also, the land earmarked for the community centre and the school were sold away for commercial purposes,” he remarked.Sidhu emphasised that it was the need of the hour to put an end to such illegal and shady sale of government land that ought to be used for the benefit of the public and guilty politicians and officials should be booked for their misdemeanours.He said a complaint against the ongoing malpractices in the LIT had already been sent to the Chief Minister, Local Bodies Department and Vigilance Bureau, Punjab.If the government fails to initiate a probe, the matter would be taken to the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the BJP leader added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bjp-terms-ludhiana-improvement-trust-e-auction-a-multi-crore-scam-seeks-probe-305399

Two big city industrialists were recently duped of Rs 6 lakh by cyber crooks and a domestic consumer of a few hundred rupees.After the police got to know about the fraud, the cyber wing of the city police started a probe.As per information, two city-based industrialists had received an email regarding their electricity bill of Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 3.5 lakh, respectively, and a link was given in the name of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL).Considering emails from the PSPCL, industrialists clicked on the link and deposited the bill as per the given instructions. Later, when they received a notice from the PSPCL regarding the non-payment of bills, the victims went to enquire from the department and were shocked to know that the bill was paid on spam link.Sub-Inspector (SI) Jatinder Singh of the cyber cell said after receiving complaint when probe was started, it was found that cyber criminals have now chosen this modus operandi to defraud people and probe will definitely expose the people behind it.“It is surprising that criminals were aware about the bill cycle of people and even the average bill and they send fraudulent emails to such consumers only. It is being suspected that criminals are having data of consumers. We will also scan the role of PSPCL officials if any during the probe,” said SI Jatinder Singh.The third person defrauded by the accused was the domestic consumer who had made a payment of few hundred rupees by clicking on the link sent by the cyber crooks.The cyber wing has requested the people if they receive any such fraudulent link asking for electricity bill, they should not click on such links and inform the police immediately.To make the people aware about such frauds, the city police are posting video messages on the official Facebook and Twitter accounts of the Ludhiana police.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/two-ludhiana-bizmen-lose-rs-6-lakh-in-electricity-bill-e-fraud-305398

As his cavalcade reached Sahnewal, members of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), chiefly the Rajewal and Kadian groups, gave vent to their anger against the three farm laws.Also read:Farm protesters gherao Bikram Singh Majithia in Sri Hargobindpur14 booked for damaging cars at Sukhbir Badal's Machhiwara Sahib rallyBlock president of Kadian group Rajvir Singh and general secretary Mandeep Singh accused Badals of initiating and leading the final passing of the three contentious laws, which they said were sure to plunder and bring the farming community on the roads. They also condemned his 100-day rally, which they said was primarily to secure his party’s position in the coming elections and not for the welfare or concern for the farming community.Had his tour been for the cause of the farmers, he would have stood in their support, they said. The protesters also accused the SAD for being a mute spectator in the Bargari incident, despite the fact that it had the power to reign in truth and justice at that time.The police had a tough time handling the protesters and bringing the situation under control. Meanwhile, addressing a huge gathering at a local palace, Sukhbir asked people to vote in favour of development and farsightedness. Reiterating the 13-point agenda of the SAD- BSP alliance, he said each and every section of the society shall get its due within a stipulated period of time.Addressing his rally, named ‘Gal Punjab Di’, he said “Ours is the party which knows how to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto, be it the completion of flyovers, electricity projects, 24-hour power supply to industry and farming community, increase in old-age pension, special package to riot victims, employment to youths, sports quota for excelling players or free higher education, especially for girls. This we promised and delivered during our tenure but as opposed to this, theCongress has failed to fulfil its promises,” said the SAD president.“Congress stands as a divided party today. When a party has failed to keep its own house in order, when will it find time to look towards the general public? The party leaders are seeking majority votes within the party itself. It does not have the capacity to reach out to the common man and solve his problems. Rather, the Congress is patronising gangsters and thus leading to lawlessness,” he expressed.Terming the Congress and AAP party leaders as liars, he said no party could flourish on the foundation of falsehood and deceit. “The SAD is known for its performance, which it shall, once again, prove if voted to power,” Sukhbir asserted. “SAD was the only party that stood up against the Centre by voting against the three black laws in Parliament, even as both the Congress and AAP backed out. The war is on but only those warriors who have stayed committed throughout, shall come out victorious at the end of the day,” he expressed.Earlier, Sahnewal MLA Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and senior Youth Akali leader Simranjit Singh Dhillon welcomed the SAD president and assured that they would leave no stone unturned to strengthen the party and make it victorious in the coming elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/farmers-protest-mars-sukhbir-badals-rally-in-sahnewal-305395
