Reportedly, no bidders are showing interest in the project.The bridge, said to be more than a century old, is located on the Old GT Road near Chand Cinema and was declared unsafe around nine years ago. But, the Municipal Corporation ignored the bridge and its design for reconstruction was finalised this year.When the tenders for the reconstruction of the bridge were floated in May at an estimated cost of Rs 5.84 crore, a senior official had stated that the project would be completed within a year. However, the project is yet to see the light of the day as nothing has been done on the ground level. The bridge is in a dilapidated condition from different points and bricks generally fall off it. The safety walls are also in bad condition.A wall was constructed on the road portion of the bridge earlier this year to stop traffic movement. It was closed for heavy vehicles in 2018 and later for all kinds of vehicles, except two-wheelers.After the closure of the bridge, traffic from Jalandhar Bypass towards Clock Tower was diverted through a nearby bridge.Parminder Mehta, the newly appointed OSD to Mayor, said, “I will take up the matter with MC authorities and Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu so that the reconstruction work can be started at the earliest.”An MC official said tenders had been floated for the project five times but bidders did not participate in the process.

But, it was not mentioned anywhere in the agenda regarding fixing of the reserve price for any vacant site at Model Town Extension.On February 15, 2021, the meeting of a committee, led by the DC, was held for fixing the reserve price of LIT properties under various schemes, including the Model Town Extension scheme. Notably, the meeting was also attended by Cabinet Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, MLA Surinder Dawar, Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu and MC Commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal.The DC said the reserve price was fixed at Rs 28,103 per sq yard for residential plots and Rs 56,207 per sq yard was fixed for built-up commercial booths in the Model Town Extension 400-acre scheme.Now, advocate Bikram Singh Sidhu, a senior BJP leader, today sent a complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Ludhiana, demanding an inquiry and registration of an FIR against the LIT Chairman and those others involved in the alleged land scam.Terming the land auction as another ‘Ludhiana city centre scam’, Sidhu said the auction of the land was conducted against the standard procedure and the LIT had not got the reserve price fixed for auction from the committee concerned.In the complaint, Sidhu alleged that it was a scam of Rs 250 crore wherein a prime chunk of land situated on Dugri and Model Town Extension Road was auctioned by the LIT Chairman in connivance with a Cabinet minister of the ruling Congress government to benefit their close associate.“This fraud not just amounts to cheating with people and the government but also a huge loss to the state exchequer,” he alleged.He said the prime land was earlier earmarked for SCOs under the proposal of making a food street with an estimated Rs 400 crore revenue generation.“But, the land was auctioned merely for Rs 98.38 crore. Moreover, the market price of the residential land near the auctioned property is Rs 1,25,000 per sq yard while the price for the commercial land is Rs 2,25,000,” he said.Sidhu also pointed towards a few more properties allotted through a draw yesterday.LIT chief denies allegationsOn the other hand, LIT Chairman Raman Subramaniam said advocate Bikram Singh Sidhu was levelling false and baseless allegations without producing any evidence. He alleged that Sidhu was concocting false stories. He said the land was auctioned in a transparent manner as per the procedure. The LIT Chairman said the reserve price for the land auction was fixed by a committee led by the DC on February 15, 2021. He further denied the allegations regarding irregularities in the draw for allotment of properties.AAP seeks probeAAP leader Ahbaab Singh Grewal said a probe should be conducted into the matter by a central agency in a transparent manner.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/controversy-over-auction-of-lits-prime-land-deepens-306974

Even amid pandemic, it was thriving on the basis of trade with Afghanistan.In the present scenario, Afghanistan and Dubai are the major buyers of sewing machines but in Dubai, China is ruling, while in Afghanistan, the local industry is sending material.Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club, said Afghanistan was a bulk buyer of sewing machines and its parts as the Muslim community, who have expertise in embroidery, lives there and a sewing machine is their basic need.“The trade became stagnant in the past due to demonetisation and then the pandemic struck. We were sailing through tough times due to our trade with Afghanistan. But after the unrest in Afghanistan, the trade has come to a standstill and the production has come down drastically as there is hardly any demand in the market. Before Covid-19, 5 lakh sewing machines were exported monthly and now the figure has come down to just 1.5 lakh. The days ahead are going to be tough,” Sokhi said.Kulwant Singh, club general secretary, said at present no orders were being dispatched and everything was on standby. “We are only waiting for things to normalise. Of all the things exported to Afghanistan, sewing machines constitute a major part,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/afghan-crisis-hits-ludhiana-sewing-machine-industry-306744
