09-09-2021||Nikhil Bhardwaj||Police monitor traffic with drones in Ludhiana||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, September 8To ease traffic congestion on city roads and find out cause of traffic nuisance in the industrial hub, the Ludhiana traffic police have come up with a novel idea to use drones. The drones are being used to monitor the traffic situation in the city.Joint Commissioner of Police (City) Deepak Pareek, who is supervising the initiative, said the purpose behind the idea was to first get to roots of traffic nuisance in certain city areas. The root cause of traffic mess can be many such as encroachments on roads by shopkeepers or roadside vendors, ill-mannered parking of vehicles (temporary or permanent), wrong architectural design of road or a stretch and lack of traffic lights.“We have just started the initiative and soon city residents will see positive results. We are using drones in the presence of experts and are noticing the reason of traffic jams. Long deliberations are going on to come with the best possible solutions,” JCP Pareek said.Pareek said shopkeepers, residents and even officials of the Municipal Corporation were also involved in discussions in this regard.“At some places near the Malhar road after studying the cause of traffic mess through drones, the issue was resolved by putting barricading, deployment of police personnel and removal of encroachments,” Pareek said.After the police posted information about the initiative on their official Facebook page, people also gave feedback to ensure smooth traffic in the city.Daljit Singh stated that “quality of roads should be the priority. Encroachments on roads is the main problem. Anybody can encroach roads at will”. Another comment by Mukesh Sharma says “please focus more on crowded places where roads have been encroached, resulting in traffic blockades.”Rahul Jain says “if you stop people taking wrong side of the road, most of the traffic-related problems automatically get resolved.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/police-monitor-traffic-with-drones-in-ludhiana-308692

The committee consisting of at least one police official not below the rank of ASI, motor vehicle inspector, a delegate of DEO and representative of PTA, is supposed to convene a monthly meeting to review implementation of the policy.”Earlier, speakers including Executive Magistrate Pawandeep Singh, SHO (City) Winner Preet Singh, subdivision traffic incharge Kulwant Singh, assistant governor Rotary Club Dr Ravinder Sharma, district coordinator Education Department Khalil Mohammad and Principal Viney Goyal regretted that majority of accidents occur due to dearth of skilled and expert drivers and to avoid this, the drivers should be trained and educated about road safety and traffic rules.DSP Ahmedgarh Sandeep Vadhera said beat officers and traffic staff had been advised to ensure that drivers of all vehicles carrying students implement safety norms. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/social-educational-bodies-roped-in-for-safe-school-vahan-scheme-308689

The consumers are being harassed by the SDO and the JE. We raised these issues before the PSPCL authorities today, demanding action against the officials.”Kainth alleged that “an illegal colony has come up on the Sangowal-Khanpur village road and the PSPCL officials have taken a bribe to instal a direct power supply line to the illegal colony. The matter should be probed and action must be taken. FIR should be registered against the guilty officials.”Chief Engineer, PSPCL, Ludhiana, Bhupinder Khosla, said a probe into the complaint was already underway and the inquiry report would be submitted by the officer concerned by September 30.MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains said: “It is a big scam committed by the PSPCL officials as electricity poles and wires were installed on a 1.5-km-long stretch to provide direct power supply to an illegal colony. When a complaint was made to the Chief Minister, the officials concerned had also made efforts to remove the power supply line. We demand an FIR should be registered against the officials who are involved in corrupt practices. After arresting the officials, the police should question them to bust the nexus. When we raised the matter before the PSPCL Chief Engineer today, he informed us that a complaint has also been sent to the Dehlon police for further action.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/2-pspcl-officials-involved-in-corrupt-practices-lok-insaaf-party-308691

We demand a prompt high-level investigation and registration of an FIR in the matter,” said Sidhu.DCC president comes out in support of Ashu, LIT chiefMeanwhile, District Congress Committee (Urban) president Ashwani Sharma has come out in support of Cabinet Minister Ashu and LIT Chairman Raman Balasubramaniam by terming the ongoing protest by the BJP activists as “politically motivated drama” in a desperate bid to distract the attention of people from real and burning issues of public interests.Addressing a press meet here today, he said rather than wasting their time finding faults with the working of the Ludhiana Improvement Trust and Bharat Bhushan Ashu, the BJP leaders ought to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reduce the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG which were skyrocketing.He said the local BJP leadership and even their senior state-level leaders were scared of their diminishing public image in the state, especially after the way the farmers’ agitation had been dealt with by the Centre.“BJP leaders should stop such cheap political gimmicks and focus on development of the city and the state,” the DCC chief said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bjp-activists-burn-effigies-of-minister-bharat-bhushan-ashu-ludhiana-improvement-trust-chairman-308682

On September 8, the positivity rate touched 0.01 per cent with only one of 9,069 tested persons turning positive in the district.However, the active case count has been rising since September 1 from 14 to 22 on September 2, 23 on September 3, 24 on September 4, 23 on September 5, 27 on September 6, 30 on September 7 and 31 on September 8.Similarly, the number of home isolation cases since September 1 from 9 to 12 on September 2, 21 on September 3, 22 each on September 4 and 5, 23 on September 6, 27 on September 7 and 30 on September 8.The district has also been having no serious or critical case since September 3 after the lone patient on ventilator was discharged on September 2.With the lowest monthly death count of four recorded in August, a single fatality has been reported in the district this month so far on September 6.While the recovery and cumulative case fatality rate has been static at 97.6 per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively, since July 7, the daily CFR has been nil for over a month, barring five days – four in August and one in September — when a single fatality was reported in the district each day.The safe trend has been persisting since June when the district had made a remarkable turnaround by recording the daily positivity rate even below 1 per cent.The development holds significance as Ludhiana had earlier assumed the dubious distinction of being the worst-hit district with the maximum number of daily Covid cases and deaths till May.If it was mayhem in May when the second Covid wave had rapidly slid into a devastating crisis with the health facilities unbearably falling short, oxygen supplies running low and many dying even without seeing a doctor, June had given a sigh of relief with the signs of gradual retreat and impact of deadly virus plateauing and the safe trend continued in July, August and September when the hit rate further dipped to as low as nil on August 28 and 29.This U-turn is all the more significant as the daily positivity rate has dropped from the highest-ever ratio of 19.57 per cent in the past three months. The district had touched its peak of virus surge on May 2. The daily hit rate has been plummeting constantly since the last week of May. Ludhiana’s positivity rate had started at a high of 18.92 per cent on the first day of May, further rising and touching its peak of 19.57 per cent on May 2.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/no-covid-patient-hospitalised-in-ludhiana-district-all-3-386-beds-vacant-308677
