The PAU has contributed tremendously to the ushering in of green revolution in the country through the development of varieties PV 18 and Lerma Rojo 64. Punjab, a small state, is making maximum contribution to the food buffer stock of the country.”“The university and the State Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare are making all-out efforts for the prosperity of farmers and agri-development. Punjab farmers should reap full benefit from it,” he urged.Pointing out agricultural challenges, he said water issues were deepening due to scanty rainfall as well as snowfall, resulting in low water levels in dams and ultimately, leading to power (electricity) woes.Captain Amarinder called upon farmers to refrain from sowing water-guzzling varieties and instead adopt less water-consuming varieties and drip irrigation technique to conserve water.He also stressed upon farmers to opt for crop diversification to augment their farm earnings. Referring to the ongoing protests against three contentious farm laws at different borders, the Chief Minister called upon the Central Government to scrap the three agriculture laws.He said the state government had given compensation of Rs 5 lakh to families of farmers who had lost their lives during protests and jobs to their wards.Suresh Kumar, Chief Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, was the special guest.Anirudh Tewari, Additional Chief Secretary (Development), Punjab, and Vice-Chancellor, PAU, said the mela theme, ‘Efficient paddy straw management keeps mother earth exultant’, was aimed at promoting in-situ management of paddy straw which was through incorporation into the soil.”Dr Inderjeet Singh, Vice-Chancellor, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), said GADVASU had collaborated with 18 Krishi Vigyan Kendras of the PAU for trainings in animals husbandry. Besides, it had tied up with 10 international ranking universities in the field of academics and research.Dr Singh also briefed about research and extension programmes underway in the university.Dr Jaskarn Singh Mahal, Director of Extension Education, said kisan melas were a platform for farmers of the state and adjoining states to gain scientific knowledge. Last year, farmers from Pakistan also participated in the fair.Though melas were being held virtually, every effort had been made to provide quality seeds, inputs and information about latest recommendations to the farmers at their doorstep, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/two-day-virtual-kisan-mela-kicks-off-at-pau-312833
