To keep the heart healthy, one should stay away from refined carbohydrates, bakery products and red meat. One should include more fruits and vegetables in the diet and walking for 30 to 40 minutes should also be included in daily routine,” said Dr Bishav Mohan, medical superintendent, Hero Heart DMC Hospital.He said excessive gymming and consuming protein shake afterwards were not proving good for health and on the other hand, yoga had given positive results.Dr Mohan said Indians were deficient in protein and thus, consumption of almonds, walnuts, soya bean, cottage cheese and egg which was cost effective, should be increased.Dr Arvind M Das, director of cardiology at Max Hospital, said a witnessed collapse should immediately trigger a resuscitation response. It involves firstly checking the pulse of the patient and calling him out to check his responsiveness. The fall could be due to low blood pressure or low sugar.“However, if your instincts tell you that this could be a cardiac arrest, then an immediate response is mandatory. Remember you have just five minutes — any delay would lead to irreversible brain damage. Bystander CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is important when one is dealing with a cardiac arrest patient. Now that there is less emphasis on mouth-to-mouth respiration, stand-alone chest compression is easy to do and learn with similar results. The next step is to call for help — for an ambulance, so that paramedical personnel arrive at the site to take over. Even if it means continuing compressions for 30 minutes, one should continue to do that,” he said.Pay attention||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/world-heart-day-stay-away-from-refined-sugar-bakery-products-red-meat-to-keep-your-heart-healthy-say-doctors-317560

Getting inspiration from stalls at kisan melas, Manjit is now a successful entrepreneur and owns a nursery.“I always had attraction for fairs since my childhood days. My family’s main occupation was agriculture and I still remember it was in 1998 when I first visited a kisan mela. Our elders used to grow traditional crops to which he was averse. Stalls and exhibitions at farmer fairs kept inspiring him to do something new. By seeing others displaying their works on fair stalls, I set my goal to be one of the leading agri entrepreneurs in coming years,” Manjit said.After thorough discussions with scientists and other farmers during farmer fairs, he decided to set up a nursery venture in 2012-13. Initially, he started growing bell pepper nursery on 0.5 marla in 2012-13. His only intention at that time was to learn. Later, he expanded his area under the nursery to 1,000 sq m and with the help of PAU scientists, he fulfilled his dream of setting up his stall in the farmer fair in 2018.He earned a handsome profit of Rs 1 lakh from an area of 1,000 sq m only from his nursery venture in his first attempt. He started using his savings for further development of his farm. The KVK, Mansa, provided him with a vermi-compost unit to promote organic farming and reduce the cost of cultivation.“I also installed walking tunnel at my farm where I grow nursery of tomatoes, peppers and pumpkins in pro-tray nursery and mastered the art. My income increased by Rs 80,000 with the adoption of this technology. In addition to increasing the area under the vegetable nursery, now, I am also growing the nursery of paddy and kharif onion, besides expanding the area under Rabi onion as seed crop,” Manjit said.Inspired by his success in nursery raising, four young farmers from his village have taken up vegetable and nursery cultivation, contributing to diversification.“Farmers’ fairs have brought laurels to me. I wish that the Covid-19 situation improves soon so that farmers may take the advantage of farmer fairs like in the past. Farmer fairs are not only educative but also entertaining and we tend to enjoy delicacies from across states,” he said.Inspires young farmers from his villageInspired by the success of farmer Manjit Singh in nursery raising, four young farmers from his village have taken up vegetable and nursery cultivation, contributing to diversification.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/kisan-melas-turn-farmer-into-entrepreneur-317561

The November exams will have half of the syllabus and the February-March exams will have the other half.While many teachers feel that students will be less burdened this way as the syllabus will be divided, the latter and some parents believe they will be under continuous stress for all these months.‘Happy with this exam system’We are happy with this system but still, there are students who are not taking it seriously.

Harmit Kaur, Principal of Nankana Sahib Public SchoolTerming this as more “student-friendly”, principal of Nankana Sahib Public School Harmit Kaur Waraich said it would be easy for students now as the syllabus would be divided and also be the marks.“We are happy with this system but still, there are students who are not taking it seriously. Otherwise, the semester system is always good as compared to the annual system,” she said.While Gunika, a student of Class XII who scores over 90 per cent marks, said for getting good marks, intelligent students would have to study continuously.“Now, unit tests will be taken by the school which will be over by October 15 and by the second week of November, the board exams are expected to be held.

He had directed that all roads in bad condition be repaired within a week or else penal action would be taken against the guilty officials.Commissioner, MC, Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal said repair work had already started on Ferozepur Road, Kaka Marriage Palace Road, PAU Road, Pavitter Nagar, Jagraon Bridge and in several other areas of the city.He said in accordance with the directions of the minister all MC officials concerned had been directed to complete repair of all city roads within a week. “A roadmap (for urgent repair of roads) has been prepared and in case of non-compliance or dereliction, responsibility of the officer concerned would be fixed and action taken as per rules,” he added.Earlier in the day, Ashu had issued a warning to the MC officials to immediately carry out repair of all city roads or face consequences for non-performance.

29-09-2021||Kuldip Bhatia||Ludhiana Municipal Corporation, LIT defy NGT order on concrete around trees: Council of Engineers||Ludhiana, September 28Kapil Arora, president of Council of Engineers (CoE) has moved the National Green Tribunal (NGT) against severe damage being caused to environment both by the Municipal Corporation (MC) and Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) here in defiance of directions made by the tribunal.Arora recalled in the petition that he had filed one petition with the NGT seeking directions to the Ludhiana MC, LIT and Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) to remove concrete fixed within one-metre radius of bases of trees in the city and accordingly the NGT had directed all three departments to take remedial action as per law.He said even as GLADA had started removing interlocking tiles and concrete structures from around the trees at various locations, both the MC and LIT seemed adamant and continued to defy the NGT directions in this regard. “This act (of MC and LIT) is against the environment norms,” he added.The petitioner submitted that since both the development authorities had not removed concrete structures within one- metre radius of bases of even a single tree in trees grown at public places under their jurisdiction even after sending various representations to both the departments, the representatives of various NGOs, including CoE, organised peaceful protest in front of the offices of the MC and LIT. However, both the bodies deliberately and intentionally kept on defying the NGT orders.Citing the facts of forest cover in the city which is just 1.6 per cent of its geographic area against the national target of 33 per cent, he stated that around 84 trees were uprooted following two storms this year. “The Supreme Court has held that there should be a proper balance between protection of environment and development activities. There can be no dispute that the society has to prosper, but it shall not be at the expense of the environment.”Arora pleaded that since both the departments are adamant on damaging the environment, the petition had been with the prayer of imposing penalty on the LIT Chairman as well as the Commissioner of MC for violating ‘environment norms’ by their unlawful act in blatant violation of the National Green Tribunal directions. He also sought compliance of directions in letter and spirit (by MC and LIT) through a monitoring committee of the NGT or Central Pollution Control Board.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-municipal-corporation-lit-defy-ngt-order-on-concrete-around-trees-council-of-engineers-317565
