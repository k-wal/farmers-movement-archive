The school van was not following safety precautions while carrying the children. It appears that the schools have scant respect for safe transportation of school children. The transport authorities have failed miserably to enforce the safe school transport policy in Bathinda district. Being custodian of the safe school transportation policy, I will raise this matter in the Punjab and Haryana High Court again and demand for strict action against the erring schools as well as Transport Department and traffic police officials for not enforcing the policy,” Soi said. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/schools-admn-not-enforcing-safe-transportation-policy-says-soi-358001

A resident near Middha Chowk said he had witnessed that the axed parts of this oldest tree were loaded in tractor-trailers that had made around eight rounds. He said a tractor-trailer, in which the wood was being shifted to another place, seemed to be of the MC. He said the tree was protecting people from scorching heat in summers and rain as well. Moreover, some street vendors used to station their carts under the large tree.Jaskirat Singh, an environmental activist said, “The axing of the trees is a serious crime under the Environment Protection Act-1986. Eight trees have been murdered near Middha Chowk. Now, we want strict action against those who committed the crime.”The MC’s Horticulture Wing and area councillor expressed ignorance about those who axed the trees.
