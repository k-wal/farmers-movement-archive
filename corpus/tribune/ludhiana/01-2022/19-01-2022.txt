19-01-2022||Mahesh Sharma||Whom to choose first-time voters' dilemma||Mandi Ahmedgarh, Jan 18First-time voters, predominantly teenagers and students, are disillusioned over choice of candidates ahead of the Assembly elections, scheduled on February 20.Constitution of governments on the basis of caste and creed, frequent shifting of loyalties of candidates, alleged ‘auctioning’ of party ticket and most prevalent trend of alluring masses through freebies have disappointed them. The first-time voters wish to elect only those deserving candidates who intend to provide transparent governance, ensuring self-reliance, peace, free healthcare, quality education, dignified lifestyle for all categories and assured future for intelligentsia.Social characteristics such as age, gender, relationship status, educational level, religious tolerance, residence and occupation were also cited as the criteria for choosing candidates of their choice. Shruti Goyal, a second year BSc student from the Mahavir Road area, said the recent political chaos in the state had confused the first-time voters over choosing candidates for the Assembly polls.“What to talk of youngsters like us, even experienced and seasoned statesmen will find it difficult to arrive at a conclusion from claims of different political parties as none of these has emerged untainted in implementing policies projected in their manifestos,” said Shruti Goyal, adding that she would vote only for a candidate who would work for education and career of the young generation.Divya Sharma, a Class XII student of MGMN Senior Secondary School, said malpractices such as commercialisation of the election process, horse trading in local bodies, state Assembly and Parliament should be completely banned.“Though I come from a political family, I will only vote for a candidate who is capable and committed for resolving problems of residents of his or her constituency,” Divya said while maintaining that NOTA would be her option in case she does not find a suitable candidate.Another youth, Dhruv Joshi, of Malaudh village said most of the politicians fail to comprehend that youngsters’ demands and aspirations were different from elders.“Candidates aspiring to be a part of the government should understand that we are the future of the state and the nation. Those winning elections should acknowledge it and provide us resources and training, besides giving this region a transformation, which we want,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/whom-to-choose-first-time-voters-dilemma-362570

The officials have also been directed to get the damaged roads repaired or even reconstructed, if desirable, at the cost of the contractors.According to MC officials, several road projects were executed during the past two months at a huge expenditure and repair works were also carried out on many other damaged roads at a cost of around Rs 10 crore.“The MC officials were under immense pressure from leaders of the ruling party to complete construction of roads in adverse weather conditions, which has led to rotting roads across the city, due to the Assembly elections which were due in February and expecting model code of conduct coming into force any time, ” said an MC official.With a large number of newly constructed and recarpeted roads getting peeled off and broken down, commuters on Hambran Road, Pakhowal Road, College Road, Model Town, Dugri, parts of Ferozepur Road, Lodhi Club Road and many more in old city areas were a harassed lot.“To make the matter worse, even the repair works on these damaged roads was not possible in the prevalent weather which meant that residents would continue to bear the brunt of negligence on the part of the MC officials for some more time,” said a harassed resident of Dugri.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/most-new-recarpeted-roads-in-city-peel-off-due-to-poor-quality-362566

Entry of farmers’ outfit in the poll fray will be beneficial for the Congress as it will eat into the AAP and SAD vote banks. — Amrik Singh Dhillon, Congress MLAThe wind of change is blowing in the state and the same will sweep the Samrala seat as well. We are hopeful of scripting history this time. — Jagtar Singh, AAPPublic wants to teach the traditional political parties a lesson this time. We are getting an overwhelming response and are confident of winning with a thumping majority. — Balbir Singh Rajewal, SSMOur alliance with the BSP will do wonders this time and we are way ahead than our rivals in the poll fray. People are fed up with the ruling party. — Paramjit Singh Dhillon, SAD-BSPBuoyed by the success of the farmers’ agitation, Rajewal (78), who is the chief ministerial candidate of the SSM and founder of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal faction), was one of the 30 nominees declared so far by the SSM, which has also forged an alliance with the Sanyukt Sangharsh Party (SSP) formed by a Haryana farm leader, Gurnam Singh Charuni, giving the latter 10 seats to contest.Though the ruling Congress has not yet declared its Samrala candidate in the first list of 86 nominees announced so far, the principal Opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has already named Jagtar Singh and the SAD has fielded Paramjit Singh Dhillon to contest from Samrala.Both these parties, which had ended runners-up (AAP) and third (SAD), have, however, replaced their previous candidates – Sarbans Singh Manki (AAP), who had polled 40,925 votes, constituting 30.55 per cent of the vote share, and Santa Singh Umaidpur (SAD), who had got 38,114 votes, accounting for 28.45 per cent of the total polled votes, in the 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections.The sitting Congress MLA, Amrik Singh Dhillon (79), who had won the seat four times — 2017, 2012, 2002 and 1997 — besides contesting unsuccessfully in 2007, is hopeful of getting the ticket.“I have proposed the name of my grandson Karanvir Singh Dhillon (31) but the party high command is still undecided on his candidature and instead, wants me to contest again,” the veteran leader told The Tribune on Tuesday.Amrik Dhillon, who had polled 51,930 votes, constituting 38.77 per cent vote share, added that his first preference was the ticket to his grandson but if the party high command insisted him, he would abide by the decision and was ready to recontest this time as well.Except the winner Congress, runners-up AAP and third-finisher SAD, all other six candidates, including Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP’s) Dalvir Singh, had lost their security deposits in 2017. As many as 1,035 voters, accounting for 0.77 per cent of the total votes polled, had opted for the “none of the above” (NOTA), which were more than other six nominees, last time.Besides Dhillon winning four times in 2017, 2012, 2002 and 1997, the Congress had also represented the seat in 1992, 1980, 1962 and 1957. The SAD had won Samrala in 2007, 1986, 1977, 1972, 1969 and 1951.This time, there are 1,74,410 electorates, including 91,734 male, 82,671 female and five third gender, which were 7,871, accounting for 4.73 per cent, more than 1,66,539 voters registered in this constituency in 2017.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/samrala-turns-hot-seat-with-ssm-supremo-rajewal-in-fray-362565

This compactor system was inaugurated just before the last Assembly elections around five years ago to resolve the problem of the uncovered garbage dump.Residents complained that the static compactor has not been functional for the past few months. Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu had earlier inspected the site and he had then asked officials to install new machines there. But, the MC is yet to make the compactor system functional again.Deepak Nagpal, a resident of Model Town Extension, said the garbage is being dumped along the road, adding to public inconveniences. “It is hard to breathe due to stink emanating from the garbage being dumped along the road. The Municipal Corporation should take the necessary steps to make the static waste compactor functional properly at the earliest,” he said.Another resident said, “It seems the waste that is dumped along the road is not even timely lifted. Big heaps of waste are welcoming the commuters. Whenever the traffic light signal turns red, many commuters stop near the dump. The situation has turned worse after the recent rainfall. If the static waste compactor is not functioning, the civic body must ensure timely lifting of the waste from the dump.”The MC has failed to resolve the problem of several other big garbage dumps located along the road in various parts of the city. However, the Ludhiana Improvement Trust has installed static compactors at some locations. The MC had also identified a number of more sites but static compactors are yet to be installed there.Health Officer, MC, Dr Vipul Malhotra said the static compactor near Canal Bridge on Dugri Road is not functioning.
