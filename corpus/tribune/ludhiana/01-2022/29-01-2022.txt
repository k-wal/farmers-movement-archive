Dog-bite victimIn yet another incident, a rabid dog bit more than 12 persons, including elderly people and children, on Sunday evening. Power failure and inclement weather compounded problems of the victims, who had to shuttle between private and government health centres, for treatment of multiple injuries. Residents alleged that doctors at the Civil Hospital failed to provide adequate treatment to patients, some of whom were referred to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala.However, the SMO, Civil Hospital, Khanna, Dr Sat Pal, claimed at least 12 victims, who reached the hospital, were provided proper treatment according to the dog-bite management protocol.“Besides managing wounds our doctors gave a required dose of anti-rabies vaccine to almost all patients except two, who were referred for management of tendon injuries and advanced type of vaccination, which is not available at either of local hospitals,” said Dr Sat Pal.Residents shivered remembering the rabid dog-bite nightmare at localities situated on Amloh Road. Had it been summer and victims were not in warm clothes, injuries could have been much more. Some residents managed to defend themselves from the rabid canine with an umbrella they were carrying.Bala Rana, a middle-aged woman, said the dog had bitten on her face when she bent down to pick something to scare it away. She was going to attend Path at her friend’s home on Sunday evening.Balwant Singh, another resident, alleged that the power failure and inclement weather further compounded problems of the victims, who had to hire ambulances to reach hospitals in distant cities.Raghbir Singh Rana and Surinder Sofat were among others, who urged the administration to save residents from the menace of stray dogs in various localities of Khanna. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/stray-dog-menace-goes-unabated-365146
29-01-2022||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Farmers to observe 'Vishwasghat Diwas' on Jan 31||Farmers across the nation would observe ‘Vishwasghat Diwas’ (betrayal day) on January 31 against failure of the Modi-led NDA government at the Centre to implement their pending demands, which were accepted in writing when their agitation against three farm Acts was withdrawn.Bharti Kisan Union-Lakhowal (BKU) general secretary Harinder Singh Lakhowal said as per a decision taken by all constituents of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) farmers would hold demonstrations in front of offices of Deputy Commissioners at district headquarters, SDMs at subdivision towns and also burn effigies of the Modi government.Lakhowal said it was most unfortunate that false cases registered against farmers had not been withdrawn, no compensation has been announced for farmers killed during agitation and no high-powered committee had been set up to settle the MSP issue. The SKM had served an ultimatum to the Centre for acceptance of all demands by February 1, 2022, failing which farmers’ bodies would launch another agitation and teach the ruling combine a lesson in the Assembly elections, Lakhowal said. —                                     #FarmersProtest||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/farmers-to-observe-vishwasghat-diwas-on-jan-31-365145

Uma Rani, a councillor, said both Kuldeep Kaur and Kirat Kaur were leaving no stone unturned to apprise women voters of achievements and vision of Kamil Amar Singh.“Unlike routine campaigns Kuldeep Kaur and Kirat Kaur spend enough time with progressive women, who can further harness support for the Congress candidate,” said Rani.Simran Kaur Maan, sister of the Amargarh Congress candidate, Smit Singh Maan, has succeeded in piloting the election campaign of her brother by reaching out to parents of young girls known to her from school and college days. She is leaving no stone unturned in exploiting relations of her two time legislator father advocate Dhanwant Singh. Jaswinder Kaur Sharma, councillor, Ward No. 5, said Simran had highlighted achievements of her brother, who was Maharaja Ranjit Singh Awardee, former international skeet shooter and a postgraduate from Oxford University, while interacting with residents of Dehliz Road during door-to-door campaign today.Sanyukt Kissan Morcha Khanna nominee Sukhwant Singh Tillu’s wife Inderjit Kaur Pandher has been working overtime to buttress election campaign of her husband and is mobilising women from agricultural families, who had earlier been associated with year-long agitation, which concluded with the withdrawal of the three controversial farm laws.Election managers of Khanna candidate Gurkirat Singh Kotli have constituted special teams of women campaigners under the supervision of Gurpreet Kaur, wife of Kotli, for undertaking intensive door-to-door campaigns in their segment.Harpreet Kaur Kang, who has been associated with the functioning of five colleges run by her husband KNS Kang, an AAP candidate from Dakha, besides visiting families to illustrate the Delhi model of government, has formed teams to respond to calls from students and alumni of their institutes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/women-activists-at-the-forefront-when-it-comes-to-campaigning-for-elections-365144

Industrialists maintained that every other day, candidate from one party or another called for a cup of tea, but they were in no mood to be hosts. It is because they were doing only 60 to 70 per cent business, industrialists added.One of the businessman, wishing not to be quoted, said by this time during elections, meetings of industrialists were convened to support party or candidates. “But this time, we have no such intention. None from industrial circles has called for raising funds. They all know that we cannot afford to provide funds. We are struggling because there is insecurity of orders in the market and prices of steel are fluctuating. Besides, prices of other raw material and wages of labour have also increased. How can we collect funds for candidates?” said businessmen.They maintained that already crores in the name of development or one time settlement policy were given in last few months to leaders of the ruling party, which bore no fruits.“We cannot afford to collect and provide more funds to parties or candidates. Our actions have already conveyed that we cannot help them,” said another industrialist in the Focal Point area. Meanwhile, Avtar Singh Bhogal from Bhogalsons said, “The industry is under tremendous stress because of uncertainty. The new government, which comes to power, should focus on the welfare of the industry because if it flourishes the state will grow. They should provide an environment free of corruption.” —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/industrialists-mum-on-providing-funds-to-parties-365142

Dhillon’s wife Pawandeep Kaur, however, filed the nomination papers as a covering candidate.The electorate should decide wisely without any external pressure. The developmental phase, through which the state had passed during the Akali regime and the deterioration thereafter, must be enough to make voters decide as to which party actually deserves a chance. — Sharanjit Singh DhillonAs opposed to the Congress, Dhillon is the sole candidate from the party without any internal opposition. He won the Sahnewal seat in the Punjab Assembly elections in 2012 and 2017.He was the only candidate from the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) to win from Ludhiana in 2017. His victory in 2017 elections, despite an anti-incumbency move in the last elections, was seen as consistent efforts made by him during his last tenure.Later, he was appointed as chief of the SAD in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha. Prior to this, he was chairman of the Agro Industry, Punjab, Ludhiana MP and president of the Youth Akali Dal. He also remained the PWD Minister and Irrigation Minister of Punjab. Besides ensuring sewerage and water supply in the town, a railway overbridge, sub-tehsil status, constructing roads even in remotest villages, construction of Dream Park, a model police station, Mattewara overbridge and Cycle Valley in Dhanansu are considered among his major contributions as MLA of the Sahnewal constituency.“The choice is very clear this time. No candidate of any party has any competition with me. Congress candidate Bajwa has suddenly surfaced after a gap of nine-and-a-half years. AAP candidate Hardeep Singh Mundian has been shuttling from one party to another. SAD has been the only party, which has remained steady in Sahnewal. My victory in every election bears testimony to the fact that people love me for being rooted to the place, remaining aligned to them and rising above the party limits,” Dhillon asserted.“The electorate should decide wisely without any external pressure. The developmental phase, through which the state had passed during the Akali regime and the deterioration thereafter must be enough to make voters decide as to which party actually deserves a chance. The Congress has a bad reputation in the Centre as well as the state. It stands as a divided party today. Its leaders are seeking majority votes within the party itself,” said Simranjit Dhillon, the Akali leaders’ son.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/dhillon-files-nomination-papers-as-sad-bsp-candidate-from-sahnewal-365139
29-01-2022||Nitin Jain||Ex-CM, Speaker's constituency in for multi-cornered contest||Ludhiana, January 28The Payal Assembly constituency, which had been represented by the former Chief Minister and Vidhan Sabha Speaker in the past, is in for a multi-cornered contest for the high-stakes Punjab Assembly polls, scheduled to be held on February 20.The Congress’ heavyweight and slain Chief Minister Beant Singh had represented this rural seat four times consecutively and his son Tej Parkash Singh, who had served as Transport Minister, twice consecutively, while the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) veteran leader and former Assembly Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal had also been elected from this segment in 2012.The entry of the newly-formed two farmers’ outfits the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM), comprising 19 farm unions, including the one led by Balbir Singh Rajewal, and the Sanyukt Sangharsh Party (SSP) formed by a Haryana farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni, which have forged an alliance, and the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, a new alliance partner of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) has made the contest multi-cornered at the state’s once most important constituency, which had remained a Congress bastion, this time.While the ruling Congress has reposed faith in its sitting MLA Lakhvir Singh Lakha, the principal Opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which had ended runner-up in 2017, has fielded a new face Manwinder Singh Giaspura.The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), having finished third last time, has left this seat for its new ally Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which has nominated Dr Jaspreet Singh Bija. The SSM has allotted ticket to Simardeep Singh Dobourji while the SAD (Sanyukt) has fielded Harshit Kumar Sheetal.Except the ruling party’s legislator, all other candidates in the poll fray this time are new faces from here.Lakha, 46, who won in 2017 after losing his maiden election from here in 2012, is seeking votes on the basis of performance of the Congress government and his own work for the constituency during the past five years. Contesting his third election, Lakha had remained the president of Khanna district Congress and Youth Congress president in the past.Giaspura, 46, who had joined the AAP after leaving the Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) in March last year, said education, health, and employment generation were his main poll promises. Though it was his maiden Assembly election, he had unsuccessfully fought the Lok Sabha election from the Fatehgarh Sahib constituency on the LIP ticket in 2019 and had polled 1.42 lakh votes.Doburji, 31, who is contesting his maiden election, wants to make the constituency self-reliant with the setting up of food processing units and skill development centres. He said the rampant sale of illicit liquor and drugs in the area were main poll issues this time.Bija, 37, who is a practicing doctor, is raising the issues of rampant drugs and illicit liquor menace besides poor condition of roads, basic civic amenities, health, education and sports facilities in the area, despite being represented by the then CM for four times in a row.Sheetal, 33, who is a small time trader in Ludhiana, is seeking votes for the overall development and welfare of all sections of society with the help of the BJP government at the Centre. He had quit the BJP to join the Dhindsa’s SAD for his maiden electoral battle.In 2017, Lakha had defeated AAP’s Gurpreet Singh Lapran by a margin of 21,496 votes, by polling 57,776 votes, which accounted for 44.19 per cent vote share, against 36,280 votes, constituting 27.75 per cent of the total votes polled, secured by Lapran.SAD’s Isher Singh Meharban had got 33,044 votes, accounting for 25.27 per cent vote share, to finish third. All other 10 candidates, including BSP’s Dalbara Singh, who had polled mere 618 votes, constituting 0.47 per cent vote share, had lost their security deposits, while 702 voters had opted for the “none of the above” (NOTA).In 2012, the SAD’s Charanjit Singh Atwal, who remained the Vidhan Sabha Speaker from 2012 to 2017, had trounced Lakha by a narrow margin of just 630 votes. While the Congress represented this seat for a maximum of 10 times in 2017, 2007, 2002, 1992, 1980, 1977, 1972, 1969, 1967 and 1962, the SAD candidates had won from here thrice in 2012, 1997 and 1985.CandidatespeakPUNJAB POLL 2022The winnersI’m seeking re-election on the basis of my performance.

No such meeting has yet been announced and the Chief Engineer of the PPCB expressed inability to organise any meeting, citing ongoing election duties. AGAPP insisted on a meeting soon, saying it has been six years since the Act regarding the ban was passed in the state and it must be enforced.”“The PPCB Chief Engineer today, in the presence of plastic manufacturers, washed his hands of all responsibility in enforcing the ban on manufacturing of plastic carry bags and asked AGAPP to go to the Municipal Commissioner,” she said.Earlier also, the NGO members had staged protests at the MC office but nothing was done by the civic body to ensure implementation of the ban. The members demanded that the PPCB must close plastic bag manufacturing units in Ludhiana which were the source of illegal plastic carry bags and single-use plastics, choking the Buddha Nullah and the Sidhwan Canal and also causing unmanageable heaps of plastic garbage across the city and at Kakka village where a landfill is located.Meanwhile, PPCB officials offered to go and check the units if the NGO would provide names and addresses of the units violating the law, they said. Gunwant Singh of AGAPP said they had written to the Chief Minister three times since December 2020 to enforce the ban but to no avail. Jagdish Nanda, a poet and activist, Mohinder Singh Sekhon of the Punjabi Pasar Bhaichara, Jaskirat Singh of the PAC for Sutlej and Mattewara, were also took part in the protest.                                     #Environment                                     #Pollution                                     #PPCB||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ngo-activists-protest-against-ppcb-for-not-enforcing-ban-on-polythene-bags-365128

However, state agencies have already pulled up their socks for checking narco-politics in the state.Senior officials of the NCB and the DRI held a closed-door meeting recently with Ludhiana Commissioner of Police (CP) Gurpreet Singh Bhullar to devise a strategy to tackle the drug and money menace during the Assembly elections. The meeting was also attended by officers of the Special Task Force (STF) and the Excise Department.It is learnt that first time, central agencies such as the DRI and the NCB have been joined hands with the police for the Assembly elections. In the past Assembly polls, the state agencies under the supervision of the Election Commission used to play the main role to check narco-politics.The DRI is the premier intelligence and enforcement agency of the Central Government on anti-smuggling matters while the NCB is the agency tasked with combating drug trafficking and the use of illegal substances under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.Sources said this time, the commission have issued strict instructions to deputy commissioners, police commissioners, SSPs and all enforcement agencies of the state and the Centre to step up vigil to ensure that inter-state and cross border movement of drugs, liquor and cash was checked effectively.The sources said state and central agencies in the meeting committed to ensure information sharing and they would coordinate to take immediate action to recover cash, drugs or liquor during the elections.
