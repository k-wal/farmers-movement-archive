Supporters of most candidates had started distributing ‘ladoos’ after weighing against them.An average-built candidate normally weighs around Rs17,000 to Rs20,000 in Rs 1 coins. It is more of a tradition, which has once again added charm to election time euphoria. Weighing candidate against sweets adds more to enthusiasm as all present feel involved when eatables are distributed among them. Aman Afridi, CouncillorAt times it becomes funny watching a thin candidate losing to heavier ones in terms of money collected or materials distributed at such occasions.The president, Municipal Council, Raikot, Sudarshan Joshi, also election campaign convener of the National Party candidate said, “Residents of various localities of the segment are showing inclination to extend monetary support to their candidate by contributing coins equal to his/her weight.”“To avoid unnecessary hassle of supporters in making arrangements, we have prepared a bag of coins equal to candidate’s weight, which is taken to his/her locality for the formal activity,” said Joshi.AAP candidate from Amargarh constituency Jaswant Singh Gajjanmajra said in-charges of his campaign at some localities were enthusiastic about organising programmes in which his supporters wanted to weigh him against coins or ‘laddoos’.“However, we have decided to stagger such activities for the time being as it will be difficult to get Covid guidelines implemented in letter and spirit in case of sizable gatherings,” said Gajjanmajra.A Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) supporter and councillor, Aman Afridi said, “An average-built candidate normally weighs around Rs17000 to Rs20000 in Rs 1 coins. It is more of a tradition, which has once again added charm to election time euphoria.”“Weighing candidate against sweets adds more to enthusiasm as all presents feel involved when eatables are distributed anong them,” Afridi added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/weighing-contestants-against-coins-catches-the-fancy-of-voters-362801

Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, 68, who remained Cabinet Minister from 2012 to 2017 and Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) from Ludhiana (2004-09) had won twice consecutively from this rural Assembly seat.This constituency, which was part of Koom Kalan and Ludhiana (Rural) till 2007, before being carved out as an independent seat following the delimitation in 2009, had witnessed a triangular contest in 2017.This time, it will be a multi-cornered contest with the entry of two farmers’ outfits — Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM), comprising 19 farm unions, including the one led by Balbir Singh Rajewal, and Sanyukt Sangharsh Party (SSP) formed by a Haryana farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni, and a new-found alliance between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, and the former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress (PLC), during the high-stakes February 20 Assembly elections, which will be held in the backdrop of the recently suspended year-long stir against the three controversial farm laws.While the SAD, which has Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) as its new alliance partner, has taken a lead by re-nominating Dhillon, the principal Opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced a new face Hardeep Singh Mundian as its candidate from Sahnewal. The Congress is yet to declare its nominee while the two farmers’ outfits, who have also reached an alliance, and the BJP-PLC-SAD(S) alliance have also not yet come out with their choices from here.Dhillon, who had also served as Youth Akali Dal president, besides heading several government-run corporation like Punjab Agro, Housefed, and Milkfed, was the lone SAD MLA to be elected in Ludhiana district in 2017. His party was able to add Dakha in the 2019 by-poll, necessitated by the resignation of then AAP MLA Harvinder Singh Phoolka.Speaking with The Tribune, Dhillon said he was confident of his re-election on the basis of his work. “There is no contest this time and the people of my constituency are well aware of my 10-year service,” he asserted.Mundian, who has switched over to the AAP few months ago after his stints in the Congress, the Lok Insaaf Party (LIP), and also contested as an independent candidate in the past, said he was getting massive response from the people and was hopeful of his victory with a big margin.On the Congress front, Punjabi singer-turned-politician Satwinder Kaur Bitti, 51, who was runner-up in the 2017 Assembly polls, was confident of her re-nomination while Raja Gill (son of former Congress minister Karam Singh Gill), Ravneet Gill (son of Udhey Raj Singh Gill, who had switched over from SAD to Congress eight years ago), Vikram Singh Bajwa (son-in-law of Congress stalwart Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, who had lost from here in 2012), Lucky Sandhu (Ludhiana (Rural) Youth Congress president), and Yograj Singh (actor and former cricketer) were also among the main contenders for the ruling party’s ticket from Sahnewal this time.In 2017, Dhillon got re-elected by defeating Bitti by a margin of 4,551 votes. He had polled 63,184, constituting 38.07 per cent of the total polled votes, while Bitti had got 58,633 votes, accounting for 35.33 per cent vote share. The AAP’s Harjot Singh Bains had finished third with 39,570 votes, constituting 23.84 per cent vote share. However, all other eight candidates, including that of the BSP, had lost their security deposits, while 1,510 voters, comprising 0.91 per cent of the total votes polled, had opted for “none of the above” (NOTA).In 2012, Dhillon had won the seat by trouncing Vikram Singh Bajwa by a margin of 21,216 votes. He had polled 71,583 votes, constituting 53.44 per cent vote share, against 50,367 votes, accounting for 37.6 per cent of the total polled votes secured by Bajwa. Then also, all other 11 nominees, including BSP’s Labh Singh, had lost their security deposits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/multi-cornered-fight-in-sahnewal-as-new-entrants-in-fray-this-time-362796

Reason is several of their fellow beings have tested positive for Covid. Now, when elections are round the corner there are maximum chances of contracting infection as teachers will have to share rooms and conduct meetings.DCSpeakEvery second person is unwell these days, but duties are to be performed. There will be no blanket exemption. Covid positive staff should rest for seven days and report back for duty. Varinder Sharma, Deputy Commissioner, LudhianaAt the same time, the administration maintains that there will be no blanket exemption. “Such positive persons should rest and report back on duty,” says the administration.One of the principals of a government school at a village near Ludhiana on condition of anonymity said, “Trainings can be conducted any time. We are getting information on our WhatsApp groups about teachers, who tested positive for Covid.”“Yesterday, in the entire district, names of over 35 teachers were exchanged, who got infected with virus. Their names are included in election duties. In such case, we will also be exposed to the virus. The Education Department has not given any clear directions about Covid positive staff,” he added.Apart from Covid, teachers feel that during the election phase, studies of students in government schools would be affected. “We are already conducting online classes. Many poor and needy students hardly get chance to attend classes due to their background and lack of facilities. Teachers and BLOs are deployed on election and Covid duties to prepare data,” said Parveen Kumar from the Government School Teachers’ Union.“In such conditions, how can teachers focus on studies of their students.

Recently, we have also deputed a team to visit these pensioners at their homes, seeking reasons for non-submission of the DLCs and facilitating them in submission of the same. So far, around 11 such pensioners have been facilitated on their doorsteps while in most of the cases, their neighbours intimated that pensioners were residing abroad.The DLC or ‘Jeevan Praman Patra’, as it is popularly known, is required to be furnished by the pensioners to their respective pension disbursing authorities (PDAs) such as the bank or the post office, once every year, in case they are unable to present themselves personally before the PDAs.Over 27,000 subscribers enrolled with the EPFO regional office here will be benefitted under the drive, Regional Provident Fund Commissioner (RPFC) -I Dheeraj Gupta told The Tribune, here, on Wednesday. He said besides holding special camps on the premises of the establishments, which had requested for the same, to facilitate their employees on their doorsteps, officials of the EPFO were also visiting the aged, frail and ailing pensioners, who were unable to visit the EPFO office due to their old age or surge in Covid cases.Sharing a few such cases wherein the aged and frail subscribers were issued DLCs at their homes, Gupta said one such pensioner, Rajinder Kaur Sekhon, had contacted the EPFO office and intimated that her DLC was due for pension. She expressed her inability to visit the office due to her ill-health and the pandemic situation. “On her request, an official went to her residence and uploaded her life certificate through a biometric machine,” he said.In another such case, a pensioner from Etawah in Uttar Pradesh, Kripeshwari Shukla (87), had undergone a surgery a few days ago and was unable to walk. She was staying in Ludhiana with her daughter. Her daughter contacted the EPFO office and requested to upload her DLC documents from home as her pension was stopped due to the non-submission of the documents. She was getting pension from UP but on her request, the EPFO official visited her place, though the member was not an EPF pensioner. The EPFO official uploaded her DLC on her doorstep.Another pensioner Bharat Jha, who was getting pension from Muzaffarpur in Bihar, and his pension was stopped due to the non-submission of the DLC, visited the EPFI local office for help without knowing the fact that the DLC can be processed at any EPFO office across the country. His DLC was also captured and uploaded at the Ludhiana office, following which his pension was restored from Muzaffarpur.In another case, the EPFO office went an extra mile to help a subscriber, Sandeep Riat, owner of Akal Spring, got her provident fund within a couple of days in her bank account.“To avoid frauds and in view of advisories issued from higher offices, we have started the practice of calling members for cross verification on the receipt of their applications for partial withdrawal when the amounts are high. Similar cross verification was done in Riat’s case and the amount was credited to her bank account within three days,” the RPFC-I said.The EPFO office also held a camp at Oswal Woollen Mills Limited here and issued DLCs to employees at their workplace.Figures at a glance||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/epfo-reaches-out-to-pensioners-on-doorstep-to-issue-dlcs-362788

In the hour-long meeting, the activists said their earlier meetings with the PPCB officials in Jalandhar and headquarters at Patiala had borne no fruit.“Despite ban, hundreds of plastic and polythene units continue to manufacture plastic and polythene bags while shopkeepers and business establishments are also dispensing these bags freely without any fear of law or penal action by the MC,” said Dr Navneet Bhullar, an AGAPP activist.Maintaining that enforcement of ban on single-use plastic was not among priorities of the PPCB and the MC, the protesters said the single-use plastic was being used with impunity, manufacture of these banned items continued unabated while the regulatory bodies, the PPCB and MC, were closing their eyes and refuse to believe in the harsh ground reality.Dr Bhullar said the assurance by the PPCB officials to had meetings with MC officials on a regular basis and keeping other stakeholders (plastic bag manufacturers and sellers) in the loop was a big breakthrough in the ongoing efforts of the AGAPP, including a series of weekly protests.“If the NGO is not satisfied with the outcome, our protests will be intensified and expanded to cover the entire state in coming days,” he said. — OC                                     #Environment                                     #Pollution||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ngo-holds-rally-against-use-of-plastic-362782
