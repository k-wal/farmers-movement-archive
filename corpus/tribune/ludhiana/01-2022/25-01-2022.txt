Good quality and right amount of food is beneficial in every way. Being rich in essential nutrients, fish is considered as a good and complementary food and has a special place over other animal meats (chicken, goat and pig).Fish protein is the second most important food in human nutrition after mother’s milk due to its quick digestion. It will be beneficial to include fish in the daily diet for full physical and mental development of expectant mothers, growing children, adolescents, adults and the elderly. Dr Vaneet Inder Kaur, HoD, College of Fisheries, GADVASUIt was stated by Dr Vaneet Inder Kaur, HoD, College of Fisheries, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU).With winter at its peak, eating fish is healthy in the season. “Fish is rich in high-quality protein and fats, which play a vital role in human health. Fish protein is the second most important food in human nutrition after mother’s milk due to its quick digestion. It has high levels of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs - mainly omega-3 fatty acids such as the EPA and DHA) which keep the body fit. In addition, fish is a rich source of micro-nutrients and essential nutrients such as vitamins and minerals needed to stay healthy,” Dr Vaneet said.In today’s fast-moving and stressful life, fish is also a good choice for patients with high blood pressure and heart disease as the Omega-3 PUFA present in fish meat lowers cholesterol and other fats in the blood and blood vessels. It would be beneficial to include fish in the daily diet for full physical and mental development of expectant mothers, growing children, adolescents, adults and the elderly, Dr Vaneet added.“As compared to chicken, goat and pork meat, fish has less fiber (3-5 per cent) so it takes less time to cook, but at the same time It is digested quickly. We can ensure a healthy and bright future for our future generations by including fish in the diet of pregnant mothers and newborns before birth,” Dr Vaneet said. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/fish-plays-vital-role-in-human-health-says-veterinary-university-expert-364188

He visited other martyr memorials at Sarabha village on Monday. Dr Kang along with other AAP leaders, also paid tributes to the statue of Dr BR Ambedkar at Mullanpur.Woman leader Harpreet Kaur Kang, Ludhiana Lok Sabha halqa in-charge Amandeep Singh Mohi, president Ludhiana Rural Harbhupinder Singh Dharaur, city president Suresh Goyal and Balor Singh Mullanpur were among those others present.Dr Kang is chairman-cum-director general, PCTE Group of Institutes, Ludhiana.

But we could never think of betraying crores of farmers of the state and families of over 700 martyrs of the Kisan Morcha,” said Tillu, claiming that his whole family and friends had been fighting for the withdrawal of three draconian laws since the launch of the agitation.Tillu reiterated that he would always stand for the interests and rights of farmers, besides working sincerely for members of other communities, including labourers, small traders, and the youth.Apparently looking at a multi-cornered contest in Khanna city among Congress candidate and Cabinet Minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli, Jaspreet Kaur Yadoo (SAD), Tarunpreet Singh Sondh (AAP) and Gurpreet Bhatti (BJP), the thrust of campaign is expected to shift to the rural belt after Tillu’s entry and it is expected to dent the enthusiasm of BJP workers.Despite being a traditional ‘SAD’ leader, Tillu has a clout among industrialists and traders. His wife Inderjit Kaur Pandher has also been active in politics and is at present the president of the women’s wing of the SAD (Sanyukt).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/entry-of-sanyukt-samaj-morchas-sukhwant-singh-tillu-changes-equations-in-khanna-364179

25-01-2022||Nitin Jain||Food Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu’s prestige at stake in multi-cornered contest||Ludhiana, January 24Punjab’s Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu’s prestige is at stake in a multi-cornered contest at the Ludhiana West Assembly constituency for the high-stakes Punjab Vidhan Sabha elections slated for February 20.The two-time Congress MLA is not only facing stiff opposition from rival political parties but also two of his close aides have also turned rivals and are in the poll fray against him this time.Ashu, who is among the eight sitting ruling party’s legislators in the district, which sends 14 MLAs, almost 12 per cent of the total 117 members, to the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, had logged the highest victory margin in the district during the 2017 Assembly polls, was pitted against main Opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) nominee Gurpreet Singh Gogi, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP’s) advocate Bikram Singh Sidhu, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD’s) Maheshinder Singh Grewal, and the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM’s) Tarun Jain Bawa.While Gogi, a four-time sitting municipal councillor from ward 76 falling under this segment and former district urban president of the Congress, and Bawa, a leading industrialist, were both close aides of Ashu before quitting the ruling party recently and joining the AAP and the SSM, respectively, SAD’s Grewal was a former MLA from the seat and the BJP has replaced Kamal Chatly, who had finished third in 2017, with a first-timer Sidhu.Ashu (50), who had won two consecutive elections in 2012 and 2017, said the completion of ongoing development projects, including the Buddha Nullah rejuvenation, implementation of yet-to-be-launched planned works, and more thrust on environment, education, health, infrastructure, and public delivery system were his main poll planks this time. He sees no difference to his electoral battle with the entry of new parties and candidates into the fray this time.Gogi (51), who has replaced AAP’s Ahbaab Singh Grewal, the runner-up in the 2017 elections, said he was forced to quit the Congress after serving for over 22 years after the party became “a private limited company”, where he alleged there was “no say” of loyalists like him. Having also served as the PSIEC Chairman during Capt Amarinder Singh’s regime, he was seeking votes on the promise of better education, health, civic amenities, permanent solution to traffic congestion and proper implementation of the Smart City project.Grewal (71), who had represented the seat in 1997 by defeating the then Congress heavyweight, Harnam Das Johar, and had remained the Cabinet Minister in the Parkash Singh Badal Cabinet, said there was a strong resentment among the public against the sitting MLA. Questioning Ashu’s claims of spending Rs 1,500-crore on the development of the segment, Grewal, who had also unsuccessfully contested his second Assembly elections from Payal in 2007 and maiden Lok Sabha polls from Ludhiana in 2019, said health, education, infrastructure, and employment generation were his main poll promises.Sidhu (50), who had joined the BJP in 2020 and was contesting his maiden elections, said better provision of basic civic amenities, health, education, employment and crackdown on drug menace, mining and land mafia were top on his priorities. He said rampant corruption, lack of development, traffic and parking problems were the main issues in the area.Bawa (49), who runs textile mills, promises to make Punjab a power surplus state, if the SSM was voted to power. He was also seeking votes for bringing about a change and ensuring overall welfare and development of all sections of society.In 2017, Ashu had trounced AAP’s Ahbaab Singh Grewal by a margin of 36,521 votes by polling 66,627 votes, accounting for 54.86 per cent vote share, against 30,106 votes, constituting 24.79 per cent of the total polled votes, secured by Ahbaab. BJP’s Chatly had ended third with 22,620 votes, accounting for 18.63 per cent vote share. All other 11 candidates, including BSP’s Kunal, had lost their security deposits, while 1,066 voters, constituting 0.88 per cent vote share, had opted for “none of the above” (NOTA).Ashu had defeated BJP’s Rajinder Bhandari in 2012 while Harish Rai Dhanda and Maheshinder Singh Grewal of the SAD had represented the seat in 2002 and 1997, respectively. Congress nominees Harnam Das Johar (2002, 1992 and 1985) and Joginder Pall Pandey (1980) had won from here thrice and once, respectively, while JNP’s A Vishwanath had emerged victorious from Ludhiana West during this seat’s maiden election held in 1977.This time, the constituency has registered an increase of a mere 1.58 per cent increase in the voter count, which has gone up from 1,76,839 in 2017 to 1,79,635, including 92,925 male, 86,700 female and 10 third gender.                                     #BharatBhushanAshu||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/food-minister-bharat-bhushan-ashus-prestige-at-stake-in-multi-cornered-contest-364177

No concrete action has been taken against those responsible for the negligence.The road projects worth crores of rupees had started in different parts of the city amid the winter season just before the Assembly elections. The recent rainfall exposed the poor work as potholes have appeared on many of the recently recarpeted roads.Residents complained after recently recarpeted DMC Road (that links Hambran Road and Ferozepur Road), Haibowal Road, Jassian Road, Pakhowal Road, Mintghumri Chowk Road, GTB Hospital Road and others started peeling off.Also, the Malhar Road Shopkeepers Association raised questions over the recarpeting work on Malhar Road where the Smart Street project under the Smart City Mission is underway as the road is getting damaged too after rainfall. The repair work of potholes on different roads that the MC had conducted has also washed away in rain.Leader of Opposition in the MC House Jaspal Singh Giaspura of the Shiromani Akali Dal said he had raised the demand before the MC House to appoint a nodal officer to keep a check on the construction or recarpeting of roads but nothing was done. “The recently recarpeted roads have badly damaged within a short period in the city. No steps were taken to collect the samples of these roads. Even without inspection of the roads, payments were released to the contractors. A probe should be conducted in this regard,” he said.Punjab AAP spokesperson Ahbaab Singh Grewal has raised questions over the role of the authorities concerned for ignoring bad quality road works. “It is a sheer wastage of public money by constructing such poor-quality roads that get damaged within a short period. It seems to be a scam. If the AAP is voted to power, we will get an inquiry done and action would be taken against the guilty,” he said.When contacted, Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said he has ordered the MC officials not to release payments to the contractors.“It seems there was some fault in the bitumen material that was used for recarpeting. We are looking into the matter. The contractors would be asked to recarpet all the damaged roads again,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/recently-recarpeted-roads-start-peeling-opposition-seeks-probe-364166
