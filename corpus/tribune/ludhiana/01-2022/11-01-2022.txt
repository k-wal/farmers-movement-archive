When the environment temperature is below lower critical limit dogs cannot maintain their body temperature and suffer from hypothermia,” Dr Randhawa added.“Puppies, geriatric and sick dogs have a lower capacity to maintain their body temperature. They need higher temperatures for their thermal comfort and overall well-being. Ventilation should be good enough to minimise odours, ammonia level and cold drafts, humidity between 30 to 70 per cent,” said Dr Randhawa.“Make sure that your dog has been placed in a warm spot in your house with well carpeted floors. Do not keep your pets too close to heat sources to avoid burns. Put all heaters and lamps out of their reach. Better to use covered heat sources in rooms to keep your pets safe,” Dr Randhawa added.“Dogs can dehydrate just as quickly in the winter as summer. So provide plenty of fresh luke warm water. Just like us, dog’s paws can have cuts and cracks in winter months so keep them clean and dry. Application of petroleum jelly can avoid further cracking,” said Dr Randhawa.

In Ludhiana alone, more than 500 cases have been reported in the last 24 hours. Refusing to learn from the alarming situation and taking the virus ‘too mild and light’, students continue to hold farewell parties on their own.In the last 10 days, four jam packed farewell parties were organised in the city at different venues by students of leading private schools. Besides these parties, get-togethers on the New Year eve are main reason behind most students contracting virus.One of the parent, Richa Aggarwal (name changed) said that her 17 years son did not listen to her and went to party where over 80 students had gathered. They had drinks and ‘hukkah’ and bumped into each other as the venue was small.“From this party, over 14 children contracted Covid. Schools have nothing to do with these farewell parties. Students themselves collect funds for parties. And the peer pressure is so much that they cannot say no to such parties,” rued a worried mother.A teacher of a leading school in Sarabha Nagar said mothers of many students were writing in groups that since their wards had fever, cold and cough, they would not be able to attend online classes.“Vaccination of students has just begun. Many students are catching Covid infection in this third wave,” a teacher said.Dr GS Grewal, a physician at SAS Grewal Hospital, said, “The virus is highly contagious, but it is mild as compared to previous waves. Still, necessary precautions and medications are required for its treatment.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/positivity-rate-rising-among-students-as-many-throw-norms-to-the-winds-360235

He said formal inauguration for pedestrians and two-wheelers was done before the implementation of the model code in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/rly-overbridge-inaugurated-in-a-hurry-ahead-of-elections-360233
