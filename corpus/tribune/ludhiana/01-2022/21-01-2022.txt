These first-time voters are too enthusiastic. Many of them will decide on their own about electing their representatives to the state Assembly. There are others who feel that parents will guide them and accordingly, they will cast their franchise.Talking to The Tribune, Arman said as he was casting his franchise first time, he would take advice from his parents.“They will not put any pressure on me but still I would like to know about political parties and candidates and what they have done for us or what they can do in the future. Accordingly, I will use my right”, he said.While Ghazal, a student of Aurobindo College, here, said drugs were the main cause of worry of parents these days. “How can children have access to drugs if they are not supplied by agents or peddlers. The government has to take steps in this regard. Secondly, a lot of youngsters prefer to go abroad as there is a bleak future here, as per them. I would like to vote for party which will work for the interests of youngsters as the latter are the future of the nation,” she said.Vanshika and Yuvraj Pratham said it would be a unique experience for them. Though they were not too aware about active politics and the elections were scheduled to be held next month, they had started taking interest in political parties and candidates and their manifestoes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/first-time-voters-excited-to-exercise-their-franchise-363152

Such parties should be prevented from contesting the elections, demanded the party.While talking to The Tribune after convening meetings of local party leaders, state CPM chief Sukhwinder Singh Sekhon said he had drawn attention of the CEC towards the undemocratic precedence of declaring the names of government heads before the polling and demanded strict action against parties, including AAP and SAD, which had already declared their chief ministerial candidates.“As the Constitution does not allow the announcement of a government head before the elections, we will fight for action against all those who are taking such steps,” he said.He said the CPM would contest elections on around 25 seats of the state on its own and would not make alliance with any party as none of the parties was contesting the elections on issues of people.“It has proved that this is an ‘issueless’ poll as none of the national or regional parties has talked about rights of people so far,” said Sekhon, citing free education for all, free quality healthcare, employment and minimum unemployment allowance of Rs 6,000 and equal amount of old-age pension as real issues.Accusing traditional parties of ‘auctioning’ ticket, he alleged that some of the candidates had to shell out up to Rs 6 crore to get ticket of the party of their choice. The CPM also took notice of the election expenditure cap of Rs 40 lakh as it was a huge amount for a genuine citizen aspiring to contest the elections.On the projection of Bhagwant Mann as the chief ministerial candidate of AAP, Sekhon said the party had handed over the command of its drowning boat in the hands of a person who could not be entrusted a responsible task.Daring AAP to clear its stand on the issue of Punjab’s waters, he said it (AAP) was the B-team of the RSS.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/act-against-parties-declaring-cm-candidates-before-polls-cpm-363151

The act was also a violation of provisions made in the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.He said the issue had gained more significance as the directions of the NGT, HC and the CGWB were being flouted by a ‘public servant’ who were supposed to keep check on violations. It has been pointed out that the rainwater harvesting system was also not being laid by the owner which was a mandatory requirement in all plots with a size above 120 sq yards as the said property had a plot area of 250 sq yards.Arora said despite the directions of the high court to fix the responsibility and take action against erring officials, the authorities concerned (MC, LIT and GLADA) have been permitting installation of submersible pump and not laying rainwater harvesting system, an act that comes under the criminal proceedings under Section 217, IPC.The complainant has urged to issue directions to GLADA and other authorities (MC and LIT) to put a stop to installation of illegal submersible pumps and also ensure compliance of laying rainwater harvesting system. The GLADA officials be also directed to take action on construction being done in violation of the building bylaws (if any) at the said under-construction house in the GLADA colony.                                     #GLADA||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/submersible-pump-being-installed-in-glada-colony-in-violation-of-norms-363150

Pro-people works and the all-round development done by our government will ensure my re-election this time. — Sanjeev Talwar, Congress MLAWe are way ahead than our rivals in the ongoing campaign. People want change and are eagerly waiting to vote for the AAP this time. — Daljit Singh Grewal, AAPMy constituency has seen the difference between me and my rivals. Works done by me and my party from 2012 to 2017 will ensure our victory again. — Ranjit Singh Dhillon, SADThe winnersParty positionHowever, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had won the urban seat thrice, along with its new found alliance partners — former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) and Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt), led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, — was yet to announce its choice for Ludhiana East.The newly-formed two farmers’ outfits — Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM), comprising 19 farm unions, including the one led by Balbir Singh Rajewal, and Sanyukt Sangharsh Party (SSP) formed by a Haryana farm leader, Gurnam Singh Charuni, which have reached an alliance as well, have also not yet named their nominee from here.The Congress has reposed faith in its sitting MLA Sanjeev Talwar (50), who had won with the thinnest winning difference of 1,581 votes in the district, which sends a maximum of 14 MLAs, which account for almost 12 per cent of the total 117 members, to the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, in 2017.The AAP and the SAD-BSP alliance have also retained Daljit Singh Grewal, alias Bhola (55), and Ranjit Singh Dhillon (56), respectively.Talwar, who had started his political career as a municipal councillor in 2002 from Ward 39 here, which later became Ward 54, was also elected as a municipal councillor for the next two consecutive terms in 2007 and 2012 from the same ward, falling under the Ludhiana Central constituency. He had polled 43,010 votes, accounting for 33.3 per cent vote share, in his maiden Assembly contest, against 41,429 votes, constituting 32.08 per cent of the total polled votes, secured by Bhola of AAP, and 41,313 votes, 31.99 per cent vote share, polled by SAD’s Dhillon.Bhola, who was the party’s Ludhiana urban president and in-charge of the Ludhiana East constituency, had quit AAP and joined the Congress before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but had later returned to AAP, to get re-nominated again.Dhillon, who is the SAD district unit president, had represented this seat in 2012, but had finished third in 2017.While Talwar was banking on what he claims as the “pro-people” works done by the Congress government, Bhola and Dhillon were riding high on “anti-incumbency” and what they alleged as “unmet promises” of the ruling party.In 2017, except the three main contenders, all other four candidates, including BSP’s Gurpreet Singh, had lost their security deposits, while 1,067 voters, accounting for 0.83 per cent of the total polled votes, had opted for “none of the above” (NOTA) in the elections.Since the inception of the constituency in 1977, the ruling Congress had won for a maximum of five times in 2017, 2002, 1985, 1980 and 1977, followed by the BJP, which represented the seat thrice in 2007, 1997 and 1992, and the SAD had emerged victorious from here once in 2012.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/3-main-parties-retain-candidates-bjp-ssm-yet-to-announce-theirs-363147
