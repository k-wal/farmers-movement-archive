AAP made formal announcement of candidature of Gogi after a meeting here today.Gogi, a former party councillor and having served as president of the District Congress Committee (Urban) for some time, was till recently the Chairman of the Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation – a political office to which he was appointed by the then CM Capt Amarinder Singh. He had quit the Congress and had joined AAP a couple of days ago in Chandigarh in the presence of state party convener Bhagwant Mann.After his candidature was announced, Gogi launched a scathing attack on Ashu, saying he would be fighting a battle of truth against “tyranny and high-handedness”.“I am fighting a war against injustice. During the past 33 years, I had made several sacrifices for the party which unfortunately was undeserving. I am sure that voters of Ludhiana West will settle their scores with Ashu through votes who had been feeding lies and making false promises to them all along,” he said while talking to mediapersons.Gogi said he would expose scams and misdeeds of the minister with documentary evidence in days to come. Truth must prevail and AAP would continue to strive for safeguarding the rights of people and also to save them from opportunist and selfish leaders.He assured that for the overall development of the segment, he would follow the Delhi governance model of Kejriwal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/aap-fields-former-congress-man-gurpreet-singh-gogi-against-bharat-bhushan-ashu-362149

Social distancing, face masks and sanitisation of hands were missing in almost all events.As candidates of their rival parties already started their campaigns, supporters of probable Congress candidates apprehend that it would be difficult for them to streamline poll campaigns of their candidates whose names are yet to be declared.Gill, Amargarh, Jagraon and Samrala are among the Assembly segments for which the Congress is yet to announce its nominees for contesting the elections. While the sitting legislator at Jagraon, Saravjit Kaur Manuke, is a AAP leader, Kuldeep Singh Vaid, Surjit Singh Dhiman and Amrik Singh Dhillon are sitting legislators of the Congress at Gill, Amargarh and Samrala segments, respectively.Chairman, Market Committee, Kilaraipur, Ranjit Singh Mangat, said a large number of office-bearers and activists of various units of the Congress in the Gill Assembly segment had met him at Dehlon and asked him to take up the issue of declaration of ticket for the segment without any further delay.“Having heard arguments of the activists, including sarpanches, panches, zila parishad members and block samiti members, we have urged Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu to impress upon the high command to announce legislator Kuldeep Vaid as official nominee of the party,” Mangat said.Congress activists at Ahmedgarh, led by Municipal Council Chief Vikas Tandon, also showed anguish over the undue delay in launching sitting legislator Surjit Singh Dhiman as a candidate whereas the Shiromani Akali Dal and the AAP had announced their candidates long time ago. Youth wing general secretary Gurjot Dhindsa, president, Overseas Congress, Davinder Singh Garcha, former legislator Jasvir Singh Khangura, former cricketer and actor Yograj Singh and Narpat Bagrian, are among claimants whose names are circulating in the area. Narpat Bagrian, scion of the Bagrian family led by Mai Roop Kaur, has also been reported to have convened protest meetings with large gatherings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/congress-activists-hold-meetings-not-care-two-hoots-about-covid-norms-362146

I’m on a hat-trick and will register it with a record margin.The sitting two-time Congress MLA Gurkirat Singh Kotli, who was inducted as Industries Minister in the rejigged Punjab Council of Ministers following the replacement of Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh with Charanjit Singh Channi in September last, has been pitted against the new faces — Tarunpreet Singh of the principal Opposition party Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Jasdeep Kaur of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance, this time.TARUNPREET SINGH, AAPPeople are fed up with the traditional parties and want a change. I’m getting an overwhelming response from people.Jasdeep Kaur, wife of controversial Youth Akali Dal (YAD) leader Yadwinder Singh, alias Yadu, who was facing multiple criminal cases, including murder, has replaced party heavyweight Ranjit Singh Talwandi, who had finished third with 31,845 votes and had parted ways to join the Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa-led Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt).JASDEEP KAUR, SAD-BSPWe’re way ahead than all our rivals. My area residents are poised to repose their faith in me this time.However, the two newly-floated outfits of farmers — Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM), comprising 19 farm unions, including the one led by Balbir Singh Rajewal, and Sanyukt Sangharsh Party (SSP), formed by Haryana farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni — besides a new-found alliance between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), SAD (Sanyukt) and former CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) — were yet to announce their candidates for this rural seat.With an increase of over 6 per cent electorates, the Khanna Assembly constituency has registered 1,69,510 voters, including 89,081 male, 80,427 female, and two third gender, for the 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections. It was an increase of 9,758 electors from 1,59,752 electorates registered in this segment in 2017.The previous Assembly poll held in 2017 had scripted a history in Khanna when slain Chief Minister Beant Singh’s grandson Kotli (48) had retained the seat on the Congress ticket by defeating his nearest rival Anil Dutt Phally (64) of the AAP by a margin of 20,591 votes, which was 183 per cent more than his 2017’s victory margin, in a triangular contest, the first at that time. Kotli had polled 55,690 votes, which constituted 44.29 per cent of the total polled votes, while Phally had got 35,099 votes, accounting for 27.92 per cent vote share. SAD’s heavyweight Ranjit Singh Talwandi (65) had managed 31,845 votes, constituting 25.33 per cent vote share, to end third. All other seven nominees in the fray had even lost their security deposits. BSP candidate Shashi Vardhan (64) had polled mere 1,202 votes, accounting for 0.96 per cent vote share. As many as 850 voters had opted for “none of the above” (NOTA), which constituted 0.68 per cent of the total votes polled, and it was more than the votes polled by other six candidates.In 2012, Kotli had trounced Talwandi of the SAD by a margin of 7,278 votes. The winning Congress nominee had polled 45,045 votes, which accounted for 38.36 per cent vote share, while the runners-up SAD candidate had got 37,767 votes, constituting 32.16 per cent of the total polled votes. Gurpreet Singh of the People’s Party of Punjab (PPP) had finished third with 23,370 votes, accounting for 19.9 per cent vote share. At that time also, other seven nominees, including the BSP’s Navjot Singh Mandair, had lost their security deposits.In the past, the SAD’s Bikramjit Singh had defeated Shamsher Singh Dullo of the Congress in 2007, Harbans Kaur of the Congress had trounced Satwinder Kaur Dhaliwal of the SAD in 2002, the SAD’s Bachan Singh had won by defeating Dullo of the Congress in 1997, Dullo of the Congress had defeated Mohinder Pal of the BJP in 1992, SAD’s Sukhdev Singh had won by trouncing Dullo of the Congress in 1985, Dullo had defeated Amar Singh of the CPI in 1980, Bachan Singh of the SAD had won by defeating Dullo of the Congress in 1977, Prithvi Singh Azad of the Congress had trounced Bachan Singh of the SAD in 1972, SAD’s Naurang Singh had won by defeating Dhamma Singh of the Congress in 1969, G Singh of the RPI had won by trouncing B Singh of the Congress in 1967 and Jagir Singh of the Congress had defeated Naurang Singh of the SAD in 1962.The twin winnersGurkirat Singh Kotli (Cong): 2017, 2012Shamsher Singh Dullo (Cong): 1992, 1980Bachan Singh (SAD): 1997, 1977Party positionCongress won 7 timesSAD won 5 timesRPI won once||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/punjab-poll-2022-khanna-in-for-multi-cornered-contest-first-time-in-history-362145
