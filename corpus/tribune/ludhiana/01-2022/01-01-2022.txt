He also demanded a separate inquiry into the illegality committed by diverting funds from the Ludhiana Improvement Trust for purchase of interlocking tiles.Grewal charged the Congress government with extending patronage to those behind the ghastly sacrilege at the Golden Temple. He said the accused had still not been identified. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/sad-seeks-impartial-probe-into-scams-of-minister-ashu-356845

STF Chairman Satguru Uday Singh had highlighted the issue of scattered industries and asked the departments concerned that what steps are being taken to resolve the issue.A member of the STF for Buddha Nullah, Col JS Gill (retd) said: “We were earlier informed that there were around 30-40 scattered dyeing units in the city that were not connected with any common effluent treatment plant. The government should focus on these units as effluent is being discharged into the MC’s sewerage lines as per information. A survey of all scattered units should be conducted. Such dyeing units must be shifted to one area and a CETP should be set up there for these industries so that no effluent be discharged into the MC’s sewerage lines.”Jaskirat Singh of Narao Manch Punjab and Chemical Engineer, said: “Nothing has been done to resolve the issue of scattered dyeing units in the city despite our repeated demands. There are a number of big dyeing industries that have not been even identified as scattered units. We demand that effluent from any dyeing unit should not be released into MC’s sewerage lines.”Sukhwinder Singh, a representative of STF Chairman Satguru Uday Singh, said: “There are a number of scattered dyeing units that have not been linked with the CETPs. The issues related to scattered dyeing units must be resolved at the earliest. Moreover, issues related to electroplating units should be taken seriously too.”Gulshan Rai, Chief Engineer, PPCB, Ludhiana, said at present, there were only 13-14 scattered dyeing units.He said big units had got their individual effluent treatment plants installed. “It is not PPCB’s work to get any industries shifted. As per rules, the PPCB has to make sure that the industries must achieve the standards fixed by the Central Government. We are maintaining the standards.”A 15 MLD CETP has been set up on Bahdaur Ke Road and 40 MLD CETP at Focal Point for dyeing units. Besides, a 50 MLD CETP is being set up on Tajpur Road. The scattered dyeing units have not been connected with these CETPs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/issues-related-to-scattered-dyeing-units-yet-to-be-resolved-by-admn-356843

The pandemic has exposed already existing serious flaws in our healthcare system. The out-of-pocket expenditure is pushing 6.3 crore people in our country to poverty every year.”“India is becoming a hub of several communicable and non-communicable diseases. We need meticulous planning and resources but the whole narrative is being changed by bigots with the overt and covert support of the state and they are out to spread communal venom and split society. It will seriously affect harmony in society and thereby, health. No one is safe during communal violence and this has to be realised by all. We have to talk about real issues such as health, education and uplift of the downtrodden. India should take initiative for a dialogue with its neighbours to put a check on the arms race and declare South Asia a nuclear weapon-free zone. The IDPD will work for these issues in the coming year,” they said.Those who addressed the event include Dr Arun Mitra, Dr NS Bawa, Dr Gagandeep Singh, Dr Param Saini, Dr Monika Dhawan, Dr Suraj Dhillon, Dr Gurveer Singh, Dr Tanya Aulakh, Prof Jagmohan Singh, Chamkaur Singh, Gulzar Goria and Vinod Kumar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/declare-health-a-fundamental-right-doctors-356834

The Congress could not deliver what it promised to the people of Punjab during last elections and in desperation it is resorting to dirty tricks to distract the attention of people from core issues.Gosha and other party leaders urged the Punjab Governor, through the Deputy Commissioner, to order the cancellation of ‘false case’ against Majithia and in this context, the party functionaries maintained that registration of such false cases at the time of elections is a routine affair for Congress governments. The SAD and YAD leaders also vowed to fight against the ‘injustice’ by the ruling party saying that they would expose the conspiracy of the Congress government during poll campaign.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/order-cancellation-of-false-case-against-majithia-yad-to-guv-356830

The determined protesters, however, said they would continue the gherao of the complex till their memorandum, addressed to the Punjab Government, is taken by one of the district officials.With entry gate of complex having been locked and police personnel deployed in large numbers, other visitors to Mini-Secretariat had to suffer and some of them even went to the extent of exchanging heated words over the protest.District secretary, BKU, Sudagar Singh Ghhudani said they had been taking up the issues of compensation to families of farmers who lost their lives during more than a year’s protest, financial assistance to kin of those debt-ridden farmers who had committed suicides and waiver of condition of five acre upper limit of land for payment of compensation against crop losses due to natural calamities.“However, our persistent voices have failed to evoke any response and we are left with no other choice than to intensify our protest,” said the BKU leader.Ghudani and other speakers charged the Congress government in Punjab with paying just a lip service to the cause of farmers but practically doing nothing to improve their lot in terms of providing cheap inputs, including diesel, seeds, farm chemicals and fertilisers, remission of old debts, building pressure upon the Centre to put a legal mechanism in place for MSP of all crops and on the top of it all promotion of crop diversification to rid the farmers of traditional crop rotation which is no longer financially viable.Among others, the rally was addressed by district president of the Bharti Kisan Union-Ekta Ugrahan Charan Singh Nurpura, Kuldeep Singh Grewal, Lakhvir Singh Nanowal, Balwant Singh Ghudani, Paramjit Singh Ghaloti, Hakam Singh Jargari, Jagmeet Singh Kalar, Rajinder Singh Sihar, Gurpreet Singh Noorpura, Yuvraj Singh Ghudani, Tirath Singh, Sukhpreet Singh Majri, Harjit Kaur, Malkit Singh and Iqbal Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/protesting-farmers-lay-siege-to-mini-secretariat-356826

The work has already begun to construct the interim terminal building at the Air Force Station in Halwara, which is one of the oldest frontline airbases of the Indian Air Force (IAF), close to Ludhiana, at the cost of Rs 4,691.12 lakh and will be completed within six months. Similarly, the construction of internal roads, estate public health services and campus lighting at the upcoming airport terminal has also picked up pace. Though it missed the January 2022 deadline earlier set by the state government, the new airport will take off in June.24x7 water supplyThe work on the much-awaited 24x7 canal-based surface drinking water supply project worth Rs 3,394.45 crore in Ludhiana will also get underway in 2022. While funds have already been allocated and land for the World Bank-funded project has already been acquired, the work will begin once the RFP for the project gets the World Bank nod.Infrastructure developmentThe work on big-ticket infrastructure development projects, being implemented at the cost of Rs 11,494 crore, were put on fast track in Ludhiana district in 2021.Of the total 31 major development works, 23 have already been completed or are in the advanced stage of completion, while the rest eight projects are targeted to see the light of the day in the New Year.The 2022 will witness cleaning of the highly polluted Buddha Nullah, a seasonal tributary of the Sutlej, which runs almost parallel to the Sutlej through most of Ludhiana district, including 14-km in Ludhiana city, before merging with the Sutlej, under an ambitious Rs 840-crore rejuvenation project underway.The other major projects scheduled to be completed this year included a bus stand at Raikot at Rs 3.87 crore, development of hi-tech cycle valley at Dhanansu village, near here, at Rs 365 crore, works under MGNREGS for the current fiscal at Rs 120.1 crore, carcass utilisation plant on design, build, operate, maintain, and transfer basis at Rs 7.98 crore, integrated ROB/RUB on Pakhowal Road on the Ferozepur railway line road crossing at Rs 123 crore, annual maintenance contract of Ludhiana safe city project at Rs 35.96 crore and works under the Punjab Nirman Programme at Rs 90 crore.Municipal CorporationThe residents want the Municipal Corporation to improve the solid waste management in the city in 2022. As the MC elections are due in early 2023, the councillors will have to either perform or face residents’ ire. The MC’s current House will complete its four years in March 2022.Waste management: A huge amount of waste has accumulated at the MC’s main garbage dump near Kakka village due to the non-processing of the waste. The residents want the civic body to ensure the processing of waste and legacy waste as per the rules. The MC needs to eliminate a number of roadside garbage dumps. The project of static compactors also needs to be completed in 2022. The MC needs to ensure management of the construction and demolition waste by setting up a required plant.Smart City projects: The residents want the authorities concerned to ensure the completion of ongoing works under the Smart City project at the earliest.Choked and overflowing sewers: The overflowing sewers at Dhandari Khurd, New Durga Colony, Shanti Nagar, Makkar Colony and several other areas in outer areas seek resolution this year.Stray animals: Despite the collection of huge cow cess, the civic body has failed to shift stray cattle from city roads to shelters. Bullfighting incidents are common on the city roads. Besides shifting stray cattle from city roads in a planned manner, the MC also needs to resolve stray dog menace.Improve services and curb corruption: The residents want the MC to bring transparency in its working and take required steps to curb corruption in the MC offices. The MC also needs to improve services to issue birth and death certificates and TS1 certificates in a time-bound manner. Besides, the civic body must act against overcharging at parking lots besides curbing the illegal constructions.HealthIndustryThe industrialists hope to get a congenial environment for trade and industry in 2022. They look ahead for the fulfilment of promise to provide power at Rs 5 per unit, better infrastructure at focal points and industrial areas, end to corruption by strengthening single windows and self-certification policy, tax and financial relief for sufferings during the Covid times, technology upgrade centre and expediting work on exhibition centre and freight corridor.DorahaSahnewal(Inputs by Shivani Bhakoo, Manav Mander, Harshraj Singh & Lovleen Bains)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/intl-airport-24x7-water-supply-infra-boost-for-dist-in-2022-356823
