While Sharanjit Singh Dhillon is the lone candidate for the SAD, this is not the case with the Congress. It is believed that multiple ticket aspirants may fail to provide a ‘coherent’ and ‘unified stance’ to the party in the elections.Satwinder Kaur Bitti, a singer-turned-politician, is being considered as the potential candidate for the Congress. She was the trailing candidate in the 2017 elections. She had lost with a margin of 4,551 votes from SAD candidate Sharanjit Singh Dhillon. Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Navjot Singh Sidhu promised full support to Bitti while speaking at a rally in Sahnewal last week. But she does not seems to enjoy the support of local party leaders as, it is learnt, that most of them kept themselves away from the rally.Bikramjit Singh Bajwa, the son-in-law of former CLP leader Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, too lays his claim on the party ticket. He was a candidate in the 2012 elections but could not win the support of local party leaders, who termed him as an outsider. “I am consistently working in the constituency for the past 12 years and am no longer an outsider,” claimed Bajwa.Another contender Raja Gill is laying claim on the party ticket as he has been camping in the area to garner public support and spread the message among people that he was not an outsider any more. He is the son of Karam Singh Gill, a close associate of former Chief Minister Beant Singh.The local Congress leaders, however, have shown their resentment for imposing “outsiders” upon them and met Chief Minister Channi over the matter. They were of the view that only a local candidate who has deep-rooted affinities could give a tough defeat to the equally strong and local candidate of the SAD.Municipal Corporation councillor Pal Singh Grewal, who is said to be close to Deputy Chief Minister Sukjinder Randhawa, also presents himself as a local candidate. Grewal expressed that given a chance, he would definitely win. Grewal is the councillor for the fifth time. He has been the chairman of the Market Committee, Ludhiana, and Chairman, Land Mortgage Bank.Another local leader and Council president of Sahnewal Sukhjit Singh Hara is a ticket aspirant as he claims to enjoy a political standing having served as the president of the Sahnewal Nagar Council. He express his claim on the party ticket for being in the Congress for long.Ravneet Gill, who is believed to be a contender for the party ticket, is the grandson of a staunch Akali Dhan Raj Singh Gill and son of Udhe Raj Singh Gill, who shifted his affinities from the SAD to the Congress, eight years ago. Ravneet is at present a zila parishad member. Lucky Sandhu, the Youth Congress president of Ludhiana (rural) is another ticket aspirant. Lucky has emerged into the picture as he carries out party activities zealously.“Last time, due to the pressure of NRIs, the ticket was given to Bitti. This time, we wish that a local leader with a strong backing and clear image should get the party ticket. If the party high command gives the ticket to Bitti, we would be in no position to support her,’ the local leaders said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/sahnewal-multiple-aspirants-for-cong-ticket-may-fail-to-present-a-unified-stance-358996

Activists have been told to be ready for massive dharnas, along with members of their families, and come equipped with quilts, blankets and raincoats to protect themselves from adverse weather conditions during the protest.President of the state body of the Theka Mulazim Sangharsh Morcha Varinder Singh Momi said a delegation of the morcha had again submitted a memorandum to remind the Chief Minister about his promises made with the union on Monday after which a two-day dharna at Bhattian village on the Ludhiana-Khanna stretch of the NH-1, was lifted temporarily.The protesters were assured that contractual employees of Water Supply and Sewerage, PSPCL, Verka Milk Plant, MNREGA, Health and Family Welfare, Hydel Projects, PWD (electricity wing) and Grid departments and those working in boards and corporations and under Union Government schemes will be regularised after taking a decision in the meeting of the activists with the Chief Minister.“Earlier, While asking us to lift dharna in public interest on Monday, the Chief Minister Office had assured us that a notification regarding all categories of contractual employees will be made by evening on Friday. Now, as the day of meeting has changed, we will block the highway as per our schedule,” said Varinder, adding that the government had also assured to accept their other related demands. Meanwhile, many residents and commuters have started rescheduling their journey plans on Saturday with an intention to avoid inconvenience in view of the ultimatum of the protesters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/will-block-national-highway-tomorrow-say-employees-358995

These gaps will be exploited by polluters to push solid waste as well as road sweeping dirt and garbage into the nullah. The MC needs to take measures to plug the gaps to check the solid waste pollution in the water body.”He said: “Since the bottom is secure, a call should be given to cover the top portion with iron or nylon- coated garden green fencing mesh to stop ingress of the over-the-fence thrown garbage, especially during night.”“As the fence has established boundaries after the removal of encroachments, there is availability of a 14-km-long and 20-meter-wide corridor space for establishing a 11 MW solar plant on the surface of the Buddha Dariya,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/fill-gap-below-fence-along-buddha-nullah-says-task-force-member-358987

The tests are done free of cost at the hospital. As lab technicians are on strike, patients are left with no other option but to get their tests done at private laboratories by paying exorbitant charges.Neeraj, who came to the hospital today, said a doctor advised him to get his blood tests done but when he reached the laboratory, nobody was present there.“I was left with no option but to get my tests done from a private laboratory. Tests at Civil Hospitals are done free of cost. At private labs, I had to spend Rs 850 to get my tests done,” he said.Anuja, a pregnant woman, said she came to meet the doctor but came to know that the hospital was not taking cesarean cases due to the strike of staff nurses.“Afterwards, I went to the laboratory to get my haemoglobin levels checked. Nobody was present there and I was told that employees are on strike. How is the hospital managing its affairs in the absence of many employees, who are observing strike. Now, at the last moment, I have been told to go to another government hospital,” she said.The worst affected are indoor patients as they also have to take the services of the private labs.“My mother was admitted to the hospital and was asked by the doctor concerned to get a few tests conducted. When I went to the lab, I was told that the staff are on strike. The hospital should have made some arrangements in this scenario,” said Satinder Singh.Jagdish Rama, general secretary of the Medical Lab Technicians’ Association, said they did not have any other option. Hence, they have to observe strike as the government was not listening to their genuine demands.Main demands of the lab technicians include pay parity, allowances and change in their designation from medical lab technician to medical lab officer.Paying exorbitant charges for testsTests are conducted free of cost at the Civil Hospital. As lab technicians are on strike, patients are left with no other option but to get their tests done at private laboratories by paying exorbitant charges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/patients-at-receiving-end-as-lab-technicians-observe-strike-in-ludhiana-358985

While 36 are admitted to various private hospitals, four are recuperating at government health facilities.The seriousness of the virus spread could be gauged from the fact that only single Covid patient was hospitalised in the district on December 26, 27 and 28, while the number went up to two on December 29, 30, 31 and January 1, further rising to three on January 2, seven on January 3, nine on January 4, 22 on January 5 and shooting up to 40 on January 6, which is a whopping 40-times spike in mere 11 days.Similarly, the daily fresh cases also continue to rise rapidly with 330 persons — 292 locals and 38 outsiders — testing positive for Covid in the district on Thursday.
