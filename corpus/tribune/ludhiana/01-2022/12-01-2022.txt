Senior leaders of the BJP, with ‘lists’ in their hands, have alleged that instead of giving funds to the real poor beneficiaries, the Congress leaders, particularly in the Ludhiana (North) constituency, distributed funds to Congress workers, their supporters and near and dear ones, while the real needy were left to fend for themselves.The leaders have demanded a judicial probe into the scam and an FIR against all the guilty — those who prepared the lists and provided the funds and those who took the money, which was meant for the poor.Providing details of the scam, senior BJP leader Anil Sarin and district president Pushpinder Singal said they had got the list of around 2,000 persons, who were the “fake” beneficiaries and not the poor and needy. As per the scheme, funds between Rs 10,000 and Rs 35,000 are given to residents for renovation of their houses which are in dilapidated conditions. “But instead of providing funds to deserving beneficiaries, the Congress leaders treated it as party fund and distributed among their workers, relatives, near and dear ones. Under the garb of the scheme, Congress leaders made their supporters happy to strengthen their vote bank. This is a big disservice to the society as deserving are left to fend for themselves,” said Sarin, while targeting senior Congress leaders and councillors.The BJP leaders showed a few names of beneficiaries, who did not even exist in Ludhiana jurisdiction and address of Phillaur was written but cheques were issued. There were a few cases where even two-three members of one family were issued cheques, which was against the scheme. The entire scam was of around Rs 15 crore, which is public money and which should go to the deserving persons, they said.“We want these fake beneficiaries to return the public money and cases be registered against all guilty,” said Sarin and Singal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/punjab-nirman-kosh-scheme-a-big-scam-by-cong-bjp-360562
