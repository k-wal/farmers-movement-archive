The examination was earlier scheduled to be held in July but was postponed and the fresh date announced was August 20. Students of BA semester II were supposed to attempt the examination by opening the given site and joining the provided link between 4 pm to 5.30 pm. A number of students from different colleges failed to join the link altogether or submit their paper.As nodal officers of different colleges brought these multiple problems to the notice of the university officials, they allowed the students to attempt another paper, which was conducted for BCom semester II, IV and VI students from 10 am to 11.30 am today. However, the problems multiplied all the more as more classes were added in the session.In the evening session, BBA and BCA classes were supposed to attempt the paper. Many students who had earlier failed to submit the paper were asked to join and attempt the exam. But even in the third chance, the problems refused to subside.“We had to attempt 100 questions. I attempted the 40 questions given on the first page but failed to proceed further as the link was taking me to the first page again and again. Hence, I failed to submit the paper. I faced the same problem this morning,” a candidate shared.“I was not able to submit the paper as again and again I was being asked if I am a robot and the whole process began again,” said another.“I attempted the questions but in the received email, it shows that some questions were left unattempted,” was the view of another student.A nodal officer of a local college said conducting the environment exam seemed to have become a Herculean task for the university. “Due to unusual traffic, the Google form closed automatically. Students faced multiple problems on account of this. Last year too, the university had to cancel the exam as servers failed to respond and panic prevailed among the examinees and supervisors. But it had acted wise by giving the option of online or offline submission on a fresh date announced. Majority of the students had then submitted a hard copy to their respective institutions but this time, the sole option of online submission has again created a furore. Students, teachers and the nodal officers were literally fed up with the process of joining, attempting and submitting.”The university officials, however, responded to the queries that the candidates were facing. “No section jumping problem, robot CAPTCHA problem etc would have been experienced had the students kept their cool and submitted just once,” a university official said.For the convenience of the candidates, the link was active till 5.15 pm today and students were asked to submit their responses even till 8 pm, the official added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/glitches-mar-undergradute-environment-exam-300403

Actually the Rs 650-crore project (to rejuvenate the nullah) has changed nothing on ground, other than three CETPs getting commissioned (which are not part of the Rs 650-crore project). Sewage from 14 MC sewer outlets, dairy waste and above all tonnes of floating solid waste still remain in the Buddha Nullah,” he stated.The retired Colonel said, “This waste, which was to go into the Sutlej at a very slow pace otherwise, will be flushed into the river in one go if 200 cusecs of water is released now. The water will take millions of litres of dyeing industry chemicals in one go to the Harike bird sanctuary. It will affect the aquatic life, whatever of it is left in the Sutlej. It will take sewage, carrying millions of bacteria, to many drinking water sources emanating from the Sutlej in Punjab and Rajasthan.”“Before releasing fresh water into the Buddha Nullah, the rejuvenation project should be completed and functioning of all CETPs should be ensured. No dairy or sewage waste should flow into the Sutlej. Water from dyeing and electroplating industry should be tapped and treated, which will happen only when CETPs function properly,” Gill added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/buddha-nullah-task-force-member-writes-to-punjab-cm-300396

22-08-2021||Nitin Jain||Covid positivity rate rises to 0.15% in Ludhiana district||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, August 21The weekly average Covid positivity rate, a key indicator of virus surge, has gone up to 0.15 per cent last week, which was 50 per cent more than 0.1 per cent recorded during the preceding week in Ludhiana, the government has confirmed.The district’s hit rate was still less than the state’s average of 0.2 per cent but was more than nine other districts in the state, the official figures have revealed.Varinder Kumar Sharma, Deputy Commissioner OfficialspeakOur effort is to keep the Covid situation under control and continue with the five-pronged strategy of test, trace, treat, vaccinate and strict enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour to avert the resurgence of the deadly infection, especially ahead of the festival season.However, Ludhiana’s positivity rate was on a par with the state’s average positivity rate of 0.1 per cent between August 3 and 9.The average positivity rate between August 7 and 13, compiled by the Health and Family Welfare Department, a copy of which is available with The Tribune, showed that Fazilka continues to be the worst-hit district with the highest hit rate of 0.58 per cent while Sangrur remained the safest district with the lowest of 0.05 per cent positivity rate.While Bathinda stood second with 0.56 per cent hit rate, Mohali ranked third in the state with 0.43 per cent positivity rate.Among other districts, Barnala registered 0.32 per cent positivity rate, followed by Pathankot 0.31 per cent, Faridkot 0.27 per cent, Amritsar 0.26, Moga 0.23, Kapurthala, Patiala and Tarn Taran 0.18 per cent each, Jalandhar 0.15, Fatehgarh Sahib, Hoshiarpur and Ferozepur 0.13 per cent each, Gurdaspur 0.11, Muktsar 0.09, Ropar and Nawanshahr 0.07 per cent each and Mansa 0.06 per cent.Ludhiana, being the largest district in the state with maximum population of four million, remained the worst-hit during the deadly second Covid wave, but made a remarkable turnaround from being the worst-hit to the safest district in the state.The safe trend has been persisting for the past two months when the district had made a remarkable turnaround by recording the daily positivity rate even below 1 per cent.The development holds significance as Ludhiana had earlier assumed the dubious distinction of being the worst-hit district with the maximum number of daily Covid cases and deaths till May.If it was mayhem in May when the second Covid wave had rapidly slid into a devastating crisis with the health facilities unbearably falling short, oxygen supplies running low and many dying even without seeing a doctor, June had given a sigh of relief with the signs of gradual retreat and impact of deadly virus plateauing and the safe trend continued in July and August when the hit rate further dipped to as low as 0.1 per cent last week.This U-turn was all the more significant as the daily positivity rate has dropped by a whopping 19.42 per cent from the highest-ever ratio of 19.57 per cent in the past three months. The district had touched its peak of virus surge on May 2. The daily hit rate has been plummeting constantly since the last week of May.The data analysed by the Health and Family Welfare Department showed that Ludhiana’s positivity rate even plummeted below the weekly average of 0.1 per cent in August as it was recorded 0.05 per cent on August 1, 0.07 per cent on August 2, lowest-ever 0.02 per cent on August 3, 0.1 per cent on August 4, 0.06 per cent on August 5, 0.16 per cent on August 6, 0.11 per cent on August 7, 0.08 per cent on August 8, 0.02 per cent on August 9, 0.2 per cent on August 10, 0.37 per cent on August 11, 0.09 per cent on August 12, 0.04 per cent on August 13, 0.05 per cent on August 14, 0.02 per cent on August 15, 0.04 per cent each on August 16, 17, 18 and 19, 0.03 per cent on August 20 and rising again to 0.1 per cent on August 21.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/covid-positivity-rate-rises-to-0-15-in-ludhiana-district-300390
