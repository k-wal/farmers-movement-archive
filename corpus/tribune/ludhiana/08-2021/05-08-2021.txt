We have earmarked a fund for sending Rs 25,000 per month to her,” he said. Hoping that Kamalpreet would one day bring glory to India, Ahluwalia said she was among those whose intensive training would be arranged in the USA or any other suitable country.Earlier, the NRIs had recognised Manshi Dalal, a boxer from Haryana, Tejinder Singh Toor, shot putter, and Gurvinder Singh, a sprinter.“We had sent a draft worth $2,575 to Manshi, a boxer of repute who had won medals at national and international boxing meets, after coming to know that she was living in poverty due to the alleged apathy of the government,” Ahluwalia said, maintaining that Kamalpreet Kaur and Tejinder Singh Toor were also sent kits as token of recognition of their outstanding performances.The NRIs have been sponsoring Gurindervir Singh, another sprinter from the region, for the past two years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/nris-to-provide-funds-to-aspiring-sportspersons-293312

They blame us for their positive test results in the past and are not ready to listen about the vaccination,” said the ASHA worker, who wished not to be named.“Women are counselled during their routine antenatal check-ups and they are told about the benefits of the vaccination. Even if they agree to get vaccinated, they return home saying they will get vaccinated after consulting their families but never come back,” said a doctor in-charge at a Primary Health Centre.“Earlier they were hesitant to get tested against the Covid also, but since it is mandatory, we can force them. The vaccination is purely optional, so we cannot do anything,” the doctor added.During the first wave, the scene was quite different and there was no evidence regarding transmission to a baby from a Covid positive mother. However, during the second wave, transmission to babies was seen in the form of intrauterine deaths, and newborns also tested positive, said Dr Sarita, a city-based gynaecologist.Keeping in view the expected third wave, it is highly recommended to all females to get themselves vaccinated against the Covid, she added.Tanisha, an expectant mother who recently got herself vaccinated, said although there was a lot of hesitation earlier, she got herself vaccinated last week after reading a lot about the effects of vaccination on pregnant women.“I just got fever and there was pain in the arm on which I received the shot, rest all went well and I am glad I opted to get vaccinated,” said Tanisha.District Immunisation Officer Dr Puneet Juneja said regular counselling of women was being done and 10 of them received jabs at government centres on the first day of the inoculation drive.“We are not keeping a separate data on the vaccination of pregnant women, so the exact number cannot be called. However, the number is going to increase in the coming days as awareness is being created among masses,” said Dr Juneja.On July 2, the Union Health Ministry had announced that pregnant women were eligible to get the Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/covid-19-vaccinating-pregnant-women-a-challenge-293310

They said the ancestral home of the martyr was declared a historic building by the government and the Archaeological Department was given the responsibility to maintain it.“We are disappointed as the house is being ignored. The plaster is falling off the walls of the house and the roofs are leaking while windows and doors are also crying for attention. The condition of the building is in fact a telling picture of the failure of the governments in maintaining it,” Rupinder said.Manuke said they had demanded that the government start the repair work of the martyr’s home as soon as possible. “We also demand that the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) at Ludhiana should be renamed after Shaheed Kartar Singh Sarabha,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/youth-body-seeks-repair-of-shaheed-kartar-singh-sarabhas-house-293309

It is only through the blue-eyed that our intentions will be conveyed to the PM. We are not going to lift the protest till the anti-farmer farm laws are withdrawn by the Modi government,” said Harnek Singh.A jatha has been sent to Delhi to support the farmers protesting there. On an average, 60-80 farmers sit at the site to register their protest against the Union Government.As per information, the operations of the dry port have been shut since January. Many dialogues were held between the administration and farmers to let the operations at the dry port continue but farmers refused to budge. It is learnt that 500-700 containers got stuck there when the movement of goods train was allowed because farmers had locked the gates and had refused to clear the containers following which the importers had to bear huge losses. It was only after requesting farmers to clear the containers, they had allowed the port to operate for a few days.“In those about 10 days, the stocks lying in the containers were lifted and cleared. But since then, the operations of the group here are shut,” said Rajesh Verma, Custom Broker, here.Meanwhile, the industrialists feel that because of this the industry is bearing huge losses. “Industry is suffering in many areas.

He had stated that an eco-sensitive site was not suitable for the industrial park.The PAC representatives, Dr Amandeep Singh Bains, Jaskirat Singh and Kapil Arora, met the minister at PUDA Bhawan, Mohali, today along with MLA Pargat Singh.PAC member Jaskirat Singh said: “When we met the minister, he agreed with us, that the industry can be located anywhere and such eco-sensitive location is most suitable for an eco-friendly eco-tourism project rather than any industry.”Jaskirat Singh and Kapil Arora said Ludhiana was a critically polluted region and the Sutlej was facing a major problem of pollution due to existing industries in the state and with the setting up of such industrial park, the situation will deteriorate further. As the Sutlej is a drinking water source for millions, it must be protected.Dr Amandep Singh Bains said since the tourism industry in the state was not getting proper exposure. Besides permitting the existing local farmers to continue with agricultural activities, such area should be used for eco-tourism development as well as to protect biodiversity along the Sutlej.“The minister assured us that he will write to the Chief Minister and the CS that an eco-friendly project only should be planned at this location,” he said.Despite repeated attempts, Sarkaria could not be contacted for comments. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/pac-members-mla-pargat-singh-meet-minister-sukhbinder-sarkaria-over-proposed-industrial-park-site-293299

However, no provision has been made for storm water drains along roadsides of the GLADA colony. Further, as per gazette notification for unapproved colonies, rainwater harvesting, which is mandatory, has not provided in the said colony,” said the complainant.Pointing out neglect in providing green cover in the colony by GLADA, the CoE president said after directions of the National Green Tribunal to all States, an ‘Action Plan of Clear Air, Ludhiana,’ was prepared by the Environment and Climate Change Department of Punjab wherein provisions were made for creation of green buffers along road sides and undertaking special drives to identify areas and make plantation to increase green belts in collaboration with the Forest Department.“However, GLADA has failed to initiate any such drive to plant saplings in any locality/area coming under its jurisdiction and at the same time not even a single sapling has been planted in any park or along the roads of the housing project,” said the complaint.Arora has sought directions to the officials concerned of GLADA to act and take necessary steps immediately in this regard and scrupulously follow all norms regarding green cover, rainwater harvesting and plantation of saplings in the GLADA colony, failing which the CoE would have to approach the NGT for redressal of legitimated grievances in larger public interest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/glada-charged-with-violation-of-norms-293297

Varinder Kumar Sharma, Deputy CommissionerWhile June reported daily virus deaths on 27 days with no casualty only on June 24, 25 and 27, July saw single life lost to Covid on five days — July 5, 9, 15, 17 and 18 — with no death recorded on 26 days last month.May had remained the deadliest for the district when a record high of 624 residents succumbing to the dreaded virus with the single-day toll touching as high as 30 twice onJune 10 and 11, while the lowest 24-hour casualties were recorded on May 31 when eight persons had died of Covid. In May, not a single day went without the virus deaths.April had reported 231 deaths due to Covid with the highest single-day toll of 20 on April 30 and the lowest 24-hour casualties recorded on April 13 when three persons had died of the virus. No day in April had also gone without the Covid deaths.In March, the district had reported 115 virus deaths with the highest single-day toll of 11 on March 29 and no casualties were recorded on four days on March 2, 5, 7 and 14.February was comparatively safer when 28 district residents succumbed to Covid with the highest single-day toll confined to three on four days while no death was reported on 13 days of that month.In January, the district had lost 37 of its residents to Covid with the single-day toll remaining three on six days, while no death was recorded on 11 days of that month.Ludhiana, which being the largest district with highest population of over 3.5 million, faced the maximum onslaught of the deadliest second Covid wave from March to May. It recorded a total of 3,140 virus deaths — 2,093 locals and 1,047 outsiders — which was highest death toll reported in any district of Punjab.The turnaround holds significance as Ludhiana had earlier assumed the dubious distinction of being the worst-hit district with the maximum number of daily Covid cases and deaths till May.If it was mayhem in May when the second Covid wave had rapidly slid into a devastating crisis with the health facilities unbearably falling short, oxygen supplies running low and many dying even without seeing a doctor, June had given a sigh of relief with the signs of gradual retreat and impact of deadly virus plateauing and the safe trend continues in July and August when the daily CFR remains zero since July 19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/no-covid-death-in-17-days-only-five-in-july-in-ludhiana-district-293293
