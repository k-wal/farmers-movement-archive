The man identified as Narinderpal Singh claimed that he belonged to a family of freedom fighters, but the government never offered any job to him or his children.LIP party workers, along with some unemployed persons, had gathered outside the DC office to mark their protest against the state government’s decision of appointing Congress MLA Rakesh Pandey’s son as naib tehsildar.When Narinderpal tried to set himself ablaze during the protest, the police and some persons managed to stop him. Cops took him to the police station from where he was later released.Narinderpal said his father and grandfather were freedom fighters. “My both sons pull a cart along with me. My elder son, who has done ITI, applied for a job multiple times, but he did not get any,” he said.“Forty years have passed, but no government has heard our voice. The families of freedom fighters are being ignored here,” he added.Notably, LIP workers have been opposing the appointment of Pandey’s son as naib tehsildar for the past several days.Randhir Singh Sivia of LIP was leading the protest outside the DC office today. The protesters were raising slogans against the Captain-led state government and the MLA. They had come to submit a memorandum at the district administration office.“The man, who sprinkled fuel on himself, belongs to the family of freedom fighters. Actually, he had come to mark his protest as he was disappointed with the government for never offering a job to any of his family members. He is not a LIP worker,” said Sivia.“Before the last Assembly elections, the Congress promised to give jobs to unemployed if it came to power in Punjab. Now, the Captain-led government is offering jobs to sons of MLAs while ignoring a large number of unemployed youths in the state. We are opposing government’s move of giving MLA Rakesh Pandey’s son a government job,” Sivia added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/immolation-bid-by-freedom-fighters-son-near-ludhiana-dc-office-300055

It was the main reason why we have left the BJP after serving it for many years,” he said.Chaitley said he, along with others, have joined the SAD because they know the working of the party and had a huge respect for Parkash Singh Badal.“Our party had an alliance with the SAD for long but it is unfortunate that now the BJP has failed to understand what people of the state want. It failed to take up the matter of farmers in a proper manner. Traders in the state are in a bad state and there is unrest among them. The industry has come to a standstill. The BJP should have taken all these matters with their government at the Centre and the latter should have resolved these issues but things are not being managed properly,” said Chaitley, adding that in days to come, many more people would join the SAD.“We have joined the SAD because we have seen the party working for the welfare of the state and Punjabis,” Chaitley added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/3-ludhiana-bjp-leaders-join-sad-300060
