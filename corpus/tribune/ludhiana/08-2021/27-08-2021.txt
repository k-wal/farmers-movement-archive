27-08-2021||In view of the recent surge in dreaded dengue fever cases from different parts of Ludhiana||Know all you want to about dengue||What is dengue?Dengue is a viral infection that can lead to fever (dengue fever syndrome) and can sometimes result in severe bleeding (dengue haemorrhagic fever) and shock (dengue shock syndrome).How can one get infected by the dengue virus?The Aedes mosquito spreads the dengue virus. This mosquito bites humans during daytime and breeds in relatively clean water stored for drinking or washing purposes and in rainwater that collects in various containers like tyres, bottles, tanks, plastic bottles etc.Who can get this disease?People of all ages and both sexes who are exposed to mosquito bites can get this disease. Children usually have a milder disease than adults.How can a patient with dengue present himself in the clinic?There are basically four ways in which a patient with dengue presents himself:Mild uncharacteristic fever.“Break-bone” fever characterised by chills, high fever, severe headache, and rash spreading from trunk to extremities, muscle and joint pains preventing all movements for nearly five days.DHF or dengue haemorrhagic fever abrupt onset, high continuous fever lasting for 2-7 days with bleeding patches under skin, nose bleeding, gum bleeding, blood vomit, black tarry stools, capillary leakage (ascites and pleural effusion), low platelet count and around 20 per cent rise in haematocrit.DSS or dengue shock syndrome shows all the signs and symptoms of DHF with cold clammy skin, weak and rapid pulse, hypotension and narrow pulse pressure.DHFHow is a patient with dengue fever managed?There is no specific drug or vaccine available that acts against the dengue virus. Management follows general principles:Can remaining in close contact with the dengue patient pass on the disease?No, the disease cannot be spread by direct contact. It spreads only via Aedes mosquito bite. The transmission route is ‘Man-Mosquito-Man’.Is there any vaccine to control the spread of dengue?A live-attenuated vaccine is in the final stages of development in Thailand and France.How does one prevent the virus from spreading?This can be achieved by protecting individuals from mosquito bite (sleeping under a mosquito net, using insect repellents) and by controlling the Aedes mosquito population in the area.How can the population of Aedes mosquito be brought under control?The anti-mosquito measures include:||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/know-all-you-want-to-about-dengue-302654

27-08-2021||Manav Mander||Third Covid wave likely in Sept-Oct, to affect kids more: Experts||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, August 26Experts are warning that the third wave of Covid would likely strike in September-October. It would affect children more and they would have similar risks as adults.However, if adults in the family wear masks and maintain hand hygiene, social distancing and get vaccinated against Covid, they can prevent infection among children in the family and protect them.“Lactating mothers should also get vaccinated against Covid. After delivery, even if the mother is Covid positive, the baby and the mother should not be separated. All babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months, irrespective of the Covid status of the mother. The virus is usually not transmitted through breast milk. In fact, the baby will receive antibodies against the virus through breast milk,” said Dr Rajinder Gulati, a paediatrician and retired SMO, Civil Hospital, Khanna.Children infected with Covid may be asymptomatic. Some can have fever, cough, cold or loose stools. If a child infected with coronavirus does not have respiratory distress, he/she can be isolated at home. In case of respiratory distress, it is mandatory to seek medical advice and care, said Dr Gulati further.Another expert, Dr Gurmeet Singh, a private practitioner, said it is important to ensure that the affected children are not dehydrated. These children can be given fluids, such as rice gruel, tender coconut water and fruit juice, in addition to nutritious diet. If the child has loose stools, homemade or commercially available Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) can be given. Oral Paracetamol is enough for managing fever in children. Administering unnecessary medicines without appropriate medical advice can be dangerous, he maintained.In case the child has other chronic problems, like asthma, diabetes or epilepsy, the respective medications should be continued with medical advice. Children should avoid stepping out of the house unnecessarily. They should not be taken to overcrowded places, he added.Dealing with children in Covid timesREDUCE SCREEN TIME Due to the pandemic and home confinement, children are likely to experience psychological problems like stress or depression. It is advisable to reduce their screen time. Unnecessary information which is like to cause fear and panic need not be shared with children.SIT AND TALK It is important that the parents sit down and interact freely with the children. All their concerns should be addressed diligently. In case a child has psychological issues, appropriate counselling and medical care should be given.KEEP THEM ENGAGEDTo keep children active and happy, they can be engaged in different games at home. Their talents should be identified and they should be encouraged to improve their skills in the area/ areas of their choice.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/third-covid-wave-likely-in-sept-oct-to-affect-kids-more-experts-302656
