Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu had called a meeting with councillors, MC officials and employees of Tata Projects Limited, which handles the project under the Smart City mission. The meeting was held at Nehru Rose Garden on Saturday.As some councillors stated that streetlights had not been installed at some points in their respective wards, Sandhu ordered inspection of all streetlights points in every ward. A team, comprising of ward councillors concerned, MC employees and workers of the managing firm, would check the streetlights in every ward and prepare a report. The matter would then be discussed in the MC’s General House meeting, likely to be held next week.During today’s meeting, officials claimed that the project, under which LED streetlights were to be installed at 1.05 lakh points in the city, had been completed. But, the Mayor said that 144 LED streetlights were found less in Ward No. 78 from where he is the councillor.Councillor Gurdeep Singh Neetu said he had found 60 streetlights less in his ward. Similarly, councillors Gurmail Singh Jajji, Harbhajan Singh Dang and some others also complained about points where the streetlights were not installed. In the meeting, questions were also raised over the role of MC officials who had given completion certificate to the project.Neetu raises question over sewer cleanlinessCouncillor Gurdeep Singh Neetu raised the matter related to Safai Karamchari Commission Chairman Geja Ram Valmiki, who had earlier accused MC officials of forcing sewer men to do manual scavenging.

After capturing the speed of the vehicle, challans would be sent to the violators at their homes.Deepak Pareek, Joint Commissioner of Police (City)This practice will bring transparency in the traffic police system and whosoever is caught driving rashly will have to pay the penalty. The owner would have to deposit the challan online in the stipulated period. The project is the brainchild of Deepak Pareek, Joint Commissioner of Police (City). He said several speed radars would be placed on the city roads to generate e-challans for speeding violations.“For the initial trial, three speed radars have been procured and once the implementation is complete, several more would be put on various city roads in the days to come. This practice will bring transparency in the traffic police system and whosoever is caught driving rashly will have to pay the penalty,” Pareek stated.After issuing e-challans, the same would be forwarded to the address of the vehicle owner. If the owner does not deposit the penalty on time, the challan would be sent to the court and non-bailable warrants could be issued against the violator for ignoring the e-challan, the JCP said.He added that the purpose of e-challans was to put a full stop on overspeeding violations so that precious lives could be saved on city roads.It is learnt that e-challaning would also minimise corruption in traffic police system because once an overspeeding vehicle is captured, challan has to be issued and no cop can delete that violation data.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/now-e-challan-for-overspeeding-in-ludhiana-291103
