It held that Rs 2,51,833 would be paid for damages to the accidental car and Rs 2 lakh for the accidental death along with 9 per cent per annum interest.Amrit Kaur had filed a petition before the PLA that on October 21, 2016, her son Harpreet was returning from Amritsar to Ludhiana after paying obeisance at Sri Harmandir Sahib. When the car reached near Phagwara, a truck was wrongly parked on the road, due to which the car hit the stationary vehicle. Her son died on the spot. The police also registered a case against the truck driver for his negligence.The car was insured with the insurance company and an accidental death policy was also taken by her son. Hence, a claim was filed. However, the claim was wrongly rejected by the company.On the other hand, insurance company officials justified the rejection of the claim. But after appreciating the evidence on record, the PLA observed that the decision of the firm was not sustainable in the eyes of law. Hence, the company was ordered to pay the claim within two months, failing which the amount would be paid with 12 per cent per annum interest from the date of decision.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/insurance-firm-told-to-pay-rs-4-5l-claim-302109

In a letter to Principal Secretary, Civil Aviation, Punjab, Tejveer Singh, a copy of which is with The Tribune, the AAI Executive Director (Engineering), Northern Region, MNN Rao, informed that Ludhiana International Airport Limited (LIAL) at its board meeting held on June 30 had approved the proposal to construct the interim terminal building over 2,000 sq m at Halwara in Ludhiana by the Punjab Government through the state government funds, which will be reimbursed to Punjab or its designated agency by the AAI after monetisation of its land at the existing Sahnewal airport in Ludhiana.“Keeping in view the resolution passed by LIAL, the AAI will consider the proposal at an estimated cost of Rs 4,290.42 lakh, including 12 per cent GST, at its 202nd board meeting, which is scheduled to be held on August 27,” Rao said.The AAI ED made it clear that based on approved estimated cost, the Punjab Government can initiate the tender action but work can be awarded only after the approval of the AAI board.Sharing details, Deputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma told The Tribune, here on Wednesday that the Principal Secretary, Civil Aviation, Punjab, had given in-principal administrative approval for the construction of interim terminal building and allied works at the cost of Rs 4,250.41-lakh on June 3.Accordingly, the tenders for road work, taxiway, apron and lighting arrangements on the roads were floated on June 19 and technical bids were opened on July 24, which are under consideration.Divulging the progress report, the ADC (General), Rahul Chaba, said a teleconference was held between the state and the AAI senior functionaries on August 4, wherein it was decided to send a detailed notice inviting tenders (DNIT) of the interim terminal building to the AAI for vetting, which is still awaited.Already, the construction of the airport link road and boundary wall has been completed.In a bid to give a boost to the industrial and economic activity in the state, the Punjab Government and the AAI are jointly setting up a new international civil terminal at the Air Force Station in Halwara, which is one of the oldest frontline airbases of the Indian Air Force (IAF), close to Ludhiana.The development assumes significance as Ludhiana is Punjab’s largest industrial and business city with a population of nearly 4 million, which is presently serviced by a small airport at Sahnewal. Ludhiana also has the advantage of being at the geographical centre of Punjab.The Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) had acquired land measuring 161.28 acres, including 135.54 acres for airport and 25.74 acres for future development.While the work on the construction of 3-metre-high with 660-mm thick punch tape concertina and barbed wire fencing has been completed by the PWD (B&R) at Rs 301.16 lakh provided by GLADA, the widening and strengthening of the existing 5.1-km link road from Aitiana village to the international airport from the existing 10 ft to 18-ft width has been completed by the Punjab Mandi Board at Rs 8.17 crore. The work also included construction of two bridges, each of 8-m span, on the Halwara drain.“Before the construction of the regular terminal, an interim building will come up to begin the airport operations here,” disclosed the DC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/aai-to-take-final-decision-on-international-airport-terminal-building-today-in-ludhiana-302107

He asked them to show evidence of corruption committed by any MC official.Accompanied by Senior Deputy Mayor Sham Sunder Malhotra and MC Commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal during a press conference at MC’s Zone D office, the Mayor said the contractors were led by a person who had “close ties with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)” and had already been blacklisted by the civic body. He wanted to malign the MC’s image for his vested interests.On the call of the contractors to boycott road construction works (bitumen based), Sandhu said in case they did not participate in the tendering process, the MC would recall the tenders of development works again but with RMC technique.On the accusation that they were asked to float tenders at 6 per cent lesser amount than the estimate prepared by the MC, he said the contractors had also worked on 5 per cent lesser amount when the civic body was headed by the Akali government in 2017.The Mayor also asked Sabharwal to conduct a probe as to how a blacklisted contractor received the tenders and ordered an inquiry into how a site of dispensary turned into a commercial building. The MC Commissioner said quality of development projects was being ensured and there would be no compromise on the same.While announcing to boycott road construction works, the Ludhiana Hotmix Plant Welfare Association president Vindod Jain had on Tuesday alleged corruption in the MC. The contractors were forced to pay commission to the MC officials to get their pending payments, he had maintained.Allegations must be probed: Cong leaderCongress leader Parminder Mehta said the allegations levelled by the road contractors should be probed. “The contractors have accused MC officials of charging commission from them. These are serious allegations and a probe should be conducted. It seems due to the commission game going on in the MC, the quality of development works is being ignored. When the samples of road material and tiles had failed tests, no action was taken against any erring contractor. The MC had kept a soft corner for them,” Mehta added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/will-not-bow-down-to-blackmailing-ludhiana-mayor-balkar-singh-sandhu-302098

But ultimately, the government had its way.In this regard, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had recently issued directions to the state government through its Chief Secretary on a petition filed by the Council of Engineers (CoE) to first get the floodplains of the Sutlej around the site at Mattewara demarcated and only then, take any further action for setting up the industrial park. However, apparently these directions have also been ignored.In a public notice, PUDA has invited ‘expression of interest’ (EOI) for the ‘Modern Industrial Park’ at Koom Kalan for plots in varying sizes from one acre to 50 acres. Eligibility of applicants for seeking the plots would be based on their average annual turnover during the past three years, ranging from Rs 5 crore to Rs 250 crore. The applicants would have to pay a refundable demand survey fee of Rs 1 lakh for a plot measuring up to 5 acres, Rs 2 lakh for 10 acres and Rs 5 lakh for plots measuring 25 to 50 acres.According to the PUDA public notice, the tentative price of the land has been fixed between Rs 1.15 crore and Rs 1.90 crore per acre, depending on the size of the plot. The last date for submission of the EOI would be September 15, 2021.National Green Tribunal directions ignoredIn this regard, the National Green Tribunal had recently issued directions to the state government through its Chief Secretary on a petition filed by the Council of Engineers to first get the floodplains of the Sutlej around the site at Mattewara demarcated and only then take any further action for setting up the industrial park.
