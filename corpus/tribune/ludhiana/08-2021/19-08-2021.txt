With a surge in their demand, their prices have also seen an upward trend.The stay-at-home period became an ideal time for many to bring home a dog.According to dog lovers and breeders, the cost of pure bred and designer dogs has gone up considerably in the past one year. Breeds like Beagle, Shih Tzu, Pug, Dachshund, Chihuahua etc are now costing double the price.A dog breeder based in Samrala said in 2020 many breeders had put the breeding programmes on hold, with uncertainty all around. “But as time progressed, we saw the demand of dogs picking up because people were locked in their homes, kids wanted company and there were no holidays. The demand for small dogs has increased as it is suitable and comfortable for people living in flats and apartments,” he said.A pet shop owner from Model Town said the prices of dogs had doubled since last year. “A Beagle pup was sold between Rs 10,000-15,000 earlier but now it is being sold for around Rs 20,000-22,000. Shih Tzu, which was earlier priced at Rs 35,000, is now being sold at Rs 50,000,” he said.Amarbeer, a mother of two, said her kids starting having major behavioural issues as they had no company at home. “Although I am working from home but I cannot devote much time to them and since they are not going to schools or anywhere outside, we brought home a dog for them. Now, they are busy taking care of him and managing his routine. They wanted a big dog but since we live in a rented accommodation and do not have much space, so we bought a Shih Tzu.

We are worried as we had never thought of this situation and business with Afghanistan had never been troublesome in the past eight years. The payments were all secured and timely,” Chopra said.“There is no response from our buyers there. The phone calls remain unanswered. Maybe there is scare and panic in the country. Some of my payment is still stuck there and I am not hopeful of getting it back in the near future,” he maintained.On being asked if the stock prepared for Afghanistan could be used elsewhere, the local manufacturer refused. “These are different pieces, huge and long, and the material is also very light in weight. We cannot use it in some other market. To the best of my knowledge, material worth about Rs 300-400 crore of Ludhiana manufacturers is now stuck”.Another manufacturer, Vinod Thapar, who regularly sends woollens and shawls to Afghanistan, feels that everything has come to a standstill for the time being. “Though I have spoken to my buyers there and they have assured that business ties will remain unchanged, but till the time everything is clear, we will be worried. My payment is also stuck there. Afghanistan always released regular payments and we hope that business will be same as it was earlier,” Thapar added.The manufacturers are keeping their fingers crossed and are hoping that at least stocks should be cleared and they should get the payments. As far as continuing business in the future is concerned, it would be decided accordingly, they stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/stocks-stuck-taliban-rule-leaves-local-bizmen-jittery-299304

The Special Task Force (STF) wing of the Ludhiana range used to make drug recovery in kilograms while the drug recovery count of the city police, which have a big number of officers, is far less than the STF.However, the number of smugglers arrested by the Ludhiana police is more than the STF in terms of recovery of all types of drugs and drug money.Led by Ludhiana Commissioner of Police Rakesh Agrawal and being assisted by several senior officers, CIA, drug units, 28 police stations, the city police are making recovery of drugs in gms only while the STF wing has been recovering drugs in kgs worth crores.As per data procured from the STF, from March 2017 to till date, it arrested 522 smugglers from the jurisdiction of the Ludhiana Commissionerate, registered 246 cases of drugs and recovered 242 kg of heroin/ice, 1,335 kg of poppy husk, 58.5 kg of opium, 34-lakh intoxicating tablets, 2.97 crore drug money, etc. Despite these recoveries and arrests from the city police limits, the Ludhiana police failed to make such big recoveries.Inspector Harbans Singh, in-charge, STF, Ludhiana, told The Tribune that the STF would continue to perform better and more smugglers would be arrested to wipe out the drug menace.“Whenever we arrest any smuggler, we always try to bust the entire supply line by exploring backward and forward linkages and many a times, we have also nabbed main smugglers living in other states,” Harbans said.Though the STF has only one cell in Ludhiana, it is making huge recoveries of drugs. The STF wing which caters to the Ludhiana Commissionerate, Jagraon, Khanna and Nawanshahr has a staff of only 50 personnel, including the office staff, of which only 25 persons are available for field work.Former DGP DR Bhatti said the STF was an exclusive agency working against drugs and the Police Commissionerate had lot of other duties such as law and order, other crimes, investigations. However, the Commissionerate should achieve good results in drug recovery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/stf-seized-242-kg-heroin-ice-nabbed-522-drug-smugglers-in-past-four-years-299291
