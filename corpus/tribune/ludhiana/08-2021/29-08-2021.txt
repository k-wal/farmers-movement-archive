MC officials had earlier claimed that there were 14 big machines for all wards but at present, only 12 machines were functional. Besides, small fogging machines given to the councillors are commonly run for a short time.Manjit Singh of Guru Nanak Colony (block A) on Gill Road said: “I have not seen fogging conducted in our area in the past over one year. The MC must take concrete measures to ensure fogging at regular intervals.”Leader of Opposition in the MC House Harbhajan Singh Dang said fogging was not being conducted properly in the city. Whenever the MC sends a big fogging machine to any ward, fogging could not be conducted in all areas of the respective ward in one go, he said.“Residents generally make requests to us to get fogging conducted in their respective areas. Thus, the civic body must intensify the fogging drive for the prevention of dengue and other diseases spread by mosquitoes,” Dang added.A former councillor, Inder Aggarwal, whose wife is a councillor from Ward 57, said: “We could get fogging conducted with a small machine in only three-four streets with the fuel and insecticides provided by the MC in a day. When a big machine is sent to Ward 57, fogging can’t be conducted properly in the entire ward. Suppose if fogging is conducted in one area with a big machine today, in the same area it would be conducted again after nearly two months by the MC with the big machine. Such drive is just an eyewash. We want that the MC should intensify the drive. Moreover, the water accumulated in road gullies is also a breeding source for mosquitoes but the civic body took steps in this regard.”However, MC’s Health officer Vipul Malhotra has claimed that 12 big fogging machines were functional.Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said the fogging drive was being carried out properly in the city.He said: “We are also going to intensify the drive. Fogging with small machines will be conducted twice a day in each ward.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/fogging-yet-to-start-in-several-areas-of-ludhiana-city-303675

They will run an awareness campaign to approach the property owners concerned to avail benefit of the one-time settlement policy. The MC will also organise special camps for regularisation of the connections and recovery of arrears.”MC’s Superintending Engineer Rajinder Singh said there could be around 80,000 to 85,000 illegal water supply and sewer connections in the city. It would be a golden chance for property owners to get their connections regularised, he said.As per the policy, after depositing the fixed fee for regularisation of connections, no other charges like road cutting fee, connection fee and security will be chargeable. Upon the satisfaction of a technical official regarding the quality of the pipe, size of connection and alignment of water supply line (not below or adjoining sewer line) connection will be regularised. No penalty will be charged if the fee is deposited within three months from the date of notification.In case of approved water supply and sewerage connections, the government has also offered a one-time settlement for recovery of arrears. If the principal amount payable on the date of notification is paid within three months from the date of issue of notification, no interest and penalty on arrears of water supply and sewers charges will be charged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-mc-to-run-awareness-campaign-in-city-303673

If some of them are to be believed, the stock equals 5-20 containers.SC Ralhan, an exporter of hand tools here, said exporters are facing exploitation at the hands of shipping lines. “We are not getting containers to send out our stocks. The freight, which was earlier $2,200 for Los Angles is now approximately $10,000. How can we run businesses in such a grim situation? There are hardly any container manufacturing units in the country and we have to rely on international shipping agencies to send the material and they charge as per their whims and fancies. We are facing huge financial losses,” Ralhan said.The exporters say they are facing great difficulties in sending stocks to buyers because of the steep freight hike in recent times. “Some of the buyers understand and they share the burden with us while others refuse to pay more. Because China is providing more freight as compared to India, the shipping agencies give preferential treatment to China and get stocks through it,” Ralhan maintained.Another exporter, Avinash Gupta, who runs a steel forging unit, said the acute shortage of containers and steep hike in freight is the root cause of huge financial losses to exporters. “If I want 10 containers today, I am just getting two-three containers and the stocks start getting piled up. The rates are also too high. ,” Gupta added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/container-crunch-worries-exporters-303672
29-08-2021||Lovleen Bains||Migrants’ kids less keen on joining colleges this year||Doraha, August 28Children of migrant labourers are taking lesser admissions in colleges this year. Not only this, their admission to the ongoing classes too has witnessed a downfall. Financial constraints, lack of job opportunities and their exodus to their homelands are being seen as the chief factors responsible for comparatively lesser admissions this year.Asish, who was studying in BCom-II last session, has discontinued his studies for the simple reason that the family is completely out of work and is finding it difficult to even make both ends meet.Another student, who was pursuing BSc, when contacted by the staff of a local college to be informed about the date of admission, said he, along with his family, had returned to their hometown and he would not be able to continue his studies.Mother of Sakshi (name changed) said, “I wanted my child to study further as she had secured 92 per cent marks in Class XII but we have no money to pay her fee. The lockdown has forced our children to give up studies and take to work.”Another child, who had cleared his senior secondary class this year, is not able to study further as he had to set up a vegetable rehri. He believes that the rehri would fetch him at least something at the end of the day but the degree, even after putting in three long years and money, would not guarantee a job.Narinder Singh Sidhu, Principal of Guru Nanak National College, Doraha, said the admission of children of migrants had decreased as compared to previous years. “The pandemic has adversely affected their pockets and they are finding it difficult to arrange the fee. Financial constraints are one of the major reasons for comparatively lesser admissions from the migrant class.”RS Jhanji, Principal of AS College, Khanna, said, “They have shifted to the work mode as the pandemic has left them completely shattered and in a state of want and misery. Moreover, the policies of the government, where there is no hope for a child even after clearing graduation or for that matter even postgraduation, is no less responsible for the decline in admissions. It has also been observed that children are giving preference to skill development courses, which can at least enable them to have their own work arrangement, if not guarantee a job.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/migrants-kids-less-keen-on-joining-colleges-this-year-303670

They said the park should not be set up on the banks of the river.They also raised questions over claims made by a minister that biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) have decreased nearly 70-80 per cent in the nullah after releasing of the canal water into the drain.Col CM Lakhan Pal (retd) said: “After releasing fresh water into the nullah, the water flow is high but chemicals have not reduced in it. We don’t agree with claims about the reduction in COD and BOD in the nullah. The problem of waste wate.”He said: “The government has been spending hundreds of crores in the name of cleaning the drain but the problem has only increased over the years. The reason is that ministers and bureaucrats see it as nothing more than a cash cow and there is little transparency in the way the government is working on this much-needed river rejuvenation project.”A member of the PAC, Jaskirat Singh, alleged: “Claims of 80 per cent reduction in the COD and BOD are technically faulty and misleading. If reducing COD and BOD by so much was so simple no STP would be required anywhere in the world.”Dr Amandeep Singh Bains from RBS Roots, industrialist Ranjodh Singh and other activists took part in the protest. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/pac-holds-protest-on-buddha-nullah-bridge-seeks-freedom-from-pollution-303668

The expenditure has been borne by the government, several private companies and NGOs under their CSR activities.While three PSA plants have already become operational, the rest are in the advanced stage of completion with six more to be functional within this month and the last one to start operations by October 10.Besides, the district has already acquired maximum cylinders and the highest number of oxygen concentrators to build a strong medical oxygen infrastructure for meeting the anticipated high demand of the life-saving gas in future.With this, Ludhiana, which being the largest district in the state with a maximum population of four million, will be able to avert the grim situation that it had passed through in the past, when an acute shortage of oxygen was faced while catering to the high demand of the serious and critical patients who were hospitalised in hordes during the second Covid wave, which had rapidly slid into a devastating crisis when the health facilities had unbearably fell short, oxygen supplies had ran low and many died even without seeing a doctor.The DC revealed that among other preparations, the district administration has also established an eight-bed paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) worth Rs 50 lakh at the Civil Hospital.Besides, 3,304 beds — 2,518 (1,768 level-2 and 750 level-3) in 77 private hospitals and 786 (750 level-2 and 36 level-3) in government facilities — have been created in the district for serious and critical patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-district-prepares-for-combatting-3rd-covid-wave-strengthens-health-infra-303667
