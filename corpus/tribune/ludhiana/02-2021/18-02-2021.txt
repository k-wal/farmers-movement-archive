18-02-2021||Nitin Jain||Clean sweep for Cong, Oppn decimated||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, February 17The Congress on Wednesday swept the civic body polls by wresting control over all six Municipal Councils (MCs) that had gone to general elections on Sunday by winning 81 of the total 112 seats in Ludhiana district.While the ruling party lost the Sahnewal MC bypoll, which the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) won, it retained the lone seat in the Mullanpur Dakha MC bypoll, which was necessitated by the death of its then senior vice-president Balwinder Singh Sekhon.The main opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced a crushing defeat by winning only three of the total 114 MC seats in eight civic bodies.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the SAD, which for the first time had contested any election separately after they parted ways over the contentious farm laws, could win only two and 16 seats, respectively. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) even failed to open an account in any of the eight civic bodies.The main Opposition AAP, which has two of the total 14 MLAs in Ludhiana district, even failed to open an account in six of the total eight civic bodies that went to polls, barring two seats that it won in Khanna and one in Doraha.The performance of the saffron party also remained dismal with no seat to its kitty in seven MCs and it won only two seats in Khanna.It was a complete rout for the BSP, which gave the worst performance with no seat to its pool in any of the eight civic bodies.The SAD emerged the main Opposition party in all MCs and managed to retain its hold in the Sahnewal bypoll, where the ruling Congress finished third while the AAP remained the runner-up.Of the total 114 seats for which elections were held, the Congress won 82, SAD 16, AAP three, BJP two, and Independents 11.It was for the first time in the history of the MCs that the Independents also failed to impress by winning only 11 seats that they had contested, with no count in four civic bodies.In all six civic bodies, the Congress won the absolute majority and won all 15 seats in Raikot, which was represented by AAP MLA Jagtar Singh Jagga Hissowal. The ruling party claimed a two-third majority in four MCs — Jagraon (17 of 23), Samrala (10 of 15), Doraha (11 of 15), and Payal (nine of 11 seats).Not only Raikot, the state’s main Opposition AAP also failed to open its account in Jagraon, which was also represented by its legislator Sarvjit Kaur Manuke, who is also the deputy leader of opposition in the state Assembly.The SAD, which represents Mullanpur Dakha and Sahnewal in the Vidhan Sabha, was able to win the MC bypoll in Sahnewal, represented by its leader in the Assembly Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, but lost Mullanpur Dakha, from where Manpreet Singh Ayali had won the Vidhan Sabha bypoll in 2019 after the resignation of AAP’s Harvinder Singh Phoolka.The Lok Insaaf Party (LIP), which represents Atam Nagar (Simarjit Singh Bains) and Ludhiana South (Balvinder Singh Bains), had not fielded its candidates on the party symbol.While the Congress contested all 114 seats on the party symbol, the AAP fielded 109 candidates, SAD 86, BJP 45, and BSP 13. As many as 123 nominees opted to contest as Independents.It took hardly 20 minutes to break the first result news from Mullanpur Dakha, where the ruling party’s Jabbar Jang Singh Sekhon retained his late father’s seat by defeating the SAD’s Sushil Kumar by a margin of 446 votes in the MC bypoll.The counting of votes began at eight centres across the district at 9 am. The last was the result news from Khanna and Jagraon MCs at 2 pm.However, the official declaration of results was made by the district election office at 3 pm.Supporters go berserk, dance on dhol beatsAs dholis and band parties were already stationed outside counting centres, the victorious candidates emerged out in the shape of massive processions with their supporters lifting them up in the air and garlanding them immensely.On the beats of dhols and tunes of brass bands, the victorious candidates and their supporters turned berserk with dancing all the way to their respective constituencies. Most of the winner candidates were carried in open jeeps with folded hands and plastic smiles. With restlessness clearly visible from their faces, the winners did not miss the chance to thank their voters and supporters all through the evening.To cash the win, Congress leaders, who worked overtime for the ruling party nominees, led the victory processions that culminated in a media briefing at party offices this evening.Later, SAD, AAP, BJP and BSP leaders had discussions with their respective party activists to analyse what went wrong.DC thanks voters, staffDeputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma has thanked voters, polling and security staffers, candidates and the political parties for doing their job and cooperation in ensuring free, fair and peaceful elections and counting for the MC polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/clean-sweep-for-cong-oppn-decimated-213936

They blamed Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu for “poor” waste management in the city.Aggarwal said: “A big problem related to solid waste management has occurred in the city due to ignorance of the Mayor and the officials concerned. No processing of waste is being done at the main garbage dump. Garbage lifting is also not done timely in the city. The waste is getting collected at secondary collection points.”Aggarwal, who is the president of the local body cell of the Ludhiana BJP, said: “A probe should be held on how much waste was processed when the A2Z firm was handling the task. If any violation is found, action should be taken. It seems heaps of garbage contain 15-20 lakh MT of waste. Why Indore model of solid waste management is not being adopted here?”Aggarwal said they will soon hold protests if the situation was not improved.NGO protests at main garbage dumpMembers of Yuva, an NGO, held a protest at the MC’s main garbage dump (landfill site) near Tajpur Road on Wednesday. Kumar Gaurav of the NGO rang a bell at the site as no attention is being paid to resolve the issue of legacy waste (old waste) there.He said: “Heaps of garbage look like mountains as no steps have been taken to resolve the issue. The MC should pay attention to improve solid waste management and ensure functioning of the waste processing plant at the earliest.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bjp-blames-ludhiana-mayor-officials-for-poor-management-of-waste-213937

In gross violation of the rules, these plots are being misused by many individuals for various other purposes.  In Phase VI of Focal Point, certain units are using these as “godowns” or “labour quarters” or have opened shops for making quick bucks instead of manufacturing, a gross violation of the bylaws.   “But what is more serious is that some people have started doing storage of chemicals and oils and lubricants in these plots, which is very dangerous. This is posing threat to life,” said one of the industrialists, on the condition of anonymity.   Many nearby industrialists rued that it is a continuous threat to life of people but neither the Municipal Corporation nor the PSIEC or the Factory Department is taking the matter seriously. To shrug off their responsibilities, the departments are passing the buck, maintained the industrialists.  As very hazardous chemicals and flammable lubricants are being used without any check industry is actually sitting in an active volcano, they said.  Gurpreet Bassi Gogi, chairman, PSIEC, said he had also come to know about such activities recently. He ensured that guilty will be punished accordingly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/psiec-allotted-plots-being-misused-213941
