At the same time, ironically, in government primary schools, no posts for Class IV employees are sanctioned.Teachers in primary schools rued that there are many works, which are done by Class IV employees only and maintaining cleanliness in their absence is a Herculean task.Parminder Kaur, a teacher at a Government Primary School, said there are no Class IV employees in primary schools. “The reality is that in primary schools, these posts are must. Though we try to keep an eye on kids, they throw things here and there. They are regularly told to adopt hygiene, wash hands etc. In the absence of sweepers, gardeners etc, the school premises are not maintained properly. We spend from our own pocket to get the class rooms, play grounds, corridors cleaned. Class IV employees should be recruited in primary schools too and if this process cannot take place immediately then government needs to sanction grants to schools to hire staff as per their requirements,” said the teacher.“The gardens need maintenance, classrooms, corridors need to be cleaned, the peon or caretaker is required for safety of the students etc. Everything cannot be managed by the teachers alone. They complained that at times, they clean the class rooms themselves with a broom with the help of students, which is not their job,” said a teacher on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/absence-of-class-iv-staff-ails-primary-schools-211809
