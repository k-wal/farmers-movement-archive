They said the safety of commuters and pedestrians must be ensured by following the guidelines issued by the Indian Roads Congress.At present, a number of projects, including smart street road work on Malhar Road, Canal bridge reconstruction work at BRS Nagar, ROB and RUBs project on Pakhowal Road and others, are under way in the city. However, the required signboards for the management of traffic have not been installed for the convenience of commuters at different points. It has also been seen that the required sign boards are not displayed most of the times when road carpeting or construction work is done.Road safety activist Rahul Verma said direction boards and reflective barricading had not been done at most of the points where road projects were under way. “Even the information and warning signs have not been displayed at many locations. The diversion plan and sign boards must be displayed at a proper distance before the construction site for the convenience of the commuters. All guidelines for traffic management must be followed,” said Verma.Col JS Brar of Maha Sabha (NGO) said, “The required sign boards regarding construction work must be displayed at all major points to alert the commuters. The reflective tapes on barricades must be displayed properly. The “slow” sign boards to slow down traffic must be displayed in the right manner and the safety of all commuters and pedestrians should be ensured.”The Indian Institute of Architects, Punjab Chapter, chairman, Sanjay Goel, said the diversion plan and information boards must be displayed in the right manner so that the commuters don’t face any problem. He said that the authorities and contractors concerned should take the necessary steps for the implementation of the guidelines on traffic management in the work zones.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/signboards-sought-for-traffic-management-in-work-zones-192548

Earlier in 2016, Dr Kakkar served as the Senior Medical Officer of the Civil Hospital.Meanwhile, on December 23, Dr Harinderjit Singh was appointed as the Civil Surgeon, Ludhiana, by the Health and Family Welfare Department but yesterday his appointment was reverted back and Dr Kakkar, who was serving as the Civil Surgeon, Barnala, was transferred here while Dr Harinderjit will serve in Barnala.Before Barnala, Dr Kakkar has served as the Senior Medical Officer in Jagraon and won four state and two national awards.This correspondent talked to Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar on the first day of his joining. Excerpts from the conversation:World is going through a pandemic and my first priority after joining Ludhiana district will be to control the spread of Covid-19 and plan for its vaccination in a smooth manner. Frontline workers will be vaccinated first, followed by high-risk categories.Awareness by mass media teams of the department will continue as earlier through print and electronic media. Stress will be laid on wearing masks, social distancing and hand washing. Though cases have come down considerably, people need to avoid going to crowded places.Cleanliness is a major issue at the Civil Hospital and stress will be laid on it. The Civil Hospital, Jagraon, during my service period won positions in the State Kayakalp award for cleanliness for three consecutive years. In 2016, it won the fourth position, in 2017 it got the first place, in 2018 it clinched the second position. In 2019, it got the National Quality Assurance Standard Standards Certification. I won the state award on Republic Day for beat services at the Jagraon hospital. I want to make improvement at the district hospital on the same lines.At present, defeating Covid is the major challenge before people of Ludhiana and we want co-operation from them in this regard. People wear masks but they don’t cover their nose which makes no sense. Everyone should wear mask in such a way that it properly covers the mouth and the nose, only then the virus can be prevented. Avoid going to crowded places and keep washing hands regularly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/containing-covid-spread-priority-says-dr-kakkar-192551

According to experts 31 per cent increase in heart attacks in the coldest months of the year has been seen as compared with the warmest.Dr Mohit Bhutani, an interventional cardiologist, said cold can reduce the oxygen-rich blood supply to your heart muscle. It can put you in situations that force your heart to work harder; as a result, your heart demands more oxygen-rich blood.Cold can reduce supply of oxygen-rich bloodThis is likely to happen because blood pressure increases during winters as temperatures drop, your blood vessels tighten and blood flow speeds up to help you stay warm, he pointed out.Another reason could be the increase in blood immunity naturally in winter to prevent you from seasonal flu and cold that can pile the plague in your arterial walls. Flue and fever also increase oxygen requirement thus makes heart beating faster.One should be aware of subtle signs that may be chest pain with pressure and discomfort in the chest with pain in the upper body and limbs.Dispelling doubts, Dr Bhutani said the pain is not necessary to occur only on the left side, but can also be on the right side. Fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, sweating is more likely to show in females than an acute chest pain. The best way to protect yourself is to stay warm, especially people with an old cardiac history and above 65-yr of age.Dr Raghav Sharma, senior interventional cardiologist at a private hospital, said Covid infection is a disease that causes inflammation by means of the release of interleukins and cytokine storm. It can affect the heart by causing inflammation of heart muscles, known as myocarditis. Hence, patients who are infected with Covid should be treated for heart disease if they show signs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/take-care-of-your-heart-during-winters-experts-192554
