A number of homeless persons in areas like Samrala Chowk, Industrial areas and others are not aware about the location of this night shelter that falls under the MC’s Zone B.Amid the cold wave, just 20-30 persons visit this shelter these days. The officials claimed that there was arrangement for 130 persons in two big halls of the night shelter.Notably, it is the only night shelter of the city where folding beds are available for the visitors. These beds have been placed by maintaining social distance for the prevention of Covid-19. At other three night shelters, beddings are placed on floor. The sanitary conditions at the night shelter of Ghoda Colony were looking better than other three night shelters of the MC, Ludhiana.Issues needing attentionLike other nights shelters, there is no provision of washing or cleaning of used blankets and bedding covers at Ghoda Colony night shelter. There is also no provision of food or tea for needy persons. A water purifier for drinking water is required to be installed at the shelter.A city resident, Jagjeet Singh, said, “The MC should create awareness among the homeless persons about the night shelter. It must install signboards to indicate the direction to the night shelter from Cheema Chowk, Transport Nagar side, Samrala Chowk and nearby areas. Moreover, the street vendors, shopkeepers as well as residents of nearby areas should also be made aware about the night shelter facility so that these persons can further share information with homeless persons. If provision of food is made available, I think more homeless persons can be motivated to stay at the night shelter during winter season.”Councillor from ward No. 20, Navneet Singh, said, “I will raise the demand for the installation of direction boards at different locations like Cheema Chowk and other areas to indicate the way leading to the night shelter. However, many residents of Ghoda Colony are aware about the night shelter.”For the prevention of coronavirus, masks and sanitisers were earlier unavailable at the night shelter. But, an official said that these had been made available two days ago.MC SDO Arvind Aggarwal said there were two halls, one each for men and women.Superintending Engineer (B&R) at MC’s Zone B, Parveen Singla, said they make all efforts to bring the homeless persons to the night shelter. On job, say civic body officialsMC SDO Arvind Aggarwal said a city bus had been deployed to bring the homeless from different locations.
