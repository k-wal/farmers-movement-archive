However, the MC is yet to recover the excess payment from the contractor.Raising questions over lackadaisical attitude, the leader of the Opposition in the MC House, Harbhajan Singh Dang, said responsibility should be fixed for issuing excess payment to the contractor. “Action should be initiated against the officials who are at fault. The MC should ensure the recovery of excess payment from the contractor at the earliest. Also, the erring contractor must be debarred,” he said.Kuldeep Singh Khaira of Vigilant Citizens’ Forum, Ludhiana, said: “When the audit report has highlighted embezzlement, why action against responsible officials is being delayed? The MC authorities must set an example by taking a strict action against the erring officials who had issued excess payment to the contractor. Transparency in all projects must be ensured.”Sources said a proposal was made by the B&R branch officials concerned to increase the Jagraon bridge retaining wall project cost on the pretext of changing the design.MC Additional Commissioner Rishipal Singh said they would issue fresh notices to the officials concerned in this regard.MC Commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal said they would take the required action against the officials responsible for releasing excess payment to the contractor.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/payment-in-excess-mc-yet-to-fix-responsibility-201032

The shortage of space is another problem with the dispensary as it has just three rooms — one room for the medical officer and pharmacist, one for auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) and a store room.“The space we have is insufficient. The room of the medical officer is small and the room for ANMs is in a depleted condition. We need proper space to run the dispensary,” said Medical Officer Dr Prabhakar.“There is no separate bathroom for the staff and we are facing the problem of water shortage as well. We have requested the authorities a number of times to shift our premises, but to no avail,” said Dr Shubh, a senior ANM.She further said that a ‘Sewa Kendra’ was lying vacant nearby and they have requested the authorities to shift the premises.“We have a huge footfall of patients in the dispensary and if we get proper space, we can work more efficiently. Our only demand is shifting us to a better and spacious place,” she said.The Medical Officer was recently appointed here and thus, the problem of consultation was solved and the Medical Officer is also attending the on-call duty at the Field Gunj government dispensary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/space-crunch-gives-a-tough-time-to-staff-at-kidwai-nagar-govt-dispensary-201050

Now, these residents are forced to bring water from nearby religious shrines and industries for drinking purposes.Residents bringing water from nearby placesA number of residents complained that there was no water supply to their houses for the past over a month but nothing has been done to resolve the issue so far. Now, these residents are forced to bring water from nearby religious shrines and industries for drinking purposes.Hari Niwas, a resident, said: “We are facing a lot of problems due to lack of water supply. We are forced to bring water from nearby factories. Earlier, we used to get contaminated water supply as sewage was getting mixed in the water supply line. Later, the civic body started a work in the area after which the water is not being supplied to our houses.”Residents said nobody was paying any attention towards problems being faced by them.“We are facing several problems in arranging water for our daily use. We want to make a request to the MC authorities to do the needful to resolve these issues at the earliest,” they said.Notably, residents had earlier raised their voice over uncovered manholes in the area but the MC has covered only some of the manholes while others are still lying opened on the broken Khaal Road (near Giaspura Chowk on the highway), posing threat to the commuters. Overflowing of sewers is also a regular affair in the area. The residents have placed sticks in uncovered sewer manholes to alert pedestrians and commuters.A resident said: “A few manholes are lying uncovered for a long time. There are chances that any pedestrian can fall in these manholes. We don’t know where we should go to file a complaint in this regard. The MC office is located at a long distance from our colony. Our elected representatives never visit the area. At least, the manholes should be covered to avoid any mishap.”Moreover, the civic body has also failed to ensure desilting of the sewer line that generally overflows. It also seems that streets are also not being cleaned on a timely basis in the area.Issues will be resolved soon: OfficialsJE (O&M) Avneet Singh said the water supply would be restored at the earliest.“I will take necessary steps to make sure that all manholes should be covered,” he said. MC’s Superintending Engineer Ravinder Garg said he would look into the matter and take necessary measures in the matter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/one-month-on-residents-not-getting-water-supply-201055

In this game of ‘mutual back scratching’, the LIT officials and the contractors were riding the proverbial gravy train while the precious financial resources of the Trust and public funds were being squandered away.The whistle-blowing LIT contractor has also charged the LIT officials of ignoring the working capacity of their favourite contractors and some of them had gotten away with works which were beyond their capacity, taking in account their pending or incomplete works with other departments. More often than not, the officials concerned, deliberately or otherwise, did not demand an undertaking or affidavit of pending or incomplete works from successful bidders which was another irregular practice where the allocation of the public works by government departments was concerned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-improvement-trust-faces-loss-due-to-pooling-by-contractors-201059
