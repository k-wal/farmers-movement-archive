After these “irregularities” came to light, the role of the B&R branch officials concerned is under scanner. Earlier, a proposal was made by these officials to increase the Jagraon bridge retaining wall project cost on the pretext of the change of the design as per information.When the matter had come to his notice, MC Commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal had written to the government in this regard and recommended conducting financial and technical audit of this project. The government then got third party techno-financial audit conducted from WAPCOS Ltd.In its report, WAPCOS Ltd has brought to the notice of the government, while carrying out the audit of the retaining wall and approaches of Jagraon Bridge at Ludhiana, that excess payment of Rs44.70 lakh had been made to the contractor by the MC Ludhiana. On the basis of the WAPCOS report, Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Company has written to the MC that the government had given directions to make the necessary recovery of Rs44.70 lakh (excess payment). The MC has also been directed to submit a report in this regard.Meanwhile, the government has also directed the MC to submit some clarifications regarding the project work. The MC has been asked to submit clarifications required for revision in design of the retaining wall which do not appear to be justified and also for the non-compliance of awarded conditions for use of RMC from plant of cement manufacturing companies. Besides, clarifications regarding the non-compliance of the condition for mix design and for the non-approval of the NS rates by the competent authority have also been sought.Now, MC Commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal wrote to Additional Commissioner (R) to take action as per the directions of the government for the recovery of the excess payment that was made to the contractor. Sabharwal has asked the additional commissioner to submit the action taken report in this regard within 15 days.It is also required to mention that Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu had earlier also marked an inquiry into the matter. The two outsourced SDOs had prepared an inspection report in which they had raised questions over the design of the retaining wall. Following the inquiry report, show-cause notices to two superintending engineers, an SDO and JE were issued. These officials were asked as to how they had made the cost estimates for the construction of the retaining wall of Jagraon Bridge.Notably, the reconstructed Jagraon Bridge was thrown open to public on September 30, 2020. The MC had got the retaining wall and bridge road approaches works conducted in its jurisdiction. The main bridge construction work was done by the Railways.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/audit-by-firm-finds-irregularities-193903

Roti is a symbol of langar, which the first Sikh master Guru Nanak Dev had started with the money given to him by his father. It represents both hard work and a spirit of sharing. Farmers provide us with food, hence, their voice should be heard by ther authorities concerned, feels the artist.Jaswinder has made several artworks in the past, depicting various issues. He is also a recipient of prestigious awards. Since this work is close to his heart, he wishes to take it to the Delhi borders to show support and solidarity towards the farmers.“I wish that their struggle should end soon and they be given their due rights by the Central Government.
