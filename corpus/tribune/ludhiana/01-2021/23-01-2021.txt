From January 27, schools will be opened for classes III and IV and then in the next phase, from February 1, the government schools will start classes for students of first and second standards.A majority of teachers welcomed the move and hoped that in the next two months, students will be in a habit of taking studies seriously. Parveen Kumar, general secretary, Government School Teachers’ Union, said students were in no habit of attending regular studies due to the pandemic.“Online classes were being organised. Students studying in higher classes took these religiously but those studying in primary or middle schools were not that serious. Now, when they will start coming to schools and regular classes will be held, we will be able to get a direct feedback about their performance and within time, we can take corrective measures,” said Parveen Kumar.While many of the parents still feel that the academic session is going to end soon, it would be better if students were promoted to next classes and they were asked to attend schools from next session from April onwards.The teachers have also expressed concerned over the laid back attitude of both the students and parents and they feel by starting classes, students will slowly be brought in routine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/schools-to-open-for-students-of-primary-classes-202339
