We expect that summers, too, will be fruitful. If this trend continues, local industry will be in profit.Talking to The Tribune, Sudershan Jain, president, Knitwear and Apparel Manufacturers’ Association, said owing to the pandemic, the imports from Red Dragon had been hit hard.“During winters, the local garment industry remained in gains because the import of readymade garments from China, Vietnam and Bangladesh was hit. We expect that summers, too, will be fruitful as the situation remains similar and imports are still not that easy. If this trend continues, local industry will be in profits. We get the yarn, thread and other raw material from these countries when there is a dire need but import of garment from these countries has always caused trouble to the local industry,” said Jain.Local garment dealers believe that not only garments but accessories as well were difficult to obtain China, owing to which, innovation on garment — which is done in Mumbai, Coimbatore, and Chennai — has taken a blow and the demand is hit.“The local industry is in gains because of the strict norms imposed by the Union Government. Neither accessories nor garment is coming from China and Vietnam. Moreover, due of increased prices of yarn in the past, the prepared garment has witnessed an increase up to 20 to 30 per cent. Though buyers are buying the product but with an increase in Covid-19 cases in the past few days, the sales are badly hit,” said Vivek Kumar of Nishu Garments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/local-industry-gains-profit-as-covid-hits-garment-imports-230220
