Moreover, this piece of land was under illegal encroachments for the past several years and the Trust was not in a position to deliver physical possession or carry out development work for laying urban infrastructure.The allottee made an appeal for treating the allottees of alternative plots who had paid their dues in 2015-17 separately from other defaulting allottees and all of them be given benefit of three years period for construction from the date of the approval of the allotment of the plots by the government or rather from the date when development works like the construction of roads, streets, water supply and sewerage were carried out. The copies of the representation have also been sent to the director of the Local Bodies, Punjab, chairman and executive officer of the LIT. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/allottees-of-plots-feel-cheated-224005
12-03-2021||Ludhiana||Many risks for people near Dhandari bus stop||The Dhandari bus stop blackspot is not different from other such sites identified in the industrial hub here.Despite efforts to rectify the situation here, many shortcomings need the urgent attention of the authorities.This stop exists on the highway due to which buses stop to take passengers, putting the lives of commuters, pedestrians and cyclists to risk. People also use shortcuts to reach the other end of the road, again risking their lives.As per a police survey, 20 persons have lost their lives at this spot in three years (2016, 2017 and 2018) by getting hit by speeding vehicles. Most of the victims included pedestrians, cyclists and scooter/motorcycle riders.At some sections alongside the Dhandari bus stop, the service lane is not properly constructed. Fences are damaged at several spots and there is no bus way for these vehicles to stop.Due to no under-pass/over-pass near the stop, the public has made several unauthorised cuts to cross the road.There are many factories/mills located on both sides of the road where a large number of labourers are working in two shifts. These labourers do not make the right use of under-pass/over-pass and cross the highway through unauthorised cuts to save their time.There are no blinker lights, speed-breakers, zebra crossing marks and signboards at this point. Also, there is no speed limit board and speed radar.‘Reduce speed limit’“This black spot shows the callousness of the authorities which allows buses to stop on NH-44. Ideally on the highway, there should not be any bus stoppage. On this highway, the speed limit is 90 kmph because of the dense population pedestrians and cyclists become victims of fast-moving traffic. The solution is if we can’t remove this bus stop, we immediately need to cut down the speed in this area to 60 kmph. There should be road markings to depict the accident zone, rumble strips to cut down the speed and 24x7 blinkers,” Dr Kamal Soi, Member, National Road Safety Council, Ministry Of Road Transport and Highways.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/many-risks-for-people-near-dhandari-bus-stop-224006

But this figure is no deterrent factor for the people to stop going on public places, partying or organising functions.Limit of 200 persons for outdoor gathering and 100 persons for indoor gathering is already imposed by the government but people have become careless and started ignoring the precautions and safety protocols, said Civil Surgeon Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar.“Covid is very much here and people should not ignore it and should diligently follow the safety protocols laid down by the government. All people should co-operate in curbing the spread of the virus,” he added further.Late night parties and functions are a regular feature in the industrial city and they continue to be the same despite the pandemic situation.“Late night parties in the clubs and large gatherings at functions are a common sight even today. Just keeping the sanitiser inside and outside the venue does not serve the purpose alone. The organiser should keep in mind the number of people he/she is inviting and the guests should also ensure that only one person or two persons from a family attend the function rather than the entire family. We are still amidst the pandemic and casual approach towards the virus can cost us dearer,” said a senior official from the Health Department.Can impose night curfew: DCLudhiana Deputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said the organisers and invitees of public events must think twice before planning a large gathering.The necessity of an event could be pondered upon before it is organised and invitees should wisely step out of their homes to keep virus under check.“The district administration is keeping a close eye over the situation simmering due to the second wave of the Covid-19. The district administration would be forced to enforce night curfew, if present situation persists for a few days and people don’t follow guidelines,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-sees-four-fold-rise-in-daily-covid-cases-224007

The representation demanded that the state government should include in its notification, the un-aided college teachers’ claim of additionality from 1-1-2016 to 31-3-2019 as specified in notification no.1-712015-U.II(1), Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.Prof Tarun Ghai, spokesperson of AUCT, said if the state government accepts their demand, it will be bringing justice to the thousands of un-aided college teachers by getting them their 50 per cent arrears for 39 months. The arrears which amount in crores will improve the financial position of the state as well.Prof Harjeet Singh, general secretary, AUCT, disclosed that despite the fact that in the state government notifications of 1998 and 2009, there had been a clear mention of the claim of additionality of un-aided college teachers, the colleges were not asked to send the same to the government. He asked the present government to correct the wrongs done by the previous governments for the welfare of the teachers and the higher education in the state.“The claim for arrears of the unaided permanent teaching staff from the government of India would bring crores of rupees to the state and this will boost the state’s economy. The practice to demand arrears both for aided and unaided posts from the Centre had been there in Punjab ever since i.e in the year 1966, 1973 and 1986. It was discontinued in the year 1996 and 2006 by the inconsiderate regime of those times. The existing government has the golden opportunity to rectify the wrongs committed by the previous governments and win the favour of the teaching community which is the back bone of society,” the general secretary added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/auct-seeks-release-of-arrears-224008

Concerned over the issue, one of the steel consumers here Badish Jindal, president, All Industries Trade Forum (AITF), said the bookies and SMS mafia continues to increase and decrease the steel prices on a daily basis.“Sometimes, they increase the prices to Rs 3,000 to 5,000 in few days and when the steel cartel sells the material, they throw away the prices in the same manner, leaving manufacturers in a real difficult situation. This fluctuation is killing the industry in both ways. The industries can not fix the prices of their products. The daily prices change is Rs 1,000 to 2,000 per ton”, rued Jindal. The industrialists maintain that the margins are very low so the manufacturers of bicycle fasteners have to keep changing their prices only daily bases.The issue of fluctuation in steel prices was raised by the FICO earlier too.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bizmen-urge-govt-to-curb-sms-mafia-224010
