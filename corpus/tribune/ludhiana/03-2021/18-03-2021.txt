18-03-2021||Ludhiana||Unauthorised Kailash Nagar cut a deadly point||Among the 10 black spots, the Kailash Nagar cut is also one of the deadly spots which is prone to road mishaps.As per a police survey, as many as 12 persons have lost their lives at the cut in three years (2016, 2017 and 2018) by getting hit by speeding vehicles. Most of these victims include pedestrians, cyclists and two-wheeler riders.During the survey, it was found that the Kailash Nagar cut is an unauthorised one on the national highway. It is around 50-60 ft wide and due to this cut, the movement of traffic on the highway is affected.Fences are damaged at several parts and roads are also uneven at the spot.The level of one side of the road is higher than the other side due to which when commuters try to cross the road from the cut, they speed up vehicles and become victims of road mishaps. Similarly, there is another unauthorised cut at the Sunder Nagar side.There are many small-scale factories/mills located on both sides of the road where a large number of labourers are working in two shifts. The labourers cross the highway through unauthorised cuts and fall prey to road accidents. There are no proper blinkers, speed breakers, zebra crossing markings and signboards at the point.The point also lacks speed limit signboard and speed radar. Drains are broken or blocked at many spots due to which rainwater is not being drained out properly during rainy days.Dr Kamal Soi, member, National Road Safety Council, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, GoI, said: “This black spot is again a clear-cut violation of the highway code for express ways that clearly states that if a U-turn is more than 500 m in urban areas, you are bound to give a pedestrian under pass (PUP) or vehicular under pass (VUP). The unauthorised road cut is created by commuters because of the absence of any of these. Being an highway, vehicles come at a fast speed, killing and seriously injuring pedestrians, cyclists and two-wheeler riders. There is an urgent need of proper lighting and speed management till a PUP or VUP is built to save precious lives on the road.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/unauthorised-kailash-nagar-cut-a-deadly-point-226927

Residents have blamed the civic body for ignoring the unlevelled structures.According to information, the MC had made a few proposals of around Rs 39 lakh to level the manhole slabs in various areas of wards 66, 82 and 90. These proposals were recently presented before the MC’s finance and contract committee.A member of the Ludhiana (West) Grievances Redressal Committee, Satish Thaman, said: “Roads are generally carpeted without removing the old layer. Thus, manholes get more and more unlevelled after road carpeting work. It poses a risk to vehicles, especially two-wheelers. The MC should take the matter seriously to avert mishaps.”RK Yadav, a resident of Laxman Nagar in Giaspura, said: “There are many uneven manholes on the 33-foot road and other areas. The MC must pay special attention and make sure that the level of the manholes should be corrected.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/uneven-manholes-open-invitation-to-accidents-226933

The strike has been called by the All India Insurance Employees’ Association (AIIEA), Federation of LIC Class-1 Officers Association, National Federation of Insurance Field workers of India (NFIFWI). All associations are opposing the proposals as these are not in the interest of the insurance industry, the economy and the people.‘No justification for IPO’The LIC has been very successful in meeting its objectives. The disinvestment in the LIC is the first step towards privatisation. Therefore, LIC’s IPO violates the very objectives of its creation.The AIIEA has met over 450 MPs to inform them of the inherent dangers to the national economy. The AIIEA requests the people to support the strike on March 18 and support the campaign.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/lic-employees-strike-today-226934

FICO members also demanded the provision of one-time settlement for PSIEC plot holders.During the meeting, FICO delegates reminded the OSD and PSIEC chairman that six years ago, PSIEC had issued a notice of Rs 249 per square yard to the Focal Point Phase VIII allottees, which was finally settled at Rs 24 per square yard.Expressing their concern, FICO members said the PSIEC again had issued notices and demanded Rs 474 per square yard from the allottees despite already being given 100 per cent anticipatory enhancement.“Now with inclusions of interest and other charges, the cost has reached around Rs 830 per square yard, which is completely unjustified and unviable. Further, owing to the PSIEC enhancement pendency, the industry situated in Phase VIII is suffering a lot all bank-related work is on a hold and the growth of the industry is stagnant as well,” said Gurmeet Singh Kular, president, FICO. Industrialists were not being able to adapt to the ‘Invest Punjab’ policy of the government owing to these reason, the delegation added.Kular demanded immediate withdrawal of the notices issued to save the industry. He said the industry was bearing the brunt of the pandemic and the fluctuating prices of steel. In times like these, the government should come forward and support the industry rather than burdening it with more costs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/notices-to-psiec-plot-holders-industrialists-meet-cms-osd-226938

We don’t know if anyone else caught the infection or not but we are tensed. The teacher must have come in contact of several others”, said a worried teacher.Condemning the policies adopted by the department, Sukhdarshan Singh, a teacher at a government school, said the Education Department was taking the exam of even primary class students, whose number are in lakhs.“If we can hold exams for them, why are we delaying the board exams till May-June, when the summers will be at their peak? There will be no generators in case of power cuts, secondly, students will be occupied till June whereas in routine, they relax in summer break after taking the exams. There was no point to hold them back for so long especially when they are not attending the regular classes either”, rued the teacher.The teachers said cases are increasing and instead of conducting exams timely, the department had delayed the whole schedule. One could feel that cases will see further increase in time to come.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/govt-teachers-worried-over-rising-cases-in-schools-rue-education-depts-apathy-226939

Wrong identification of insects and the amount incurred on insecticides to control these insects will lead to heavy economic loss to the farmers. “Keeping record about life cycle of the harmful insects is the first step for their effective management which requires important information regarding appearance of particular insects and their numbers. This record keeping will help the farmers to effectively plan and manage the target insect in the coming years. Insect attack on the crop depends upon crop variety, crop cultivation practices and climatic conditions of that place,” said Dr Harmeet Kaur, Assistant Professor, Plant Protection, KVK, SAS Nagar (Mohali).Today’s need is not to kill the insects with harmful chemicals but to manage them with wisdom and common sense by keeping them below economic threshold level to get good crop yield along with healthy environment, she said.Follow these steps||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/manage-insects-for-improved-crop-yield-say-agri-experts-226940
