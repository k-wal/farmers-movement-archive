The accused leader Satish Nagar, who remained in police custody till late night, was released, citing his pending role verification in the smuggling network. This is despite the fact that he was made the main accused in the FIR.Today, Anoop was produced in the court and his five-day police remand was taken for interrogation.Initially, the police said the former councillor was running a drugs network and was listed as the main accused in the FIR, but now the police took a U-turn in the case, saying the BJP leader’s role was yet to be verified.ADCP Pragya Jain said Anoop and his two aides were running the smugging network and further probe was on to bust the entire supply line.When the Police Commissioner was asked the reason for releasing the BJP leader from custody, the CP said the FIR was registered on the basis of the preliminary information and the role of Satish Nagar was being scanned to know if he had any links with the recovery of the large haul of drugs.“The police cannot implicate any wrong person in a drugs case and, similarly, the police cannot let any smuggler go scot-free. The role of Satish is being verified and if there is any proof of his link with the recovery of the drugs, the police will pursue the matter.

Aggravating the matter, the thalassemia OPD was also lying shut at the Civil Hospital today.Sukrit, a thalassemia patient, said although there was the OPD at the hospital, it was lying closed. Left with no option, they had to go to a private hospital and spend a lot of money for blood transfusion and consultation.“Both me and my brother are thalassaemic and need blood transfusion every month. At government hospitals, it is done free of cost, but since the thalassemia OPD at the Civil Hospital is shut today, the patients will have to go to private hospitals. A minimum of Rs3000 is spent on one patient and in case the doctor prescribes tests, that costs extra money,” he said.The patients have to be on medication regularly and for the past one month, a couple of medicines are also not available at the hospital and it is proving troublesome for the patients.“Now not only for treatment, we have to spend a huge amount on medicines as well, while the government is giving treatment free of cost. Tablet defrijet and tablet kefler are not coming for the past one month and today when we reached the hospital, we were told that tablet kelfer had arrived, while the other medicine was still not available,” said another thalassaemia patient, Tanya Bajaj.She said the medicines of other brands were available, but the patients were having health issues with that medicine and they needed medicine from a specific company only.“We are paying for medicines from our own pocket. A single strip costs Rs420 and in addition, the cost of the blood transfusion is also borne by us when the OPD is closed. The government claims to provide free treatment and medicines to these patients, but the reality is opposite,” said Manpreet Singh, a patient.“Today when we met the senior medical officer of the Civil Hospital in this regard, she told us to take medicines from other company, while about the thalassaemia ward, she said there was no staff and due to Covid, the OPD was lying shut,” added Manpreet.At this, the thalassemia patients got together and protested at the Civil Hospital in this regard.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/thalassaemia-patients-protest-unavailability-of-medicines-219866
