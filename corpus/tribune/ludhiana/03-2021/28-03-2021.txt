The number of camps is being increased to meet the demand for the vaccine.”Earlier, people were shying away from receiving the jab, but now with vaccine being administered near their homes, they welcomed the move and coming out in large numbers, after seeing each other to get themselves vaccinated, Sharma added.Under the “vaccine at doorsteps” initiative of the district administration, there was no need to go and stand in a queue at the vaccination centre as the health teams would visit particular area/factory/village/residential society or private or commercial establishments after receiving call from the said area councillor, village sarpanch, or prominent person from the locality concerned and hold the vaccination camp in their vicinity, Sharma said.The Deputy Commissioner disclosed that the district administration would send health teams to vaccinate all eligible persons at all places after receiving a call. Urging the people to shun hesitance and embrace the vaccine, Sharma stressed, “Scientists have left no stone unturned to develop the vaccine. The public should accept it as social responsibility towards the nation and get themselves vaccinated at the earliest to save precious lives from the pandemic.”When there was no vaccine, people were dying in large numbers and praying for vaccine and now when it was here, they must come forward to get a jab to win the war against the pandemic, Sharma added.Soliciting wholehearted support of the people, area councillor Mamta Sharma, while inaugurating another such camp at Housing Board Colony in Randhir Singh Nagar, said this was the best system for people as instead of standing in a queue and wasting time, health teams would vaccinate them at their doorsteps. She congratulated fellow councillor Seema Kapoor and local leader Sunil Kapoor for making efforts to organise camp.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/2-vaccination-camps-held-in-ludhiana-231622
