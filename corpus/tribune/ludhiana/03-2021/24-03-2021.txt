24-03-2021||Manav Mander||Ludhiana battles tuberculosis amid surge in Covid cases||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, March 23Every year, World Tuberculosis Day is observed on March 24 to raise public awareness on the causes and effects of the disease. The theme for 2021 is ‘The Clock is Ticking’.The theme is representative of the time frame set to eradicate TB by 2025.Ludhiana alone, at present, has approximately 12,000 active TB cases.Common Symptoms“Fewer cases were detected in 2020 but in January, February and March 2021 alone, the district has witnessed nearly 1,100 to 1,200 fresh cases,” District TB officer Dr Ashish Chawla said.During a TB screening drive in December last year, a total of 36 new cases were diagnosed. All cases were from urban areas.Dr Chawla said the reason behind more cases from urban areas was a large influx of migrants in the urban areas, and poor working and living conditions in the water-tight compartments.“The lifestyle of the urban population is such and they do not pay much attention to the warning signs, owing to which, more cases are detected from urban areas. As much as 80 per cent of these cases are of pulmonary TB,” he added.“For a layman, the word TB is a problem related to prolong cough but in reality, it is one of the devastating diseases which can infect a human from head to toe. Talking on the lines of neurosurgery, TB is one of the most common infections of brain and spine in underdeveloped and developing countries. It is extremely common in Punjab,” said Dr Dipesh Batra, neuro and spine surgeon.“Although brain TB can produce any kind of symptoms, and sometimes symptoms are very mild and subtle, this can lead to delay in detection as routine blood tests fail to detect it. Only a battery of advanced tests can diagnose it,” Dr Batra added.Delay in detection, poor compliance to treatment, under treatment, socio-economic status, society’s attitude etc are the major factors leading to multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB.In order to reduce burden of drug resistance, strategies of controlling MDR-TB should emphasise multi-sectorial actions, addressing health care and social needs of TB patients, added Dr Batra.“The emergence of drug-resistant TB, including MDR-TB, and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is a major public health threat,” Dr Batra said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-battles-tuberculosis-amid-surge-in-covid-cases-229794

The deceased was identified as Rajinder Singh Jinder (49) of Rokon Patti of Barudi village.Investigations revealed that some unknown miscreants, armed with sharp edged weapons, had brutally killed Jinder on his way to his dairy situated on the outskirts of the village.Since no eyewitness has come forward, circumstantial evidence suggests that the assailants were hiding near a religious place.

In such cases, when the police contact the person mentioned as owner in the registration records, he refuses to claim the vehicle and in the process, tracing the actual owner/ end user becomes difficult for the police authorities, leaving the vehicle to rust as unclaimed in the police station,” he revealed.The CP said the data of about 1,500 vehicles lying in various police stations of Ludhiana have already been entered in the app. Agrawal informed that the public can search their vehicle by registration number, engine number or chassis number. The app can be downloaded for android phones from Google Play Store.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/a-first-app-to-find-stolen-lost-vehicles-in-punjab-229790

As per the bylaws, for the opening of a fuel station, the road width should be at least 60 foot.”He claimed that these roads were less than 30 foot in width and fuel stations on such roads were against the byelaws.“The width of both Tibba Road and Noorwala Road is less than 30 foot. As per the byelaws, for opening of a fuel station, road width should be at least 60 foot wide,” said Talwar.“The NOCs have been given for opening of fuel stations in violation of the norms.

There are times when a person comes in contact with the virus but doesn’t develop any symptoms, he becomes more dangerous for society as he unknowingly spreads the infection. To avoid this, and for early diagnosis, people should come forward for sampling,” said Dr Kakkar.The awareness team comprising Mass Media Officer and Block Extension Educators is also making the rounds of city in a special IEC van fitted with public address system to spread the message.Block Extension Educator Rajinder Singh said, “Sampling teams have been deployed at various points throughout the city. Police personnel are also being deployed with the team to facilitate sample collection.”“The government has made strict rules for the people not following the Covid norms, and to avoid any heavy fines, people should always wear a mask.
