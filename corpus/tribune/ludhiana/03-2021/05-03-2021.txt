Among those who are employed, a higher percentage of people with hearing loss are in the lower grades of employment compared with the general workforce.Good hearing and communication are important at all stages of life. Hearing loss and related ear diseases can be avoided through preventative actions such as protection against loud sounds, good ear care practices and immunisation.“Hearing loss can be addressed when it is identified in a timely manner and appropriate care sought.
