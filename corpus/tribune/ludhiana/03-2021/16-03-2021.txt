For the convenience of many schools, where classrooms do not have a proper ventilation system, the Education Department is conducting examinations in morning and evening shifts for various classes.Before entering the examination hall, students’ hands were sanitised and were asked not to remove their mask during the course of the examination.A teacher at a government school here, on the condition of anonymity, said the invigilators were not too strict with the students as they had attended online classes for the session. “Students have lost confidence in appearing for exams.
