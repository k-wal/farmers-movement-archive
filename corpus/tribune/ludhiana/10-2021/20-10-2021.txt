It is known to be one of the most common cancers among the women.Addressing the audience during a programme organised by a private hospital to mark ‘Breast Cancer Awareness Month’, Dr Batta recommended annual mammography screening for above 40-year-old women. “It is currently the best available method to detect breast cancer,” he said.Breast cancer survivors also participated in the event and shared their journey and experience right from the diagnosis till treatment.Minakshi Sharma, Deputy Director, District Bureau of Employment and Enterprises, Ludhiana, was the chief guest for the event.“About 90 per cent of patients survive when breast cancer is detected at an early stage. Thus it is important for women to self-examine their breasts regularly and consult a doctor if they notice any change. Young females should also be educated about breast cancer,” said Dr Batta.Some common symptoms of breast cancer are painless lump in the breast or armpit, change in breast shape, dimpling in breast skin, abnormal nipple discharge and nipple retraction or ulceration, he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/early-diagnosis-key-to-treat-breast-cancer-doctor-326753

Additional Superintending Engineer Amandeep Singh Khangura was the keynote speaker.SDO Harpreet Singh Deol, convener of the event, informed that a group of students from the town and surrounding villages volunteered to act as ambassadors for the movement launched by local office of the PSPCL for persuading people to help the government in combating the ensuing power crisis by minimising wastage of electricity.The speakers argued that students could play an important role in cutting down power bills of their homes, family establishments and schools by checking wastage of electricity, thus strengthening economic condition of their parents and alma matter.“Once you decide to check wastage of electricity by stopping unnecessary use of electric devices and gadgets, you become an earner as the money saved is also money earned,” said Khangura, maintaining that conservation of electricity was also a service to society and nation.The speakers stressed the need for conserving electricity in view of the increased demand due to rise in number of industrial units, commercial organisations and reckless use of appliances and devices.They exhorted students to lead by example.Use of energy star certified devices with higher efficacy, alternative sources of energy like sunlight, replacement of traditional lamps with LEDs and optimum use of electric fans, air conditioners and refrigerators were cited as common means to conserve electricity.Divya Sharma, Khushi and Harshita Jain were felicitated for achieving top positions in the declamation contest held on the subject.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/students-pledge-to-act-as-ambassadors-for-power-conservation-326755

However, a meeting is going on and there is no agenda. Neither the trustees appointed by the government nor the LIT officials know about the agenda,” claimed a BJP activist.The protesters ridiculed Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi for his silence over the gross “misdeeds” of the LIT chairperson, Raman Balasubramanium. It points towards tacit support to financial irregularities and corrupt practices of the LIT functionaries, they said.“On one hand the Chief Minister makes claims about honesty and transparency while on the other, the LIT chairperson blatantly refuses to share the information with the public or the media. This indicates that the chairperson has something to hide and he is not working in the best interest of the public and the institution,” said Lucky Chopra.The protesting BJP activists also claimed that efforts were underway, albeit behind the curtain, to restore the possession of 3.79 acre commercial land in Model Town Extension even after the e-auction had been cancelled by the government and the matter was in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bjp-protests-irregularities-in-lit-functioning-alleges-favouritism-326756

The questions are being raised over the role of the departments concerned for delaying the shifting of such poles.A road safety activist, Rahul Verma, said the work to shift the electricity towers is being delayed on Ferozepur Road even when the shifting charges were deposited to Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) by the department concerned more than a year ago. “Such towers are open invitations to fatal mishaps. These should be shifted at the earliest to ensure the safety of the commuters,” he added.Verma also questioned the delay in shifting of electricity poles from Malhar Road where he said the poles are causing mishaps.The electricity poles were earlier located in the central verge area but these are now on road after reduction in the width of the central verge.A shopkeeper on Malhar Road said, “The smart street project is underway and after reduction of the centre verge, the electricity poles on-road portion are posing threat to the commuters.
