Gosha said the heinous crime against peacefully protesting farmers is in fact a crime against humanity which has created widespread resentment among all sections of people.He said for more than a year, farmers have been protesting at Delhi borders against the farm-related Acts of the Modi Government. But rather than dispensation of justice to them, the peacefully protesting farmers are being run over under the vehicles of BJP leaders and also being targeted by repressive BJP governments at the Centre and in the state of Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-farmers-protest-killings-in-lakhimpur-kheri-320166

The stretch was earlier dug up for installation of storm water drainage pipes but the MC failed to reconstruct it till date.The shopkeepers said mishaps are common on the stretch as the civic body turned a blind eye towards the situation. During the rainy season, the stretch had caved in at different points and some vehicles had got stuck there too.Bittu Gumber, president of a shopkeepers’ association, said, “The shopkeepers and commuters are a harried lot due to bad condition of the road. Thus, we staged a protest today. We have also submitted a memorandum to the MC’s Zonal Commissioner Jasdev Singh Sekhon who has assured us that road re-carpeting work would be started very soon.”Another shopkeeper said, “The situation is too bad on the stretch that has not been even levelled properly.

||Star Road Lohara cries for repair||Tribune News Service Ludhiana, October 4 The badly broken roads across the city are haunting the commuters. One such dilapidated Star Road Lohara has also been crying for attention of the civic body for a long time. It is difficult to drive vehicles on the potholed stretch of the Star Road that connects the Giaspura, Shimlapuri and other areas. The road falls under the Municipal Corporation’s jurisdiction but the safety of commuters is being ignored as nothing has been done to get the potholes filled. A resident said, “Public face a lot of inconveniences these days as the bad condition of the road is continuously being ignored. The potholes remain filled with rainwater during the rainy days. It is very risky to drive a two-wheeler on the stretch with big potholes. Even no step has been taken to repair these potholes on a temporary basis. The civic body must pay attention to get the road re-carpeted at the earliest.” Rajinderpal Kaur Chhina, AAP leader, said, “The Star Road stretch is badly broken and it is giving an open invitation to mishaps. Not only this road, but also many other roads in the Ludhiana (South) constituency have been in a shambles for a long period. Even some of the roads that were re-carpeted recently have started breaking within a short period. The public money should not go waste. The civic body must ensure good quality roads in the area.” On behalf of Ward 33 councillor Sunita Rani, her husband Satpal Singh Lohara said the Star Road has got damaged due to heavy rains this year. He said tenders have been floated for the re-carpeting of the road. It is expected that the road work would be done later this month, he added. Despite repeated attempts, the MC’s executive engineer (B&R Branch), Rakesh Singla could not be contacted for a comment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/star-road-lohara-cries-for-repair-320170

05-10-2021||Shivani Bhakoo||Sans subject teachers, science students of Ludhiana govt schools suffer||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, October 4It seems the entire Education Department has pulled up socks to show the “best” in the National Achievement Survey (NAS). May be this is the reason that the plight of students, in the middle of the session, is not being realised by the department.There are many schools in the district in which till date subject teachers have not taken classes. This has compelled a few students in senior classes to change their stream as they are worried about their future.In February this year, commerce and science streams were offered to students in a few government schools. Many schools are facing difficulties in absence of proper subject teachers for commerce and science streams.One of the Principals of a school, on condition of anonymity shared, “Either there are no teachers or there are no students in many schools. The department is going ahead with the rationalising policy, which is being done for last many years. Not providing teachers is a failure on part of the government.”“Why should students suffer because of the lackadaisical approach of the department? In the middle of the session, they are changing their streams in panic,” the Principal added.In many schools, students are bound to change streams because of unavailability of teachers. “We are putting in our entire energy on getting good results in the NAS. We don’t have to prove ourselves at the national level that we are the best. If we are the best, it will come out through students shining in all tests and assignments. How can we expect students to shine when we are not providing them ample teachers,” said another lecturer of a government senior secondary school.Meanwhile, the department media in-charge, Dr Devinder Chinna, said many teachers had been promoted in the district recently. They would be able to take classes, he added. “The department is rationalising everything. Things will be better in the near future. Teachers will be available for students,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/sans-subject-teachers-science-students-of-ludhiana-govt-schools-suffer-320172

05-10-2021||---||Issue advisory on ‘bad air’ days, citizens’ body writes to Punjab Deputy Chief Minister, OP Soni||Ludhiana, October 4Members of Clean Air Punjab, a citizens’ collective of individuals and organisations concerned working on the issue of air pollution, have written to the Punjab Deputy Chief Minister, OP Soni, who also heads the Health Ministry, urging him to lead by example by taking up the issue of air pollution prominently.The demand made by citizens, primarily mirrored their right to clean air and the right to breathe, underlining the reality that Punjab was home to some of India’s most polluted towns, including Ludhiana, Khanna, Mandi Gobindgarh, Amritsar, Jalandhar, and Patiala.To make sure people stay alert about deteriorating air quality, Clean Air Punjab has also urged the Health Minister to direct all the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to mandatorily issue timely health advisories publicly on ‘bad air’ days, which will help save vulnerable groups from severe health impacts of air pollution.Punjab has a total of nine non-attainment/million-plus cities under the National Clean Air Action Plan (NCAP). A non-attainment city is one that does not meet the prescribed air quality standards set by the Union Environment Ministry.Supreet Kaur, president of EcoSikh, said, “The issue of air pollution is just not limited to the Environment Ministry and it’s time for the Health Ministry to step in as well. It’s a well-known fact that air pollution poses severe risks to health. Recently, a first pan-India study conducted by scientists in India found that areas with poor air quality and higher emissions of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 are more likely to have Covid infections and related deaths.”“The menace of air pollution can only be tackled by coordinated efforts of all stakeholders. The government being the apex body to frame policy guidelines and ensuring its successful implementation must pay attention to the issue of air pollution,” she added.Ranjit Powar, member of Clean Air Punjab, said, “Clean air is crucial to health and performance. Each of us has a right to clean air and also an obligation to work for keeping the air clean. Most of all, the government, as the policymaker and regulating authority for keeping the environment pollution free, must own its responsibility to harness sources of air pollution.”“What will people do with higher incomes and material progress that might come through the smoke-belching industry and units that diffuse poisonous gasses for miles around, choking their lungs and poisoning their innards? Let us safeguard our air and life,” he added.The recent Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) released by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) for 2019 revealed that air pollution was likely to reduce the life expectancy of about 40 per cent of citizens by more than nine years.“With over 4.2 million deaths per year, ambient air pollution continues to be the ninth leading cause of cardiopulmonary deaths in the world. In India, indoor air pollution also poses a threat accounting for over two million deaths, 44 per cent due to pneumonia, 54 per cent due to COPD and two per cent due to lung cancer. Children, adolescents, women and elderly are the vulnerable group for respiratory morbidity and mortality,” said Dr Zafar Ahmad, senior consultant, Department of Pulmonology, Sleep and Critical Care Medicine, Fortis Hospital.Even during the lockdown under the second wave, when most industries were shut and movement halted, Ludhiana noted an average air quality index (AQI) of 135 whereas the good AQI is 0-50 and moderate is 51- 100.Even Fazilka and Ropar, which were considered some of the greener regions in Punjab, noted an average AQI of 113 and 129, respectively. This alarming data focuses on the immediate need for an intervention and promoting actions to reduce the prevalent severe air pollution.The air quality in Punjab continues to get worse. Air pollution accounts for almost one in 10 deaths in children under five years of age. It makes children vulnerable to the risk of chronic lung and cardiovascular disease, cystic fibrosis and increases the chances of hospitalisation and ICU admissions.The WHO estimates that in 2016, six lakh children died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air. These children were innocent bystander victims of the public’s misadventures.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/issue-advisory-on-bad-air-days-citizens-body-writes-to-punjab-deputy-chief-minister-op-soni-320175
