He said the burning of stubble poses a danger to the environment and must be avoided at every cost. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/vans-to-spread-awareness-on-stubble-burning-in-ludhiana-districts-318914

They said though no private colony (like Inder Nagar) could have direct access with the approved government colony (BRS Nagar), which was the town planning scheme of the LIT, the trust Chairman had got an illegal road constructed, connecting the private colony (Inder Nagar) with the BRS Nagar Colony.They have demanded a Vigilance inquiry to bring out all facts and at the same time registration of an FIR against the LIT Chairman for misuse of the property (of LIT) of which he was supposedly a custodian in the official capacity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-improvement-trust-chairman-charged-with-encroachment-upon-park-318915

The main Focal Point road (that connects Chandigarh Road and Dhandari Khurd area) is in a shambles for a long time.As the authorities concerned turned a blind eye towards the problems being faced by the commuters, big potholes are causing mishaps. Around 100-metre stretch of the main road (from Jeevan Nagar towards Dhandari Khurd) remains completely blocked due to dumping of a huge amount of garbage on the road. The situation turned worse in the rainy season.Raju, a factory worker, said, “As the garbage dump has blocked a stretch on one side of the double road, we are generally forced to pass through the wrong side. Many of the factory workers suffer due to the garbage dump and badly broken road. Sometimes, bike riders meet with mishaps on the broken stretch of the Focal Point road. We want the government must direct the authorities concerned to reconstruct the road. And, the garbage dump should be removed at the earliest.”Badish Jindal, president of the Federation of Punjab Small Industries Associations (FOPSIA), said, “The dilapidated condition of the roads in Focal Point and other industrial areas is continuously being ignored here. There is no proper drainage system due to which water remains accumulated on the roads. A huge amount of taxes are paid by the industries but there is no development in the Focal Point areas. The elected representatives generally ignore the industrial areas as they don’t have any vote bank in such areas.”“We demand from the government to spend at least 50 per cent of the tax amount collected from the industries on the development of industrial areas. There should be no political interference,” he said.Gurpreet Gogi, Chairman, Punjab Small Industries & Export Corporation (PSIEC), said the broken road would be reconstructed at the earliest. He, however, blamed the MC for the garbage dump. “The MC is responsible for the dumping of the garbage on Focal Point Road. The civic body must remove the dump,” Gogi said.Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said the MC would take required steps to remove the garbage dump from Focal Point Road.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/garbage-dump-blocks-stretch-on-main-focal-point-road-in-ludhiana-318920
