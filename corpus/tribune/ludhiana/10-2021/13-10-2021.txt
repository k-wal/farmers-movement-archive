He, however, asserted that the ward being extremely underdeveloped is being ignored for allotment of funds for development works and delivery of basic amenities.Superintending Engineer (O&M), MC, Rajinder Singh said a couple of dyeing units located in the area are permitted to discharge their effluents into sewer lines and the problem of overflowing of sewer lines is due to a snag in pumping motors used for drainage of waste water to treatment plant.“This is a temporary problem which is being taken care of and the situation would improve in the next couple of days. Besides, the common effluent treatment plant (CETP), being installed by dyeing units, is also expected to become operational in about a fortnight and the problem of overflowing sewers and toxic waste would be permanently solved,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/dhandari-khurd-residents-protest-overflowing-waste-from-sewers-323924

At present there are 34 dengue patients admitted to hospitals, while 311 have been discharged so far. Out of the total cases, 269 belong to urban areas and the remaining are from the periphery areas of the district.According to experts, people should not get panicky as 90 per cent cases do not require hospitalisation and also suggest some plants that help in keeping mosquitoes away.Prof Mary John from Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) said when platelets of any patient drop below 50,000, coupled with high fever, bleeding, vomiting, dizziness, black stool, severe headache, pain behind the eyes and muscles, one should get immediately admitted to hospital. He said these are the basic warning signs and one must not ignore these symptoms.“Unnecessary panic among people leads to overcrowding in hospitals. The patients must not indulge in self-medication or those having mild fever can take a simple crocin tablet along with ample quantity of fluids and water for a few days at home. In addition to this, strips of wet cloth can also be put on the forehead of a person having fever,” said Assistant Civil Surgeon Dr Vivek Kataria.Specialist doctors said platelet transfusion should be given only when platelet count is below 10,000 and there is active bleeding or other complications.They stated that dengue is transmitted by the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito which usually targets in the daytime.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/dengue-case-count-reaches-345-in-ludhiana-323926

Parents should use two-wheelers to avoid traffic congestion. “Everyday parents park their vehicles outside our shops and houses and when we stop them, they indulge in arguments with us. We are paying the price of having our shop and house near schools,” says a shopkeeper and a house owner.Serpentine queues of vehicles were seen during a visit to some schools in the opening and closing hours.There was a traffic chaos outside BCM School, Shastri Nagar, Sacred Heart Convent School, Sarabha Nagar, Guru Nanak Public School, Sarabha Nagar, Bal Bharti School, Dugri, DAV School, BRS Nagar, etc.At most of the schools, no major presence of traffic police personnel was seen, parents were seen crawling through the jam-packed roads. Some schools deployed their employees to manage the traffic mess but their minimal number is not able to ease out the traffic.“This afternoon when I came to pick my child from BCM School in my car, I got stuck in a long traffic jam. I started from the school at 1 pm and reached my house near the Sangam Palace chowk in Haibowal at around 2 pm. Firstly, I got stuck outside the school, then I faced another traffic jam on the Malhar road. I took an hour to cover the 7-kilometre distance due to the traffic jams,” says Monu Kapoor, a parent.Another parent Raman Chawla said schools should have necessary parking arrangements to cope with the rush of parents. Parents park their vehicles in an haphazard manner which causes traffic congestion due to lack of parking space.Traffic police are also not deploying police personnel to manage the traffic rush.Traffic policeman, parent exchange argumentsWhen a traffic policeman rudely asked a man to pay heed to the traffic rules during a traffic jam outside BCM School on Tuesday afternoon, the parent felt humiliated and started exchanging arguments.‘Schools should deploy marshals to man traffic’Rahul Verma, a member of the Punjab Road Safety Council, told The Tribune that schools should deploy marshals to man traffic during opening and closing hours. Schools are also not allowing parents to bring their vehicles inside the institutions due to which parents park vehicles haphazardly on roads which leads to traffic jam.“If we will resort to wrong parking outside schools, what lessons we are teaching to our children as they will also follow us. I believe if parents will stop bringing their wards in their private vehicles and make use of school buses, traffic congestion can be checked outside schools,” Verma said.Police Commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar after joining the Ludhiana police had also stated that checking traffic congestion was one of his priorities in Ludhiana.“We will definitely develop some mechanism to sort out the traffic issue outside schools,” Bhullar said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/traffic-goes-haywire-outside-private-schools-in-ludhiana-city-323927

Last year at Daresi, only a 30-feet effigy was prepared and burnt among a few people.Like every year, Ali Asgar had come from Agra to prepare effigies of Ravana. He has managed to get five-six more orders from the city. Giving the message of communal harmony and brotherhood, it has been 29 years since Asgar had been coming to the city to prepare the effigies.“This year will go off better. Last year, the pandemic had casted its effect on the celebrations and there were hardly any events. This year, I managed to get seven-eight orders. Though before the pandemic, we used to get nearly 30-35 orders,” he said.Dasehra at the Daresi ground is the main attraction not only for city residents but also from people from periphery areas, who also visit the place for the celebrations.“Daresi will have the highest effigy at 100 feet and we are waiting for the final day,” Asgar said.Another effigy maker at Dugri was also excited for the festival. “Last year there were no celebrations and this time, Dashera will be celebrated. “I am preparing the effigy for the Dugri ground and two more places,” he said.Children who had to give Dashera amiss last year are all geared up for the festival this year.“Dashera is my favourite festival and last year since there were no celebrations we had made a small effigy at home but this year we will be going to the Dashera ground to see the effigy go up in flames,” said 10-year-old Rudra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/100-ft-ravana-effigy-to-go-up-in-flames-at-daresi-ground-in-ludhiana-323928

The city also has the advantage of being at the geographical centre of the state.The Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) had acquired land measuring 161.28 acres, including 135.54 acres for airport and 25.74 acres for future development.While the work on the construction of 3-meter-high with 660-mm thick punch tape concertina and barbed wire fencing has been completed by the PWD (B&R) at Rs 301.16 lakh provided by GLADA, the widening and strengthening of the existing 5.1-km link road from Aitiana village to the international airport from the existing 10-feet to 18-feet width has been completed by the Punjab Mandi Board at Rs 8.17 crore. The work also included the construction of two bridges, each of 8-meter span, on the Halwara drain.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/deadline-nears-construction-of-halwara-airport-interim-terminal-yet-to-begin-323931
