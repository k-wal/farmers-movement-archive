More than 50 cases are being reported daily in the district. Amidst such a situation, the apheresis machine at the Civil Hospital is lying defunct.The apheresis machine separates blood received from donors into its various components like plasma, platelets and white and red blood cells.One dies of ‘dengue’, 51 new cases in districtThe report of 51 patients came positive for dengue here on Friday. Now, the total count of dengue cases from the district is 631. A patient undergoing treatment at the DMCH is suspected to have died due to dengue on Friday. The patient was a resident of Civil Lines. Till now, four patients have succumbed to dengue. Of total 631 dengue patients, 510 belong to urban and 121 to rural areas.If the blood bank of the Civil Hospital has enough stock of blood units then random donor platelets can be prepared and given to patients. If the stock is not there then patients are left with no other option, but to go to private hospitals and get single donor platelets.Random donor platelets are prepared from donated blood within four to six hours of collection. Single donor platelets are obtained from one donor and prepared by an apheresis machine.The machine bought for Rs42 lakh 10 years ago is not in the working condition from the past four years. Patients are now paying double the price for platelets at private hospitals.Blood Transfusion Officer of the Civil Hospital, Dr Gurinderdeep Singh Grewal, said, “The machine needs regular servicing. It is not functional at present.”“We give patients random donor platelets if available. Patients coming to us are those, who cannot afford costly treatment. In case the need for apheresis machine arises, a patient first will have to arrange a donor and pay Rs9,000 as processing charges, which many are generally unable to afford. The OPD and blood are given free of cost to patients,” said Dr Grewal.“The kits used for processing keep lying unused. We have to return them as they are of no use for us. We have been returning kits in the past too,” Dr Grewal added.A family of a patient admitted to the Civil Hospital, who needed blood platelets, said random donor platelets were not available and neither the facility for single donor platelets. “So, we shifted our patient to a private hospital,” the family added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/dengue-patients-suffer-as-ludhiana-civil-hospital-apheresis-machine-lies-defunct-328479

23-10-2021||---||Punjab Govt aggravating realty sector crisis, allege colonisers||Our CorrespondentLudhiana, October 22In the wake of deep crisis facing the real estate sector in the state, colonisers have charged the Congress government in Punjab, led by Charanjit Singh Channi, with further aggravating the grave situation by stopping registration of sale deeds and refusal of new electricity connections for regularised plots and properties in unauthorised colonies.Addressing a news conference here today, the Punjab Colonisers and Property Dealers Association president, GS Lamba, announced that if the government failed to come to the rescue of realtors without any further delay, all colonisers and property developers would handover keys of their establishments to the Chief Minister after Diwali to mark ‘mass protest’.Elaborating on the issues faced by developers, Lamba alleged that the bureaucracy had misguided the state government about observations of the Punjab and Haryana High Court with regard to a civil write petition for stopping registration of sale deeds and grant of new electricity connections.As a result, the crisis-ridden colonisers across the state had been betrayed because the entire business, which had already suffered due to the Covid-induced lockdown, had come to a complete halt.Ridiculing certain recent decisions of the Punjab Government, he said on one side those residing inside ‘lal lakeer’ in the rural areas were being given ownership rights of their lands and relief in pending electricity bills and on the other hand thousands of owners of residential and commercial properties, who had paid composition fee and got their properties regularised, were not being given ‘no objection certificates’ (NOCs) to get their sale deeds registered.Similarly, plot owners were being discriminated when it came to releasing new electricity connections, Lamba added.Even after four and half years of the Congress rule in the state, not even a single poll promises made with developers had been fulfilled, said Lamba. This is despite the fact that aggrieved colonisers had knocked at all possible doors, Lamba added.Others present on the occasion were Darshan Lal Laddu, Jagdish Jagga, Deepak Badyal, Ankur Singla, Jashanpreet Singh Chawla, Sham Verma, Amritpal Jand and Mani Haibowal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/punjab-govt-aggravating-realty-sector-crisis-allege-colonisers-328482

These cracks are posing a major threat to commuters’ as the ROB connects number of villages, besides being a major stretch of the town. Such cracks and that too on the road used by heavy vehicles can play havoc with lives of commuters.The ROB was made user friendly in 2015. It’s now almost every year that the gap between expansion joints widens to such an extent that the flyover has to be closed for repairs for more than a fortnight.Till date, the administration has failed to address recurring problem. Moreover, officials are oblivious of the suffering of commuters when they are forced to use an alternate broken and potholed road with the closure of the ROB for repairs time and again.“Even a layman can understand that the ROB is not able bear load of heavy vehicles. These vehicles carry load more than ROBs capacity, which leads to breaking of expansion joints time and again. Sadly enough, none is able to ban the entry and exit of heavy vehicles on this route. Moreover, if such vehicles keep on hammering into the gap every now and then it will surely affect the life of the bridge,” shared Navdeep Kaur, a teacher in a local school, who uses the ROB regularly.“This is for the fourth time that the problem has arisen, which was rectified just nine months ago. If problem continues to recur, it can result in a major tragedy. At night the problem gets aggravated,” shared another commuter of Kohara village, who has to cross the ROB twice in the day.Manjinder Singh Bhola, councillor of Ward No. 2 of Sahnewal, rued that the major gap could prove a death knell for any commuter. “Major gap surfacing on the overcrowded ROB time and again is a mockery of the system. The irony of the situation is that we are forced to survive in such a corrupt set up where there is simply no authenticity of construction work undertaken. None is answerable to the general public. The life of commuters is held to ransom. There is no authority whatsoever to check what is happening after all to expansion joints time and again. If our chosen representatives cannot guarantee safety and security of our lives, what is the use of such government and such representatives? It is a total shame on the entire set up,” he rued.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/cracks-appear-on-railway-overbridge-at-sahnewal-328483

Taking 5-gm (one spoon) of this powder daily will help in sufficing daily need of vitamin D of an individual.Recently, National Mushroom Day was observed this month on October 15 to enjoy and appreciate the culinary value of mushrooms and PAU experts stressed upon growing of mushrooms as subsidiary occupation.“More than 2,000 species of mushrooms exist while around 25 are widely accepted as food. Few of these mushroom varieties are commercially cultivated. Mushrooms are rich in high quality proteins, vitamins, minerals and amino acids, which make them an ideal food for consumption,” said PAU experts.“The climatic conditions of Punjab are quite appropriate for the cultivation of summer and winter varieties of mushrooms. For summer, farmers can adopt the cultivation of milky mushroom. It is commonly known as ‘dhudh chhata’ that implies milk umbrella due to its colour and shape. The optimum temperature for its cultivation is (28-35°C) that is available in Punjab for at least six months (April-October),” PAU experts added.“The presence of high fiber content, protein rich, low fat concentration make this mushroom as a good diet for people with hyperacidity, constipation, cardiac and diabetes problem,” said Shivani Sharma and Shammi Kapoor from the Department of Microbiology, Skill Development Centre, PAU.“Considering the availability of huge amount of agro wastes, shift towards hi-tech agriculture and need for employment generation, there is abundant potential in mushroom cultivation. Mushrooms are considered super food as they are loaded with vitamins and promote a healthy immune system and boost bone health. Further, making mushroom powder by exposing them to sunlight and UV light increases the content of vitamin D by more than 100 times,” they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/pau-experts-stress-on-growing-mushrooms-328488

To avoid adulteration, some people have started making mithai at home but if they are buying khoya from the market, they need to be very careful because using adulterated khoya in mithai preparation can make their effort futile.During the festival season many makeshift and temporary shops start mushrooming up in the interiors of the city and are said to be the main culprits behind bringing adulterated khoya into the city.District Health Department is regularly checking mithiai shops during the festival season to check adulteration. “The mithai shops are regularly checked for adulteration and department is keeping an eye over the shops and anybody found indulging in adulteration will be punished according to law,” said an official from the department.There are multiple ways to check purity of khoya and the first and simple method is by taking a teaspoon of khoya and add it to a cup of hot water. Add two drops of iodine in the cup and if it turns blue, it means it is adulterated and has been prepared by using starch.One can also test the purity before buying and all one need to do is to take small amount of khoya and rub it in your palm and if it has grainy texture and leaves a trail of grease and tastes little sweet then it is pure otherwise it is adulterated.You can also check the presence of vansapati in khoya by mixing two tablespoons of hydrochloric acid and one table spoon of sugar in it. If the mixture turns red then it is adulterated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/quick-ways-to-check-adulteration-in-khoya-during-festival-season-328489

The parking lot is located just near the offices of the Additional Deputy Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner.The city resident, Rahul Verma, who is a road safety activist, gave a complaint to the police against the parking staff. He alleged that the parking staff overcharged fee from him. He also alleged that when he questioned about the prescribed parking fee, the staff “manhandled” him.Verma said, “I had parked my car at the multi-storey parking lot at the Mini Secretariat today. They charged Rs 50 from me for parking my car. When I questioned that what actual fee has been fixed by the administration, they manhandled me. I then went to the Nazar branch of the district administration to know the actual parking fee. The staff informed that the parking fee is Rs 10 for a two-wheeler and Rs 20 for a four-wheeler. I have filed a complaint to the police against the private contractor staff for overcharging and manhandling.”Sources said the users are commonly forced to pay more than the prescribed parking fee at various parking lots under the district administration, Municipal Corporation, Mandi Board and others as there is no check on the violations.A senior Congress leader and Punjab Medium Industrial Development Board (PMIDB) Chairman, Amarjit Singh Tikka, said, “It has come to my notice too that the visitors are being overcharged at some parking lots under various departments, including the MC, district administration and Zila Parishad. I will raise the matter before the DC, MC Commissioner and authorities concerned to take strict action against the contractors who are overcharging from the parking users. Such contractors should not be allowed to tarnish the image of the government.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/parking-lot-staff-manhandled-me-alleges-ludhiana-resident-328490
