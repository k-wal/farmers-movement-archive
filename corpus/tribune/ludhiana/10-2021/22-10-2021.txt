A memorandum of policemen alleging step-motherly treatment with them went viral on Thursday.The memorandum to Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi was shared by angry Punjab Police personnel in WhatsApp groups and on social media. Some police officials told The Tribune that they have been raising their demands for a long time but no government is serious about their demands.The memorandum states that the Punjab Government and Punjab Police have not been extending required facilities to the policemen from constable to inspector rank.The memorandum states that on the pretext of implementing the Sixth Pay Commission, the government has plans to cancel the ongoing facility of 5 per cent house rent allowance for the policemen. Since police jobs are transferrable, discontinuing the facility will affect a large number of policemen.They said most of the times lower-rank police officials have to use their own vehicles to carry out police works or to reach the crime spots. From years vehicle allowance has not been increased by government and it should be increased to Rs 4,000 per month from Rs 400 per month.They said police personnel have no duty timings due to which they cannot bring food from home. Most of the times they cannot even reach home to have dinner with their families and they have to spend more on their food. The government should give Rs 3,000 per month ration allowance instead of Rs 100 being given to them now.“From constable to inspector rank, the government has been giving only meagre allowances for years. We cannot revolt openly as it may annoy our seniors. We had made sacrifices at the terrorism times and now we are participating operations to wipe out gangsters but why government is not giving required facilities to us like being given to gazetted officer ranks starting from the DSP level?” they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/govt-giving-us-step-motherly-treatment-lower-rank-cops-327846

Under the wake of security and law and order, which is a state subject, the Central Government wants to take away powers of the state governments, which are already reduced to the level of municipalities. It also shows lack of faith in state security forces and the police.They said it would amount to increased contradictions and confrontation between Central and state forces which would not augur well for the sensitive Border state of Punjab, which has already passed through a traumatic period. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/mcpi-u-opposes-move-to-extend-bsf-jurisdiction-327850
