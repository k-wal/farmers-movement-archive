Such burning of waste in the open causes severe damage to environment and troubles residents of nearby localities. Aged people and children are the ones most affected due to the smoke,” said CoE president Kapil Arora.“The burning of waste in the open has been completely banned by the NGT. As per the NGT directions, the violators shall be liable to pay environmental compensation of Rs5,000 in case of simple burning, while Rs25,000 in case of bulk waste burning,” said CoE member Kulwant Singh Rai.Another member, Mohit Jain, said: “It is the duty of MC officials to keep a check on the burning of waste in the open and impose fine on violators. But instead of spreading awareness among residents, they are violating the NGT orders.”MC’s Health officer Dr Vipul Malhotra said they had not received any complaint yet. “If a complaint is received, we will take required action,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/burning-of-waste-engineers-complaint-against-ludhiana-civic-body-327436

Now that the CBSE has announced the date sheet, students have suddenly pushed the panic button. There is still a month left, if they study religiously, they can score well. Harmit Kaur Waraich, Principal, Nankana Sahib Public SchoolParents and teachers also expressed concern over the non-serious attitude of the students towards these exams.“Since this would be the first batch to take board exams twice, students were very casual in their approach,” said Harmit Kaur Waraich, Principal, Nankana Sahib Public School. “Now that the CBSE has announced the date sheet, students have suddenly pushed the panic button.”“Earlier, we were continuously telling them to be serious about their studies, but their approach was too casual. They need to score well in these tests to get a good percentage in the final. Now, they are coming up with a lot of queries. There is still a month left, if they study religiously, they can score well,” said the Principal.“Ever since the CBSE has announced the date sheet, my son, who is studying in Class XII, looks confused,” said a parent. “Till now he was busy attending one party or the other.”“As parents we have to push them. If we continue to complain, they will be under tremendous pressure. We need to support them in the best possible manner,” said the parent.Meanwhile, students are divided over board exams being held twice this time. While some say it will reduce their burden, others believe they will be under stress throughout the year.This year, the CBSE has decided to hold exams in two terms – first term in November-December and second in March-April.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/students-press-panic-button-as-cbse-announces-date-sheet-327432

The prices are bound to increase further. The prices will be on higher side throughout this month,” said Islam.While tomatoes are being sold at Rs80 per kg, onions cost Rs50-60 per kg. Capsicum, which was selling for Rs50 per kg a few weeks back, is now being sold at Rs120 per kg. Similarly, the rates of beans, cauliflower, bottle-gourd, carrot, etc., are also on the higher side.“We are not using any vegetables these days. We are depending upon pulses and soya, which is still reasonable. How can a person buy vegetables in meager salary of Rs4,000 a month?” asked Raushni, who works as a domestic help in Ghumar Mandi.The vendors though said the rates would come down once fresh crop arrives in the market.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/vegetable-prices-burn-a-hole-in-common-mans-pocket-327425

Earlier, the court had granted a two-day police remand which ended today.Manna is the among the three accused who was arrested by the STF in November last year with 31 kg heroin, 6 kg ice (methamphetamine) and Rs 25 lakh drug money.A STF probe found that despite Manna was lodged in prison, he continued to run his heroin smuggling network from the Kapurthala jail. At present, Manna is lodged in a Amritsar jail and for a few months, he also remained in the Kapurthala jail where he, along some other inmate, ran the drug network from the jail.“When Manna was in the Kapurthala jail, he supplied around 4 kg heroin to his clients on the directions of kingpin Bedi, who is hiding in Australia. He must be having access to a mobile phone in the jail. We have brought Manna on production warrant to inquire how he was running the drug network from the jail and we are also writing to the Kapurthala jail authorities for the recovery of mobile phone,” a senior STF official said.The kingpin of the drug cartel Tanvir Singh Bedi has been hiding in Australia and the process to extradite him to India has already been initiated by the police.Notably, three months ago, the police had arrested smuggler Harminder Singh Bedi from Thailand. Bedi is at present in the custody of the STF for questioning. Sources said Bedi’s questioning led to the disclosures of Manna’s jail network.STF officials said Bedi had a formula to prepare heroin by mixing various chemicals. Before his arrest from Thailand, Bedi had visited Punjab and he had reportedly prepared around 200 kg of heroin of which the STF had recovered only 31 kg while the rest either had been sold to their clients or might be concealed somewhere.Ludhiana STF in-charge Harbans Singh said further interrogation of Manna may expose his network being operated from jail and more recovery could also be made.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/remand-of-drug-smuggler-manjit-singh-manna-extended-327422
