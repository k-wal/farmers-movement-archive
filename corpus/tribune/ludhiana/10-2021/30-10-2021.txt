We will not issue challan to shopkeepers who will sell crackers on road or outside their houses ahead of Diwali. Even our seniors have told us to be lenient with illegal crackers sellers, “said a police official.A city SHO requesting annonymity said the CM’s statement had given liberty to unlicenced shopkeepers and they might put stall at any non-designated places. However, this liberty may invite major mishaps as at such non-designated places, the vendors did not ensure fire safety arrangements.The district administration has already designated a site in Ludhiana only where crackers will be sold by licenced sellers.Joint CP Headquarters J Elanchezhian he said the police would not harass any innocent shopkeepers but they would ensure that no glaring violations should be there ahead of Diwali.“We have asked all SHOs to ensure that no illegal crackers godown should come up at vulnerable places like residential areas which may invite any untoward incident. Even crackers should be sold at designated places only so that the administration could take all precautionary measures to prevent any accident. This is for the safety of residents. Two illegal godowns set up in a residential area have also recently busted by the city police,” Elanchezhian added.Stalls installedNow, many small cracker sellers and vendors have already installed their shops and stalls in the market and residential areas and have displayed crackers for sale at non-designated places.
