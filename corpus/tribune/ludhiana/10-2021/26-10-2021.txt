Private laboratories and hospitals cannot charge more than Rs 600 for the dengue test. We have already conducted meeting with the private hospitals and members of the Indian Medical Association. If still anybody is charging more than Rs 600, then person should contact the Health Department with the bill receipt and necessary action will be taken against the violators,” said Civil Surgeon Dr SP Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/no-check-on-private-labs-hospitals-overcharging-for-dengue-test-in-ludhiana-329820

They demanded that the Centre should grant fair compensation from the national disaster relief fund to farmers whose crops had been damaged due to recent rains.Bharti Kisan Union (Kadian) president Harmeet Singh Kadian regretted that the government had failed to comprehend that agriculture had never been a remunerative vocation and its sustenance depended on various factors, including weather. Challenging the government’s decision to fix 17 per cent moisture content of the paddy as standard for procurement, he said: “Now, when rains and hailstorm have caused massive damage to the paddy crop when farmers had delayed harvesting due to adamancy of procurement agencies, the government should seek expert opinion whether it was possible for farmers to further delay the process.”Urging the government to allow procurement of paddy with 24 per cent moisture, Kadian demanded Rs 40,000 per acre compensation for farmers whose paddy crop was damaged completely due to recent rains. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/farm-unions-seek-relaxation-in-moisture-content-in-paddy-relief-for-losses-329830
