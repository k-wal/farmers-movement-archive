The land upon which the township extends spans to 300 acres.Development plans will create approximately 2,000 well-paid jobs, over a development period of approximately five years.“Intention is to develop, upon this site, a series of world-class facilities. This will involve a bespoke 18 hole golf course, designed (by Jack Nicholas), a five-star hotel, international schools (junior and senior) in collaboration with prominent educational institutions based in the United Kingdom, a health farm with spa facilities, and a multi-faith temple,” Malhotra said.The project will also offer 280 homes and a variety of apartments and plots for development. There will also be a provision for economically weaker section (EWS) housing spreading over 10 acres.This will be in continuation to earlier project worth investment of Rs 1,000 crore filed by the NRI with Invest Punjab in 2020 to develop a world-class township at Hambran in Ludhiana.“My experience in Punjab has instilled a confidence about the proactive approach of ease of doing business and conducive business ecosystem in the state,” added Malhotra.Another investor, Sucheta Oswal from the Vardhman Group, announced an expansion of their operations in the state at an estimated investment of Rs 600 crore.They will invest at two places — Rs 400-crore project in Malerkotla and Rs 200-crore project in Ludhiana.Elsewhere, a South Korean company Sunjin India Feeds Private Limited announced Rs 80-crore investment in Patiala. The company’s managing director, Gi No Park, said they had already purchased a land and were in the process of beginning the setting up of the unit.Sunjin India, which is a South Korea-based company and is starting its India journey from the state, will be setting up a feed mill plant for manufacturing animal feed with foreign direct investment (FDI) of Rs 80 crore (10 million dollars).Another local investor, Sonalika Group, pledged another Rs 1,000 crore investment to expand their existing tractor manufacturing plant in Hoshiarpur worth over Rs 1,000 crore.Among others, Mahindra Group promised to set up their third tractor factory in the state, Birla Group another Rs 1,500-crore, Sanjeev Mehta of Hindustan Unilever announced Rs 1,200-crore, Dr Atul Chauhan from Amity University Rs 500-crore and JK Paper announced another investment of Rs 200 crore.“This shows that the government has been able to create trust and confidence among Punjab, national and international community. We need to tread on this path forward and further build on the momentum,” said Invest Punjab Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rajat Agarwal.He said the government had been clearly able to create a good and investor-friendly ecosystem in the state.“The investors seem to be confident about the state and seem to be assured and reassured as was the theme of the summit,” he asserted, while adding that the confidence of NRI bank in Punjab seems to be returning, demonstrating the healthy NRI investment arrival to the state.Agarwal said not only the textile sector and home-grown industrialists of Punjab have shown confidence but the confidence of foreign companies and countries, which were not traditional to Punjab like South Korea, has also been built.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/industrial-hub-ludhiana-fetches-big-investments-from-summit-330843

We are determined to transform the state as the most-preferred destination for investment and industrialisation. —Charanjit Singh Channi, Chief MinisterReaffirming his government’s zero tolerance for bureaucratic and political corruption, indifferent attitude, inordinate delays and inertia in the day-to-day operations of the industry in the state, the Chief Minister committed to act as a true facilitator for the investors and assured the industry captains of conducive ecosystem for attracting more investments to Punjab.“Revival and empowerment of industry is fundamental for employment generation and prosperity of the state.

28-10-2021||Ludhiana||Punjab Investors’ Summit a flop show, says SAD||Shiromani Akali Dal today termed the Punjab Investors’ Summit 2021 held here a “massive flop show” with investors not coming up with any concrete investment due to anti-industry policies of the Congress government.Commenting on the summit, former minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal said Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi used the opportunity to hold a Cabinet meeting here as the government had got jittery after SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal received a massive response from the trade and industry.“Channi tried to woo the industry but he failed abysmally. Investors have gone by the past record of the Congress government, which has refused to give any special incentives to attract investment in the state or give any incentive to the home-grown industry to help it in its expansion plans. This is why no new industry came to Punjab in the past nearly five years,” he said.Grewal said even today the investors and leaders of industry were shocked the Chief Minister’s failure to announce any special incentives for new investment as well as expansion of existing projects.The CM also did not announce any special project for Ludhiana or come out with any plan to fix its crumbling infrastructure, said Grewal.The SAD leader said the industry felt betrayed as the Congress government had failed to provide power to it at a landing cost of Rs5 per unit as promised.He said instead of reducing the tariff for the industrial sector, it had been increased manifold repeatedly.“Industrialists also faced massive power outages during the Congress tenure due to which they had to use alternative power sources, leading to a further increase in their input costs,” he observed.The Congress government also failed to give any concession to the industry during the period of Covid, despite promising to do so, he added. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/punjab-investors-summit-a-flop-show-says-sad-330848

Of them, 107 cases have been reported from Ludhiana urban areas, including 93 from Ludhiana city, one from Khanna and 13 from Jagraon, while 15 cases were from rural areas of the district.Amid allegations of opposition against inadequate fogging to control mosquitoes that spread dengue, the cases were reported from Gurdev Nagar, Rishi Nagar, Model Town, Giaspura, Kakowal Road, Janta Nagar, Himmat Singh Nagar, BRS Nagar, GTB Nagar, Garewal Road, Dares Road, Amarpura, Durgapuri, Cambrian Road, Shivaji Nagar, Green Park, Chander Nagar, Shivpuri, Agar Nagar, Kitchlu Nagar, Ajit Nagar, Tagore Nagar, Churpur Road, Aman Park and Sant Vihar.The Health Department said 1,026 dengue cases had been confirmed till date in the district. Besides, 2,656 suspected cases had been reported.Questions are being raised by opposition parties over “inadequate” fogging in the city. SAD Ludhiana urban president Harbhajan Singh Dang said a large number of dengue cases were being reported but fogging was not being conducted properly for controlling mosquitoes for the prevention of dengue in the city.“In every area, fogging should be conducted with big machines at least thrice a week. Currently, fogging is not being done properly even once a week. The material that is provided for small fogging machines is not enough. The MC should intensify the fogging drive,” he said.A BJP leader, advocate Bikram Singh Sidhu, on Tuesday submitted a complaint to the MC Commissioner, alleging that the civic body had failed to ensure proper fogging in many parts of the city. He said fogging was not being conducted timely to control mosquitoes in many areas despite rise in dengue cases in the city.“Besides a few localities, majority of the areas are neglected in terms of cleanliness drive and fogging. The stagnant water puddles have become a breeding ground for mosquitoes larvae, thus leading to a constant increase in dengue and malaria cases. If the Municipal Corporation fails to address these issues at the earliest, party members and office-bearers will stage a dharna against the corporation,” he said.There is no arrangement to conduct fogging in many areas outside the Municipal Corporation limits also.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-district-records-highest-single-day-spike-of-122-dengue-cases-330850

They alleged that they were detained. A PAC member, Jaskirat Singh, said: “We staged a peaceful protest around 2 km away from the venue where the CM had to visit. After the CM’s convoy passed through the road, a police officer came to us. After an enquiry, he went away. Later, we got a call from the officer hat he can allow two of our members to meet the Chief Minister at the helipad. When I and Dr Amandeep Singh Bains reached outside the venue, we were asked to wait in a nearby school. Later, the police closed the school gate and we were not allowed to go out till the CM left in a helicopter. We were detained by the police.”Dr Amandeep Singh Bains said: “We wanted to request the CM to cancel the modern industrial park project as it should not be set up in an eco-sensitive zone. The police did not allow us to go out of the school to meet the CM. Actually, we were detained in a clever manner.”The PAC members had earlier also sent a mail to the Chief Minister and all Cabinet ministers, demanding protection of our air, water, environment and health of Punjabis as an integral part of being progressive. DSP Sandeep Wadhera said nobody was detained by the police.He said: “We had told the PAC members that they can meet the CM at the helipad as representatives of other organisations had also wanted to meet him.

28-10-2021||Lovleen Bains||No age relaxation for pvt college teachers applying for govt posts irks applicants||Doraha, October 27While on one hand advertising of posts of Assistant Professors and Librarians by the Punjab Government after more than two decades is being hailed, on the other hand no relaxation for those teaching in private aided colleges, despite being equally qualified, has met with resentment.In the currently advertised posts, the age limit fixed for the general category is 37 years. Relaxation has though been given to SC, OBC, government employees, widows, divorcee, PWD, forces, and contractual teachers of government colleges.“A number of students have acquired eligibility and higher qualification in the past more than 20 years from the time the posts were last advertised but never got the jobs as they were never advertised. As a result they had to join private colleges against the permanent posts. Recruitment in private aided colleges too remained suspended for more than 10 years from 2004 onwards,” said a PhD qualified teacher, teaching at a local college.“A majority of these teachers, who are working against unaided permanent posts, are now facing problems. Decline in enrolment ratio in these colleges has led to financial crisis and resultant withholding of salaries of unaided staff for months together,” said another teacher working against a permanent unaided post in a local college.“A number of them also bore the brunt of rationalisation. Although they belong to the highly qualified class, many of them remain vulnerable to exploitation,” he said.Panjab University Senate member Shaminder Singh Sandhu said the upper age limit fixed by the government was 37 years for the posts where basic qualification was graduation, the same age limit where basic qualification is PhD (for non-NET candidates) seems unreasonable as it takes at least seven more years after graduation to complete the basic requirement for the post of Assistant Professor.“Relaxation to part time, guest faculty and contractual teachers of government colleges in terms of age and marks for experience is befitting as they have served these colleges for long. But the teachers serving in the private colleges and facing the lack of opportunity in the government sector have also become over-aged. Even the UGC has put no such restriction on age to appear either for the NET or any other entry level exam. Moreover, the teachers willing to serve in the field of higher education complete their education (MPhil/PhD) around the age of 30 and in the last two decades they have not got any appropriate opportunity, as a result of which they have become overage,” said Sandhu.“Age relaxation given to contractual teachers of government colleges should be extended to the ones serving in private colleges on aided as well as unaided posts. I have written to the Minister of Higher Education and the Secretary, Higher Education, in this regard,” Sandhu added.Meanwhile, a delegation of teachers is also learnt to have met Higher Education Minister Pargat Singh in this regard.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/no-age-relaxation-for-pvt-college-teachers-applying-for-govt-posts-irks-applicants-330852
