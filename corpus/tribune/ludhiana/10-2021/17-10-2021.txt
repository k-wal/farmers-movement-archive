But no concrete steps were taken to provide relief to users from overcharging. The MC had, however, increased the parking fee from Rs 5 to Rs 10 for parking of a two-wheeler and from Rs 10 to Rs 20 for parking of a car.The employees working under the private contractor were issuing manual slips to the users at the Multi-level parking lot on Thursday. As per the rules, the parking contractor is supposed to issue only e-tickets to the users, not manual tickets.The contractor is also supposed to display parking fee rates on the prescribed board at the lot. But, no parking fee board was displayed at the entrance and exit of the parking lot. At the entrance of the parking lot, the categories of vehicles like small truck, tempo, car, jeep, scooter, motorcycle, etc, have been written on the pillars/walls but the fee column is left blank.Angrez Singh of Tarn Taran Sahib had parked his car at the parking lot on Thursday. He said, “I had parked my car for 3-4 hours and I was charged Rs 50 as parking fee. But I don’t know the actual parking fee at all.”Some other visitors also said Rs 50 were being charged for parking a car. A former councillor had earlier also raised questions over the MC ignoring the fleecing of users at the parking lot.On being asked, the parking staff could not tell that where the parking fee board has been displayed? A parking worker, however, claimed that they are not overcharging fee from users.MC Commissioner, Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal said the Additional Commissioner concerned has been directed to look into the matter and take strict action if any violation is found.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/mc-fails-to-check-overcharging-by-contractor-at-multi-level-parking-325701

Action should be taken against culprits and law and order has to be enforced firmly. The Singhu border should be handed over to the Army or paramilitary forces so that such acts were not repeated under the garb of farmers’ protest,” he said.“Nobody is allowed to take law into their hands. Even Kasab was tried in court before hanging. Punjabis are insecure after the happening as they believe, it allows anti-social elements to operate on their own whims and fancies without any sort of moral, physical, social or legal check,” Soi said.He expressed that if the Centre and the state fail to strengthen law enforcement agencies even after such horrifying incidents, people of the country would have no option but to migrate to other countries in big numbers.The BJP leader requested the Prime Minister and the Home Minister to take strict action in the matterso that nobody dares to engage in such condemnable act again.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bjp-flays-sacrilege-lynching-incidents-at-singhu-border-325706

There is a need to bring transparency in the working of the F&CC. The panel should be completed without any further delay. At least one opposition party councillor should be taken as a panel member in the F&CC. During the tenure of the last MC House, Congress councillor Balkar Singh Sandhu was then nominated as a member of the F&CC. Now, Sandhu is the city Mayor and he should complete the panel. If it is not completed now, we would move the Punjab and Haryana High Court,” said senior SAD leader Jaspal Singh Giaspura.Around a year ago, SAD leader and former leader of opposition in the MC, Harbhajan Singh Dang had also raised the matter before the Mayor to nominate two councillors at the earliest. When the SAD-BJP was in the majority during the MC’s fifth House, Congress councillors used to blame the then Mayor for allegedly delaying the nomination of two councillors as panel members.Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu could not be contacted for his comments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/oppn-leader-raises-questions-over-incomplete-fcc-325707

The day raises awareness about spine health and also motivate people to take care of their spinal health.Getting ready for workTake good care of spine.The theme revolves typically around younger generation who are working back to back, overburdened with work and hardly take care of their spine health. During the pandemic, work from home has led to side effects and aggravated spine-related issues. If not taken care of, symptoms are going to stay for more than a year. A number of patients coming these days have increased by 10-25 per cent as compared to pre-Covid times. Dr Shubhang Aggarwal, orthopaedic and robotic joint replacement surgeon and director, NHS Hospital, said work from home during the pandemic had contributed a lot towards spine-related problems.“Couch seating arrangement is contributing to the pain. Fluffy furniture is comfy but slouching or leaning forward on your laptop or lying down while typing is hard on the body. Especially when your 15-minute Zoom meeting turns into an hour. Though zebra-print chair looks cool on video conferences, it’s not the most ergonomically sound chair for you. Choose a chair that delivers both support and comfort to your lower back and hips,” Dr Aggarwal said.Another city based expert said improper and insufficient facilities for working from home for prolonged hours led to many spine-related problems during Covid. “Now, not only elderly but even young are facing issues related to spine. It is important to take short breaks to reduce stress on spine. Regular exercise and yoga will also help in easing the problem,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/keep-your-spine-healthy-experts-325708
