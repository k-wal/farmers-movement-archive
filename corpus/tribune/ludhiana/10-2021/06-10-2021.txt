It should be clearly specified as to which plots or properties required NOC and proper arrangements be made at the tehsil level or at ‘suvidha centres’ for issuing NOCs to all eligible properties.The developers have urged the government that keeping in view of interests of the common man, instructions be issued to the Revenue Department to resume registration of sale deeds at the earliest which would give much needed fillip to the crisis-ridden property and real estate business.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/resume-registration-of-property-sale-deeds-colonisers-to-govt-320821
