Due to the irresponsible attitude of the government, the exam has been postponed nine times, they alleged.“We are around 1,800 candidates who had cleared the physical fitness exam. We have to appear in the written exam but it is being delayed for past nine months. Whenever we raised the voice demanding from the authorities concerned to get the pending written exam held, excuses were always made to postpone the written exam due to Covid-19. On the other hand, around five candidates had appeared for the Punjab Police recruitment exam. Are the Covid guidelines only for 1,800 candidates who have to appear in Army recruitment written exam?” they said.A group of protesters said they have spent Rs 50,000 to take coaching from different academies for preparing for the exam. “We belong to economically weaker families and it is difficult for us to wait for more time for the examination. We appeal to the Deputy Commissioner, Ludhiana, to take the required steps to get the written examination conducted as Army recruitment is very important for all of us”, they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/youths-protest-repeated-postponement-of-army-recruitment-written-examination-326531

The reckless mowing down of innocent farmers is a crime which no sane soul on earth can forget. The cries of bereaved members of the family are too loud to be subdued and crushed. Moreover, when the entire country is standing in support of the bereaved, no party, however strong, powerful or dictatorial it may be, can resist and has to bring in justice at any costs,” expressed the protesters.“The conduct of the Narendra-Modi-led Central Government, as far as the Lakhimpur Kheri incident is concerned, has not only been condemnable but shocking as well. The government seems to have thrown all sanity to winds and it is openly supporting the killers of the innocent farmers. ‘Jungle rule’ has now begun to affect our families, surroundings and society at large. But the Union Government has to remember, that in a democratic country like ours, the public is still the strongest administrator and anything which goes against ethics and morals of our democratic politics will be criticised and fought till the last breath. We shall not sit back and our agitation will be intensified with each passing day if justice is denied.“Nothing can be more heart rendering than this. The incident at Lakhimpur Kheri is highly deplorable. Rather than granting justice to the farmers, who were peacefully protesting for the past one year, they are being run over by vehicles. The poor farmers have been sitting on the Delhi borders and are demanding their rightful due. Many of them have lost their lives during the protest,” the protesters said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/employees-pensioners-support-rail-roko-agitation-in-doraha-326535

The CM had then met the Home Minister and asked him to take strict action to curb arms and drug smuggling from Pakistan,” he alleged.The protesters said the Union Government was trying to intimidate people of the state by imposing such a wrong decision before the elections.“Such extended powers to the BSF can be misused,” they alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/aap-protests-against-centre-state-over-extended-jurisdiction-to-bsf-326536
