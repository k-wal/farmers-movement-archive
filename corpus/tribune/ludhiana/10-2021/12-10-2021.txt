Of an estimated more than two lakh illegal connections in the city, the Municipal Corporation has till now received just 5,000 odd applications for regularisation.The scheme, which was introduced on August 25, 2021, would remain open till November 24, 2021.Officials of the operation and maintenance (O&M) branch of the MC admitted that a majority of residents having illegal water and sewerage connections were not interested in getting these regularised on payment of nominal one-time fee and user charges only because they were being misguided by small- time political leaders. These politicians promised residents to protect them from any penal action or disconnection of water supply and sewerage connections, they added.A senior MC official said it was a one-time opportunity for those having illegal water/sewerage connections to get these regularised and pay user charges if their plot area was more than 125 square yards. And such residents only had to pay a one-time fee of Rs200 for the regularisation of connections, he said. Plots upto 125 square yards were exempted from user charges, he added.As per the notification issued by the Local Government Department, Punjab, in this regard, if illegal water and sewerage connections were not regularised during the three-month window, defaulters would have to pay 100 per cent penalty on one-time fee and interest on user charges. And for those failing to fall in line even after three months of the closure of the scheme, harsher action such as disconnection of such illegal connections in addition to recovery of penalty and interest on arrears, was in the offing.A senior MC functionary observed that more or less, city residents had got used to non-payment of local taxes, especially the user charges for water supply and sewerage.“Arrears of water supply and sewerage charges have mounted to over Rs300 crore, which shows that defaulters are reluctant to pay for utilities,” said the official.In such a scenario wherein arrears of user charges were mounting with every passing month and defaulting residents had no fear of law, the laxity or in many cases connivance of field staff of the MC could not be ruled out, said a former councillor.Only 5,000 applications receivedOf an estimated more than two lakh illegal connections in the city, the Municipal Corporation has till now received just 5,000 applications for regularisation. The scheme, which was introduced on August 25, 2021, would remain open till November 24.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ots-scheme-fails-to-get-good-response-in-ludhiana-city-323302

The proposed Amritsar greenfield connectivity starts from Nakodar and ends near the canal on the Amritsar-Ajnala road.The project alignment of the Punjab section passes through Ludhiana, Patiala, Sangrur, Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Gurdaspur districts, while the alignment of greenfield connectivity to Amritsar crosses through Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Tarn Taran and Amritsar districts.The expressway will reduce the distance between Delhi and Amritsar/Katra by about 40 km and provide travel time from Delhi to Amritsar within four and four and a half hours and Delhi to Katra within six and six and a half hours.Since the four-lane access-controlled road expandable to eight lanes being developed under the hybrid annuity model (HAM) passes through Punjab, Haryana, and Jammu, it will provide the shortest connectivity to industrial and economic hubs of Ludhiana, Mohali, Patiala, Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Sangrur in Punjab, Ambala in Haryana, Kathua and Jammu in Jammu and Kashmir and Chandigarh.After the long-distance vehicular traffic shifting from existing national highways to the new expressway, resulting in lesser congestion leading to higher fuel savings and reduced travel time, the freight movement will also speed up and road safety of the traffic connecting the region will be enhanced with minimum distractions and conflict zones.It will also provide the shortest connectivity to important Sikh shrines at Sultanpur Lodhi, Goindwal Sahib, Khadoor Sahib, Tarn Taran and the recently developed Dera Baba Nanak-Kartarpur Sahib international corridor in Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/land-acquisition-for-delhi-katra-expressway-picks-up-pace-in-ludhiana-district-323315
