The administrative department, police officials and NGOs made constructive efforts to bring about a healthy change in the town. Efforts put in by Payal MLA Lakhvir Singh Lakha coupled with the works done by Municipal Council chief Sudarashan Kumar Pappu, Doraha is changing for the better. However, the problems of sewer accumulation, unplanned garbage disposal, broken roads, unabated use of plastic and traffic congestion remained unresolved.HighsWater treatment plant to be set up: Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi has recently announced a grant of Rs 13 crore for the setting up of a treatment plant near Gurthali pull. The sewerage treatment plant installed by GLADA had failed to cope up with the inflow and the town gets inundated even after a slight downpour. Residents have been grappling with the problem for years together.Huge garbage dump to be shifted out of town: Setting up of a dump on 2 acres near Gurthali pull is also on the cards. The huge dump near the telephone exchange, which has been inconveniencing residents for long, would be hopefully shifted. The garbage will be treated to produce manure which would be used by farmers of surrounding villages.Community hall renovated: The community hall, which was built years ago to facilitate the needy, has been renovated with the efforts of the council chief Sudarshan Kumar Pappu who is seen less as a Congress leader and more as a man of the masses. The renovated hall will now be made available to the needy who can organise their events at a nominal cost.Construction, repair of streets and roads: Construction and repair works of various streets and roads, including the Araichan road, are going on at a fast pace. Tenders for the construction of dharamshalas and community halls for the Shigligar Basti, Sapera Basti and Muslim communities have been passed.Community health centre almost ready: The 40-year-old problem of the absence of a hospital has been resolved as the building of the community health centre (CHC) is nearing completion. People of the town as well as surrounding villages were facing grave problems in the absence of a civil hospital. They were generally left without medication as they could not afford visiting private doctors and paying huge fees to them.Police station to be shifted: The new building of the police station, Doraha, is being constructed. The shifting of the station from the busy railway road area is expected to ease traffic congestion. The problem of accidental or other vehicles stranded in front of the police station will be resolved with the shifting of the station outside the town.LowsWhile developmental works are being undertaken in the town, some issues still demand attention and early resolve.Encroachments: Encroachments in Doraha town are a nightmare for commuters as well as local residents. Encroachments by shopkeepers and vendors on both sides of the only main market road, present a poor picture of the town.Heaps of garbage an eyesore: Permanent heaps of garbage dumped at places visited by a majority of the residents, employees and students have not only become an eyesore but also a major cause of spread of various diseases and infections. The municipal authorities seem to be helpless in providing a permanent remedy for the same.Neelon-Doraha stretch a virtual hell: The Doraha-Neelon stretch, where the proposed work on ROB has to be initiated, has hit commuters hard. The commuters have to shell out money at the toll twice, in a distance of mere five kilometers. The authorities are completely oblivious about it and nothing substantial has come out for the past many years.The problem of sewage disposal: The Doraha-Jaipura road is the worst hit due to the sewer overflow. The road connects several villages. It has been almost four years since sewer water began flowing on to the road and made the life of residents, commuters and villagers a virtual hell. They have made several complaints but to no avail.Traffic congestion: The traffic congestion in Doraha has assumed grave proportions as there is simply no check on the haphazard parking in the town. Vehicles remain stranded for hours together, thanks to the callous attitude of the traffic police personnel.Stoppage of trains: Residents and rail passengers have demanded more stoppages of trains in the town as it would boost the income of the railways in a commendable manner.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/efforts-made-but-a-lot-needs-to-be-done-in-doraha-355827

But since it was “mistimed” or “went off accidentally before being planted”, it helped minimise the destruction and, in turn, took the life of the carrier only.“The recovery of aluminium particles and plastic shrapnel from the body of the deceased clearly showed the strength of the explosive material,” said the officers, adding that had the explosion taken place at a crowded place, it could have caused an unimaginable devastation.Was in touch with ISI, BKIGagandeep Singh was in touch with members of the ISI, Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) and banned outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), based abroad, who were hell bent to disturb peace in Punjab and again raise the bogey of a separate state ahead of the Assembly elections due in early next year,” investigators said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/from-cop-to-terrorist-gaggi-transformed-in-a-decade-355824

However, the civic body has allowed the private contractors to carry on the bitumen-based road recarpeting works just before the Assembly elections.The civic body commonly avoided recarpeting and repair works of potholed roads during winter season in the past some years as a number of roads that were carpeted during winter had got damaged within a short period. The questions are being raised as the bitumen-based road works are going on in full swing these days in winter.Harbhajan Singh Dang, councillor-cum-president of the local unit of the Shiromani Akali Dal said, “The bitumen-based road works are not recommended during winter because there are chances that roads carpeted during low temperature can get damaged within a short period. The roads were generally not recarpeted after December 15 in the past. But, various roads are being recarpeted during the extremely cold weather conditions these days.”Sanjay Verma of the Council of Engineers said, “As per the seasonal limitations set by the PWD and MORTH specifications, the bituminous works are not advised in winter season, especially when temperature goes down below 10°C. There is the possibility of surface getting damaged earlier than its expected life. Road re-laying should be avoided in this season.”An employee of the MC said the Hot-mix plant was closed about 10 days ago due to winter season and plant operations are likely to be resumed after end of this season.Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said only those contractors, who have given a guarantee that the recarpeted roads will not get damaged before expected life, are carrying out the road works these days and they are responsible for the ongoing road works.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/against-rules-contractors-recarpeting-roads-in-winter-355814

In March, the civic body had given nod to the estimated annual budget of Rs 1064.85 crore for 2021-22 but the government had sanctioned only Rs 815.65 crore.Now, the MC is going to take a loan of Rs 100 crore and it has proposed to sell a number of properties, even those given on rent. Besides, it is expecting to generate Rs 19.10 crore as cow cess during this financial year.The MC will generate the advertisement tax of only Rs 4 crore as per the revised budget. In March, the MC, in the estimated budget, had aimed to generate Rs 15 crore under the head of advertisement tax during 2021-22. It is not clear how the income under the advertisement head has been reduced, raising may eyebrows. When contacted, Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said the government had already reduced the advertisement-related income in the sanctioned budget amid the Covid-19 pandemic.In the estimated budget for 2019-20, the MC was expecting to generate Rs 25 crore from advertisements but the income target was reduced amid the Covid-19 pandemic. When Navjot Singh Sidhu was the Local Bodies Minister, he had introduced a new policy for outdoor advertisements to increase income from advertisements.Properties to be sold to generate Rs50 croreA resolution for the implementation of The Punjab Management and Transfer of Municipal Properties Act, 2020 and the rules under the Act were approved to sell or rent/lease out the MC’s properties. The House members approved a resolution regarding the generation of Rs 50 crore by ‘selling’ various properties. Such properties include land of some prominent educational institutes and around 1,000 shops that were given on rent/lease.As per the resolution regarding generation of Rs 50 crore, the MC has a plan to give ownership rights to the lessee/tenants/occupiers by charging the required amount from them.Meanwhile, the House members also passed another resolution regarding the e-auction of some properties.Objections on appointments on compassionate groundsA few councillors raised objections over the names of two persons in the list of deceased employees’ kin who are to be issued appointment letters on compassionate grounds under a scheme. A councillor said he had never seen an employee (who has died) working in his ward. Councillor from Ward 52 Gurdeep Singh Neetu also raised a similar objection. Meanwhile, another Congress councillor raised a question seeking transparency to avoid chances of any irregularity. Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, however, said a committee has finalised the names.Five roads to be named after ‘Panj Pyare’The MC House has passed a proposal to name five roads in different zones on the names of ‘Panj Pyare’. Officials have prepared a report of nine roads and of them, five roads are to be selected. During the meeting, the members also gave nod to regularise the services of employees, including JEs and SDOs working on an outsourced basis.Opposition praises Mayor for development in cityThe Opposition councillors of Shiromani Akali Dal, Lok Insaaf Party and BJP praised Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu and MC Commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal for carrying out development works in the city.SAD councillor Harbhajan Singh Dang and BJP councillor Chaudhary Yashpal thanked the mayor for development works.

From where did he collect the explosives? Which route did he take from Khanna to reach the court complex? And, how did he reach the court?The only clue the police have so far is the CCTV footage of Gagandeep, who was dismissed as a head constable in a drug case, and his woman friend, who is a constable, visiting Hotel Down Town, Khanna, before the blast.A day after the explosion, the police seized the digital video recorder (DVR) from the hotel.The probe revealed that on the day of the blast, Gagandeep left home at 9.30 am on his Activa scooter, went to the Civil Hospital, Khanna, and parked the scooter there.“It is suspected that either Gagandeep’s aides dropped him at the Ludhiana court or he boarded a bus. Someone in Khanna might have given him the explosives,” a senior police official told The Tribune.As per his wife, Gagandeep was not carrying any bag when he left home on December 23, raising the suspicion that explosives could have been handed over to him either in Khanna or Ludhiana.Sources say the NIA and police have already checked footage of dozens of CCTV cameras, starting from his home in Professor Colony, Khanna, to the civil hospital. Even cameras installed on highways and markets in Khanna are being examined for clues.
