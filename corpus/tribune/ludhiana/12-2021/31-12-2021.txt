Though we are still safe from the Omicron variant, the rise in daily and active cases, besides increase in the hit rate calls for immediate steps to curb the upward trend. We are monitoring the situation and necessary steps are being taken. — Varinder Kumar Sharma, Deputy CommissionerWith four international travellers, including three from the United Kingdom and another from Romania, 21 persons, which comprised 17 from the district and four outsiders, tested positive for Covid while the tally of active cases reached 65 during the past 24 hours, the official figures have revealed.It was despite the fact that the testing rate has fallen down drastically from 14,411 on August 14 to 2,907 on Thursday. However, the only sigh of relief was that no case of the new highly contagious Omicron variant of Covid has been reported in the district so far.On Thursday, the positivity rate climbed up to 0.58 per cent, which was a record high since June 18 when Ludhiana had reported a hit rate of 0.63 per cent. Since then, the positivity rate in the district ranged between 0 to 0.43 per cent from June 19 and December 29. Thursday’s hit rate was more than double than Wednesday’s positivity rate of 0.24 per cent.Also, the count of Covid deaths has also broken the five-month record with seven persons falling prey to the virus in the district in December so far while November, October and August had reported four casualties each whereas five each had died due to Covid here in September and July.The development holds significance as Ludhiana had earlier assumed the dubious distinction of being the worst-hit district with the maximum number of daily Covid cases and deaths till May. In June also, Ludhiana had reported 89 Covid deaths.Ludhiana, with a maximum population of 4-million, had remained the worst-hit during the deadly second Covid wave, but had later made a remarkable turnaround from being the worst-hit to the safest district in the state.The safe trend persisted since July when the district had made a remarkable turnaround by recording the daily positivity rate even below 1 per cent.If it was mayhem in May when the second Covid wave had rapidly slid into a devastating crisis with the health facilities unbearably falling short, oxygen supplies running low and many dying even without seeing a doctor, June had started giving a sigh of relief with signs of gradual retreat and impact of deadly virus plateauing and the safe trend began in July and continued till recently when the hit rate remained nil on December 14.This U-turn was all the more significant as the daily positivity rate has dropped from the highest-ever ratio of 19.57 per cent recorded on May 2, when the district had touched its peak of virus surge.The daily hit rate had been plummeting constantly since the last week of May.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/covid-daily-cases-touch-4-month-high-356506

Minister Ashu has denied these allegations.The BJP leaders alleged that labour, small contractors and truck owners were being troubled due to ‘corruption’ in grain markets of the state.Demanding that the ED should conduct the probe, they alleged that “PUNGRAIN has made big clusters in the grain markets and had given labour cartridges and transportation tenders to favourites of minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and have disqualified low rate tenders to extract more money from the Central Government.”Bikram alleged that corrupt practices were going on in grain markets of various districts. For example, a contractor, Gurpreet Singh, had carried out the transportation work for Rs 2.25 crore in 2019-20, which was later carried out by the minister’s favourite contractor for Rs 4 crore, he alleged.The contractor, who was present during the press conference, has demanded a probe into awarding of contracts.Meanwhile, Cabinet Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said all these allegations were baseless and fake. There was complete transparency in the working of grain markets and there was no misuse of funds, he said.Thge minister said the tendering process was online and transparent. Moreover, it was a Central Government- monitored process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bjp-seeks-probe-into-irregularities-in-awarding-contracts-at-grain-markets-356508

Soldiers, students, daily-wagers, small traders and employees are among the worst affected.The Railway authorities said facility had been withdrawn due to decrease in number of passengers during the lockdown period.Residents led by Sikandar Singh Jartauli regretted that the government, instead of modernising halt stations at Ghungrana and Jassowal villages had withdrawn facility, which they had been using for over six decades.“Most unfortunate is that the government has withdrawn a facility, which compensated for the lack of education institutes in the region. Even poor students could commute from their villages to schools and colleges in Ludhiana city at nominal fairs,” said Jartauli while maintaining that withdrawal of the facility had affected hundreds of commuters from lower and middle sections of agrarian society.Residents of Rangian, Gopalpur, Brahmanmajra, Dhulkot, Nangal, Jartauli, Khera, Chupki, Kaind and Dulley villages are now forced to use alternative, expensive and unsafe means of transportation or spend extra money and time to reach Gill and Ahmedgarh stations to board trains.The Ahmedgarh railway station authorities confirmed that Ghungrana and Jassowal halt stations had been closed owing to decrease in number of passengers boarding trains from these points during the Covid pandemic.The Railways need not consult local authorities or state governments before closing halts stations unless these are opened at the formers instance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/closing-of-ghungrana-jassowal-halt-stations-inconveniences-residents-356513

Slow progress of development projects, despite best efforts of those assigned works, has left many dreams of locals unfulfilled.However, the year will also be remembered for commencement and continuance of major development works despite all odds. Residents expect a lot more to be done to enable them to live a dignified life in the future.AchievementsDevoted and dedicated outstanding working of the civil and health administration seems to have yielded desired results in preventing the spread of coronavirus by undertaking vaccination for all categories of eligible residents. Roping in of social organisations for vaccination camps nullified the adverse effect of the NHM healthcare officials’ agitation.Construction work on twin passage on Pohir Road railway overbridge and limited height underbridge is about to be completed. Heavy vehicles, school buses and commuters will benefit the most on the inauguration of the bridge. The civil administration has also given nod for the closure of Jagera Road level crossing on the Dhuri railway line for the construction of a proposed under bridge.Work on the long-pending demand of setting up sewage treatment plant (STP) has also been started by the Municipal Council, which when completed at cost of Rs8.5 crore, would facilitate disposal of waste water.The Government Elementary School, Amarpura, has been upgraded to Senior Secondary School and shifted to a new building constructed near the Bajrang Akhara road. The construction work of the building was also completed this year.Massive construction and repair work of many roads and streets, including Railway Road, Thana Road, Chand Cinema Road, Dehliz Road, Jawahar Nagar, Dhulkot Road and Amarpura streets has been undertaken with grants sanctioned by the government.The Municipal Council has also received more grants worth approximately Rs10 crore. Besides laying new water supply lines, the civic body has also installed two more tube wells for strengthening the water supply system.Primary health centre yet to be upgradedLong-pending demand for the upgradation of the primary health centre even after five years of establishment of the subdivision is yet pending. Social activists have succeeded in drawing the attention of the higher authorities in the Health Department towards need for a subdivision-level hospital in the town.Sewage continues to overflowThough major work of the STP project has been completed, overflowing sewage is still a major issue, which further compounds problems for the health authorities as stagnant water becomes a breeding bowl for pathogens and vectors.Water supply lines 30-year-oldInfrastructure for the water supply needs comprehensive upgrade as majority of pipelines are over 30-year-old. Already finding it hard to maintain regular supply of hygienic germfree drinking water, the Municipal Council is yet to draft a plan for the replacement of major pipelines.Waterlogging in low-lying localitiesThe town is already facing problem of water stagnation in low-lying localities. Increasing level of Railway Road, Dhulkot Road and Mahavir Road has aggravated waterlogging problem in these localities. Solid waste management still remains an unresolved issue as there is no sufficient and suitable place for dumping garbage.Poor bus serviceThe bus service, which has remained poor during past decades, has worsened further due to inaccessibility and blocking of the bus stand. Passengers have to either walk down or make alternative arrangements from Pohir or Jagera Bridge, which are situated over 3 km away from the main town.Besides, the administration has failed to solve the traffic congestion problem as encroachments continue in front of commercial establishments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/many-demands-of-residents-remain-unfulfilled-356520

He won the seat in 1997, 2005, 2012 and 2017. In 2007, SAD’s Jagjiwan Singh Khirnia won the election.Electorate strengthTotal voters - 1,71,083Male - 90,216Female - 80,862Third gender - 5Locals’ key demandsHaving won four Assembly elections out of five, Dhillon might face opposition from his own blood this time as the Shiromani Akali Dal has pitted one of his close relatives Paramjit Singh Dhillon as candidate.Though the constituency has received abundant funds and seen development, inadequate sewerage system and lack of parking facility for shops situated on recently widened Ludhiana-Chandigarh highway may go against Dhillon. Contrary to expectations, the six-laning of the highway resulted in disappointment among shop owners situated in the main markets at towns situated along it as customers find it difficult to park their vehicles now.Despite spending huge grants, executing agencies failed to accomplish development projects to the satisfaction of residents. Dhillon, on the other hand, claims: “I have left no stone unturned to work for residents of my constituency. The government overtook a private college at Machhiwara besides establishing a new ITI. We have also succeeded in widening major roads passing through the area and at least 400 km long link roads were reconstructed or repaired.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/awash-with-sewage-woes-356422
