Besides, he also raised questions over MC’s role in installing interlocking tiles on the said land.Harbhagat Grewal, a resident of Sarabha Nagar, alleged that a portion of government school land had been encroached in 2004 for widening of the road in an illegal manner.“As per the LIT’s layout plan, the road width is 20 feet, but it has been increased in an illegal manner. In 2014, an MC official had stated in a report that interlocking tiles were installed without any permission on the land. Instead of getting encroachment removed from the school land, the MC is now replacing old interlocking tiles with new,” he alleged.“Now, I have complained to the Chief Minister and requested him to fix responsibility of officials concerned to get the encroachment removed. The school land should not be used for road widening or constructing footpath,” he said. He further said that the MC’s F&CC had approved the work to install interlocking tiles there. MC Commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal said that he would look into the matter. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/complaint-to-cm-against-alleged-encroachment-356312

The freight carried during last month was 184 per cent more than average monthly loading, said senior railway officials.Officials of railway business development unit (BDU) said constant interaction with trade and industry in the region had yielded excellent results and the Railways had established a system in place to cater to varied needs of different kinds of trade and industry.For the benefit of small traders, 99 wagons were loaded during last month on piece-meal basis with food item, paper and potatoes, said an official of the BDO.Similarly, potatoes were loaded from Kapurthala station for carriage to different destinations in Assam and Nagaland, he added. From Jalandhar station, two farmers’ special trains loaded with potatoes were sent to Agartala in Tripura, he said.Railway officials further stated that processed food items were sent from Sahnewal (Ludhiana), Moga and Phillaur to North-East and other states while an export consignment of tractors was loaded from Nasrala station for Bangladesh.Significantly, 199 wagon-loads of tractors were transported during last month, which was 75 per cent more than average monthly loading.Lauding concerted efforts of the staff and officials of the BDO and other employees deployed for loading/unloading, Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Seema Sharma said of late several new kinds of goods other than traditional cargo, were being transported by Railways. At present, requirement of even a single wagon was also being met by Railways, DRM added.“We are in touch with potato-growing farmers and their organisations in Ludhiana, Moga, Hoshiarpur and Amritsar to motivate them for availing piece-meal cargo service being provided by Railways so that they can get better price for their produce,” DRM said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/rlys-ferozepur-div-earned-258-cr-from-freight-in-nov-356310
30-12-2021||Ludhiana||Bumpy ride on Noorwala Road inconveniences commuters||Located just about 1.7 km from GT Road (NH-44), residents of several colonies on and along Noorwala Road are a harassed lot due to its pathetic condition. The stretch provides access to the national highway, which commuters use to go to their work and business places in the city.The Municipal Corporation (MC) has washed its hands off the plight of the people justifiably so on the ground that this particular road and colonies are out of city limits. The proposal of the Public Works Department (PWD) for reconstruction of the road is gathering dust under red tapes.Affected residents have been taking up the matter with PWD officials as well as the MC (for the part of road that lies within the city limits), but their repeated pleas have not evoked any positive response so far.In yet another representation to the Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Varunesh Kumra and other area residents said the road was constructed as per standard provisions and specifications in 2016 and its normal life term expired in 2021 (a fact admitted by PWD officials).About reconstruction of the road, the department had intimated under Right to Information Act that an estimate was sent to the Finance Department for approval. The road would be reconstructed on allocation and receipt of funds.According to Kumra, who had been taking up the issue with government officials concerned, the Executive Engineer, Provincial Division, (Buildings and Roads), had admitted in one of his official letters that being mixed land use area and location of factories and commercial establishments on this road, the volume of traffic was high.But at the same time, the department had said that it could do nothing about the condition of the road that lied under the MC’s jurisdiction because extension of the city limit was a prerogative of the state government.Residents lamented that being nobody’s baby, Noorwala Road and colonies in this area had many other civic issues like sanitation and disposal of garbage for which neither the PWD not the MC were prepared to take the responsibility.Through a signed representation to the CM, affected residents, shopkeepers and members of industry, have urged the government to expedite approval of estimate sent by the PWD for the reconstruction of road and take appropriate steps to address other civic issues like sanitation and disposal of garbage by extension of the MC limit or by forming a nagar council for the benefit of more than one dozen colonies located along Noorwala Road on the city’s periphery. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bumpy-ride-on-noorwala-road-inconveniences-commuters-356309

These were the main enticements that pushed Gagandeep Singh, alias Gaggi, the main suspect in the “high-intensity” bomb blast at the district courts complex in Ludhiana on December 23, which left him dead and injured six others, into narco-terrorism, the investigations have revealed.The technical and documentary evidence found during the six-day multi-pronged probe by state and Central agencies have made startling revelations about the transformation of Gaggi from a cop to a terrorist in a decade.“While he was dismissed from service in a drug recovery case, he eventually lost his own life in the terror attack that he carried out,” the investigators said, while unravelling the result of Gaggi’s illegal activities.Senior officers monitoring the ongoing investigations disclosed that after being thrown out of the police service, the 29-year-old Gaggi was desperate to continue leading his lavish lifestyle to which he was used to during his days as head constable.“Since he was left with no source of income, the dismissed cop explored his links with jail inmates, with whom he came in contact during his two-year stay in Ludhiana jail, and subsequently, the local handlers and pro-Khalistan sympathisers started luring him into narco-terrorism,” senior officers said.The investigations further unravelled how Gaggi came in contact with A+ category militants linked to Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) and members of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and banned outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) based in Germany, Pakistan, Malaysia and even Dubai.“While he strengthened his contacts with international links through internet calls, foreign-based militants and separatists brought him close to several local terrorists and anti-national elements as well, who were already actively involved in terror and violence activities in Punjab and elsewhere,” senior officers added.The probe also found that the international masterminds also pushed the sacked policeman into narcotics trafficking with an aim to disturb law and order situation in the poll bound Punjab by spreading terror and violence in an organised manner.“For making him act on their diktats, the foreign masters provided him drugs, women and money as well, which prompted the dismissed cop to turn militant,” investigators observed.The examination of his phone call records and other gadgets traced so far also laid bare the lone blast deceased’s relationship with several women within and outside the police service.“Due to his relationship with other women, Gaggi’s relations with his wife were also somehow strained, but she continued to accept all this as he used to shower her money besides fulfilling her other daily demands to keep her satisfied,” investigation officers have traced.The probe has also deciphered that the dismissed cop-turned-militant was active in a network of anti-national and separatist elements through personal and virtual meetings. “His close links with those found involved in other terror and violence strikes were also being further probed to ascertain his role in other cases, if any,” officers maintained.A planned strikeInvestigations so far have come across ample evidence suggesting that the explosion in the Ludhiana district court complex was a “planned” strike, executed with an aim to create terror and panic ahead of the Assembly elections in Punjab due early next year. “While judiciary was the main target as the suspect was facing a trial in a drug recovery case that took his cop’s job, the blast was also aimed at claiming public lives and causing loss to the public property in the poll-bound state,” investigators revealed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/drugs-money-lured-gaggi-into-narco-terrorism-probe-356307
