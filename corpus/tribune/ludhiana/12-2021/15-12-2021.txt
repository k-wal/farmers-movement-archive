The buildings were being used as “unauthorised” godowns for commercial purposes in the area, according to the MC.An official said a resident of the area had earlier moved the court against the godowns.“The MC had taken action against the godown buildings. The owners concerned had then requested the civic body to unseal the buildings so that they could set up godowns in another area. The buildings were later unsealed during the Covid pandemic but the godowns were still running from the area. Now, the complainant has filed a contempt petition in the court,” he said.ATP MS Bedi said they had sealed all eight godowns running from the residential area today. The hearing in the case was scheduled to be held in January 2022.However, questions are being raised over the role of the MC as to why it failed to take timely action when the godowns were opened in the residential area.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/after-resident-moves-court-ludhiana-municipal-corporation-seals-eight-godowns-in-residential-area-350466

Both these factors contributed in making the kendra at the Civil Hospital into a fruitless venture.Though medicines are given free of cost to patients at the Civil Hospital but since the medicines are in shortage most of the times at its pharmacy also, patients often visit the Jan Aushadi Kendra but they have to return empty handed from there also due to unavailability of the medicines.Narain, a patient, who had come to the hospital for taking his medicine for a skin-related problem, said the medicine was not available at the store so he came to the kendra but it was not available there also. Now, he is left with no other option but to buy it from a chemist at higher price.Anju, who had come to a gynaecologist for her check-up, said only two medicines were available at the pharmacy and then she came to the kendra to buy the remaining but none was available here.“Why has the hospital opened the kendra as I never get any medicine from here,” she rued.Ensuring availability of quality medicines at affordable prices to all was the main key objective of the government behind opening the Jan Aushadhi Kendras. Generic versions of medicines that are required in day-to-day basis should be made available here.Generic medicines are available at the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and the list of medicines available here is also provided to doctors of the Civil Hospital so that they can prescribe medicines according to salt, and not brand.Hospital pharmacy too faces drug shortageThough medicines are given free of cost to patients at the Civil Hospital but since the medicines are in shortage most of the times at its pharmacy also, patients often visit the Jan Aushadi Kendra but they have to return empty handed from there also due to unavailability of the medicines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/jan-aushadhi-kendra-at-civil-hospital-ludhiana-sans-medicines-350469

This will give a major boost to the economic development of Ludhiana and help attract more investment and jobs for the Punjab industrial hub. Charanjit Singh Channi, CMSharing details, Deputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma told The Tribune, here on Tuesday that of the total five eligible bidders, Synergy Thrislington of Solan was awarded the work to construct the interim terminal building of the new international airport after being found to be the lowest and the most suitable bidder.He disclosed that the firm has been given six months to complete the allotted work.Divulging the progress of the ongoing work, Superintending Engineer, PWD (B&R), Rakesh Garg, said the interim airport terminal will be built on the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode on the lump sum basis at the Halwara air base.He said the already awarded work for the construction of internal roads, estate public health services and campus lighting at the airport terminal has picked up pace. The work was allotted to Ludhiana-based Ceigall India Limited at Rs 1,604.15 lakh on the EPC mode with six-month completion deadline.After missing the January 2022 deadline earlier set by the state government to make the new airport operational following much delay in granting the final approval from the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the PWD (B&R) had floated two separate tenders for the construction of the airport project.While the construction of an internal approach road, taxiway, car parking and apron has been in progress for the last month, the work has begun to design an interim terminal building.It was on October 22 that the AAI had accorded formal nod to the construction of a new interim terminal building for the upcoming international airport at the cost of Rs 4,691.12-lakh.The project entails construction of interim terminal building spread over 2,000 square metre area with other associated works, including construction of apron, taxiway, car parking and development of internal approach road.According to the AAI nod, the interim terminal building will be constructed by the Punjab Government through the state government funds, which will be reimbursed to Punjab or its designated agency by the AAI after monetisation of its land at the existing Sahnewal airport in Ludhiana.Already, the construction of the airport link road and 2,333-metre-long boundary wall has been completed.In a bid to give a boost to the industrial and economic activity in the state, the Punjab Government and the AAI are jointly setting up a new international civil terminal at the Air Force Station in Halwara, which is one of the oldest frontline airbases of the Indian Air Force (IAF), close to Ludhiana.Sahnewal airport to shutLudhiana, which is Punjab’s largest industrial and business city with a population of nearly four million people, is presently serviced by a small domestic airport at Sahnewal, which will be shut once the new international airport begins operations.

Corruption and unemployment are also major issues in the constituency.Master Avtar Singh, a Jagraon resident, said: “A short spell of rain is enough to flood the roads here.

There is no check on the quality of works being done by the municipal council here.”Residents also want promotion of sports in the constituency.
