The LMA also has over 400 student members, she informed.Kang added that the LMA has been recognised and conferred with accolades like the Best LMA Award for the year 2010 and again for the year 2014 out of the total 67 LMAs or local management associations under the AIMA across the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/governor-presents-achievement-awards-to-6-business-leaders-351646

They were protesting over regularisation of their services.Determined to get their demand accepted and implemented before the Assembly elections, the protesters left no stone unturned to build pressure on the administration by obstructing the national highway and other link roads during the protest.Commuters, including patients and elderly persons, had to travel extra distance on bumpy link roads to reach their destinations during the first 12 hours of the 36-hour blockade announced by the protesters.Gagan Walia, a petrol pump owner from Khanna city, had to suffer extra agony and stress due to the blockade when he was going for a follow-up treatment from a heart care centre in Ludhiana after a recent bypass surgery. “The unfortunate part was that the protesters were allowing only ambulances to pass on the road but patients travelling in private cars were not being allowed to go,” said Walia.Former civil surgeon KC Goyal, Pawan Sharma of Green Avenue Ahmedgarh and Rajesh Narad of Pohir village were among those who reached their destinations late by three-four hours as even alternative routes had also been blocked at many places.Office-bearers of the Theka Mulazim Sangharsh Committee Balihar Singh and Shiv Singh Khanna said they had to take the step as they failed to draw the attention of the government towards their demands. “Earlier we had blocked traffic for only four hours and the administration had persuaded us to lift the blockade on the promise of arranging a meeting with the authorities concerned on November 30. However, nobody listened to our grievances till 10 pm on the scheduled day,” Balihar said.The protesters, accompanied by their families, including infants and elderly members, lamented that as many as 50 memoranda forwarded to Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi had failed to yield desired results.They threatened to intensify the protest by blocking other highways too in case their demand was not accepted by 8 pm on Saturday.Threaten to intensify protestThe protesting contractual employees working with various government departments have threatened to intensify their protest by blocking other highways too in case their demand is not accepted by the authorities by 8 pm on Saturday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/contractual-staff-lay-siege-to-nh-351655

Nationalisation of banks was a gift to the nation which was given by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1969. Public sector banks had played an important role in development of the country through green and white revolutions. These were not possible without the assistance of the public sector banks. However, the Centre was making all efforts to destroy the public sector banks, which were pillars of the Indian economy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/bank-staff-strike-enters-day-2-351663
