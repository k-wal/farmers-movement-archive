The restrictions on international travel are bound to get more stringent. So, it is better to be safe rather than getting stuck in a possible lockdown scenario. Feeling sad and frustrated.”This is not the only case of cancellation of invitation. Many locals have reported cancellation of invitations received earlier from families expecting NRI guests and hosts.Gopal Goyal, a caterer from Raikot, informed that at least 26 bookings for providing services in January were either cancelled or postponed till next date to be fixed after restrictions on international travel were lifted permanently. Cancellation of visits of some NRI family members was cited to be the main reason behind cancellation or postponement of the scheduled programmes.Rishi Joshi, organiser of a light and sound group, claimed that 10 programmes, booked for January had been cancelled on similar pretext. He had to bear substantial loss as singers and artistes, engaged for the purpose, were not ready to adjust advance amounts for any future programme, Joshi added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/travel-restrictions-lead-to-cancellation-of-functions-350959

People commuting on the stretch are facing a lot of inconveniences as the stretch lies broken. Industrialists of the area have alleged that the road construction work is going on at slow pace.After a meeting with the contractor and industrialists last month, Municipal Corporation (MC) officials had then claimed that the former was directed to complete the pending work. Meanwhile, industrialists alleged that the road construction work was being delayed once again. They demanded that the MC authorities should get the work completed at the earliest.VS Gill, member, the Sua Road Industrialists’ Association, said the contractor had deployed men just for a few days after industrialists raised the matter before the MC last month. A portion of the road was dug up 10 days ago, he said. Later, the road construction work was stopped again, leaving the public to face inconvenience, he added.Ready mix concrete (RMC) work on Sua Road was started in December 2020 and the contractor concerned was supposed to complete the project (estimated cost of Rs3 crore) within six months. Earlier, industrialists had raised questions over ‘poor’ road construction work in March 2021. Later, the project was stalled by the contractor without completion. In November, MC’s additional commissioner had visited the project site and instructed officials concerned to do the needful to get the road project completed.A member of the industrialists association said they were assured that the road work would be completed soon, but to no avail. Industrialists were facing financial losses as the road work had not been completed even after one year, he added.Meanwhile, executive engineer Surinder Singh said the road construction work was underway. The contractor had been asked to complete the road work by December 31, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/slow-pace-of-road-construction-work-irks-industrialists-350962

Many new units had come up in the state and many more are in pipeline, they added. The delegation discussed several vital issues with the CM.Members said their main concern was that manufacturers of steel were buying required scrap against tax invoice. There remained an uncertainty over whether tax paid on purchase of scrap was deposited by the seller with exchequer or not, members added.“It is not only resulting in revenue loss in some cases, but also portrays genuine buyers as tainted as far as purchases and input credit is concerned,” said delegation members.“The best alternative to stem the bogus billing and to avoid hardship to genuine buyers of steel scrap is that the GST on scrap should be reduced to 2.5 per cent-5 per cent so that there is no incen rupulous dealers to evade tax,” members delegation added.“In turn the government will get due GST payment @ 18 per cent from manufacturers/furnace industry on their final product as output,” said delegation members.“The Punjab Government is levying tax after tax on power. The rates of such taxes are being raised arbitrarily. It badly hits state’s steel industry, which is already facing huge crisis. The tax rate should be nominal,” delegation members added.KK Gupta, association president, said, “Steel prices are fixed according to the situation of the market on the basis of demand and supply. Generally the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), a Government of India enterprise, fixes steel rates for a specific period. The rates are available on its websites.”“SAIL fixes the rate of steel material on the basis of demand and supply and after considering the market situation. The SMS service providers, who are neither manufacturers nor authorised by any competent authority to fix and circulate steel rates, are fraudulently circulating fake/wrong and frivolous steel prices through their mobile phones every 15 minutes. There is no market in the world, where steel prices change every 15 minutes. The main purpose of such persons is only to play ‘Satta’ on steel prices deliberately circulated by them. This SMS service needs to be checked and stopped,” Gupta added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/induction-furnace-assn-delegation-meets-cm-350965

In harsh situations living in trailers, trucks and makeshift arrangements, life is difficult both from physical and mental point of view,” said Dr Mitra.“Living away from their families for days altogether in uncertainties leads to several mental problems. In such situations hygienic conditions are poor and basic amenities are lacking, which accentuate health issues. That is why a large number of people had abdominal, chest, joint and even cardiac problems. Many of these increased because of lack of timely care,” Dr Mitra added.“But, it is to great satisfaction that the farmers’ movement has succeeded. Their success has paved the way for movements for justice and equality,” Dr Mitra added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/harmony-maintained-by-farmers-gives-lesson-to-society-say-doctors-350972
