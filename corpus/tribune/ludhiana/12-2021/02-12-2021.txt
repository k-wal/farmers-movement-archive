Protesting union members are demanding implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission of Punjab.

The teachers are demanding that the UGC pay scales should be revised as had been done by all states and the decision to delink from UGC scales be withdrawn. As professor Kingra started the fast, university and college teachers started ‘Education band” across the state.Addressing the teachers on the occasion Dr Jagwant Singh, general secretary, PFUCTO, said unfortunately, the state government was acting in a “shameless” manner.“Its decision is in direct contradiction with regulations of the UGC and cannot be contravened by the state government.

Faridkot remained the most polluted city with highest AQI 357, followed by Jalandhar AQI 243.The poor air quality has left the Maximum City of Punjab under a dense envelope of smog, especially in the morning and evening hours, with the rise in respiratory problems due to ‘very unhealthy’ AQI.On November 30, which was the concluding day of the current kharif season, Ludhiana topped the state with a maximum of two fire events, while the state recorded a total of five cases, including one each in Fatehgarh Sahib, Gurdaspur and Kapurthala.The last 10-day data of this crop season showed that Ludhiana recorded one farm fire on November 29, three on November 28, two (day’s maximum in state) on November 27, none on November 26 and 25, four on November 24, two each (again day’s highest in state) on November 23 and 22 and 10 each on November 21 and 20.The farm fires spotted this kharif season have broken the record of previous four years when 4,330 such cases were reported during the entire season till November 30 in 2020, 2,532 in 2019, 2,481 in 2018 and 3,239 in 2017.
