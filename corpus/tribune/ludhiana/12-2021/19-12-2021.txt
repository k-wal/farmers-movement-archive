All your planning for the next day is futile since you never know whether you will ever reach your destination on time or not. I have been getting regularly late for my office for the past two days. Since ours is biometric-based attendance, I had to take short leave for both days. The situation in evening is no better when you come to know that you cannot commute on the highway due to the obstruction created by the contractual staff, said an annoyed teacher.“Such protest is not justified. There are hundred other ways in which one can hold a protest but the manner in which the public is harassed by protesters is wrong. None can approve of a protest where an ambulance has to remain stranded, staff fail to reach their offices on time and students suffer in cold weather on roads. The commuters who have to cover long distances are the worst sufferers,” said another commuter.Khanna SSP Balwinder Singh said the dharna had been lifted as the Chief Minister had agreed to listen to contractual staff tomorrow at 6 in the evening.“The traffic flow has normalised. We were trying our level best since yesterday that the dharna be lifted so that commuters suffer the least. With the combined efforts of the administration and the police department coupled with the readiness shown by Cabinet Minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli, we succeeded in fixing an appointment of the contractual employees with the Chief Minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/public-bear-the-brunt-as-protests-become-order-of-the-day-in-region-351885
