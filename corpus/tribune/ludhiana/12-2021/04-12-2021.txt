For over a year now, the LIT and the Municipal Corporation authorities have been corresponding with each other without any positive outcome until now.It is indeed intriguing that the 100-foot road had been encroached upon in one of the busy localities on the Pakhowal road. The MC and the LIT continue to pass the buck and none of these institutions are prepared to confirm or deny existence of the road, which still existed in the layout plans of the colony prepared by the Trust and also handed over to the Town Planning Department of the MC.In a complaint to the Punjab Chief Secretary and Principal Secretary, Local Government, Punjab, a city-based social activist, Nalin Kaushik, an advocate, has alleged that LIT and MC officials had shut their eyes to the issue of ‘missing road’, which had been allegedly occupied by unlawful means for construction of residential houses, commercial buildings and even religious institutions.As per information obtained by Kaushik under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, LIT officials had maintained that the status of the road or for that matter any encroachment on public road would be known to the MC as the scheme had been transferred to the civic body for maintenance and building control was also with the MC authorities.In his complaint, Kaushik said on the issue of ‘missing road’ and encroachment thereon, the complaint and enquiry branch of the MC had intimated him that information about the road had been sought from the LIT and a letter by the MC building branch (377/ATP-D dated August 19, 2020) had been written to the LIT executive officer.“Later, the LIT officials also intimated me (vide letter LIT/6334 dated November 20, 2020) that the information and layout of the scheme sought by the MC had been provided to the messenger by the Drawing Department,” said the complainant.“Little or no efforts were made to gain the possession of the land (under encroachment) since the 100-foot road had to be constructed to connect Vikas Nagar with Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar while passing through Pakhowal road along Sidhwan Canal and the Ferozepur railway line,” the complainant contended.Now that MC officials had been given the layout plan of the scheme and have also been told about encroachment on the said road for almost a year, no worthwhile action seemed to have been taken in this regard, he said, demanding that encroachment on the road should be removed and strict disciplinary action be taken against negligent officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/100-foot-road-disappears-ludhiana-improvement-trust-mc-play-blame-game-346026

Besides giving a major boost to the economic development of Ludhiana, the airport will also improve the air connectivity of the industrial capital of the state. Charanjit Singh Channi, Chief MinisterSharing details, Deputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma, who is monitoring the progress of the work on the airport project on a daily basis, told The Tribune, here on Friday, that the lowest and the most suitable bidder will be allotted the work to construct the interim terminal building of the new international airport within the next few days.He said all five successful financial bids have been opened and are being examined as per the laid down specifications and norms. “The award of work will be done before December 15, when the work on the construction of the interim terminal building is slated to begin on ground,” the DC revealed.After missing the January 2022 deadline earlier set by the state government to make the new airport operational following much delay in granting the final approval from the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the PWD (B&R) had floated two separate tenders for the construction of the airport project.While the construction of an internal approach road, taxiway, car parking and apron had already started on ground last month, the deadline for starting the construction of the interim terminal building has been fixed for December 15.It was on October 22 that the AAI had accorded formal nod to the construction of a new interim terminal building for the upcoming international airport at the cost of Rs 4,691.12 lakh.The project entails construction of interim terminal building spread over 2,000 square metre area with other associated works, including construction of apron, taxiway, car parking and development of internal approach road.The government has fixed a six-month deadline for the construction of the interim terminal building and associated works, which will be completed till June 30 next year.According to the AAI nod, the interim terminal building will be constructed by the Punjab Government through the state government funds, which will be reimbursed to Punjab or its designated agency by the AAI after monetisation of its land at the existing Sahnewal airport in Ludhiana.Already, the construction of the airport link road and 2,333-metre-long boundary wall has been completed.In a bid to give a boost to the industrial and economic activity in the state, the Punjab Government and the AAI are jointly setting up a new international civil terminal at the Air Force Station in Halwara, which is one of the oldest frontline airbases of the Indian Air Force (IAF), close to Ludhiana.Ludhiana, which is Punjab’s largest industrial and business city with a population of nearly 4 million, is presently serviced by a small domestic airport at Sahnewal, which will be shut once the new international airport begins operations. Ludhiana also has the advantage of being at the geographical centre of Punjab.The Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) had acquired land measuring 161.28 acres — 135.54 acres for airport and 25.74 acres for future development.While the work on the construction of 3-metrer-high with 660-mm thick punch tape concertina and barbed wire fencing has been completed by the PWD (B&R) at Rs 301.16 lakh provided by GLADA, the widening and strengthening of the existing 5.1-km link road from Aitiana village to the international airport from existing 10 ft to 18 ft width has been completed by the Punjab Mandi Board at Rs 8.17 crore. The work also included the construction of two bridges, each of 8 metre span, on the Halwara drain.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/five-bids-opened-for-international-airports-interim-terminal-building-346031

The protesters accused the government of not regularising their services despite giving assurances for the past three months.Many private buses were stationed on the road as bus stand gates were closed by the protesting employees. Thus, the traffic jam occurred on the stretch outside the bus stand. The passengers were seen waiting for the resumption of bus service inside the bus stand too.Punjab Roadways, PUNBUS and PRTC Contract Workers Union leader Satnam Singh said they staged a protest as their demands have not been met by the government. He said the services of contractual employees are not being regularised by the government.“When Capt Amarinder Singh was the Chief Minister, he had assured us that our services will be regularised. After that Transport Minister Raja Warring and Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi gave similar assurances but nothing has been done to regularise our services to date”, the protesting employees said.The union members have also demanded that along with the regularisation of their services, 10,000 new buses should be purchased for strengthening the government bus services. They said the number of Roadways buses have reduced to 399 from 2,407, while the Punjab Chief Minister and Transport Minister are making claims of providing free bus facility.
