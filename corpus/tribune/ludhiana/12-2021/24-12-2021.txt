But, the chief of no political party came to attend the event for sharing their party’s agenda to save natural resources and for protection of environment. Most of the political parties even failed to send their representatives.Padma Shri awardee Sant Balbir Singh Seechewal, Padma Shree awardee Baba Sewa Singh from Khadoor Sahib, Padam Bhushan awardee Dr Inderjit Kaur from Pingalwara, Amritsar, former Jathedar, Takht Shri Damdama Sahib, Giani Kewal Singh, former Chairman of PPCB Kahan Singh Pannu were among the environmental activists present.The representatives of the Shiromani Akali Dal and BJP, however, came to share their views during the event, while a representative from the Aam Aadmi Party reached late in the event. No representative from the Congress, Lok Insaaf Party and Punjab Lok Congress, etc, came to attend the event.On the occasion, the People’s Green election manifesto for the Punjab Assembly elections was released by Punjab Vatavaran Chetna Lehar.The political parties have been asked to mention in their manifestoes that what steps will be taken by them to save the groundwater and stop air, water, noise and soil pollution and also for solid waste management, if their party forms the government in Punjab in 2022.With making an appeal to the people to join hands to save natural resources, Balbir Singh Seechewal said it is a very sad state of affairs that no political party has talked about the environmental issues yet. “We don’t demand drugs or money but we demand a clean environment. Our vote will go to that party which will ensure steps to protect the environment,” he said.Dr Inderjit Kaur of Pingalwara, Amritsar, said the environment has to be a top priority in the state as the health of the citizens is deteriorating and medical facilities can never be enough in a situation where a polluted environment is causing disease burden.Giani Kewal Singh said the political persons want “Chair” not society and they fight for the “Chair”. He raised questions as none political party chief came to attend today’s event, aimed to save the environment. During his speech, he termed MPs and MLAs as ‘chowkidars’ of their respective constituency.Gurpreet Singh Chandbaja of the Bhai Ghanaiya Cancer Roko Seva Society and Naroa Punjab Manch said, “We wanted from chiefs of political parties to share their agenda that what they will do to save the environment but they did not come today.”“All the toxic effluent is thrown into the Buddha Nullah by Ludhiana city and industries and it further pollutes the Sutlej. The polluted water flows out of the taps of homes in south Punjab as it is the only source of drinking water for the residents there. This is a violation of their fundamental right to live guaranteed by the Constitution and sadly genocide by pollution but politicians hardly care,” he said.Ranjodh Singh, president, Ramgarhia Educational Council, said leaders rarely raise an issue concerning the environment from their election rallies. Some activists also raised the demand for cancellation of the state government’s proposed modern industrial park to be set up near the Sutlej and Mattewara Forest but none of the political parties has yet given assurance to cancel or shift the location of the project.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/activists-slam-politicians-for-ignoring-environment-issues-352832

She said they had written to the Chief Minister, Department of Local Bodies, PPCB and Directorate of Environment and Climate Change, but to no avail. The departments concerned had failed to take any step to enforce the ban due to which the NGO was forced to stage protests.Mahinder Singh Sekhon of Punjabi Bhasha Passar Bhaichara also participated in the protest, demanding proper enforcement of the ban on single-use plastic. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ngo-protests-demands-ban-on-single-use-plastic-352844

To protest against the proposed move, the traders and shopkeepers held a convention today.Tarun Jain Bawa from the Bhartiya Arthik Party said time and again, respective governments were pressing the trade and industry by imposing taxes in one form or the other. GST on garment, textiles and footwear was increased earlier from 0 per cent to 5 per cent and now, from January 1, it was going to be increased to 12 per cent, which will ruin the businesses, he said.He said corporate houses were promoted to finish the small industries.Sonu Nilibar from the Cloth Merchant Association here said the textile and handloom sectors were providing highest employment in the country after the agriculture sector. Instead of extending incentives and required support to these sectors, the government was adamant to finish them, said Nilibar.He said the traders and manufacturers were not happy when 5 per cent GST was imposed, now, further 7 per cent increase would cripple the industry.The Punjab Cloth Merchants Association is regularly submitting representations to the Finance Minister and the Central Government not to levy high rates of GST (12 per cent) . More than 100 representations from all across the country have already been sent to the PMO, FM and Textile Minister.The traders are of the view that the government would not be benefited by increasing GST. Instead, when prices of suits, sarees and readymade garments will be increased from 15-20 per cent, more people will indulge in non-billed transactions or under-invoicing.Another meeting of leaders on the issue will be held on December 30.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/traders-oppose-move-to-hike-gst-on-textile-352847

However, the Municipal Corporation (MC), Ludhiana, is ‘continuously violating’ the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, even after facing environmental compensation of Rs 1.8 crore for the same.The MC has failed to resume waste processing at its main garbage dump site spread on around 50 acres near Kakka village even over 10 months after a private firm, A2Z group, terminated its services in February this year.Thus, a large amount of waste is getting collected, forcing people of nearby areas to suffer.The main garbage dump has been contaminating the groundwater. Earlier, the NGT had also given directions to the civic body to ensure waste processing and make alternative arrangements of water for residents living in nearby areas.A former councillor, Inder Aggarwal, said: “The A2Z group had given an ultimatum to terminate its services on December 24 and it had then terminated the services in February. The MC had not taken any steps to make required arrangementsto handle solid waste as per rules after the passage of almost one year. Thus, huge heaps of waste are coming up at the main dumping site. The civic body is openly violating the solid waste management rules.”Earlier also, civic body teams had visited Indore, Chennai, Delhi, Rajasthan and Prayagraj (Allahabad) to study the solid waste management system but no model has been introduced at the ground level in the city. Around 1,100 MT of waste is generated in the city on a daily basis while lakhs of metric tonnes of waste has got collected at the main dumping site as the waste processing is not being done by the MC.A resident of Kakka Road said: “We had raised the issue many times but the Municipal Corporation and other government authorities concerned ignored the serious threat to us. We have been left to suffer due to the stench emanating from the garbage. People are forced to live under threat of catching diseases due to collection of a huge amount of waste in the area.”Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said the civic body would hire a consultant to finalise the plan for better solid waste management in the city. He said a detailed project report regarding the solid waste management would be prepared.Continues violation even after facing compensationThe Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana, is ‘continuously violating’ the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, even after facing an environmental compensation of Rs1.8 crore for the same.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/civic-body-fails-to-ensure-waste-processing-at-main-dumping-site-353093

Justice Madaan also directed the forwarding of the order’s copy for compliance to the rent controller concerned through Ludhiana District and Sessions Judge. Justice Madaan was hearing a civil revision petition by a 73-year-old woman. She was aggrieved by the slow pace of proceedings in the “ejectment petition” filed against the respondent-tenant.Keeping in view the nature of request, Justice Madaan asserted that the court did not feel the necessity of issuing notice to the respondent. After hearing the petitioner’ counsel and going through the record, especially the interim orders, Justice Madaan asserted that issues were framed in November 2018 and the case was fixed for the petitioner’s evidence.The interim orders thereafter showed that an application for amendment to the written reply was filed on respondent-tenant’s behalf, which was decided vide order dated May 14, 2019, after four months and several dates. The case then stood adjourned twice for filing amended written reply. The case was fixed for the petitioner’s evidence again. The affidavit of a witness was filed on September 9, 2019, and of another on October 22, 2019. But their cross examination could not be got completed for several dates.Justice Madaan added that the courts’ functioning was affected for some time following Covid outbreak. But a perusal of the interim orders showed every attempt was made on the respondent’s behalf to stretch the proceedings with his counsel either praying for adjournment or not being present in the court when the case was listed.“The rent controller has shown over indulgence to the respondent in granting adjournments liberally, which fact cannot be appreciated. The rent controller should have been sensitive to the plight of a senior citizen,” Justice Madaan added.Justice Madaan directed the rent controller to dispose of the rent petition expeditiously by giving short adjournments and disallowing requests for adjournments, except for “very compelling reasons to be recorded in the interim orders”.“If it is found that the respondent is still trying to stretch the proceedings by not cross examining the petitioner’s witnesses, the rent controller may think of either appointing some legal aid counsel to represent the respondent to conduct proceedings on his behalf or close the cross examination by order,” Justice Madaan added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/dispose-of-senior-citizens-case-expeditiously-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-to-rent-controller-353099

The shop is situated in a densely populated area and fire could have spread to the adjoining buildings had the fire brigade not reached the spot on time.Due to winter season a huge stock was already kept in the shop and the entire stock was gutted in the fire. The loss is said to be in several lakhs of rupees.As per information, the fire station got information about the fire at 9.10 am. Due to the narrow road and huge rush in the market, initially a small fire tender was sent to douse the flames. Later when fire could not be controlled, traffic was stopped and big fire tenders were pressed into service.The adjoining shopkeepers after noticing the smoke billowing out from the building tried to douse the flames with available fire extinguishers but they failed. They then immediately informed the fire brigade.Fire men took more than two hours to completely douse the flames.Shopkeepers said the fire started due to a spark from the dangling high tension wires passing over the shops in the market. They alleged that many a time complaints were given to the authorities for either shifting these wires or tying them properly so that any untoward incident do not happen. Even ruling party politicians were also requested to pursue the matter with the authorities but nobody listened to them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/garment-shop-gutted-in-fire-at-gandhi-nagar-market-in-ludhiana-353100

The outcome of the enquiry is yet to be known.Meanwhile, Rajinder Ghai, president, Parents’ Association, said on December 17, he had sent a written complaint to the Chief Minister and others when the local Education Department did not take a proper action against the male teacher.“We had brought into to the notice of the authorities concerned that the teacher was harassing girl students. Two days passed, but no action was taken against him. When we saw the matter being taken up lightly by the department, we wrote to the CM and others concerned and immediately, an enquiry was marked into the incident,” said Ghai.Association members visited the school and interacted with the staff, parents and others, Ghai added.“But we feel that because of social pressure, parents are not willing to pursue the matter. But that does not mean the teacher should not be punished for his wrong-doings,” said Ghai.It may be mentioned here that a girl student of the particular school had approached the Parents’ Association about a male teacher, who had molested a student. The association approached the Principal and DEO office too but the department “just transferred” the teacher to a boys’ school as he had tendered an apology.

They have also sought action against those private dealers, who had been exploiting helplessness of farmers by forcing them to buy unnecessary products, at exorbitant prices while selling urea.Assuring farmers of regularising supplies soon, senior functionaries in the Cooperative Department informed that there was shortage fertilisers due to low supply by MARKFED.Protesters led by the Ludhiana district president, Bhartia Kisan Union (Kadian), Hardeep Singh Giaspura, and the All India Kisan Sabha leader, Baldev Singh Latala, alleged that farmers cultivating wheat and potato were suffering due to acute shortage of sowing season inputs, including urea and fertilisers. They alleged that the Punjab Government was not concerned about genuine needs of farmers.The protesters said senior functionaries in the government, including Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and other ministers, were hand in glove with manufacturing companies, which were all out to exploit helplessness of farmers.“We fail to understand how manufacturers are supplying all fertilisers, along with unnecessary products, to private dealers, but not to the Cooperative Department,” Giaspura said while alleging that manufacturers were forcing private dealers to sell unnecessary products at exorbitant prices, along with urea bags.A blockade on the Ludhiana-Chandigarh highway was lifted temporarily after being assured by the authorities concerned about regular supply of fertilisers within a couple of days, he added.“But, nothing concrete has yet been done to replenish urea at godowns of cooperative societies in the region. Now, we will wait for two days and start blocking highways at various places from Friday onwards,” he said.Meanwhile, Prabhjit Kaur Dhillon and Dara Singh, senior functionaries of the Cooperative Department and the Punjab Agriculture Department, respectively, claimed that sincere efforts were being made to requisition enough supplies from MARKFED.

Sale deeds of those colonies located in khasra numbers of land uploaded on the public domain by departments concerned as unauthorised/illegal colonies will also not be registered.To prevent haphazard growth of unplanned and illegal colonies in Punjab, the officials concerned are hereby directed that before registering any conveyance deed, the list uploaded on the portal of the Revenue Department containing authorised and unauthorised colonies, along with khasra numbers, may be examined carefully. Special Chief Secretary-cum-Financial Commissioner, PunjabIn speaking orders given by the Special Chief Secretary-cum-Financial Commissioner (FCR), Punjab, on November 22, 2021, it has been stated: “I accordance with directions issued by the Punjab and Haryana High Court during disposal of a civil write petition (CWP 133/2021), all registration officers in the state have been asked not to insist on obtaining NOC before registration of sale deeds as it will cause unnecessary harassment to the general public.”“However, in the interest of preventing haphazard growth of unplanned and illegal colonies in Punjab, you are hereby directed that before registering any conveyance deed the list uploaded on the portal of this department containing authorised and unauthorised colonies, along with khasra numbers may be examined,” the FCR added.The FCR further intimated revenue officials that this (Revenue) department would soon be issuing a notification under Section 19-A(1)(C) of the Registration Act, along with a list of legal and illegal colonies and khasra numbers.“Only in case the property sought to be transferred falls in khasra numbers of illegal colonies the registration is to be refused as per relevant provisions of the Registration Act,” the FCR said.Meanwhile, in a related development, the Ludhiana Municipal Corporation (MC) put on agenda a proposal, discussed at the General House meeting held here today, to ask Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to issue new electricity connections only if approved building plans of premises and documents in support of the property having been regularised were produced by applicants.Taking up the issue of release of new electricity connections to properties located in illegal colonies once again with the PSPCL, the Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) regretted that in spite of clear instructions in this regard, the matter was not being taken seriously by power utility officials.In an official letter dated December 21, 2021, the Chief Administrator (CA) of GLADA has written to the PSPCL Chief Engineer/Central Zone that in accordance with Section 20 sub section (2) of PAPRA (Amended Act) and provision made under the regularisation policy no electricity, sewer, water and telephone connections could be issued to any building or land situated in an unlicensed colony and no sale deeds of properties in such colonies would be registered.GLADA emphasised upon the PSPCL not to issue any new electricity connection to unlicensed/illegal colonies and if any power connections have been issued, these be disconnected forthwith.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/revenue-department-tightens-noose-around-illegal-colonies-353439

On the one hand cancellation of board exams came as a sigh of relief for lakhs of students and their parents, one the other hand switching to online classes brought unprecedented challenges for them.Nearly two years into the Covid-19 pandemic, students were affected by partial or full school closures, which took toll on the physical as well as mental well-being of students and teachers. Though exams were conducted offline in majority of the city schools, students were made to study online. Besides, the students appearing of board classes of major boards — Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Punjab School of Education Board (PSEB) — have to appear for twice for the exams in November/December and February/March, which is altogether a difference experience for students as well as for the teachers.No board exams for Classes X, XIIFor the first time, the board exams of Classes X and XII got cancelled due to Covid spread. The decision received mixed response from students as well as parents. While the intelligent students maintained that their percentage suffered as they were expecting high percentage, other students were elated with the decision. Even many parents looked unsatisfied as they felt that students were neglecting their studies.Focus of government schools on enrolmentAs the classes were mostly conducted online, parents asked the private schools to either waive the extra expenses, else they will not pay the fee. As a result, parents started to enrol their wards in public schools. Government schools also lapped up the opportunity and focused on enrolling maximum new students. While in Ludhiana alone, 12,071 new students were enrolled from private schools, approximately 46.73 per cent. The total number of students in primary schools is 25,834. Similarly, in secondary classes, 13,763 students switched over to government schools with amounts to approximately 53 per cent.Govt schools enrolment hike claims fall flatWhile the records of the government schools showed exemplary increase in the number of students, many teachers in government schools alleged that this enrolment was just on papers.

The first term was held in November/December for classes X and XII while second term will be held anywhere in February/March. Mixed response of students was witnessed over the new pattern.Several teachers succumb to virusThe government as well as private schools reported fresh cases of Covid due to which panic gripped city residents. Parents and teachers condemned government and private school managements for starting offline classes. Many private schools even switched over to offline classes for small children. Several teachers lost lives in the second wave of Covid-19, last year.Parents protest against fee hikeWhen many school managements went strict with parents to deposit school fees, protests were held outside several private schools. The parents wanted schools to waive or decrease the fee while schools had expressed helplessness as their overheads remained the same.Online functions, events in schoolsLast year, most of the events were held online for the students amid the Covid crisis.

At the site earmarked for school, the developer had planted eucalyptus trees while untreated STP and WTP discharge (water) was being drained into the school site which had become a big nuisance.The residents’ body said similarly, the club house and a community centre which were promised at the time of sale of plots/properties had not been provided. “Even basic amenities like electricity supply, power backup, rainwater harvesting and drinking water supply in the colony are not up to the mark,” rued the residents.Charging the developer with an attempt to pull a fast one and abdicate his responsibility towards the residents by attempts to obain a ‘completion certificate’ from the competent authority (GLADA) through misrepresentation of facts, the welfare society said against promised three generating sets for power back up, only two have been installed.“The power distribution system is overloaded due to the scarcity of transformers and corroded underground transmission lines, boundary wall if not high enough to ensure safety and security while water tanks are not regularly cleaned up with the result that residents get foul-smelling water,” said the society president adding that a probe should be marked to senior officials of the engineering wing of GLADA and appropriate legal action should also be taken against the developer for misrepresentation of the facts and betraying the residents of the colony.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/eldeco-estate-colony-developer-seeks-completion-certificate-ludhiana-residents-cry-foul-353782
24-12-2021||Harshraj Singh||Ludhiana: Uneven manholes give commuters a bumpy ride||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, December 23Not caring two hoots for the safety of the commuters, the authorities concerned have failed to level sewer manholes even on the recently recarpeted roads in various parts of the city. The uneven manholes in many parts of the city had already been posing threat to the commuters.Ahead of the Assembly elections, the roads are already being recarpeted by ignoring the cold weather conditions while the uneven sewerage manholes are neglected too.The level of manholes has not been corrected on recently carpeted roads in BRS Nagar, Hambran Road, College Road and many others. Most of the manholes are below the road surface and look like big potholes, giving invitations to mishaps.In several areas, the manholes have been covered with bitumen layer instead of correcting the level by the contractors concerned. A senior Congress leader Parminder Mehta said, “Even Mayor and MC Commissioner had earlier given instructions to the officers to do the needful to correct the level of sewerage manholes but to no avail. The manholes that are below road surface are causing mishaps. It is difficult for the sewer men to locate those manholes that have been covered with bitumen instead of correcting the level. MC or any other department concerned should make sure that the level of manhole structures should be corrected before starting the road recarpeting work as it is part of road project and contractor is paid for this work too.”In March 2021, residents of Urban Vihar near Dugri Phase 2 had complained that the sewerage manholes were covered with bitumen instead of correcting the level by the contractor. MC’s SDO concerned had then claimed that the sewerage manholes were covered with bitumen on a temporary basis and level will be corrected later. However, the level of manholes has not been corrected to date.A resident of Sarabha Nagar said that the level of a number of manholes was not corrected. Thus, uneven manholes cause inconvenience to the commuters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/uneven-manholes-give-commuters-a-bumpy-ride-353783

He said the CM is busy in his rallies and election campaigning and ignored the intelligence warnings on the infiltration of anti-social elements from Punjab borders with neighbouring country which has resulted in the bomb blast. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/punjab-govt-is-a-nonentity-bjp-leader-353784
