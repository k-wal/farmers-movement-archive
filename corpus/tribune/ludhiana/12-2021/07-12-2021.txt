The mood of party was upbeat ever since the “controversial” farm laws were repealed by the BJP, heading the Centre Government, recently.Senior party leaders, supporters and workers are hopeful to perform well in the upcoming Assembly elections in Punjab. They maintain that all ground work has already completed and sincere efforts are being made to win voters’ confidence.The BJP Punjab chief spokesperson, Anil Sarin, said, “Meetings are held at booth and mandal levels to chalk out poll strategy. The BJP is a cadre-based party. Party’s decision is supreme for all workers and leaders. Those, who have worked hard for all these years are ticket aspirants.”“The party leadership is watching everything minutely. Ultimately, it will decide about candidates. Alliance with any other party or not is to be decided by the high-command. Despite all odds, major role has to be played by leaders, workers and supporters of the BJP themselves,” he added.Senior leaders are tight-lipped over the alliance partner or the role to be played by Captain Amarinder Singh. They believe that there is enthusiasm among all party workers to perform well.The Punjab BJP vice-president, Parvin Bansal, who had contested from Ludhiana North said, “Losing or winning is another part, but as far as high spirits are concerned, BJP workers are full of hope and energy to perform.”“Leaders are focused, which is the bright side of the party witnessed as far as elections in Punjab are concerned,” he said.Earlier, the party was being condemned for bringing farm laws for the benefit of farmers, which had been withdrawn, he added.“I do not see why people will not support the party when it has always worked for their welfare. The recognition, which Prime Minister has provided to the country at the international level, has been nowhere in its seven decade history. This party is for the people and country’s welfare,” he said.On the issue of Captain Amarinder Singh, Bansal said he had always shown concern towards safety of the country and would continue to do so. “Alliance with his party or not is the BJP high command’s decision, but we are all geared up to put-in our best in elections,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/upbeat-bjp-ready-to-contest-on-117-seats-347362

If the new GST is levied from January 1, prices will escalate. For that, we are thinking of pasting fresh price labels on our products. We cannot pay hiked GST from our pockets. It’s the customer, who has to pay.”Meanwhile, regular representations are being sent by the states to the Centre to roll back this proposal. It is not that traders or manufacturers in Punjab only, who are worried over the outcome, but representations from cloth manufacturers and traders from all over country, including Kolkotta, Bengaluru, Mysore, Telangana etc, are being sent to the Centre Government for taking back the decision.Sonu Nilibar from Nilibar here said, “States are interlinked as far as procuring garments are concerned. We all will be affected. There are chances of more tax evasion now. The government should realise this. Moreover, the hike is going to affect customer only.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/customer-to-bear-the-brunt-as-centre-likely-to-hike-gst-347361

Apart from participating in declamation and essay writing contests, students took out an awareness rally to exhort voters to exercise their right to universal franchise wisely and without bowing to any political pressure.Young boys and girls, who had attained the age of 18 years, were asked to get themselves registered as voters as exercising their right to vote was their moral duty and constitutional right.Essay writing competition and declamation contest was organised to spread awareness among first time voters and others.Officiating college Principal Dr Nirlep Kaur exhorted young voters to exercise their right cautiously as their decision may tell upon political, economic and social health of the nation if taken otherwise.Nodal officer Prof Gurpreet Singh opined that the youth was the hope of the country. Every decision taken by them would directly influence policies to be framed and system to be followed, he added.“In a democratic system, the power is in the hands of the youth, who have the capacity to take independent and bold decisions,” he said. “Every single vote counts. So, the thought of not voting is killing democratic system of the country,” he added.General secretary of the college management committee Harpratap Brar said, “Young voters should be awakened to choose the right candidate and vote cautiously. It is but natural for first time voters, as many of them are in college, to be excited and overwhelmed to exercise their right to vote.”“It is a golden opportunity and a big challenge for young voters to think in terms of choosing a candidate worthy of representation and capable of thinking for the people and able to run the government as per the needs and demands of the general public,” he added.When contacted Tehsildar Pardeep Bains said, “The government is trying its level best to involve more and more young voters in the voter awareness drive. Such programmes are being organised as daily routine. It is duty of students as young voters to make others aware of the importance of voting and ask them to vote judiciously.”“Each voter should think twice before casting his or her vote without bowing before any pressure. If the voter finds no suitable candidate, he or she can select the none of the above (NOTA) option instead of not voting at all,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/college-students-take-out-rally-to-spread-awareness-on-voting-347360

The national programme will also implement source sustainability measures as mandatory elements, such as recharge and reuse through grey water management, water conservation and rainwater harvesting. The mission is based on a community approach to water and will include extensive information, education and communication as a key component. It looks to create a ‘jan andolan’ for water, thereby making it everyone’s priority.OfficialspeakOnce we achieve universal access, the district administration further plans to monitor the functionality of potable water supply in adequate quantity and of prescribed quality being provided to every rural household on a regular and long-term basis. This silent revolution happening in rural Punjab in terms of household tap water connections is a work in progress for a ‘New Punjab’. —Varinder Kumar Sharma, DC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/district-heading-towards-tap-water-to-all-rural-households-347353
