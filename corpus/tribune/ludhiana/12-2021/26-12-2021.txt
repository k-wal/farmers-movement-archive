An upward trend in joint pain has been witnessed among young adults, including those who have recovered from Covid-19. Many youngsters are now consulting doctors complaining bone and joint problems.During winters, over 50 per cent of the people feel less motivated to step outside and rather feel more inclined to stay home, where it’s cozy and warm. But, regular exercise can certainly help to fight that stiffness, pain and improve a general well being.Dr Ranjit Singh, senior consultant joint replacement surgeon, Prolife Hospital, Ludhiana, “Each year we witness rise in the number of senior citizens seeking treatment for increased joint pain and discomfort during winter. However, this year, young adults are also complaining, including those who have recovered from Covid-19. .”Dr Shuchin Bajaj, Founder Director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, said, “We have seen a spike in the number of senior citizens seeking treatment for bone and joint problems during winter. But nowadays we can see younger people are also facing the same problem due to work from home and consuming a diet high in trans fats and sugar.”Generally the cold weather causes muscles to stiffen up, the joint cartilage nutrition decreases and metabolism slows down. Therefore, it becomes mandatory to keep your body active, even in the winter months,” said Dr Shubhang Aggarwal, Director and Orthopaedic and Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon, NHS Hospital.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/joint-pain-rising-among-young-adults-354469

26-12-2021||Harshraj Singh||Ludhiana MC fails to resolve issues of waste management, illegal construction, Buddha Nullah pollution||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, December 25The Municipal Corporation (MC) failed to resolve the issues related to solid waste, illegal constructions, overcharging at parking lots, dumping of untreated dairy waste into the Buddha Nullah, etc, this year too.Commuters had to suffer because of badly broken roads. Ahead of the elections, road works are now being carried out in the winter season.The overflowing sewage problem in Dhandari, Giaspura and several other areas remained unresolved. Waterlogging was witnessed in many parts in the monsoon season. The MC, however, laid storm water drainage pipes near Clock Tower and got an old drain operational near Dholewal to resolve waterlogging problem in these areas.The MC inaugurated its Burj Pawat shed for around 150 head of stray cattle but it failed to make the required arrangements for hundreds of more stray cattle that still roam on city roads.LowsBuilding collapse tragedies: In April, five persons lost their lives and number of others were injured in the auto parts factory roof collapse incident at Baba Mukand Singh Nagar. The roof slab of the top floor of auto parts manufacturing unit Jasmail Singh and Sons was being lifted by using jacks without any permission from the MC.In August, at least 10 persons, including two children, were injured when an unsafe multi-storey building of RT Woolen Mill on RK Road collapsed. The MC’s role was under scanner after these incidents.Waste processing ignored: After private firm A2Z group terminated its services in February, the MC took no steps to ensure waste processing at its main dumping site near Kakka village. Even it failed to deal with legacy waste. In July, the PPCB imposed an environmental compensation of Rs 1.8 crore on the Ludhiana MC for violating the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The opposition parties also raised questions after the MC handed over the work for lifting garbage from secondary collections to a private firm without tendering process.Poor show in Swachh Survekshan: With the MC failing to improve its performance, Ludhiana slipped to rank 39, out of the 48 cities (above 10 lakh population category) in the Swachh Survekshan-2021. The city ranked 7th out of 13 cities in the state. The city had ranked 34th out of 47 cities in the Swachh Survekshan-2020.Frequent road cave-ins: Two school students (siblings) riding an Activa scooter fell into a crater as a big portion of the road caved in at Deep Nagar in October. The MC’s old brick sewerage line had got damaged there. Besides, cave-ins occurred in Phase-II of Urban Estate in Dugri, Ishmeet Singh Road, Clock Tower Road and other areas of the city this year as no lessons were learnt from the past to avert such incidents.Controversies on Smart City Mission projects: The opposition parties raised questions over various Smart City Mission projects. The Pakhowal Road ROB/RUBs project missed the deadline. With raising questions over the project design and planning of the Smart Street project on Malhar Road, the traders blamed the authorities for reducing the width of the road, causing traffic snarls. The retrofitting of Sarabha Nagar project is still incomplete as many wires have not been laid underground.In July, the MC’s carcass utilisation plant near Noorpur Bet could not be inaugurated due to protest by villagers.Buddha Nullah overflowed: As the banks were not strengthened, the Buddha Nullah overflowed opposite Peeru Banda area in September as heavy rainfall lashed the city. The polluted water had flown into nearby fields. The Buddha Nullah had overflowed many times in the past but no concrete steps have been taken to avoid flooding.HighsRejuvenation of Buddha Nullah: The much-awaited Rejuvenation of Buddha Nullah Project was launched this year. The Department of Local Government constituted the monitoring committee, headed by the MC chief, for the project that is to be completed within two years after launch.Animal birth control: The new building of the MC’s Animal Birth Control Centre was opened this year. According to officials, the centre has been developed at a cost of nearly Rs 1 crore. The centre has preparation room, sterilisation room, operation theatre, 22 kennels, including six pre and 16 post-operation.Equipment purchased for fire wing: Under the Smart City Mission, new firefighting equipment worth Rs 3.28 crore was purchased for strengthening the fire services in Ludhiana. Hi-tech equipment, including new mini fire tenders, emergency lights, life detectors, battery-operated combi tools, thermal imaging cameras, aluminium firefighting suits, etc, were purchased.Land finalised for water treatment plant: For the upcoming 24x7 surface water supply project, the MC purchased land for setting up the water treatment plant of 580 MLD at Bilga village. The project is funded by the World Bank. The civic body has been planning the project for a long time.Act of humanity: When kin of those persons who had succumbed to coronavirus, were either refusing or unable to perform last rites amid Covid-19 crisis this year, the Municipal Corporation’s Covid Cremation Management Cell had ensured the dignified last rites of the dead this year. A group of about 10 youngsters and MC officials performed the last rites of the deceased.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-mc-fails-to-resolve-issues-of-waste-management-illegal-construction-buddha-nullah-pollution-354474

26-12-2021||Nitin Jain||More leads emerge in Ludhiana bomb blast probe||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, December 25Even as the deceased dismissed cop still remains the main suspect, more vital leads have emerged in the ongoing investigation into the District Court Complex bomb blast, which had left one dead and six hurt here on Thursday, senior officers have confirmed.Involvement of more than one person, terror module, pro-Khalistan connection and international links were among the clues that have been found during the two days of probe into the high-intensity explosion that had created a terror across the state ahead of the Assemble elections due early next year, the investigation officials have said.“We are working on all the leads and theories that are emerging during the ongoing investigation and on the basis of technical evidence in hand, the arrests and questioning of other suspects in the case cannot be ruled out,” police officials involved in the probe revealed.Though DGP Siddharth Chattopadhyaya has claimed that the state police have managed to crack the bomb blast case after identifying the deceased, Gagandeep Singh, alias Gaggi of Khanna, who was dismissed from the police service following his arrest in a drug recovery case in August 2019, in less than 24 hours, the cause and nature of the explosion still remains unknown.However, a post-blast investigation team of the NSG from New Delhi and the forensic experts from the state police have found during the preliminary investigation that a “high intensity” explosive was used in the improvised explosive device (IED) following the recovery of aluminium particles and plastic shrapnel from the body of the deceased.Investigations so far have also revealed that the dismissed cop, who was scheduled to appear before a district court on Friday, a day after the blast, in a drug recovery case, wherein he had already undergone two years in jail and was presently out on bail, was himself assembling the IED when it went off in a public toilet on the second floor of the court complex.“The high explosive material used in the IED was capable of causing maximum damage to the lives and property but since it exploded inside the toilet and on the day when the footfall was less as compared to normal days following the lawyers’ strike and non-functioning of both courtrooms located on the second floor, the damage caused remained minimum,” investigators believed.Though the major remains of the explosive material were washed away in the running water from the pipeline that got damaged following the blast, the forensic experts have collected and sent for scientific examination whatever was available on the spot of crime to help ascertain the exact material used in the IED.With the investigations also hinting at pro-Khalistan involvement, terror module and international links in the blast, the use of RDX in the IED was also not yet ruled out. “We are using several scientific methods to detect and measure the use of a military explosive in the explosion by collecting samples from debris and remains from the blast site,” the officials said.Besides identifying the undertrials with whom the deceased remained in touch inside and outside the jail, the police have also prepared a list of close associates of the dismissed cop within and outside the department to interrogate them for their possible involvement in the case.“Our first and foremost suspicion of the deceased’s involvement in the blast has only strengthened on the basis of technical evidence collected so far and further investigations are in progress to unearth the involvement of others and motive behind the explosion,” Commissioner of Police, Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, who was leading the state police investigation in the case, said.Suspect’s profileName: Gagandeep Singh, alias GaggiAge: 29Height: 5’11”Address: House No: 405, Gali No: R/13, Mohalla Guru Teg Bahadur, Lalheri Road, KhannaBooked: FIR 75, dated August 11, 2019, at STF, Phase 4, Mohali, under Sections 21, 29 of the NDPS ActBehind bars: From August 16, 2019, to September 7, 2021, at Ludhiana jailBailed out: September 8, 2021||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/more-leads-emerge-in-bomb-blast-probe-354478
