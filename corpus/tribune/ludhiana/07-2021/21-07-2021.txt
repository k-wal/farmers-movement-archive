21-07-2021||Ludhiana||Patients suffer as docs go on complete strike||Patients had a difficult time as doctors went on complete strike and boycotted OPDs today. Earlier, they were holding parallel OPDs but since the government has failed to accept their demands, work was completely suspended.Doctors will be sitting on a dharna in Chandigarh on Thursday. Doctors are protesting against the recommendation of the Sixth Pay Commission to reduce the non-practicing allowance (NPA) of veterinarians, medicos and allied professionals from 25 to 20 per cent along with delinking it from the basic pay structure.The out patient department, in-house patient department, work related to unique disability identification, Ayushman Bharat Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana, webinars, videoconferences, online consultation and elective surgeries all remained suspended at Civil Hospital today and only emergency services were open.“Initially the NPA at the rate of 25% was the part of pay for the calculation of all allowances. Now with the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission, the NPA has been delinked from pay and reduced to 20% which means it has been fixed now and no other allowances will be calculated on the NPA. It will remarkably effect the net salary of all the government doctors, be it allopathic, ayurvedic, homeopathic or veterinary,” said Dr Rohit Rampal from the PCMSA.He adding that doctors worked relentlessly during Covid but this is what the government has gifted them. “We were expecting some bonus in lieu of our selfless services but the government instead has decided to deduct our salaries,” he said.A patient who came from Shimlapuri to seek consultation in rain was disappointed to see doctors on strike. “I was having fever and came to the hospital but upon arrival here I found that doctors were not seeing patients,” he said.Another patient, Surekha from Tajpur Road said it is the third time in May that she is coming to the hospital and doctors are on strike. “Every second day the doctors are on strike and where will the patients go now?” she said.Ram Dulari, who cannot afford to visit a private doctor, has no option but to come to Civil Hospital. “Now what should I do?” she questioned helplessly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/patients-suffer-as-docs-go-on-complete-strike-286142

Now, the Vigilance Department has issued directions to Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) to initiate action as per law against the developers.‘No licence obtained’The Vigilance directions have come after the Canal Department (Sidhwan canal subdivision) lodged a complaint with the police for registration of criminal cases against the developers for construction of illegal ramps towards canal banks.Through an office memo (dated July 7, 2021), the Vigilance Department has asked the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Punjab, and the GLADA authorities to take action against the erring developers as per law and submit an action-taken report.In a similar move, the Sidhwan canal subdivisional officer had lodged a complaint with the SHO, Sahnewal police station, that work was on in some colonies in Jaspal Bangar village on the right side of the canal and illegal ramps were being constructed to gain access to canal banks at several places without obtaining any permission for the purpose from the Canal Department.“There is an apprehension of damage to road along the canal and concrete lining of the canal. In addition, unrestricted entry to expressway will also obstruct the smooth flow of traffic and can lead to accidents,” said the memo, adding that action as per law (including registration of criminal cases) be taken against the guilty colonisers.In this regard, a city-based social activist, Rachpal Singh Gabria, had lodged a complaint with the state government, saying several illegal colonies were coming up along the Sidhwan Canal Expressway where promoters had not obtained any licence from the competent authority, nor had any change of land got approved.
