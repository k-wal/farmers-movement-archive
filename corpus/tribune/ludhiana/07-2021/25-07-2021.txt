In the two-hour session, the police officers listened to problems of the industry in detail and assured them to provide every possible solution.The function was held under the aegis of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) with Rakesh Agrawal, Commissioner of Police, Ludhiana, and other senior cops. The discussion focussed on law and order in various industrial sectors.Agrawal said “Ludhiana is a place of educated people. So, the Police Department will take help of experts to resolve its problems. Currently, the department is focusing more on making residents aware of rules and regulations. Although the Ludhiana police have taken many steps to resolve the daily traffic issues, we are looking for support from organisations. The police also ask for support from citizens to make our plans successful.”He said many mobile applications had been developed for better service and support of residents, in terms of safety and security, like Shakti App, Safeauto App etc. With these, residents can use public transport without any fear for being robbed during night.Rahul Ahuja, former chairman, CII Punjab State Council, said, “Being an industrial town with large migrant population and financial capital of Punjab, Ludhiana as a city has its own set of challenges and to overcome these, the Police Department is a key stakeholder. In this regard, today’s interaction with senior police officers assumes great importance. Our objective of organising the interaction is primarily to apprise the officials present on some of the challenges pertaining to law & order faced by industry and common citizens, besides exploring areas where the CII and the local police authorities can work together.”Ashpreet Sahni, chairman of CII, Ludhiana Zonal Council, said there were no two thoughts about the fact that a proactive and stimulating attitude, both from industry and the local police administration, could help in better law enforcement and instilling a sense of discipline among citizens. The session would help the police engage not only industry, but also the society at large and make them partners in making Ludhiana safer and smarter, he maintained.Over 90 industrialists, including 21 local industrial associations, presented their suggestions and ideas in the session.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/industry-interacts-with-cops-in-ludhiana-discusses-law-order-issues-287788

After the recent rainfall, the situation has turned worse on this stretch.Harvinder Singh of Phase 2 Market Association said mishaps were common on the poor stretch near Sanjh Kendra. Harvinder, who runs Bagga Tent House, said, “The road was last carpeted about seven years ago. At that time, questions were raised over the quality of the material used but our voice was ignored. The road had started cracking up within a short time.”“The road gullies were not constructed due to which water logging is common here. These issues have been ignored for long. We will vote for only those who ensure development in the area,” he further added.The main road stretch from Canal Bridge to Police Station Chowk is also crying for attention. Moreover, the potholes on the internal roads of Dugri Phase 1 and 2 have not been repaired.A resident of Phase 1 said, “When we pay taxes, it is the responsibility of the civic body to ensure the provision of better roads and safety of the commuters. But, the potholes were not repaired before the arrival of the rainy season, leaving us to face inconveniences.”Despite repeated attempts, Rahul Gagneja, MC’s Superintending Engineer at Zone D, could not be contacted for comments.Notably, the area falls under Atam Nagar constituency from where LIP chief Simarjeet Singh Bains is MLA. Bains too could not be contacted for a comment.Councillor from Ward No. 44, Harkarandeep Singh Vaid, said the issues would be resolved at the earliest. A road project worth Rs 4 crore had been approved by the department concerned and tenders for the same would be floated soon. The project files regarding works related to internal roads of Dugri had also been approved, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/potholed-dugri-roads-an-open-invitation-to-mishaps-287789

The teachers who have received both doses have been advised to upload their certificates on the Education Department portal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/schools-opening-tomorrow-teachers-rush-to-get-vaccinated-in-punjabs-ahmedgarh-287790
