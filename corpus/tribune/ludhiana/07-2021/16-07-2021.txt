Stand-up comedian and producer, Bharat Sharma, who started his career three years back, too resorted to online shows when Covid hit the industry.The Ludhiana-born artist upgraded his skills as a producer and a host, as he manages Aaye Bade Comics production as well as online shows. All set to record his first show in The Laugh Club, Chandigarh, on July 17, which will be released on YouTube, he is rather excited than nervous.Timing mattersTalking about the delay in recording his first show, he says, “The timing matters. I know this could have happened way sooner, but in the times of a pandemic it is all about taking into account the safety of others. My online shows have helped me stay in touch with the audience and also reach out to fresh faces.”Recalling his old job, he adds, “I used to work in the corporate sector in Mumbai where I met a lot of artistes, directors and writers, which influenced me and I started writing;in no time I was writing for short films. Then, I was introduced to stand-up comedians like Amit Tandon, Atul Khatri, Sorabh Pant and Punit Pania. It seemed a tough job to make people laugh, but still I remember how Atul Khatri motivated me a lot.” As for the future, he says, “I have no plans of returning home after this. I have already been offered three live shows.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-born-stand-up-comedian-bharat-sharma-says-it-is-a-tough-job-to-make-people-laugh-283996

The indifferent attitude of the governments was evident as the government was in collusion with hoarding and profiteering mafia and the people had been left to fend for themselves.In the memorandum, the party stated that it would, in no case, tolerate the loot of people by big business and corporate houses and would take to streets, if required, to defend the rights of the poor.Meanwhile, the Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) activists, led by district president Sadhu Singh Panjeta and district secretary Sudagar Singh Ghudani, also organised a protest and submitted a memorandum to the district administration, calling for immediate disbursement of compensation for damage caused to standing wheat crops at several places during the harvesting season.They said wheat crop had been destroyed by fire in several villages, including Giddri, Bilaspur, Lapran and Ghudani Kalan, but the affected farmers were still waiting for compensation.

The number of women gamers is also growing in north India.Mobile gaming took off amid the pandemic and for those who were trying to deal with the prolonged social isolation, it provided a creative outlet. However, the flip side of the coin is that it is also leading people towards anxiety, depression and sleeplessness as such patients have increased 10 times over the past year.Career for womenIn a recent HP Gaming Landscape Report-2021, 96 per cent respondents from both Chandigarh and Jaipur and 92 per cent from Ludhiana said they were accepting gaming as a socialising tool. Besides, the report mentions that in north India, women gamers are growing in number, with 83 per cent of expressing a desire to pursue gaming as a career.According to the report, 91 per cent respondents in north India agreed that gaming helped relieve work and study pressure while reducing stress and inducing positive feelings. The survey reveals Chandigarh and Lucknow to be more accepting in gaming as a stress-reliever than their counterparts in Delhi.Nitish Singal, head, Personal Systems (Consumer), HP India, said, “We are on the verge of a massive gaming boom, based on the increasing popularity in the past 18 months. People today look at gaming as more than a hobby. It is a lucrative career option and an outlet to relieve stress.”Meanwhile, it’s having negative impact on the health of those who are indulging in too many mobile gaming activities. “Gaming is perceived as an enabler to socialise and make new friends, especially amid social distancing, but it has its flip side.
