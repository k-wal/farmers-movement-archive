But segregation of waste is still being ignored in most parts of the city.At present, the non-segregated waste is generally collected from households and establishments and dumped at secondary collection points of the city. Even, a huge amount of used polythene bags, which have already been banned about five years ago, can be seen at the dumping sites inside the city. Broken glass pieces, bulbs, e-waste, chemicals and other waste are also being dumped with general waste. Besides, biomedical waste was found at different dumps in the past too.A member of the Buddha Nullah Task Force, Col JS Gill (retd), said nothing had been done at the ground level to ensure segregation of waste in the city. The campaigns were merely a formality.“Residents are supposed to segregate waste. The MC must create awareness among the residents for the segregation of waste,” he said.“It seems councillors are least bothered about segregation of waste in their respective wards. They should come forward and motivate people to segregate waste, which was required for a better solid waste management system. Waste should not be lifted if it was not segregated at source level,” he said.Colonel Gill said: “Required facilities should be set up to deal with wastes such as broken glass, CFL and other bulbs, tube lights, e-waste and other hazardous waste. Leaf and branch crushers should be set up in all colonies of the city. The MC must ensure proper processing of the waste.”The civic body has even failed to resume operations of the waste processing plant at the main dumping site near Kakka village for the past five months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/waste-segregation-still-a-distant-dream-in-ludhiana-279355

It is the first time that a virtual House meeting is going to be held.Now, the resolution would be presented in the House meeting that would be conducted online next Wednesday (July 14).The third-party firm had earlier given an ultimatum to the MC to increase the tipping fee from Rs 324 to Rs 435 per MT waste, otherwise it would stop lifting garbage from the city. Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu had then formed a committee. Senior Deputy Mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra said the SAD and BJP councillors were also part of the committee that has given nod to increase the tipping fee from Rs 324 to Rs 425 in view of hiked fuel prices.Notably, when the A2Z group had left services in February, the MC had asked the third party firm to lift garbage from secondary collections points but without floating any tender. The Opposition councillors, including of the BJP, had then raised questions over the MC’s move. Instead of hiring any new firm by floating the tenders as per the rules, the MC had hired the third-party firm for waste management.Around 1,100 MT waste is generated in the city daily and the MC pays an average Rs 3.56 lakh per day as a tipping fee to the firm at present as per the information. If the MC House gives its nod to hike the tipping fee from Rs 324 to Rs 425 per MT waste, then the MC will have to pay about Rs 4.67 lakh per day (about Rs 1.1 lakh more) tipping fee to the firm.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/lifting-of-garbage-fcc-panel-gives-nod-to-increase-tipping-fee-279356

For this, all schools have already submitted the mark-sheets of the respective students to the board. But the way the results are being declared this time, students and parents have express dissatisfaction over the evaluation formula finalised by the CBSE as they believe that it will bring down their percentage.Rutv, a student in Class XII, said, “I did not perform well in Class X but both in Classes XI and XII, after choosing the medical stream, my marks improved. Had it been based on the performance of Class XII alone, I would have scored 96-97 per cent marks but since Class X numbers will also be counted, I do not expect more than 90-91 per cent marks,” he said.Many parents of meritorious students claimed that due to the evaluation criteria their wards are bound to suffer and percentage will be low.Harmit Kaur Waraich, Principal, Nankana Sahib Public School, said the past few days were hectic as the staff was busy preparing results and lists have been submitted to the board. She added that many parents had expressed unhappiness on the way results were prepared.“They were expecting much more marks in Class XII as students had to perform with their chosen subjects. Class X exams are not taken that seriously as compared to Class XII though it is also a board class. As none knew about the pandemic, the board decided the best for students. All schools will certainly be fair and transparent in submitting results,” said Waraich.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/students-unhappy-over-cbse-criteria-279357

In addition action as per rules will be taken for non-compliance and violations,” says the letter written by MTP.The security gates, installed in the name of security, had generated a huge controversy between groups of residents with allegations being levelled that many gates were kept closed round-the-clock and vacant area behind the locked gates was being used as parking space or playing games by those residing in vicinity.The directions for deployment of security guard from 11pm to 5am, if the gate was to be kept closed, were also being flagrantly violated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/building-branch-fails-to-check-illegal-security-gates-in-ludhiana-279358

With barricades lying on the main gate (exit) and the entry from reservation centre side and the parking lot not operational, passengers intending to board the trains from Ludhiana railway station have to leave their vehicles outside the railway complex and made to walk carrying their luggage to reach the platform.“With vehicles being unable to enter the railway station complex, the porters are charging exorbitantly to carry the luggage to the platforms, causing huge inconvenience to passengers, especially those travelling with families and kids or elderly persons,” said a senior citizen, Kirpal Singh, who was to board a train for Amritsar.As the parking contractor has not resumed work on the main entry side of the railway station, the entry of private and hired vehicles remained close inside the railway complex making it tough for those reaching the railway station by their own or hired vehicles (cabs) as they have no other choice but disembark outside the main entry and walk all the way (for more than 200 yards) to reach platform number one or other intended platforms.It was learnt that there was a tussle going on between the parking contractor and railway officials over payment of license fee which had not so far been resolved. Railway officials seemed to be disinclined to remove barricades from the main gate till parking was made operational since unrestricted entry of vehicles inside the railway station would create further problems than solving any.Several railway passengers also complained about insanitary conditions at the platforms, inadequate arrangements of drinking water in the scorching heat and some instances of overcharging by vendors as all the vends allotted at the railway platforms had not still become functional.Railway officials said parking lot would soon become operational and both entry and exit gates of the railway station would be opened thereafter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/trains-restored-facilities-missing-at-railway-station-in-ludhiana-279360
