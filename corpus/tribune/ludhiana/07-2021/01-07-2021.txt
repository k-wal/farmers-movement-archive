Unlike senior officers, the employees fully depend upon salary by the month end for their daily needs,” alleged members.Around 79,000 employees have already retired under the VRS and the salary bill has already been slashed down by 50 per cent still, the management is not disbursing the salary to the employees on the due date and this state of affairs is continuing for the past one and half years, said union members.Every month the average revenue collection is between Rs 1300 to Rs 1400 crores.

Domestic animals and poultry birds are particularly vulnerable to heat wave. Hyperthermia (Heat intolerance syndrome) is one of the commonly encountered problem among dairy animals of Punjab.The problem is most common in exotic and crossbred animals said Dr Charanjit Singh, Professor-cum-Head, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana.“The condition occurs due to high environmental temperature and humidity. During the weather conditions heat loss is reduced leading to rise in body temperature called hyperthermia. Panting (marked increase in respiration rate), reduced appetite and milk production are the common manifestations. The most common initiating factor is poor ventilation and also some times in animal that have suffered from foot and mouth disease in the past as a result of to damage to heat regulation system in brain. This condition is cannot be treated by drugs and antibiotics,” said Dr Singh.Dr Sushma Chhabra, Senior Scientist, Department of Veterinary Medicine, said hyperthermia is mostly observed during months of May to September with maximum cases recorded during months of July to September. During humid weather, the ambient temperature and relative humidity frequently exceed the critical comfort level of temperature humidity index (72), resulting in elevated body temperature and panting. The temperature-humidity index (THI) describes the effect of environment on animal’s ability to lose heat.Dr Charanjit Singh further added that a study on dairy animals showed that subcutaneous administration of 5 ml iodised oil (containing 750 mg of elemental iodine) for three consecutive days was helpful in its management. More than 95 per cent of the hyperthermic dairy animals recovered with this therapeutic regimen and no relapse was recorded during the post treatment period of two months.He advised farmers to provide ample quantity of water to animals, keep them away from direct sunlight in well ventilated places and give bath to dairy animals 2-3 times a day. Feed your animals, during the cooler periods of the day (early morning and evening). Often the farmers treat such animals with antibiotics and other drugs (Diminazine or buparvacone).This is absolutely not required unless the tick related diseases has been confirmed by blood tests. If high fever persists or marked loss of appetite and milk yield, get the blood of your animal examined at the GADVASU for tick borne diseases or other infections. Self-medication should be avoided by farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/save-dairy-animals-from-hyperthermia-veterinary-professor-276647

Now, as trains have been restored, the barrier at the main gate is causing huge inconvenience to passengers, especially the women, children, elderly and physically challenged persons.In a communication to the Union Railway Minister, former councillor and Congress leader Parminder Mehta has demanded immediate removal of the barricade to provide easier access to rail passengers and enable motor vehicles, cycle rickshaws and three-wheelers to drop rail travellers inside the railway station.He said passengers travelling with their families and carrying heavy luggage are forced to walk long distance from the main entry gate to their respective platforms as vehicles could not go inside the railway station complex due to barricades. “In larger interest of the public, these barricades should be removed and free access must be ensured to the platforms and booking counters,” Mehta added.The Congress leader also pointed out that main gate of railway reservation centre, which was closed during the lockdown period, had also not been reopened till now. As the rail traffic was now being restored in a phased manner, the reservation centre should also be opened as the intending rail travellers were forced to purchase tickets at a premium from agents and touts as most of the migrant work force did not have access to internet facilities for e-booking, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/barricade-at-ludhiana-railway-station-entrance-irks-passengers-276630

Despite knowing the facts that there was an acute shortage of green cover in the state and Ludhiana is one of the most polluted cities of the country, the trees have been axed unnecessarily. It is a well-known fact that due to the development of the road infrastructure, the number of such aged trees in Ludhiana has decreased considerably during the past one decade. For any city, the old trees are termed heritage property. Such act of axing trees is shameful and unacceptable.”Superintending Engineer, LIT, Boota Ram, said the trees had been axed after getting required permission for the construction of the road.“It is a two-way road. Earlier, one side of the stretch was constructed and now, the other side has to be constructed,” he said.Meanwhile, advocate HC Arora has also sent a complaint to the CM against the axing of trees on the premises of the DC office, Ludhiana.

He added that whenever a new driver is employed by the auto-rickshaw owner, it will be the responsibility of the owner to get the details of the new driver updated in the software by visiting the Saanjh Kendra.The CP said once the database of auto-rickshaws is created it will also help prevent crime as the registered auto-rickshaw drivers would be afraid to commit crime using their verified autos. Apart from this it will be easy to identify the accused in case anyone commits crime using an unregistered auto-rickshaw.The CP said the Joint CP, Traffic, will be the nodal officer for the smooth conduct of the drive and police will be charging Rs 150 for covering the cost of stickers and driver’s verification for which proper receipt will be issued from the Saanjh Kendra.“It is mandatory for every auto-rickshaw owner to get his vehicle registered with the unique ID, otherwise, strict action will be taken against those auto-rickshaw owners who are not having proper documents and permits in future,” said Joint CP, Traffic, Deepak Pareek.Pareek also urged the residents of Ludhiana to prefer travelling in auto-rickshaws which have unique ID pasted on them. In case of any suspicion, the passenger can immediately call the Police Control Room at helpline number 112, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/now-auto-rickshaws-to-have-unique-id-to-prevent-crime-in-ludhiana-276595
