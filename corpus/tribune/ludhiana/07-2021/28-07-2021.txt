Several residents, who are labourers living in rented accommodation, in streets 1 and 1.5 have alleged that no water is supplied to them during the daytime or in the evening.They said the water is generally supplied around 11 at night these days when most of the people are sleeping. They asked the MC to ensure proper supply of water in the morning and evening.Sandeep Sharma, SDO, MCNobody from the area has complained about water being supplied only at night and not during daytime.

Days have passed but no one from the civic body has turned up to collect residential waste, which is multiplying each day, making the life of residents miserable.Repeated reminders, pleas and ultimatums have fallen on deaf ears, bringing out the non-seriousness of the officials of the Municipal Council. Also, days pass before sweepers turn up to clean the streets.“The unclean surroundings are leading to an increase in the number of flies and mosquitoes and residents are falling prey to diseases with each passing day. No sweeper is seen for days together and as a result, the garbage collected in the wards has started emitting foul smell,” rued a resident of one of the wards of Sahnewal.Another resident said, “Garbage is difficult to retain for days. What would be the situation if even after weeks none turns up to lift the garbage? We are helpless. If we try to take out the garbage and place it in the street, the dogs litter it, thus worsening the situation. We have to ultimately pick the garbage and throw on the dump ourselves. There is no alternative left.”“This, despite the fact that sweepers are being unduly paid a monthly amount of Rs 30, Rs 50 or even Rs 100 for picking up garbage. But they are in no mood to lift the garbage. They are regular to the houses which have more paying capacity or belong to politicians, councillors, higher officials etc,” added another resident.Sandeep Kumar, Additional Deputy Commissioner (urban development), Ludhiana, said he would immediately look into the matter and see what needed to be done.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/garbage-lifting-cleaning-tardy-in-sahnewal-289222

Two other motorcyclists accompanied the snatchers, Rajat had stated.He was working with a private firm, which supplies food material to online clients, and was reportedly returning after collecting payments from various customers. He had alleged that the money collected from clients was looted. However, during the course of investigation, the police started suspecting the complainant on the basis of circumstantial evidence from the vicinity of the place of incident as reported by Rajat.Malerkotla SSP Kanwardeep Kaur said Rajat had taken a loan to purchase the vehicle used in the crime and he could not repay its installment for many months, owing to the prolonged lockdown.Bowing to the interrogation by cops, supervised by SP (D) Harmit Singh Hundal and Ahmedgarh DSP Sandeep Vadhera, Rajat confessed that the complaint lodged was false and he intended to usurp the company’s money. He told the police that he had handed over the said money to his father Anil Seekree at Sarinh village before lodging a formal complaint at the Ahmedgarh Sadar police station, while the two other accused enacted the robbery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/complainant-arrested-for-faking-highway-robbery-in-mandi-ahmedgarh-289224

Orange alert has also been issued for a few districts but Ludhiana is safe and it will be receiving a moderate rainfall.Dr Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, Principal Scientist, Agricultural Meteorology Department, PAU, said a system of rainfall had been formed and the state would receive continuous rainfall in the next few days. Some districts, including Hoshiarpur and Pathankot, would receive a heavy rainfall while Ludhiana would be receiving moderate rain.The main reason for excessive increase in humidity is continuous increase in area under cultivation of paddy. Earlier, some parts of the state was under cultivation of paddy and on some belt, cotton crop was grown but now even the cotton belt has come under paddy. Water is stagnant in a large portion in the state due to which humidity levels have increased. Besides, before the system of the rainfall was formed, humidity levels increase. Humidity level will increase after rain also, but low temperature will some relief. “Rain at this point will prove beneficial for farmers as paddy needs a lot of water. Rain will help boost the growth of the crop. Waterlogging might take place in low-line areas, hence, farmers need to be prepared for the same and make arrangements. No spraying should be done in this period as it gets washed away by rain,” she said.Meanwhile, people travelling to hills need to be careful these days as roads are slippery and there is low visibility in mountainous regions. They should travel only if it’s necessary and should check the forecast before starting their journey.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/rain-likely-in-ludhiana-district-over-next-few-days-289229

The crime wing of the Ludhiana police made 16 special teams which conducted raids on 16 gun houses on Monday falling under the jurisdiction of the Police Commissionerate and seized their entire records.The development came after the Punjab Police busted a racket in which a large number of illegal weapons, which were bought by gangsters from Madhya Pradesh, were recovered but bullets were bought illegally from gun houses.The entire operation is being supervised by DCP (Crime) Simratpal Singh Dhindsa and assisted by ADCP (Crime) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti.Talking to The Tribune, DCP Dhindsa said the police got a tip-off regarding gun house owners supplying bullets to anti-social elements. “On Monday, ACP and inspector rank officers were called without informing them the purpose. By forming 16 teams, each team was told to conduct surprise checking at each gun house. We have seized the entire records of the gun houses, including details of bullets sold to the licence owners. Now, we will verify each entry to find anomalies, if any,” he said.Dhindsa said the 16 gun houses had weapons of over 1,000 licence holders and thousands of bullets were sold to valid gun licence holders as per the records.”Sometimes, gun house owners sells bullets to civilians or anti-social elements at exorbitant prices and they put entries in the name of valid gun licence holders. We will approach every licence holder to expose the racket, if any, and the entire probe may take more than a week to reach any conclusion,” Dhindsa said.There were 19 gun houses in Ludhiana of which three namely Punjab Arms Company, Civil Lines; Fauji Gun House, Bindraban road; and Grewal A/A Dealers, Ghumar Mandi, have applied for cancellation of their gun house licence. Other 16 operational gun houses where police conducted raids are Sherry Gun House, Toor Market, Dugri; Gurjot Gun House, Sherpur Kalan; Ashu Arms Company, Bharat Nagar chowk; Paul Gun House, Bhai Bala chowk; Uttam Gun House, Bharat Nagar chowk; MS Arms Company, Kitchlu Nagar; Imperial Arms Company, Nirankari Market; Bharat Gun House, Pakhowal Road; Verma Gun House, Bharat Nagar chowk; Doaba Gun House, Kochar Market; Akshit Gun House, Ghumar Mandi; Ludhiana Gun House, Model Town; Royal Gun House, Ghumar Mandi; Capital Gun House, Gurdev Nagar; The Gun Smith Gun House, Sarabha Nagar; and Shiv Shakti Gun House, Guru Nanak Pura.Licence expired, gun houses still keeping weaponsAs per the police, some gun houses are still keeping those weapons, licence of which have either been expired or have not been renewed by the holder. There is always a possibility that gun house owners may give such weapons on rent to criminal elements such as gangsters and after using the same, gangsters may hand over the weapon to the gun house. It is the duty of the gun house owner that if a weapon holder’s licence has expired, they should inform the police station concerned for further proceedings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-police-teams-raid-16-gun-houses-289234
