In addition to privately owned agricultural land, some developers have gone ahead with encroaching upon the land owned by the Irrigation and Forest Departments by fudging or fabricating revenue records,” said the complaint.Seeking stern directions to the GLADA authorities to take action against the developers of illegal colonies for violations of provisions made under the Sub-sections 12 of the Section 5 and Sub-section 1 of the Section 21 of the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA) 1995, the complainant has also called for strict action for immediate removal of encroachments from land under the ownership of the Irrigation and Forest Departments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/illegal-colony-developers-eye-land-along-sidhwan-canal-expressway-281390

The online petition is being shared on various social media platforms to create a mass movement to protect the natural habitat of Mattewara and the Sutlej.In the petition, Ranjodh stated that: “Since the Covid pandemic, which began last year around March, there were consistent lockdown and slowdown in all activities. However, the state government took a hasty decision in the Cabinet without any discussion to go ahead with the development of around 950- acre industrial park in the vicinity of the Mattewara Forest reserve and the Sutlej banks, near the flood-prone Dhussi embankment.”The government has acquired land from panchayats of Sekhowal and a few adjoining villages for the project. Many residents of the villages have also opposed the government’s move.While sharing his concern, Ranjodh Singh stated: “The Mattewara forest is spread over more than 4,000 acres of natural reserves, housing several varieties of flora and fauna. It is the oxygen factory for the entire Ludhiana and a habitat for animals and birds, including neel gai, peacocks, monkeys, wild boars, deers and serpent varieties. The nearby Botanical and Butterfly Garden is known for exotic varieties of butterflies and insects. If an Industrial zone comes up in the area, whole ecological balance will get ruined in the due course of time.”“To oppose the haphazard development and save the Mattewara forest area, a public action committee has been fighting a battle to protect the forest and the river,” he said.Meanwhile, over 325 persons have signed the petition within a short time after it was published, raising their voices to save the forest and the river. More people are being appealed to join the petition.While giving a reason for signing the petition, Mahinder Singh Sekhon stated: “I fully support and stand by the petition. What is being done is ecocide! And I strongly oppose this.”Nandini Deshmukh stated: “I want natural ecosystems to sustain. It is essential for the survival of mankind.”Another supporter Kiran Gupta commented: “The Mattewara forest is the lungs of Ludhiana city, lungs damaged means poor health of city and residents. If lungs stop working, no life.”Maninder Singh has stated: “We need forests more than the industry.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/nature-lovers-sign-petition-to-save-mattewara-forest-281392

Industry representatives burnt the effigy of the state government to mark the protest.Since the past 10 days, the large-scale industries are forced to close down their units due to power cuts. This is the longest-ever lockdown for industries due to power shortage in the history of the state, said Badish Jindal, president, Federation Of Punjab Small Industries Association. “The industry strongly slammed the government for the failure of providing power to the industries which resulted into the production loss of over 20,000 crores in state,” he added.The industries produce over 40,000 tons of steel in the state daily. The crisis affected the production of 4 lakh tons of steel in state and also impacted the production of yarn. The blackout directly affected 10,000 industries and two lakh industries indirectly in the state.The whole situation was caused due to the ‘mismanagement’ of the PSPCL as the own thermal plants were shut down on the name of surplus power in the state, said Jindal further.The power is available in many states but the PSPCL is failed to buy the power due to its worst financial position which is due to the non-payment of subsidies by the state government to the PSPCL. Due to Covid, the industries were already in crisis and these cuts deepened their troubles. Exports of more than 1,000 crore are at risk due to the cancellation of orders, added another industrialist Narinder Bhamra.The industrial heads present there have warned the government that they won’t stop their industries if some extension in cuts is announced by the government. “We will start our industries and government will be responsible for fire out of their grids,” said Jindal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/industrialists-burn-govt-effigy-over-power-cuts-281397

However, there is a need to be watchful about how mutant strains will behave.As per data from the first and second Covid waves, even severe Covid infections in children are less likely to require ICU admissions. However, we need to be watchful about how the mutant strains will behave and be ready and prepared for the worst.In the first wave, the severe disease occurred primarily in the elderly and individuals with co-morbidities. In the second wave, large number of younger age group (30-45 years) individuals have developed severe disease as also those without co-morbidities. After the second wave, if people do not continue following Covid appropriate behaviour, the third wave, if occurs, is likely to infect the remaining non-immune individuals – that may include children also.Dr Rajinder Gulati, member, Indian Academy of Paediatrics, said pandemics tend to occur in waves, and each wave causes a large number of cases. Eventually, most of the population may get immune by asymptomatic or symptomatic infections (herd immunity). Over time disease may die out or may become endemic in the community with low transmission rates.“The Serosurvey (December 2020, January 2021) showed that the percentage of infected children in the age group of 10-17 years was around 25 per cent, the same as adults. This indicates that while children are being infected like adults, they are not getting the severe disease. Children are as susceptible as adults and older individuals to develop infection but not severe disease. It is highly unlikely that the third wave will predominantly or exclusively affect children,” said Dr Gulati.The spectrum of illness is likely to be much less severe in children than adults; there is only a remote possibility of children being more severely affected than adults in next wave.Hope for the best but better be ready and prepared for the worst, added Dr Gulati further.Parents should berole models for kidsExperts highlighted the need to be ready for a significant number of patients seeking consultations, educating the parents regarding illness and warning signs on different platforms, arranging more Covid wards for children with more special wards such as high-dependency units (HDU) and intensive care units (ICU). Parents should also be ideal role models to their children regarding mask etiquette, hand hygiene, and social distancing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/highly-unlikely-that-3rd-wave-will-affect-only-kids-expert-281399
