Under this campaign, more than 300 challans have been issued in the past five days.The campaign is being led by JCP (Traffic) Deepak Pareek. He said the in-charges of traffic zones had been told to set up nakas on the highway and on the internal roads to check violations.Commuters being won over with politenessThe traffic police are attempting to change people’s perception by showcasing polite behaviour. During the present campaign, whenever the personnel stop commuters, they address them as ‘Shriman Ji’.“In the past five days of the campaign, we have issued more than 300 challans for high beam usage. Now, this campaign will continue for the next few days to check violations. High-beam lights often become the cause of road mishaps and the traffic police will not tolerate this violation,” Pareek stated.However, the JCP said apart from challaning the commuters, the traffic police personnel had also been told to make the commuters aware about the purpose of high beam.The traffic police are attempting to change people’s perception by showcasing polite behaviour. During the present campaign, whenever the personnel stop commuters, they address them as ‘Shriman Ji’. A Delhi-based driver, who was stopped for using high-beam light, was impressed with the behaviour of the cops. “I was stopped as I was using high beam but cops did not challan me. Rather, they taught me when to use high beam and when not to. They even addressed me respectfully as ‘Shriman Ji’ and took a promise from me to follow all traffic rules,” Sumit Tandon of Delhi said. The cops’ behaviour busted the myth that other state’s vehicles are never spared by the traffic police, he added. JCP Pareek said challaning was not the motive of the campaign.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/for-using-high-beam-light-over-300-challaned-in-five-days-in-ludhiana-279835

First half of June experienced above normal rainfall, which reduced thereafter. However, scattered rainfall occurred on a few occasions during this period,” he disclosed.Submitting the weather forecast for the next 10 days, the DG, IMD, said according to latest numerical weather prediction model guidance, the moist easterly winds in lower level from the Bay of Bengal are likely to spread into northwest India covering Punjab and north Haryana by July 10.“Accordingly, the southwest monsoon is likely to advance over remaining parts of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, west Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan during July 10 to 12,” he revealed.Dr Mohapatra stated that the subdued rainfall activity is very likely to continue to prevail over Punjab till July 9. However, isolated thunderstorm activity can also be expected over Punjab till July 9.“The monsoon activity would revive commencing from July 9 night with rainfall at many places in the state. It is likely to increase further during July 11 to 12 with moderate rainfall at many places over the state and isolated heavy rainfall. During the period from July 11 to 16, all the districts of Punjab are expected to receive cumulative rainfall of about 50 to 70 mm,” the IMD DG added.The report was submitted after the Chief Secretary had held a conversation with the Secretary to the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) regarding the current status of monsoon and its forecast for Punjab.Tthe continuing dry spell has led to a major power crisis in the agrarian state with the demand touching a record peak and the consumers reeling under frequent outages.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/delayed-monsoon-to-hit-punjab-on-july-10-met-279844

However, fixed charges for weekly off days shall not be levied.The PSPCL has also stipulated penalty for defaulting consumers who failed to observe weekly off days or run load in excess of restricted load. It has been laid down that for each weekly off day a penalty of Rs 100 per kVA (for first default) of maximum load used in excess of the restricted load, while for second and each subsequent default it would be Rs 200 per kVA of maximum load used in excess of the restricted load.Meanwhile, highly placed sources in the PSPCL indicated that even after the closure of most large industries and imposition of power cuts on urban feeders, the state is facing a shortfall of anything between 1,000 and 1,500 MW of power every day. Official data made available said the state’s own generation from all sources — four units each of thermal plants at Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat, hydel power projects, private power plants and renewable energy sources — is to the tune of 5,000 MW. With addition of its share in BBMB and Central grid, the state could muster around 11,500 MW, which still leave a gap between the total demand and availability of power.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/power-crisis-no-supply-to-large-units-for-3-days-279848
08-07-2021||Ludhiana||Residents feel the pinch of hiked water supply, sewer charges||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic and ahead of the Assembly elections, a number of owners of properties above 125 sq yards are feeling the pinch as they have to pay the hiked water and sewer charges. Now, bills of six-month period are being generated with an increased tariff while the civic body had issued yearly bills last year.After the hike, the water supply and sewerage bill amount for six months is Rs 2,100 for 126-250 sq yard houses, Rs 2,700 for 251-500 sq yards and Rs 3,600 for residential properties above 500 sq yards. After ending the exemption, the Municipal Corporation (MC) had also fixed Rs 1,200 bill amount for 51-125 sq yard houses.When leaders of different political parties raised the issue of houses up to 125 sq yards, Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu recently announced to restore the exemption of houses up to 125 sq yards from levy of water supply and sewerage charges but there is no relief for the properties above 125 sq yards from the hiked charges.A city resident said: “My house is in the category of above 125 sq yards. My annual bill was around Rs 2,400 last year but now, I will have to pay Rs 4,200 yearly. When I checked the MC website, it shows that my water supply and sewerage bill amount is Rs 1,890 (after 10 per cent rebate) for six months, up to September 30, 2021. The MC has hiked the charges very much at this time of crisis, instead of announcing any relief. It would be better if water meters are installed and charges be collected accordingly.”In November 2020, the MC House had approved a resolution regarding a hike in the water and sewer tariff. Most of the councillors of opposition parties as well as the ruling Congress had remained mum on the resolution regarding the hike in user charges during the meeting.AAP leader Keemti Rawal said: “The civic body should not charge any hiked water supply charges as people were already facing financial problems due to the pandemic. The hiked water supply and sewer charges should be revoked with immediate effect. Besides, the Mayor has announced to restore exemption for residential properties up to 125 sq yards. It is merely an announcement ahead of the Assembly elections. A resolution in this regard should be presented in the House meeting to restore the exemption in a real manner.”An official said they had not received any written document to restore the exemption of residential properties up to 125 sq yards from levy of water supply and sewerage charges. Bills for houses above 125 sq yards had been generated as per the hiked tariff.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/residents-feel-the-pinch-of-hiked-water-supply-sewer-charges-279850

Moreover, the government is ending the allowances instead of hiking them”.The protesters said employees from across the state would gather in Patiala on July 13 and gherao the Moti Mehal to mark their protest.

But all their hopes had dashed to the ground, especially in case of vets and medicos, as the NPA had been slashed from 25 to 20 per cent and also delinked to be part of salary.He stressed that the privilege of the NPA had been granted to medicos and vets by the previous Pay Commissions, keeping in view the long period of study, late entry to service and arduous job conditions for past several years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/6th-pay-commission-vets-assn-decry-punjab-govts-double-standards-279855

The State of Punjab through the Chief Secretary, the Principal Secretary of the Department of Local Government and the Chairman of LIT have been made respondents in the case.Kapil Arora, president of the CoE, who is the petitioner, made the submission that the LIT had chalked out a plan to carve out 33 residential plots of 200 square yards each in designated green belt situated behind House Nos 651-E to 684-E in Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar while citing some landmark judgments of the Supreme Court as well as the NGT made in similar type of cases.Explaining the present case the petitioner said even though the CoE had already served a legal notice to the chief secretary for action plan of clear air in Punjab in pursuant to directions issued by the NGT but still the LIT seemed to be going ahead with its plan which was evident from bricks and building material dumped at the site of green belt for construction work which indicated that the LIT chairman had scant regard for directions of both the Supreme Court and the NGT.Arora contended, “Conversion of designated green belts into residential plots is like encroachment over the land left for its prime motive. In similar instances, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has even quashed the amendment in Master Plan changing use of area in question from green belt to residential one quoting that the purpose shall never be changed in any other manner whatsoever. ”The petition has pointed out that the colony was developed by the LIT in mid-1970s and with increase in the number of plots in the locality, air pollution had assumed alarming proportions. With increasing commercial activity coupled with conversion of designated green belt into residential plots, the land area under green belt would decrease and quality of air would deteriorate further. As many as 54 trees had already been axed by the LIT.The petitioner has prayed to the NGT to restrain the LIT and also issue directions to the chief secretary and other respondents for restitution of said designated green belt along with plantation of saplings 20 times the trees axed in the area. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/engineers-body-moves-ngt-against-ludhiana-improvement-trust-decision-279861
