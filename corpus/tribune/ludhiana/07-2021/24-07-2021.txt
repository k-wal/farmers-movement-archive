The admission process shall continue for the next two-three months. Moreover, it is only possible to vaccinate the students if the local administration organises a permanent camp after August 10 in all colleges, so that each student visiting the college during admission days is vaccinated. Moreover, the vaccination cannot be carried out without the consent of the parents, which is a tedious process, especially as we are not in personal contact with the students.”Narinder Singh Sidhu, principal, Guru Nanak National College, DorahaAchieving complete vaccination within this stipulated period will not be possible since a majority of the students are appearing for their final examinations , which are going to be held till July 31. Even if the students are being informed about the deadline, the response is nominal.Narinder Singh Sidhu, principal of Guru Nanak National College, Doraha, said “Achieving complete vaccination within this stipulate period of time shall not be possible since a majority of the students are appearing for their final examinations at present, which are going to last till July 31. Even if the students are being informed about the deadline, the response is nominal. This is for the simple reason that getting vaccinated in between the exams may affect their attempt. They are worried about the after affects of the shot. The colleges cannot carry out any vaccination drive till the culmination of exams due to unwillingness on part of the students”.Tejinder Dhaliwal, principal of Guru Nanak College for Girls, Muktsar, said students were not attending college in person. Getting in touch with them and convincing them and their parents for vaccination needs to be done in steps. Assuring 100 per cent vaccination in few days was simply not possible. “The DPI Colleges has to give more time to the institutions to ensure complete vaccination,” he maintained.“Moreover, vaccine shortage is another great hindrance in achieving the target. Many a times, day-long camps run out of stock within the first hour. In the wake of the situation, it is difficult to establish coordination with the Health Department as well as students and plan a camp,” he added.A student said, “I am at present appearing for my BA semester II examinations, last being on July 31. The college where I study has asked me to ensure vaccination till that very date. Even if I think of getting vaccinated on the last day, I may not be able to since vaccination is in short supply”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/difficult-to-achieve-student-vaccine-target-say-colleges-287412
