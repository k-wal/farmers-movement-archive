Therefore, the PPCB carried out random inspections of acid pickling units through its officers.Verma informed that two erring units, namely Ravindra Alloys Industries on Jaspal Bangar Road and Sond Impex in Phase-IV, Focal Point, Ludhiana, have been closed and environmental compensation of Rs 12 lakh has been imposed on the eight erring units, namely Ganpati Fasteners Pvt Ltd, Ashoka Industrial Fasterners, Bansal Industries, Ashoka Industrial Fasterners, Amarjit Steel, Vishnu, Ashish International and Abhey Steels Pvt Ltd. (Rs 1.5 lakh on each unit).Anurag Verma informed that during inspection, a number of irregularities were found in these units. “Samples of acids being used by these industries were also taken and observed that these industries are using HCl acid in acid pickling process although they have taken consent from the board for use of sulphuric acid only. Moreover, these units are sending spent HCl to a reprocessing unit located at Kohara operating under the name of JBR Technologies Pvt Ltd, which has infrastructure for treatment of spent sulphuric acid only,” he said.“Thus, these industries are maintaining inappropriate disposal mechanism due to change in the type of acid used without the permission of the board. The final disposal of HCl-based spent acid is doubtful and there is a likelihood of discharge of it into sewer,” he said.He informed that a medium scale unit, Vallabh Steels Ltd, Nandpur village, Ludhiana, was operating without obtaining valid consents from the board. Further, the unit has decreased the quantity of agreement for lifting of spent acid from 1,20,000 litres per month to 29,000 litres per month without submission of any reason. Therefore, the unit has been imposed environmental compensation of Rs 1.5 lakh by the board.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ppcb-closes-2-units-imposes-rs-13-5l-compensation-on-nine-in-ludhiana-290437

As a result, polluted water is continuously flowing into the fields, damaging the crops and leaving farmers worried.Villagers said the banks had breached when the city received rainfall recently but no concrete steps were taken to repair the damaged portions of the banks. Water is still flowing into the fields since the level of the drain rose again after yesterday’s showers.Villagers are demanding that the district administration takes necessary steps for re-construction of the bank portion and cleaning of the drain at the earliest. They also demanded compensation to the affected farmers.Sukhwinder Singh Bittu of Bagga Khurd, a village located near the drain, said, “The Buddha Nullah bank near Talwara was damaged due to heavy rainfall a few days ago but no steps were taken to reconstruct the bundh. Now, the drain water is continuously flowing into paddy fields of a number of farmers and damaging the crop.The administration and the government departments concerned must take steps to reconstruct the nullah bundh. Moreover, the government should pay compensation to the farmers whose crops have been damaged.”Another villager, Iqbal Singh, said “When the water level in the drain starts rising, the polluted water flows into the fields. It has already entered 35-40 acres of fields. The affected farmers have faced losses in lakhs. The polluted water has damaged my paddy crop too.”Executive Engineer of Drainage Department Harjot Singh Walia said, “As soon as the water level goes down in Buddha Nullah, the work to repair its banks will be started.”He, however, claimed that the level of an adjoining field was low that’s why water flowed there but it was not a major problem.It is required to mention that a huge amount of trash has got collected in the Buddha Nullah, outside the civic body’s limit. Despite repeated demands of the villagers, the authorities concerned failed to get the drain cleaned or banks of the nullah strengthened timely. Residents have been demanding construction of a retaining wall as a permanent bundh to avoid flooding in the drain.After rainfall in July 2017 and 2018, the Buddha Nullah had overflowed near Peeru Banda and New Kundan Puri areas. On August 1, 2019, the nullah overflowed from at least three different locations and its highly polluted water entered nearby fields and streets in these areas. A portion of the nullah bundh was also washed away and the MC took two days to plug the breach.On August 20, 2019, after a sudden rise in the nullah water level due to Sutlej river swelling, two breaches at different locations on the Tajpur Road had flooded the slum area and nearby streets. At that time, the sewer water had also flown back in New Kundanpuri and some other areas along the Buddha Nullah.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhianas-buddha-nullah-breaches-bank-near-talwara-village-290438

Of these, 93 buildings lie in Zone A and nine in Zone B. On the face of it, the building branch of the Municipal Corporation (MC) has not taken any action at all or at most, notices for violation have been issued without any further follow up action as per the rules.In a complaint lodged with the Principal Secretary, Local Government Department; Director, Local Bodies; Chief Town Planner, Local Government; and Chief Vigilance Officer, Local Government Department, Punjab, city-based social activist Gajjan Singh Jassal has alleged that while construction of hundreds of illegal buildings was continuing with impunity in Zones A and B, the field staff (building inspectors) and their supervisory officials (Assistant Town Planners concerned) were turning a blind eye to these blatant violations.Supporting his complaint with photographic evidence of all illegal commercial buildings, Jassal said all such commercial and industrial buildings had been constructed without approved building plans, without paying change of land use (CLU) charges and other violations, like excess coverage and inadequate parking space, had also been committed.The complainant further said that it was beyond comprehension as to how so many buildings (most of them multi-storeyed) were constructed right under the nose of the MC, without evoking any kind of reaction. “If at all any action has been taken against the builders of these complexes, it remains on paper,” said Jassal, while demanding disciplinary action against MC officials concerned.Municipal Town Planner SS Bindra said around 40 out of the 102 buildings were outside the jurisdiction of the MC where no action could be taken. About the other alleged illegal buildings, the ATPs concerned had been directed to issue notices or take follow up action if notices had been served. They had also been asked to certify that no financial loss had been caused to government exchequer by these buildings, he maintained.“We shall deal strictly with the defaulters and nobody would be spared,” the MTP added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/illegal-commercial-buildings-galore-in-ludhiana-mc-in-slumber-290447

Traffic came to a standstill during the protest, inconveniencing commuters.District president of the Union Kirandeep Kaur said they had been working tirelessly during the pandemic but the government was not paying any heed towards their demands. “Our main demands include a fixed salary of Rs 15,000 per month, Rs 500 per tour, smartphone and monthly incentives,” she said.Kirandeep said “Our salaries should be fixed so that we have a sense of security and are able to carry out our work with confidence”.Another ASHA worker, Rajbir Kaur, said they had been assigned the work to feed data on the government portal and hence needed a smartphone. “Not every ASHA worker has a smartphone and in such a situation, it becomes very difficult to enter the data. Sometimes, we go back home and ask someone in the family/neighbour to lend us a phone to do our work. We are not able to upload the data by 5 pm, as required, because we do not have smartphones,” Rajbir stated.Kirandeep further said they had worked as frontline workers during the pandemic but were not given proper safety gear, thus risking their as well as the lives of their family members.
