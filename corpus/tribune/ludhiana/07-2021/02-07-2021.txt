Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, and Dr Balwinder from Punjab Homeopathic associations along with other doctors held protest at the civil hospital against the delinking of Non-Practicing Allowance (NPA) from basic pay.“What to expect any benefit/allowance from the government, it has reduced our salaries. Doctors never looked back and were serving 24x7 amidst the pandemic and this is what we have been rewarded with,” said Dr Rohit Rampal from Punjab Civil Medical Services Association.“Blinkered attitude of the state government towards the demands of rural doctors and giving no ear to the long pending demand of Dynamic Assured Career Progression (DACP) and now cut on NPA has left the cadre of rural doctors in disappointment, and now we have decided to boycott all the programs of state government and started it by observing Doctors’ Day as black day across Punjab,” said Dr JP Narula, state president, Rural Medical Services Association.He further added that Rural Medical Officers are tirelessly working on frontline amidst Covid, immunisation in rural areas is largely supervised by the cadre of RMOs but instead of encouraging them the government is deliberately demoralising.Dr Jagjit Singh Bajwa, president, Association of Rural Medical Officers, Punjab, said, “The rural veterinary officers who were regularized along with rural medical officers have got their right of DACP from 2015, but we the RMOs are still running from pillar to post to get our legitimate right”.Functions held at pvt hospitalsA small function was held today in the main reception area of Hero DMC Heart Institute.

However, school students in the district are yet to receive textbooks of many subjects for their coming exams, starting from July 5.A teacher at a government school said books of science and maths are yet to be given to students. In such scenario, how can they take the online exam when textbooks are still not distributed?, said the teacher.“The department has focused all its attention in enrolling more and more students in government schools but the textbooks are not published accordingly. If the department had the plan to increase enrolment, it would have got the books published in bulk. The parents are approaching us and we are telling them to take help of guides and wait for the textbooks, which is unjustified,” said the teacher.Another teacher complained that as far as quality education is concerned, Punjab is far behind other states. “There are no qualified teachers, vacancies are lying in schools, books are not available on time etc. The department should focus on quality instead of enrolling more and more students”, rued the teacher.The students are yet to get books for subjects such as science, maths and social science and these are being sent in instalments, said the teachers.Sukhdarshan Singh, a teacher at Kot Mangal Singh, said the department has a list of all students and at least basic books should be provided to them.

While the mixed and urban feeders were subject to power cuts, ranging between an hour and a half to three hours in some cases, the power intensive and large supply (LS) consumers have been directed to observe compulsory two-day off every week starting from 4 pm today (July 1 to July 3).Residents of several localities along the Ferozepur Road, Durgapuri in Haibowal, Chandigarh Road, Basti Jodhewal, Basti Mani Singh and various old city localities, complained of nearly two-hour long outages twice in the day. The power supply remained shut down in Civil Lines for almost an hour this afternoon and then again in the late evening, causing inconvenience to people.In some areas of Haibowal, falling under Aggar Nagar Division of PSPCL, and Basti Mani Singh, residents complained that power supply remained disrupted for the whole night while in some adjoining areas, voltage was either very low or kept fluctuating. “We had to switch off all electrical appliances fearing damage from unstable voltage,” a Durgapuri resident said.Residents of various localities blamed the PSPCL staff for apathy and indifference. They said even as they suffered due to power failure during the night and had to go without water supply in the morning as well, the officials remained oblivious and repeated complaints went unheeded.A resident of Basti Jodhewal said the spurt in demand for power in this particular season (peak paddy sowing and extremely hot weather) was not a new phenomenon, but despite the tall promises of assured supply, both the political leadership and the PSPCL top brass had failed to take timely measures to arrange additional power supply. “We are paying a heavy price for poor power management by the government and the PSPCL management,” he rued.Sources at the PSPCL headquarters indicated that the total demand for power in the state had exceeded 14,000 MW while the availability from all sources (including Bhakra and central grid) was not more than 12,800 MW. “We are finding it tough to manage the situation, even as three units of Guru Gobind Singh Thermal Power Plant at Ropar and four units at Lehra Mohabbat are generating 550 and 830 MW additional power,” the source added.Meanwhile, as an emergency measure, the PSPCL management has directed all general industry (LS) consumers, rolling mills and induction furnace units fed from category 2 and 3 feeders in the entire Central Zone to observe two compulsory weekly off days with immediate effect.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-reels-under-unscheduled-power-cuts-277111
