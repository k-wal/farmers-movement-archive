But when cases declined, we realised the urgency of the decision.Payal SDM Mankanwal Singh Chahal said: “The initial resistance towards lockdown has turned into a natural acceptance with the passage of time. The public is less reactive now and is ready to close their shops as per the lockdown and curfew orders. In rural areas, however, there is still the need to keep a vigil since villagers tend to be casual in their approach towards the virus.”Khanna DSP Daman Bir Singh said: “The number of challans has reduced with time.

The complainant claimed that immediately after a team of MC officials had demolished some structures and dug out internal development works (man holes and underground pipes), the developer had resumed the internal development of the colony.He alleged that the developer had struck a deal with the MC field staff and was going ahead with the development works in the colony without any fear of law or punitive action.Jassal further alleged that the developer had not obtained any permission for development of a colony at agricultural land, nor were the change of land use (CLU) norms were fulfilled. “By carving out an unlicensed and illegal colony and violating provisions of open spaces, parks, play grounds, sewerage and water treatment plants, that too without getting statutory approval from the competent authority, the developer is cheating gullible public,” said the complainant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/illegal-colonies-construction-continues-despite-ludhiana-municipal-corporations-action-266291

However, the protestrrs alleged that the administration was acting to facilitate normal functioning at the port owned by Adani Group.Gujjarwal alleged that the administration has been trying to get the dharna lifted on the instance of owners of the Dry Port.“We have decided not withdraw our movement at any cost till the Union Government repeals the three farm laws,” said Harnek Singh Gujjarwal arguing that the dharna was not laid on protest of some local issue.

The valley will provide impetus to the flourishing business-friendly ecosystem across all sectors.A decision to this effect was taken at a high-level meeting, chaired by the Chief Secretary, recently.The Principal Secretary, Industries and Commerce, Alok Shekhar, intimated at the meeting that the internal works of the project of key concern for all components would be completed by the end of this year.He disclosed that e-tendering for plots and units would be floated soon and a few large industries had shown interest to bid for the large plots.He informed that a deficit of Rs 7 crore had emerged in the budget provided by the government for the road project.The meeting decided to make a proposal to the Finance Department to allot the balance amount.Recently, a leading bicycle manufacturer, Hero Cycles, had set up an anchor unit spread over 100 acres of land in the cycle valley for the manufacturing of mobility solutions like bicycles and e-bikes.A provision of Rs 22 crore has been made in the Punjab Budget 2021-22 for creation of capital assets in the valley.The state government was developing the cycle valley with an aim to attract new investors not only from within the country but also from overseas.The approved industrial park would not only attract global investments but also facilitate Punjab-based industries to expand their capacities thereby generating new employment opportunities in the state.While a concrete four-lane road to connect the valley directly with the Ludhiana-Chandigarh NH-5 has already been completed at the cost of Rs 33.53 crore, the storm water drainage, effluent collection system and water supply distribution system will be accomplished by July.

The establishment of the industrial park is evident testament of receptiveness of the Punjab Government to the industry feedback and timely implementation of required policies and decisions on ground. The valley will provide impetus to the flourishing business-friendly ecosystem across all sectors. As proven in the leading economies of the world, focusing on the development of industrial infrastructure by the government has always been instrumental in harnessing the investment and sustainable development of the economy.”Investment destinationTo attract the global and local investors in the valley, the Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion has been aggressively reaching out to the investors to attract investment in the valley by highlighting the vast investment opportunities in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/e-auction-of-plots-at-upcoming-hi-tech-cycle-valley-soon-in-ludhiana-266277
