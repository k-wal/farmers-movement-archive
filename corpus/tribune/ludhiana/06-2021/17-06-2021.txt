The dependent domestic manufacturers are bearing the brunt as steel is available to them at exorbitant rates. The steep hike in steel prices is not market-driven. Stimulus packages have increased the consumption in global market,” reads the communication.The prices of steel are at unprecedent highs owing to increased demand amid low allocation of production for the domestic market coupled with minimal imports due to import restrictions imposed by the Centre. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/crack-whip-on-steel-cartel-demands-fico-269807

The deformity was seemingly due to parasitic siamese twins that were not compatible with life.Clinically, the child was conscious and oriented and can walk on his two legs, while his third leg also shows normal neurological responses.The patient from Haibowal was brought to Deep Hospital in Ludhiana by a NGO where he was diagnosed by Dr Baldeep Singh, Head, Paediatrics Department, Deep Hospital.Surgery which took six hours was performed yesterday at the hands of four expert teams of the Hospital, comprising neurosurgeon Dr RK Kaushal, Head of Department, Neurosurgery, Orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Mohammad Yamin, HOD, Orthopaedics, and Paediatric surgeon, Dr RJ Singh, HOD, Paediatric Surgery and Dr Tah, Senior Consultant, Plastic Surgeon.“This is the first of its kind surgery to be done in Punjab till date and the third such case in the country, with the previous two surgeries reportedly having happened at the AIIMS, Delhi, many years ago,” said Dr Baldeep.“The boy had a birth defect where an additional rudimentary leg was arising from the back in addition to the two normal legs. The third leg was neurologically intact although the power in that leg was reduced. This ‘Tripod Deformity’ is seemingly due to a parasitic Siamese twin, the body of which degenerated leaving the leg behind in the other twin, which fused with the back of the baby,” said Dr Yamin.The patient had undergone an MRI scan which showed the presence of Femur tibia fibula and the knee joint in the additional leg. After reaching this diagnosis, a decision was made by the expert team of doctors at Deep Hospital to remove this leg. The surgery required a multi-disciplinary approach with the involvement of 4 departments working together, said Dr RJ Singh.“The patient is currently in the paediatric ICU and is recovering as per expectation,” said Dr Kaushal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/doctors-perform-rare-surgery-on-infant-with-tripod-deformity-in-ludhiana-269805

He said rainy season was here and rather than completing work to fill up deep potholes on roads and streets, nearly half of the city roads had been dug up either to lay sewer or storm water drainage or for construction of major development projects being undertaken under the Smart City Mission.Ill-preparedness for rainy season would once again turn city roads and streets into water bodies, disrupt vehicular traffic, cause road accidents and make the lives of city residents miserable. “About the grave insanitary conditions in the city, the less said the better. To make the matter worse, road gullies and open drains have not been cleaned, which will cause massive waterlogging on roads and also cause immense damage to many of the recently constructed road and streets,” he added.Mehta alleged that corruption had crossed all limits in the MC administration at all levels to the extent that officials were openly conniving with contractors in siphoning off public funds, building branch officials had become puppets of unscrupulous builders and overcharging at MC paid parking was rampant.Summing up the sorry state of civic affairs, the former councillor said anti-people policies and actions of the MC top functionaries were bringing a bad name to the Congress government in the state and it was time that both the Mayor and Commissioner pulled up their socks to set their house in order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ex-councillor-slams-faulty-working-corruption-in-ludhiana-municipal-corporation-269618

The MC top brass and other members of the F&CC apparently agreed with the apprehensions of most other political parties in general and city residents in particular that handing over recovery of arrears of user charges in private hands could lead to strong-arm tactics and highhandedness on the part of recovery agents.The MC, however, called upon the Punjab Government to provide adequate field and clerical staff to efficiently handle recovery of user charges at its own level because the move for privatisation was necessitated by shortage of employeed at various levels.Among other issues discussed in the F&CC meeting were approval of tenders and issuance of work orders to successful bidders for nearly 140 development works, mostly those of road construction with premix carpet, cement concrete and laying interlocking tiles, fixing upper ceiling for bids in relation to CSR (common schedule of rates) to deal with the menace of pooling by contractors and inviting bids for paid parking sites in Sarabha Nagar and Model Town Extension markets. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/fcc-meeting-ludhiana-civic-body-defers-penalty-on-late-renewal-of-trade-licences-269616

A young married woman of 19, who was deserted at her native place in Bihar, was reunited with her husband working as a daily wager here after she travelled all the way from Patna to Ludhiana.Dr Pragya Jain, ADCP-I, LudhianaAfter a lot of cajoling, she narrated how her husband left her back in Bihar after a fight and how she reached Ludhiana and now has no place to live. Gradually, she told the incomplete mobile number of her husband.Penniless, the migrant destitute reached here by train, travelling without a ticket. But her ordeal did not end here. Oblivious of her estranged partner’s whereabouts, the woman was roaming aimlessly in the industrial city when a local tailor turned saviour for her and gave her shelter at his home before taking her to the local police for tracing her husband and arranging their reunion.Even as the local police station staff, where the tailor took the woman initially, proved helpless, the Good Samaritan did not lose hope and reached the Ludhiana Police Commissionerate headquarters to seek appointment with the ADCP-I, Dr Pragya Jain, about whom he had heard and read the story of how this woman IPS officer had come to the aid of a minor rape survivor while going beyond the call of her duty recently.The sustained efforts of the tailor-turned-survivor bore fruit as the Commissionerate Police not only traced the deserted woman’s husband and arranged their reunion but also ensured their rehabilitation.“Our officers and field staffers worked overtime to trace the man, of whom the woman was having no contact details. After being traced, the man posed stiff resistance to accept the woman. However, we managed to arrange their reunion under “Operation Reunion” and ensured their rehabilitation with the help of local community,” the Commissioner of Police (CP), Rakesh Agrawal, told The Tribune, here on Wednesday.Sharing details, ADCP-I Dr Pragya Jain, who arranged the reunion and rehabilitation of the poor couple, said Munni belonged to Bidipur village in Nalanda district of Bihar and was married to Rohit Choudhary, who had deserted her in Bihar last month following a domestic spat. Married for five years, she was a mother of two kids, aged three and two years.On June 13, without informing anyone and leaving her kids behind with her parents, who were also daily wagers, she boarded a train from Patna to Ludhiana, without ticket, in a bid to search her husband.“Having no money, no mobile phone and no luggage, she reached the Salem Tabri area and started wandering aimlessly, asking for her husband, without knowing his whereabouts,” revealed the ADCP.A local tailor, Budh Dev, on seeing the destitute woman, took her to the nearby police station as she was unable to share anything about herself.Not satisfied with the response of the police station staff, Dev provided her shelter with his own family, while trying to locate her family. Today, he reached the Police Commissionerate and sought appointment with Dr Pragya Jain.“I was intrigued at the peculiar situation and was touched by the heart-warming selfless effort of Dev,” expressed the ADCP. She herself sat with the woman and talked to her at length trying to elicit any information about her background.“After a lot of cajoling, she started narrating her ordeal, how her husband had left her back home in Bihar after a fight and how she reached Ludhiana and now has no place to live. Gradually, she told the incomplete mobile number of her husband without knowing one of the digits,” Dr Jain said.While trying to locate her husband, the police also arranged her further stay at Mother Teresa’s charitable home. “We tried all the possible mobile number combinations, called them up, some of which went unanswered. Then, we tried a few mobile apps, revealing photos and identity of the number owner, following which the woman identified one of the photos as that of her husband’s,” the woman IPS officer said.As technical aids revealed the man’s location, a police team, headed by SI Rashpal Kaur, found the man working at a local iron factory.“But her ordeal was not over yet as her husband refused to take her back, alleging marital discord. Our team then engaged with the local community leaders and factory owners to counsel both,” the ADCP shared.Finally, with the combined efforts of the police and community, the couple was reunited and their return trip to Bihar was sponsored to bring back their minor children to Ludhiana and stay happily here.The Good samaritanA local tailor, Budh Dev, on seeing the destitute woman, took her to the nearby police station as she was unable to share anything about herself. Not satisfied with the response of the police station staff, Dev provided her shelter with his own family, while trying to locate her family.
