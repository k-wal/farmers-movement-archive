Residents have complained to the Municipal Corporation (MC) authorities in this regard and sought action to provide them immediate relief.Sandeep Luthra, owner of Om Sai Computers at Giaspura, said, “Garbage is being disposed of on a plot located near my shop. Meat waste in large quantity is also dumped here. It is hard to breathe due to smell emanating for the piled up waste. We request the MC authorities to take action and provide us relief at the earliest.”Earlier, they had asked an unidentified person to stop dumping waste on the plot, but to no avail, he added. “The meat waste is generally dumped after midnight when most people are sleeping. We don’t know people, who dump waste here,” he said.Another resident said, “The MC has not provided any garbage collection facility for this area on a daily basis. Even if garbage collectors come once in a while they ask for Rs100 from each person. There are many labourers living in the area and they can’t afford to pay Rs100 for lifting garbage.” “The MC should make arrangements for garbage lifting on a daily basis at nominal charges. During rainy season heaps of waste invite flies and mosquitoes, which pose a threat of spreading diseases in the area,” he added.Meanwhile, the MC Zonal Commissioner, Neeraj Jain, has given instructions to the staff concerned to take required action on complaints of Giaspura residents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/meat-waste-dumped-on-vacant-plot-at-giaspura-residents-irked-275732

Now, with the implementation of the 6th Pay Commission, it has been delinked from pay and reduced to 20 per cent which means it has been fixed now and no other allowances will be calculated on the NPA.It will remarkably effect the net salary of all government doctors being allopathic, ayurvedic, homeopathic or veterinary,” said Dr Rohit Rampal from the Punjab Civil Medical Services Association.Meanwhile, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) teachers also joined the protest on the university campus against the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission during a protest call given by various Punjab veterinary and medical associations.During the demonstration, teachers argued that the reduction of the NPA shows the anti-employee mindset of the present government. The GADVASU Teachers’ Association expressed dismay over the state government’s move to reduce the NPA of veterinarians, medicos and other doctors along with delinking it from basic pay structure.They took a strong note of the government’s move to reduce existing NPA from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. Furthermore, the government delinked the NPA to be a part of salary for calculation of other allowances and post retirement pensionary benefits.They argued that in spite of honouring the doctors for working hard during the Covid pandemic, the government has played a cruel joke by reducing their allowances. Veterinary clinicians serve the poorest of poor in society and reducing their pay show anti-poor nature of the government. The government must not forget that professionals in veterinary field were granted the NPA due to their late entry to the service owing to extended period of studies as compared to non-medical professionals.There is a strong resentment in veterinary faculty and the veterinary fraternity throughout the state is gearing up for a state-level protest.Patients at receiving endAmid the strike by the doctors, it were patients who were at the receiving end and had to return to their homes without consultation from doctors. Suraj Kumar had come for getting his disability certificate but had to return without the same. “I need it urgently but upon reaching here I came to know that doctors were on strike,” he said. Another patient from Basti Jodhewal said earlier he came on Friday and doctors were on strike and today also the doctors are on strike. “Where should patients go,” he questioned. “I cannot afford to go to a private doctor as the consultation fees is high but with doctors of the Civil Hospital on strike there is no other option left but to shell out extra money at private hospitals,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/6th-pay-commission-services-at-ludhiana-civil-hospital-hit-as-doctors-protest-275730
