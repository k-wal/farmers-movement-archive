A number of measurement books are missing from the civic body’s records.Now, these officials have been served show-cause notices and if they failed to file a satisfactory reply, necessary action may be taken against them.Following a complaint regarding the missing measurement books from the MC records, the Local Bodies Department has asked the civic body to send an action-taken report against the officials concerned.The Department of Local Government has written to the MC Commissioner that the Municipal Corporation had sent show-cause notices to 59 officials but a case was forwarded to the government to take action against only 17 officials. The Department has asked the civic body to send an action-taken report or fresh status report against the remaining 42 officials too so that further action can be initiated.Earlier, the Local Fund Account Punjab had also raised objections in audit reports of the MC, Ludhiana, that a number of measurement books were not submitted by the officials concerned for audit.But, the civic body had a soft corner for the officials concerned. Even, some officials who had not submitted the measurement books in the past had been awarded promotions too, sources said.It is mandatory for the officials to submit the measurement books in the MC records. It is a violation of the Municipal Account Code, 1930, if the books are not submitted to the civic body, as per information.Notably, a financial audit report that was prepared by a third party firm more than a year ago had also disclosed that the measurement books were not being maintained by the officials as per the engineering procedure.Jr engineers blame asst engineer for ‘fraud’Meanwhile, three junior engineers at the Zone C have written to the MC authorities against an assistant engineer of the B&R branch for allegedly taking their signatures in a “fraudulent” manner on documents regarding receiving of some old measurement books. But, the assistant engineer had not submitted the old measurement books to them in reality as they alleged.The junior engineers, who have been working with the MC for a short period, alleged that the measurement books were still in the possession of the assistant engineer concerned. They said they were facing mental harassment as the assistant engineer was giving them “transfer threats” too. They have requested the MC authorities to mark a probe into the matter and provide them justice.Additional Commissioner Rishipal Singh said show-cause notices had been sent to the officials who had not submitted the measurements books to the Municipal Corporation.He said if they did not file any satisfactory reply, necessary action would be taken against them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/role-of-59-officials-under-scanner-for-missing-measurement-books-270775

19-06-2021||Ludhiana||Fire Dept reels under staff crunch||Though the fire brigade has started getting the fire tenders and other required stuff gradually under the Smart City Mission, their major issue of staff crunch still remains unresolved.The authorities concerned are not paying attention towards the issue which can seriously affect the disaster response mechanism in case any major fire incident takes place in city.Only 5 fire stations for 17 lakh peopleDespite the city has over 17 lakh population, the industrial hub is only having only five fire stations catering to the population. Fire stations have around 21 fire tenders and this number is not according to the norms of population. As per the norms, one fire tender is required after every 50,000 population and according to city’s population, which is over 17 lakhs, 34 fire tenders are required.Recently, the Fire Department has been given four small quick response vehicles and three live detectors (victim locators). The quick response vehicles will enter the narrow lanes of old city areas where big fire tenders cannot reach, especially in those areas where many hosiery units are located. These live detectors will help the fire officials in sensing if any human being is trapped inside the building at the time of fire incident.Apart from this, five inflatable lights were also allocated to the fire Brigade. As compared to this, staff is inadequate to handle things.However, the department is facing huge staff crunch. Against 147 regular posts only 33 posts are filled while 114 posts are lying vacant. Interestingly, the post of assistant divisional fire officer has been lying vacant from long time but recently it was filled. Against four regular posts of fire station officers there is one fire station officer and 15 sub fire officers there are six fire officers while rest of the posts are still pending. However, as many as 67 employees (50 fireman and 17 drivers) hired through the PESCO.A fireman, on the condition of anonymity, claimed that they got four quick response vehicles so as to reach in time for controlling the situation but staff is equally important. He said there is hardly any planning to recruit more regular staff. He claimed that due to the lockdown not many fire incidents are taking place but during normal days it is difficult to handle the peak season when they have to work for more than 12 hours and they are also not getting any overtime for the same.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/fire-dept-reels-under-staff-crunch-270779
