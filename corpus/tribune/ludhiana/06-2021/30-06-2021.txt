30-06-2021||Ludhiana||Ludhiana police open modernised cyber cell||The Ludhiana police today inaugurated its newly renovated, updated and modernised cyber cell at the Sarabha Nagar police station building. It will decrease the dependence of the city police on the Mohali cyber cell police station.Ludhiana Commissioner of Police (CP) Rakesh Agrawal, along with Joint Commissioner of Police J Elanchezian, Rupinder Kaur Bhatti, ADCP (Investigation), Vaibhav Sehgal, ACP, Cyber Crime-I, and Kulwant Singh, ACP, Cyber Crime-II, inaugurated the cell.The CP said with the rising cases of cyber crime, a need was felt to upgrade and differentiate the working environment of the cyber cell from that of a regular police station.The new cyber cell consists of offices for ACP Cyber 1 and 2, in-charges Cyber zone 1 and 2 and separate working cubicles have been created for IOs in a modern cyber lab.“It would allow better and efficient distribution of work. Moreover, new hardware and software infrastructure will be added to the cyber lab to ensure quick, time-bound redressal of complaints and technical and scientific investigation in cases of cyber crime, “he said.Along with enhancing the capabilities of the Ludhiana police, the upgrade would create an overall public-friendly environment by providing better facilities for the public at large, Agrawal said, adding that moreover, it would ensure greater privacy to complainants which would encourage more people, especially women, to reach out to the Cyber Cell to air their grievances.Cyber cell daily receiving 300-400 complaints: ADCPADCP (Investigation) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said the cyber Cell received on an average of 300-400 complaints every month in 2020-2021. Despite this huge workload, staff shortage and impact of Covid lockdown, the Cyber Cell had an impressive performance in 2020-21. Nearly 1,700 complaints had been disposed of, resulting in registration of only 28 FIRs in the past year itself. Along with this, the Cyber Cell has ensured recovery/refund to the amount of Rs 40 lakh in the past one year, thus saving the hard-earned money of citizens.The CP added that at present, cyber crime unit (CCU), Ludhiana, was investigating cases under 21 different crime heads and there were approximately 2,600 complaints pending for inquiry in the unit. The Cyber Cell was the only cell that covers the entire vast jurisdiction area of the Ludhiana Commissionerate with 28 police stations and a population of over 40 lakh. Ludhiana being an industrial and modern city, cyber crime cases had been increasing rapidly. Besides, the CCU was also receiving complaints through the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, which is functioning under the Cyber Crime Prevention against Women and Children (CCPWC) scheme by the Ministry of Home Affairs. In these complaints, inquiry was conducted/completed in a time-bound manner. Hence to expedite the inquiry/investigation of cyber complaints/cases, there was a proposal to set up a cyber police station in Ludhiana with increased staff and latest technical capabilities.Inspector Pawan Kumar, Cyber Cell in-charge, said the cell had been regularly using social media networking sites to create awareness among the public regarding various types of cyber crimes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-police-open-modernised-cyber-cell-276129

In the absence of waste processing, more heaps of refuse have come up at the dumping site in the past five months since a private firm, A2Z group, terminated its services. Questions are being raised over the role of the MC for not taking any concrete steps to ensure processing of the waste till date.In the rainy season, woes of the residents have increased. A resident of Mahatma Enclave, located near the dumping site, said: “We generally keep doors and windows of our houses closed due to foul smell emanating from the dumping site. It is even hard to breathe when the waste is burnt. During rainy days, we are forced to suffer more. Flies and mosquitoes are also common. I have been witnessing huge heaps of waste for a long time but the civic body has done nothing to dispose of the same.”The residents of Kakka village, Baba Naam Dev Colony, Mahatama Enclave, colonies on Tibba Road and other areas had been seeking for a relief but the corporation did nothing to manage the waste.The NGT panel had earlier given directions to the authorities concerned to ensure safe drinking water supply to the residents of the areas in the ambit of 2 km from the dumping site.Ludhiana SAD president and former MLA Ranjit Singh Dhillon said: “A large number of people in nearby colonies and villages are suffering as a huge amount of waste is getting collected in routine at the main dumping site. They are forced to live in hell-like conditions amid threat of catching diseases. When the private firm had left the services, it was the responsibility of the civic body to make timely necessary arrangements to ensure processing of waste.”Under the Smart City mission, a proposed project of installation of legacy waste screening machines and reclamation of land by scientifically processing of the legacy waste is yet to be launched.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/ludhiana-mc-fails-to-ensure-waste-processing-residents-suffer-276131
