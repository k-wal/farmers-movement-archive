Instead of increasing salaries, our pay scale and allowances are being reduced. We also make an appeal to unions of various other government departments to come on a single platform against the commission report.”He said: “The government has cheated employees by denying them their dues in the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission report.

Soil testing is done for optimum use of fertilisers in different crops, reclamation of problematic soils and orchard plantation. For general crops, soil samples should be taken from surface to 6 inch (15 cm) soil depth, from 5-7 locations in a particular field. After proper mixing, the sample is reduced to half kilogram for testing in laboratory. Soil testing is repeated after 2-3 years. While, farm-yard manure should be applied to different crops as per recommendations of the PAU for maintaining soil productivity. Green manuring with leguminous crops such as jantar, sunn hemp, cowpea etc. should be preferred as these crops fit well in different crop rotations. On decomposition of green manure crops, the availability of nutrients and organic matter content in the soil increase which improves soil physical chemical and biological fertility of soil.‘Use chemical fertilisers judiciously’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/experts-share-tips-to-improve-soil-health-yield-274786
