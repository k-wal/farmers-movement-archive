They are vehemently opposing the construction of a multiplex and a parking lot on the school campus.The primary school building situated in U-Block in the heart of Mandi town has been demolished to pave the way for a multiplex building and a parking lot. A basketball field, canteen and a drawing room adjoining the old primary school building have also been demolished. The decision has angered the school alumni, who feel the structure was part of a precious heritage that should have been conserved.“As per the Right to Education Act 2009, all decisions regarding the development plan of a school should be taken by the School Management Committee, which will also monitor the utilisation of grants, but people witnessed the school campus being reduced to debris with a heavy heart,” said Prof Rama Kant Agnihotri, an alumnus of the school. He is the former head of Department of Linguistics, University of Delhi, and is at present Professor Emeritus, Vidya Bhawan Society.“I matriculated from this school in 1960. The middle school classes used to be held in U-Block. The school was established in 1866 by the then King of Mandi, Raja Bijai Sen, today known as Government Vijay School. It should have been given the status of a heritage building. The alumni of the school have served the country at highest positions in different fields,” he added.Similar sentiments were echoed by other alumni, who felt that the government should construct a primary school building and restore the basketball field, canteen, drawing room, stage and the playground to provide the basic amenities to the students. Gaurav Thakur and Vikki, both students, fear that the playground would get squeezed.“After the demolition of the primary school building, basketball field, canteen and the drawing room, the students are in limbo,” said Nisha, president of the School Management Committee.However, the people of Mandi town are divided over the issue. While the supporters of CM Jai Ram Thakur are supporting the decision, his detractors are opposing it. The Municipal Corporation Mandi had also supported the decision of the government saying a parking facility was a long pending demand of the people of Mandi.Senior Congress leader Kaul Singh Thakur, who is an alumnus of the school, said that the construction of a parking lot and a shopping complex on the road leading to the Zonal Hospital would result in traffic chaos.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/students-alumni-oppose-parking-lot-multiplex-on-school-campus-300025

Resentment is brewing among the locals over unabated quarrying of hills with impunity.Government departments like forest and mining have failed to check illegal hill cutting and digging of deep trenches on hills. Local residents apprehend soil erosion and landslide due to reckless excavation of hills with JCB machines. The farmers, who used to leave their animals on the hillside for grazing, say they will lose green pastures if unscientific excavation is not stopped.Inquiries reveal that the owners of private land are using JCB machines to extract soil from these hills and even from the forest area. They sell the soil to private builders in the neighbouring Punjab. Loaded trucks can be seen transporting soil extracted from the hills on the roads connecting Pathankot-Jalandhar road. Locals alleged that offenders sold extracted soil in Punjab for Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 per tractor-trolley.Ashok Kapoor, up-pradhan, Gagwal gram panchayat, said he had raised the issues of illegal mining and reckless cutting of hills in the panchayat in the past. The offenders were playing havoc with the hills and hundreds of tractor-trolleys transported the soil extracted from forest and private areas even during the lockdown by crossing police naka at Bhadroya.He said he had received threats from the mining mafia for objecting to illegal mining and reckless cutting of hills for which he had recently lodged a police complaint.Rajiv Kalia, Kangra District Mining Officer, who has additional charge of Nurpur, said he had directed the field staff to take action against the offenders.

Last year, one in every 14 patients had died at the institute. The death-patient ratio has worsened during the past two years at the PGI, courtesy Covid.On the contrary, AIIMS, New Delhi, saw lesser deaths in 2021 and its death-patient ratio was 1:20.8 till June.Prof Jagat Ram, Director, PGI, said: “The institute has been admitting serious and critical patients of Covid-19 since March last year. The death rate among severe Covid patients was very high. The PGI is the only tertiary care hospital in Punjab, Haryana and HP. Mostly, the PGI is flooded with patients from various quarters through referrals. We cannot send patients to other hospitals, unlike AIIMS, Delhi, which has an option of referring patients to other hospitals such as Safadarjung Hospital. That is why, AIIMS has a better death-patient ratio than the PGI.”Around 7,122 Covid patients have been admitted to the PGI so far, of whom 1,221 belonged to Haryana and 2,864 to Punjab.
