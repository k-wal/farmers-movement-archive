17-08-2021||---||IIT-Mandi devises system to prevent mishaps||Mandi, August 16Students and faculty innovators from the IIT-Mandi have developed a smart road-monitoring system to prevent accidents.Dr Kala Venkata Uday, Assistant Professor, School of Engineering, IIT-Mandi, along with a team of BTech students from the 2016-20 batch have developed a system that can be used for speed detection, better traffic control and road usage, by employing Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.How it worksDr Kala said, “The new system comprises two layers of detection units on each side of a road curve besides two signalling units. When a vehicle passes through two consecutive layers of detection units, the sensing system detects the speed, direction and the type of vehicle. A corresponding signal (light/sound/ barrier) is then displayed on the other side to alert drivers of vehicles heading towards the curve.”“The new system can work in rain, snow, fog or poor visibility conditions. The data can be encrypted and shared with only appropriate stakeholders. At the prototype development stage, the system costs less than Rs 20,000, excluding the alerting units per curve,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/iit-mandi-devises-system-to-prevent-mishaps-298213
