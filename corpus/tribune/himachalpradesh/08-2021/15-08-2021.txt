A few years ago, the then Virbhadra Singh government had posted a Mining Officer at Nurpur to check illegal activities in these subdivisions, but he was shifted to Una district in April. Only one Assistant Mining Inspector, who would retire next year, is watching the four subdivisions. Besides, there are one mining guard at Indora, two at Nurpur, and one each at Fatehpur and Jawali subdivisions to check the illegal activity.The state Industry Department had issued challan books to the designated officers of the Irrigation and Public Health Department, Public Works Department and the Forest Department and authorised them to impose a penalty on the defaulters. The local administration, Revenue Department and the Block Development authorities are also authorised to check illegal mining in their areas.In practice, only the police and the skeletal staff of the Mining Department are randomly checking mining activities and recovering finey from the offenders.Villagers living areas surrounding these rivers have been protesting against rampant illegal mining activities, as underground water resources are depleting, posing a threat to the irrigation and drinking water supply schemes. Their fertile lands have also turned barren. Illegal mining is also damaging bridges. Hoshiar Singh, president, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Kangra, alleges that local and Punjab stone crushers are carrying out mining illegally with banned JCB and Poclain machines in the Chakki rivulet. He demands stringent action against the mining mafia by lodging FIRs and confiscating banned excavators.

He said that the Himachal Government submitted a proposal to the Centre recently.Kapoor said that when this is constructed, the distance between Pathankot and Leh would be 521 km while the distance from Pathankot via Manali was 802 km. Thus, the distance from Pathankot to Leh would reduce by 281 km.In a letter to the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways yesterday, Kapoor said that the road was necessary in view of the aggressive behaviour of China on the country’s borders. “This road will connect the military cantonments of Pathankot with adjoining areas, including the Pathankot cantonment, Yol cantonment and military camps on the Pathankot-Jammu road, and military camps in the Poonch region with Leh and Ladakh, thereby facilitating the movement of soldiers,” he added.“Moreover, there is immense potential for setting up hydroelectric projects and promotion of tourism and pilgrimage in the Pangi tribal area, which can be exploited properly if the means of transport are available,” Kapoor said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/approve-pathankot-leh-road-project-mp-kishan-kapoor-297762
