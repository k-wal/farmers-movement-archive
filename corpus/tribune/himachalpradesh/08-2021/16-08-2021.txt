As a precautionary measure, the local authorities had evacuated people from some houses along the river banks due to the formation of a lake. Some agricultural land had been submerged.“We have found that more than 50 per cent blockage has already got removed naturally by the river. The velocity of flow at the blockage location is in the range of 6 to 7 m/s,” said Rai, CWC director.He said that due to the landslide, a natural bench of about 20 m width and about 45 to 50 m length had been formed which will provide the space to accommodate the material falling due to further landslide. “The concave shape of the sliding plain shall also provide some space to accommodate the further sliding material. Hence, the further complete blockage of the river in case of a landslide at the same location is less likely,” he said.The experts observed that the sliding material is carrying the majority of finer grain composition and any material further coming in the river will get washed away by the running water. “The situation seems to be normal at present; however, the administration needs to be watchful,” they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/experts-visit-landslide-site-that-caused-blockade-on-chanderbhaga-river-in-himachal-297982
