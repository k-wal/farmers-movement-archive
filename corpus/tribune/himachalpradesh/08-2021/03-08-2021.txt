In view of the same, proceedings qua accused Virbhadra Singh stand abated,” the judge said.While in the corruption case lodged by the CBI, the court was scheduled to record the evidence, the money laundering case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) was listed for framing of charge.The cases against other accused persons, including Singh’s wife Pratibha Singh, will continue.The veteran Congress leader and others had claimed innocence and said that instead of pleading guilty they would face trial.In the case filed by the CBI, the court had in February 2019 framed charges of alleged criminal misconduct and amassing disproportionate assets of over Rs 10 crore against Singh, and others, saying he intended to cause loss to the tax authorities by presenting unaccounted money as sale proceeds of apples.Apart from the two offences under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, the court had said that prima facie charges of alleged forgery and attempt to cheat under the IPC were also made out against the former Union minister.The court had also framed charges against Pratibha Singh, and seven others for allegedly abetting in the offences.The other seven accused are LIC agent Anand Chauhan, Chunni Lal Chauhan, Joginder Singh Ghalta, Prem Raj, Vakamulla Chandrasekhar, Lawan Kumar Roach and Ram Prakash Bhatia.The punishment for the offences of criminal misconduct and disproportionate assets under the PC Act range from one to seven years jail term, forgery under IPC entails a maximum of two years imprisonment and the offence of cheating could lead to a maximum sentence of seven years.CBI had registered the case against Singh and others for allegedly amassing assets worth around Rs 10 crore disproportionate to their known source of income when he was the Union Minister in the UPA government.A charge sheet running into over 500 pages, filed in the court, claimed that Singh had amassed assets worth around Rs 10 crore which were disproportionate by 192 per cent of his total income during his tenure as a Union Minister.The final report, filed against nine people for alleged offences punishable under section 109 (abetment) and 465 (punishment for forgery) of the Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act, arrayed around 225 witnesses and 442 documents.The ED had filed a case of money laundering against Singh and others based on the CBI case.The matter was transferred by the Supreme Court from the Himachal Pradesh High Court to the Delhi High Court, which on April 6, 2016, had asked the CBI not to arrest Singh and had directed him to join the probe. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/court-abates-proceedings-against-ex-hp-cm-virbhadra-singh-in-cbi-ed-cases-292369

The Congress leader said he himself and other party MLAs, including Asha Kumari, Sukhvinder Sukhu, Vikramaditya Singh, Sunder Thakur, Nand Lal, Vinay Kumar and Lakhwinder Rana had received similar calls on Monday.Earlier on Monday, Sukhvinder Sukhu raising the matter in the House and said he got a call from Pannun, threatening that no one will be allowed to hoist the national flag in the state on Independence Day.In the pre-recorded phone calls, the caller had said, “Himachal Pradesh was part of Punjab, and we are seeking a referendum in Punjab.

Several roads were also blocked due to landslides.Tonnes of ripe peas, cauliflowers, broccoli, iceberg lettuce and lilium flowers are being destroyed every day as farmers are unable to take them to 'mandis' after roads were damaged due to the cloudburst over the Tojing Nullah, said Bir Bahadur Singh, a farmer and Trilokinath Temple 'Kardar' (main trustee of its management committee).The Udaipur farmers sell their crops in Bandrol, Manali, Bhuntar and Takoli 'mandis' of the state and in different 'mandis' of Punjab, Chandigarh and Delhi either directly or indirectly through farm traders, he said.A woman farmer, Bhim Dasi urged the administration with folded hands to repair the roads so that farmers can take their crops to 'mandis'.Another farmer, Chudu Ram told PTI that farmers will die of starvation in winters if their crops do not reach 'mandis'.If the administration cannot repair the roads immediately, it should at least construct 'kaccha' roads so that trolleys and other vehicles can get to 'mandis', he said.However, state Technical Education Minister and Lahaul-Spiti MLA Ram Lal Markanda dismissed Singh's claims of ripe crops getting destroyed."The temple 'kardar' is a local Congress leader and is levelling baseless allegations of ripe crops getting destroyed," he said.When told that several other farmers, too, have expressed concern over the situation, Markanda said currently, the priority is to rescue stranded people. As many as 372 stranded people have been rescued in the last six days."I am also worried about the farmers of my area as I know that they grow only one crop a year. I am visiting the affected areas of my constituency instead of attending the ongoing monsoon session of the state assembly to redress their grievances," he added.Markanda said six bridges were damaged due to the heavy rains and efforts are being made to restore vehicular traffic movement on them in the next two days.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/unable-to-take-crops-to-mandis-due-to-damaged-roads-farmers-in-lahaul-spiti-a-worried-lot-292341

Data from Kinnaur was not available and in Lahaul & Spiti, schools have been closed till August 9 due to heavy damage by rain.A large section of parents was apprehensive about sending their wards to schools as the Covid graph reflected a rising trend with 134 new cases coming to the fore on Sunday (August 1). Only students, who had doubts and queries about the lessons taught online, visited schools for guidance and clarification.Those who attended school were excited. “We have been attending online classes from home for a very long time. Coming back to school and having physical interactions with teachers and friends is refreshing,” said Neha, a student of Class XI.Principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Syri, Vijay Goswami said, “We got to know about hidden talents of our students during the lockdown period as they shared their knowledge about fields like horticulture and agriculture in online classes.”“Online classes are still underway and the attendance has been kept optional so that there is no compulsion to attend the school in case parents and students have apprehensions due to the pandemic,” said Director, Higher Education, Amarjeet Sharma. He said there are over 3.5 lakh students, including about 2.15 in government schools, studying in Classes X to XII.Precautions like sanitisation of classrooms, thermal scanning, staggering of students while coming and leaving the schools, alternate sitting arrangements and adherence to appropriate Covid behaviour, were taken today, claimed the authorities of various schools. The students were asked not to share books and stationary and avoid physical contact with each other.Private schools had asked students, planning to attend school to clear doubts, to come with parent’s consent in writing and inform the teachers a day before.Only 50 per cent of the students were allowed, so the number of students attending classes in private schools was less than that of government schools.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/43-attendance-registered-as-schools-open-in-himachal-for-classes-x-xii-292148

Its volunteers have collected tonnes of garbage littered by tourists and locals in the river.Over 40 members of the NGO, mostly local youth, are taking part in the campaign. The waste collected by them includes plastic wrappers and empty bottles. Unfortunately, state agencies have turned a blind eye to the large-scale environmental degradation in the Dhauladhar hills.Waste dumping goes on unabatedThese volunteers have no support from the Palampur authorities like the Municipal Corporation, SDM, forest and IPH departments, which are the main custodians of rivers and forests.Due to their apathy, the Neugal — one of the major tributaries of the Beas originating from the Dhauladhars in Kangra — has become polluted. One can see garbage, animal carcasses and industrial effluents floating on the surface of the river.In fact, the Palampur MC is also dumping its waste in the river, as its garbage treatment plants at Aima, Ghuggar and Khalet have been lying defunct for the past six months. The Neugal is considered the lifeline of residents of Palampur.Anish Nag, Deputy Mayor of the Palampur MC, admitted that in the absence of a garbage segregation facility, garbage was being dumped on the riverbed near the Aima plant.Over 100 drinking water supply schemes of Palampur, Dheera and Jaisinghpur subdivisions are dependent on the Neugal. In the past five years, things have gone from bad to worse as tonnes of plastic waste can be seen on the riverbed.Local MLA Ashish Butail, who also visited the riverbed on the request of NGO People’s Voice, assured the people that he would ask the Forest Department to identify spots on the riverbed for the installation of barricades that would restrict the entry of people.The National Green Tribunal has also asked the authorities to take measures to stop dumping of garbage into the river.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/ngo-starts-cleaning-neugal-in-palampur-292162

The incessant rain pouring in the area, however, posed a challenge.As many as 200 to 250 villagers are using this path on a daily basis ever since the highway was closed for traffic. With the opening of the schools today, the utility of this pathway has further increased as it provides a shorter route to reach Sataun, Paonta Sahib, Nahan, etc. Though people from the affected Kamrau belt could use the other arterial routes, these are time consuming.SDM, Paonta Sahib, Vivek Mahajan said, “Labourers have been deputed to broaden the pathway to facilitate the villagers using it. An earth excavation machine was also pressed into service to restore the caved in portion of the highway by preparing the ground but incessant rain was hampering the operations. The slush has made it difficult for the workers to carry on work throughout the day.”The officials of the HPSEBL have also begun the work to shift power lines lying in the precincts of the Kali Dhank where cracks have appeared on the road surface as its base had eroded.Mandeep Singh, Superintending Engineer, Sirmaur, said, “Power supply in the Shillai area has not been disrupted but three power supply lines are being shifted as they fall in the vulnerable zone which could erode further. This could plunge the area into darkness if the lines were not shifted soon.”A 33-KVA substation at Shillai would also be shifted for which a team comprising officials of the HPSEBL, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, which is overseeing the road widening project, as well as the private company executing the work visited the site today.“The final route of the highway after its widening will also have to be taken into account while shifting the poles and power infrastructure or else they will again become vulnerable to damage when widening work begins. The cost incurred on this additional liability was yet to be worked out as the prime focus is to shift the poles,” said the SE, HPSEBL.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/shillai-landslip-restoration-work-of-hill-pathway-from-parcha-to-heuna-underway-292175

Bilaspur is part of the Hamirpur Lok Sabha segment represented by Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.The synthetic track has been rendered useless due to waterlogging in the absence of a proper drainage system. The project was initiated during the Congress regime. The entire work, barring the drainage, was completed in 2019. After the BJP came to power, the remaining work progressed at a snail’s pace.Local athletes said their dream of having a state-of-the-art synthetic track had been shattered despite the fact that Anurag Thakur represented the constituency.Rakesh Kumar of Bilaspur alleged the fencing of the complex was unnecessary brought down by the contractor building the drain. Rashmi, an athlete, said since the work got delayed, the track had sunk at many places due to waterlogging following rains.Sandeep Sankhyan, local Congress leader, said poor quality of the work would only result in wastage of funds. Pardeep Kalia, district sports and youth services officer, said the drainage was being constructed at an additional cost of over Rs 35 lakh. The work would be completed soon and its quality would be ensured, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bilaspur-athletics-track-in-ruins-in-sports-minister-anurag-thakurs-area-292135
