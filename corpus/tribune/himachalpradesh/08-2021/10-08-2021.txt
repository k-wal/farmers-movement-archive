The construction of the road was completed about one and a half years ago.Angel Chauhan, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Kullu, said three dumping sites were provided to the contractor of the NHAI, Gawar Construction Limited company, but these all were found largely vacant during the inspection, which means that the debris had been illegally dumped elsewhere. He said the NHAI had been asked about the disposal but no response was received. He said the total amount of fine compounds to Rs 1,15,60,000 as per the calculations of the area of illegally dumped debris.Three dumping sites were provided to the contractor of the NHAI, Gawar Construction Limited, but these all were found largely vacant during the inspection, which means that the debris had been illegally dumped elsewhere. — Angel Chauhan, Divisional forest officer, KulluThe DFO said even earlier, many notices were sent and fines worth lakhs of rupees had already been realised from the NHAI for damage to forest land. He said due to repeated offences, an undertaking was sought from the NHAI regarding precaution and corrective steps to re-establish the damaged area. He said there had been complete negligence in dumping of debris during the road construction. He added that the NHAI had also not returned the excess land to the Forest Department after completion of the construction.The DFO said similarly, a damage of Rs 1.45 crore had been assessed due to illegal muck dumping by another contractor of the NHAI during the four-laning of the Jia (Bhuntar) to Ramshila stretch of the highway. He said a notice had been given to the NHAI and further action would be taken accordingly.Abhishek Rai, an environmentalist, alleged that the contractors of the NHAI had thrown norms to the wind and had illegally dumped debris at various places, causing irreparable damage to the environment. He alleged that the haphazard dumping by the companies undertaking construction had caused severe damage to forest land and polluted the Beas.

The road stretch between Mandi and Pandoh has become prone to landslides due to deep cutting of hills in the area.The highway has remained blocked due to frequent landslides during this rainy season. The damaged highway has become a death trap for motorcyclists, especially those travelling during night, as they fail to negotiate potholes.Rajender Mohan, a councillor of the Municipal Corporation Mandi, has also raised the issue with the district administration. He has urged the Deputy Commissioner to ask the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to repair and maintain the road to avoid fatal accidents.Tourists facing inconvenienceThere is urgent need to accomplish the construction work of the highway in the stipulated time.

Due to the poor condition of the highway, tourists travelling to Kullu and Manali are being inconvenienced. It takes them long hours to reach Manali, making the journey cumbersome”.Anup Thakur, president of the Hoteliers Association Manali, says, “The state and Central governments should ask the authorities concerned to speed up the construction work on the highway and complete it in a time-bound manner. Due to the delay in the completion of the road project, the tourism industry of Kullu and Manali is suffering”.“Kullu and Manali lack good air connectivity because of the delay in the expansion of the Bhuntar airport.

Kulwant Singh, Block Development Officer (BDO), Baijnath, has urged the Director Rural Development for a detailed inquiry by the State Accounts and Quality Control wing of the department.The BDO told The Tribune that as per the report received from new panchayat secretary Ankush, the then panchayat pradhan and the secretary had withdrawn over Rs 58.16 lakh from the State Bank of India branch at Baijnath between 2016 and 2021 for different development works. However, only Rs 37.98 lakh was utilised and the remaining Rs 17.92 lakh was not accounted for anywhere and no utilisation of the amount was shown in the records. Despite best efforts, Rs 17.92 lakh could not be reconciled.He said that the accounts register and other records for 2019 to 2020 was also missing from the panchayat office. He had informed the higher authorities in this regard, he added.Kulwant Singh said that on the direction of the higher authorities, he had lodged a complaint against the panchayat pradhan and the secretary at Baijnath police station. Besides, a detailed report was also sent to the District Panchayat Officer, Kangra, and the Deputy Commissioner, Kangra, but till date neither the pradhan and the secretary had been directed to deposit the amount in the state exchequer nor they had been penalised.He said that he had inspected most of the development sites of the panchayat and found that in the Tiala to Bag Kuhal work, Rs 1.24 lakh pertaining to the cost of cement, sand, stones, shuttering and concretising work was drawn from the state treasury. However, the panchayat had not executed any such work.Likewise, in another case, the panchayat constructed a village road with material collected with the help of labour under MGNREGA but the then panchayat pradhan submitted fake bills showing that material was purchased from somewhere else and also managed to get the payment from the treasury. In yet another case, an old house was shown as a goat shed in the village and the money was withdrawn from the state treasury.Besides, the panchayat also constructed retaining walls in the village without the approval of the authorities concerned. As per the MGNREGA guidelines, there was no provision for the construction of retaining walls before 2018.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/baijnath-panchayat-embezzles-funds-builds-walls-without-nod-295368

This necessitates the need to exercise added caution while widening this highway.A report submitted by experts on Kali Dhank area in Shillai sub-division, where a 150-m road had caved in on July 30, has suggested taking into account the geo-scientific evaluation of inherent risk and hazard specific to that spot while undertaking widening on steep slopes.The slide was triggered due to slope saturation and abandoned quarry activities in its toe. It was heavy rains that catapulted the slide. The quarry was active till 2019.The GSI report has suggested benching in uphill debris as well as in the rock mass, which should be carried out carefully and scientifically. Given the vulnerability of fragile strata, suggestions like installation of signboards/ banners at appropriately identified vulnerable locations for cautioning the commuters has been put forth. Widespread landslide awareness should be made in vulnerable areas to warn the dwellers.This can help prevent loss of lives as commuters travelling on the route can be warned about the looming danger of landslides which are triggered during the rainy season. Altering the geometry of the steep slope by flattening and benching along with draining out any ingressing nallah or rain water has also been made by the GSI experts.Since the area receives 70 per cent of annual rainfall in the monsoons, the need to exercise added caution has been stressed.Paonta Sahib SDM Vivek Mahajan said, “The staff of the private company widening the highway as well as the officials of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways have been directed to ensure that all measures suggested by the GSI are adhered to. It will be ensured that signage are erected at vulnerable sites to create awareness among the commuters to avert a mishap.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/gsi-experts-suggest-measures-to-stabilise-shillai-nh-slopes-295382

The road bears a huge traffic volume as besides the local traffic, trucks carrying industrial goods, limestone, etc ply on it. Besides, goods vehicles as well as buses coming from Punjab and Haryana and heading towards Uttarakhand also use it on a daily basis.“Overspeeding is a regular feature and several fatal accidents have taken place,” informed Rakesh, a local resident.Spots like Nariwala and Majra-Surajpur are especially vulnerable to accidents. Two-wheeler riders are among the worst sufferers as they, trying to steer clear of the puddles, end up causing accidents. The presence of stray cattle roaming on the highway adds to the danger.With no parking areas available, trucks are often seen lined up on both sides of the road at various industrial hamlets en route this highway.

10-08-2021||Arun Sharma||No vaccine certificate, Himachal turns away Naina Devi pilgrims from Punjab||Tribune News ServiceRopar, August 9A large number of devotees from various parts of Punjab, who were on their way to pay obeisance at Naina Devi temple today, were turned away from the Himachal Pradesh border near here for not having RT-PCR negative report or Covid vaccination certificate.This led to a chaos as the devotees demanded the removal of restrictions. They squatted on the highway and raised slogans against the Himachal government, causing a traffic jam. Following a fresh surge in cases, HP recently re-imposed curbs on the entry of outsiders. Probably unaware of the restrictions, hundreds of devotees reached Kolan Wala Toba, the entry point from Punjab, in the morning. As the hill state’s police refused entry to those not carrying either a negative report or a vaccination certificate, the crowd swelled at the checkpoint. A few devotees said the government should have announced its decision at least a fortnight ago as several people visited the shrine on foot, a journey that had to be started days in advance. Ropar SP Ajinder Singh and Anandpur Sahib DSP Raminder Singh Kahlon coordinated with the civil administration to arrange on-the-spot testing facility to pacify the devotees. Deputy Commissioner Sonali Giri said more such facilities would be set up en route to Naina Devi tomorrow.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/no-vaccine-certificate-himachal-turns-away-naina-devi-pilgrims-from-punjab-295471
