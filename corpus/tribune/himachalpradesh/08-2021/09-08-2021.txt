Most of the tourist vehicles, including luxury buses, go to Manali using this route. The bridge connects Parla Bhuntar and the Parbati valley to Bhuntar. Agriculturists of the Parbati and Garsa valleys are dependent on this bridge for transporting their produce to the marketing yard at Bhuntar.Being narrow, big traffic jams can be witnessed as only one vehicle can pass through it at a time and long queues of vehicles at both ends, especially during peak hours, are witnessed.The concrete bridge was washed away in the 1995 floods and a Bailey bridge was constructed as a stop-gap arrangement, which was damaged beyond repair by a big truck carrying heavy machinery in 2008. After that, another smaller Bailey bridge was erected at the same place.Residents have been demanding a wider bridge for a long time. They rue that their troubles mount during the peak tourist season in the summer when a large number of vehicles make a beeline for this famous hill station.Vehicles carrying fruit and vegetables also use this bridge to transport the produce.Leaders of the area have often talked about getting a new concrete bridge constructed. People say the plan to construct a double-lane bridge was made many years ago but nothing has materialised.The NHAI authorities say the old design has become non-usable due to scarring because of floods and another design has been prepared to construct a 50-m bridge.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/26-years-on-bhuntar-awaits-concrete-bridge-294996

Recent heavy rains triggered the incident.”Sounding a word of caution, the study suggests that the new road alignment must avoid a distress rock mass stretch found at the downstream shoulder of landslide near the road level. A minor slope failure has been recorded at its toe.Though Barwas village, located further uphill area of the affected site, appears to be on stable ground,the uphill mass, including village establishments, must be frequently observed for any ground signatures of slope instability, the report suggests.Vivek Mahajan, Sub Divisional Magistrate, Paonta Sahib, said, “Several measures have been suggested by the GSI team to stabilise the slope, both while restoring the road and undertaking its widening. The company concerned has been directed to adhere to the suggestions.”The GSI team comprised Manoj Kumar, Director, Engineering Geology Division, Pradap Jagan R, Geologist, and Abhinav Poonia, Assistant Geologist.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/mining-to-blame-for-himachal-pradesh-road-cave-in-294938
