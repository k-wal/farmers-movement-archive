The condition of the road has turned from bad to worse as travelling on the national highway is no less than a nightmare.‚ÄúThe condition of the highway is pathetic and will worsen as the road widening project will take at least five years to complete,‚Äù said a senior government official.A part of the highway at Paror, near the railway overbridge, has turned into a virtual death trap. Many fatal accidents have taken place on the spot because of the potholes. Bitumen laid during the summer was washed away by the first monsoon showers. Similar is the condition between Jogindernagar and Padhar.However, the highway authority is not concerned about the situation.Most drains along the highway are choked and water is flowing onto it, causing it damage.Earlier, the national highway wing of the Public Works Department maintained the road. The Central Government used to provide funds, but now there was no such provision. The road widening project has been hanging fire for the past four years because of red tape. The NHAI has acquired land only for the first phase of 40 km, of the total of 208 km. Its foundation stone was laid in 2017.Information gathered by The Tribune reveals that the National Highways Authority of India is giving money only for the road widening to four lanes and there is no focus on its maintenance though it is the lifeline of the people of Mandi and Kangra districts.‚ÄúThe road must be maintained till the project is completed. Otherwise, it will cause a lot of inconvenience to people, besides posing a risk to the lives of travellers. The highway is one of the busiest in the state, which links Pathankot with Leh also and is used by the Army for the transportation of heavy defence equipment and supplies to forward areas in Ladakh,‚Äù says a retired PWD engineer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/commuting-on-pathankot-mandi-highway-a-nightmare-303409

As per information, the case file has been prepared but the state government is yet to submit it to the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for approval.In view of the presence of thousands of trees, which need to be axed for developing industrial plots in the park, the Forest Department has mandated procuring approval under the FCA-1980, which has put a question mark on the future of this ambitious project envisaged to bring industrial revolution and generate employment opportunities for locals.The detailed project report (DPR) proposed by the state Industry Department has also been put on hold. The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, will give the FCA approval in two stages.Inquiries reveal that the state Industry Department has identified 4,000 kanals of government land in the Nurpur Assembly constituency and notified the park on nearly 85 hectares of non-forestland vested under the Village Common Land Utilisation Act. The state government had transferred this land in the name of the Industry Department, paving the way for developing the park on the notified land. But the Forest Department objected to the land transfer due to the entry of ‚ÄòKhudro Drakhtan Malkiat Sarkar‚Äô (KDMS) in the revenue record, which attracts the mandatory provision of the FCA-1980. The KDMS means on any land, whether private or government, the naturally growing trees are owned by the government.Viklap Yadav, Divisional Forest Officer, Nurpur, told The Tribune that there were 14,432 standing trees on the land identified for developing the integrated industrial park at Chakban (Khanni) in Nurpur forest range. ‚ÄúThe approval under the FCA-1980 is a must and the case file has been submitted to the state government that will be forwarded to the Central Government,‚Äù he said.Meanwhile, Rakesh Prajapati, Director, Industry Department, said that the department was in the process of getting land cleared under the FCA-1980. Once clearance was received and the land was free from all encumbrances, the department would invite investors, who were already in touch with the government for setting up industrial units there.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/industrial-park-project-on-hold-for-want-of-fda-clearance-303383

They needed protection and also subsidy to transport their produce.He said that the farmers were agitating against three agriculture laws for the past nine months and if the Central Government does not take them back, the agitation will spread to state capitals and Shimla will also boil like Delhi‚Äù.He invited the farmers of the state to attend the mahapanchayat to be held in Muzaffarnagar on September 5. He said a strategy to pressure the Central Government to take back the laws would be chalked out.He said that the Union Government should announce the minimum support price for all crops, including vegetables and fruits, besides milk.Tikait said, ‚ÄúWe are coordinating with village samitis and NGOs to unite farmers, who are divided on party lines. It is high time that the farmers come together to fight for their rights‚Äù.Meanwhile, the demand and supply decides the price of apples and not any company. Rakesh Tikait is trying to mislead farmers and spoil the environment in the country and Himachal, said BJP state spokesperson Baldev Tomar here today.‚ÄúSmall farmers are being given the utmost priority in the agricultural policies of the country. With this spirit, in the past few years, serious efforts have been made to provide convenience and security to the small farmers,‚Äù Tomar said in a press note issued here.Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, Rs 100,060 crore had been given to farmers so far. Out which, Rs 1 lakh crore was transferred to the bank accounts of the small farmers during the pandemic period.
