He said even BJP’s Maheshwar Singh, who had contested the last Assembly elections, was not approached on the matter. He had opposed the decision. There was chaos in the party and such decisions depicted the lack of experience of the present government.The MLA alleged that Banjar MLA was encouraging regionalism and it seemed that everything was not smooth in the BJP. He said, “We will fight with the government to ensure the protection of the rights of the region.”Even earlier, the PWD project implementation unit was shifted from the Lug valley to Bajaura and the PWD subdivision was shifted from Bhuntar to Bajaura. He alleged that the budget for various schemes under the MLA priority was being diverted to other areas.He said, “We will not let injustice happen in the region and preparations are being done for an agitation and it will be ensured that the government does justice with the region.”Meanwhile, during a press conference, Banjar MLA Surender Shourie said there was some misinformation regarding the CM’s announcement of shifting of the IPH subdivision at Shamshi. A new subdivision would be made at Bajaura for 16 panchayats. People of Shamshi need not come to Bajaura.He said it was decided that every constituency would have their own divisions of the PWD and the IPH and thus the IPH division was shifted to Largi from Shamshi.He added that small sections would result in more development. The IPH authorities had made the proposal and it was discussed with the IPH Minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/kullu-sadar-congress-mla-takes-on-cm-over-shifting-of-iph-subdivision-299213

These were in the form of bridges constructed by hoteliers to provide a passage to their properties.The bridges and retaining walls constructed on the drain had reduced its carrying capacity. During the flash flood on July 12, the water from the drain spilled on to roads. The high-velocity water spilling on streets washed away cars parked on the road.Though the Dharamsala MC has removed the encroachments on the drain, no responsibility has been fixed on the people who raised these illegally and the officials who failed to check the encroachments.Sources said MC officials had issued notice to encroachers for raising illegal structures but no follow-up action was taken. The ‘laid-back’ authorities encouraged others to follow suit and raise encroachments again.Municipal Commissioner Pradeep Thakur said notices had been issued to people who had encroached upon the drain. “We have also removed most encroachments. The responsibility will be fixed,” he said.The sources, however, said due to lack of rules to check encroachments on natural drains and streams, the government might find it hard to penalise encroachers. Most lands on the riverbeds and drains are private properties in revenue papers. The government had not drafted rules to fix the boundaries of natural streams. Many people raised structures on the boundaries of natural steams, claiming that these were their property.The Commissioner, however, said they were now invoking provisions of MC Act which states that all natural drains in the city will be MC drains. Any encroachment would be dealt with strictly, he said.The MC officials also site lack of the staff as a reason for not acting against encroachers on time. Though Dharamsala municipal council was upgraded to the corporation and eight villages were added to its boundary in 2015, no additional staff have been provided to the local body since then.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/encroachments-on-drain-caused-flash-flood-in-dharamsala-299208

The residents living there fear that the debris could flow down into the nallahs and water bodies and cause environmental havoc.Large mounds of debris have been dumped at Kachhi Dhank in a bid to widen the road. Being a sliding zone the hill has been eroding during every monsoon. The road gets inundated each time it rains and the absence of protective measures along the muck dumping site could cause an environmental disaster. This site is especially vulnerable as it lies in the catchment area of Giri river.As per the project report, the dumping areas can be used for purposes like parking lots and setting up wayside amenities after proper compaction and slope protection work. The report warns that traffic vibrations also lead to landslides and other stability issues. This necessitates the need to take immediate protective measures at the dumping sites.Excavation is underway on this road and barely 2 per cent of the work has been completed till now.Taking a strict note of the unscientific muck dumping on the Paonta Sahib-Shillai section of NH-707, Deputy Commissioner, Sirmaur, RK Gautam said, “No unscientific dumping would be permitted in the nallahs and wherever such dumping has been done without taking into consideration protective measure, prompt action would be taken.”Reckless muck dumping had also damaged three traditional water mills at Haivena village where locals had been granted petty compensation.Culverts have also been damaged owing to unscientific muck disposal at Sataun village where the natural flow of water had been diverted towards the arable fields. An artificial lake had been created aggravating the woes of the locals.In Khajiaar village, potable water source had been damage which had also hit availability of water.Divisional Forest Officer, Kunal Angrish, said, “Private company four-laning the NH-707 has been directed to put in place jute or wire mesh as restoration measures at places where the excavated hill is prone to excessive erosion or where trees have been uprooted at the dumping sites.”Project Director, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Vivek Panchal, when quizzed, said, “The Kacchi Dhank is a land preservation site where muck has been dumped. Requisite measures would be taken while widening this road in the due course of the time to ensure that there were no environmental issues due to muck dumping.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/unscientific-dumping-along-giri-river-poses-risk-299201
