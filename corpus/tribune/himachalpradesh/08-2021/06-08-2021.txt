Faults allow relative movement between the blocks which may occur rapidly, in the form of an earthquake, or slowly over a period of time. The length of a fault may vary from just a few meters to several thousand kilometers.Faults can have a large influence on the mechanical behaviour, such as strength and deformation, of soil and rock masses and their assessment is critical seismic zoning and for planning construction of buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, pipelines and railroads.The project, tittled “Active fault, paleoseismic and crustal deformation in north-western and Central Himalayas: An integrated approach towards seismic hazard assessment”, was funded by the Ministry of Earth Sciences at a cost of Rs 5.54 crore. It is expected to be complete by September 2021, according to a statement made by the Ministry in the Lok Sabha today.As per the objective of the project, active faults were identified and mapped using satellite data and ground-truthing was carried out in areas like Central Kumaon Himalayas, Chandigarh-Pinjore, Ropar-Hajipur-Pathankot and Kangra.Studies and identificatiuon of faults and rock deformation in areas covering the Dehradun foothills and Central Himalayas from east of Kaladungi till west of Nepal is still under progress, according to the ministry’s statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/study-validates-five-active-seismic-fault-lines-in-north-west-india-293957

Moreover, there was no petrol station in the vicinity if one operated on the link roads. The nearest one at Shillai too is more than 20 km away,” informed Akhil Sharma, general secretary, Sirmaur Bus Operators Union, who operates a fleet of buses.“Diesel is not sold in cans and it is not even convenient to fetch as much as 100 litres diesel for operating a bus on an everyday basis in cans from a distant place,” said Sharma.Operations of as many as 36 buses comprising private operators and Himachal Roadways Transport Corporation (HRTC) have been hit due to closure of the Paonta Sahib-Shillai National Highway-707 since last Friday.Hapless residents have no option but trudge a three-km hilly route to reach the other side of the highway from Parcha to Heuna in Shillai to meet their exigencies.A request had been made to the Director Transport at Shimla by the Regional Transport Authority to permit buses to take a diversion from Sataun through a 9.5-km stretch though link roads as well as through a 40 to 50-km stretch through Vikas Nagar in Uttarakhand for buses plying on the Paonta Sahib-Shillai routes last Saturday.“Approval for the new routes will be received soon from the Director Transport. Delay has been caused as the official was on leave,” RTA Sona Chauhan said.With the team of Geological Survey of India giving its nod to restore the road at the original alignment, the transporters were hoping for an early restoration of the road.Akhil Sharma added that the private bus operators were barely able to operate one or two routes from Paonta Sahib to Heuna in view of the high operational cost. The prevailing pandemic has already broken the backbone of the transporters who were unable to pay bank installments of loans and other state taxes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/shillai-cave-in-operators-await-nod-to-ply-buses-on-alternative-roads-293597

However, today it has no teachers’ representative when the number of government and private colleges has swelled to 138 and over 100, respectively.“In view of the phenomenal expansion of institutions of higher education in the state, there should be at least one representative each of government and private colleges for their better coordination and smooth functioning,” says RL Sharma, general secretary, Himachal Pradesh Government College Teachers’ Association (HGCTA).He says, “Due to the lack of coordination between the colleges and the university, there is a huge communication gap and the issues of the teachers are either not addressed or the university takes unilateral decisions, which are not in the interest of teachers”.He adds, “The HPU is demanding the restoration of financial autonomy but it is indifferent towards the genuine demand of the college teachers for representation in the Executive Council. The colleges affiliated to the HPU and the teachers are the main stakeholders in higher education but they have no say in decision making”.He says that the university is discriminating between university and college teachers and its alleged biased attitude is harming the academic growth of teachers, thus affecting the overall educational scenario.The association has made a number of representations to the Governor, Vice-Chancellor and the state government for the inclusion of one representative each of the teachers of government and private colleges, but to no avail.“It is in the interest of the university and the colleges to have representatives of the latter in the Executive Council for better coordination and expeditious resolution of their problems,” says Sharma.The HGTA says, “The university is apprehensive that teachers’ representation will check and expose the unilateral decisions taken by the Executive Council regarding the colleges without taking them into confidence”.HPU Vice-Chancellor Sikendar Kumar says that the university has not received the seniority list of the college teachers since 2006 and even the list of the principals of private universities is not available. “We have sent several reminders to the state government for providing the list and it is still awaited,” he adds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/no-college-representative-in-hpu-council-293600

It was contended in the application that the monsoon season was at its peak and there was possibility of uprooting of dangerous trees, which might cause a threat to life and property.The court had passed the orders on a petition treated as the PIL, highlighting the issue of illegal felling of green trees within the jurisdiction of the MC, Shimla, in violation of the statutory provisions. The petitioner had prayed to quash and set aside the permissions granted for felling of trees and to restrain the authorities from furthering the process of illegal felling of green trees and granting permission in future without the leave of the court, in the garb of dangerous trees, or widening of the existing roads. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-hc-vacates-stay-on-tree-felling-permissions-293607

Information collected by The Tribune reveals that the government has contributed just Rs 47 crore to the Smart City project while the Central Government had provided Rs 245 crore.As per the agreement for the project, the state and Central governments have to provide equal funds for the project. Sources said that the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Development had been asking the state government to contribute its share of funds to the project before the Centre releases more money, which now about Rs 200 crore.The sources said that the project had got Rs 292 crore (Rs 245 crore contributed by the Union Government and Rs 47 crore by the state government). Till July 31, Rs 241 crore had been spent under the project and around Rs 51.82 crore was left with the project authorities. Till the state or Union government provides more funds, development under the project may come to a halt, they added.The government had earlier pleaded with the Union Government that being a special category state, Himachal should be allowed to contribute just 10 per cent to the project and the Union Government should provide 90 per cent funds. However, the Union Government turned down the plea on the ground that other states that had been sanctioned Smart City projects may also make a similar demand if Himachal was given the benefit of the special category state.The sources said that already stressed for funds due to Covid, the state government may not contribute more towards the project.Pradeep Thakur, Commissioner of the Dharamsala Municipal Corporation and Managing Director of the Smart City project, admitted that a matching contribution by the state government to the project was still awaited. He, however, added that after sending the utilisation certificate of the funds provided by the Union Government they were proposing more projects for approval. “We hope that the Central Government will provide more funds for the Smart City project,” he said.Some of the works that have already been executed in Dharamsala under the Smart City project include the GIS Web Portal, website, e-Nagarpalika, underground dustbins, inclusive streets, smart classrooms, solar power plant, root zone treatment, all ability park, DC complex parking, Bhagsunag project area development and LED lights in streets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/no-matching-funds-from-govt-to-dharamsala-smart-city-project-293598

We would like to know the compelling circumstances which are forcing you to do so, when the assembly is in session,” said Agnihotri.There were heated exchanges between the treasury and opposition benches over the issue. Congress legislators resorted to sloganeering and accused the government of meting out injustice to a Himachali officer. “There were reports of heated exchanges between a minister and the Chief Secretary and now he has been removed, while the session is on. So you must explain the reason for his removal,” retorted Agnihotri.The Chief Minister retaliated to opposition attack by stating that it is an administrative issue which cannot be discussed in the house.“We do not humiliate officers and supersede them like you did in the appointment of Chief Secretary when you were in power. We have discussed the issue and he is being given a more important constitutional post, which is at par with a High Court Judge,” said Thakur. He said don’t make an officer a politician, let him remain an officer.The CM also took strong exception to Congress adopting a parochial view by discriminating between an outside and Himachali officer, which, he said, was unfortunate. “At least we did not supersede seven officers to appoint a Chief Secretary of our choice, like you did. We have always respected seniority,” he said. He added that it is solely the prerogative of the government to appoint an officer against any post.Speaker Vipin Parmar said it was not an issue which fell within the purview of the Vidhan Sabha. He advised the opposition to leave the decision of appointment of the Chief Secretary with the government.

The Modi government has disturbed the country’s economy and democratic system.”He said the people were fed up with the policies of the BJP and claimed that the Congress would win all four byelections in the state and form its government after getting a landslide victory in the Assembly elections next year. Invoking six-term Chief Minister and former MLA Virbhadra Singh, Dutt said he had played a significant role in the development of Himachal and as a true tribute to him, the party should win the seat.He made it clear that the party high command would have a final say in deciding the candidate for the assembly segment.

Rattan Pal, chairman, State Cooperative Development Federation, who had unsuccessfully contested the last poll against the Congress stalwart Virbahdra Singh, is considered the party’s obvious choice.His candidature is being challenged by two-term former MLA Govind Ram Sharma who has openly declared his willingness to contest the poll. He said, “I am sure that the party will consider my candidature. I was denied a ticket last time despite being a sitting MLA and I followed the party’s decision and worked for the party’s victory.” The demand to give him the party ticket has also been raised by the Arki Kalyan Manch.A section in the party is annoyed with Rattan Pal who they say had been given the ticket without having any electoral experience. He has failed to emerge as a leader who could take others along, they said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/arki-bypoll-two-time-mla-govind-ram-sharma-keen-to-fight-bjp-in-a-fix-293594
