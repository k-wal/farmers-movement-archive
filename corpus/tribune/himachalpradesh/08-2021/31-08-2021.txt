He had also approached the Himachal High Court when even after the court order no action was taken against the mining mafia. Even illegal roads constructed by the mafia were not dismantled.“Mining starts barely 500 meter down and upstream of the Beas on the Jalandhar- Hamirpur national highway. It witnessed an exponential rise with a boom in real estate in Punjab and Una district. Despite various complaints by villagers pertaining to damage to their crops because of illegal mining, mafia having strong links with politicians has each time overcome hurdles,” said Jagvir Singh, when The Tribune team called on him.Jagvir Singh, a bachelor, has devoted his entire life to the protection of the environment in the Rakkar area. He lives in a temple on the bed of Beas and has been fighting the mafia tirelessly for the past 14 years as illegal mining has caused large-scale environmental degradation. He said most of the mining is going on in the wildlife sanctuary, forest land, and “gar mum kin khud”.However, in the present political scenario, Jagvir finds himself helpless before the mafia which has links with local leaders. He said as per orders of the Himachal Pradesh High Court, no permission was given for mining and boring well in the Beas in the 500-metre radius of Kaleshwar Mahadev Temple. However, mining mafia is flouting the ban openly under the noose of local authorities.Ban order being overlooked||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/lone-battle-against-illegal-mining-in-beas-continues-304313

They arrived at a consensus on 10 demands, including effective implementation of the Market Intervention Scheme to ensure remunerative prices to apple growers, recovery of farmers’ dues from commission agents and the withdrawal of the hike in the prices of material used for packaging flowers, fruits and vegetables.Also read:Offered ‘low rates’ by Adani, apple growers in Himachal turn to APMCsHimachal apple trader protests road blockade The manch demanded the grading of apples in A, B and C categories and the fixing of a minimum support price of Rs 66, Rs 44 and Rs 24 per kg, respectively, for these.The manch leaders accused the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) of not performing their duties in a proper manner, causing losses to apple growers. They also criticised the Urban Development Minister for his comment that the market prices were determined by demand and supply.The other demands included the purchase of agricultural produce in the market by weight, payment of dues to farmers for apples purchased by the HPMC and HIMFED, restoration of subsidy on fertilisers, seeds, insecticides, fungicide and other inputs and the grant of subsidy on agricultural implements, spare parts and tillers and the release of subsidy on anti-hail nets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/kisan-manch-threatens-to-hold-protest-on-september-26-304315

As per the present arrangement, there are two parameters for water charges in the MC area. A sum of Rs 24 is charged per 1,000 litres in a majority of the wards while residents of the newly merged areas as well as certain wards like ward number 1, have to pay Rs 13 per 1,000 litres.As per the resolution passed by the councillors, the residents have been granted a month’s period to regularize their domestic connections. Those failing to do so would be imposed Rs 20,000 as penalty. New charges will only be imposed on metered connections from October 1.The BJP councillors had, however, boycotted the house when this resolution was passed on Friday during a special session.Water distribution is looked after by the MC staff while it’s supply has been entrusted with the Jal Shakti Vibhag (JSV) which is paid Rs 4 crore annually. With limited sources of revenue the MC has failed to pay these charges regularly and a lability of Rs 78 crore was already due towards the Jal Shakti Vibhag.Fearing loss of revenue, the MC officials were skeptical about its implementation. MC Commissioner LR Verma said, “With a liability of Rs 78 crore due against the JSV, reducing the water bills will further hit revenue.”He noted that, “The resolution passed by the house will be sent to the state government for further action. We are evaluating its financial implication and in case the revenue remains on par, it could get a go-ahead though people were reluctant to come forward and regularise illegal water connections.”With habitual defaulters taking away a sizeable chunk of the Rs 4 crore annual revenue, the MC authorities were unable to clear the pending liability. It faces a monthly expenditure of Rs 26 lakh and after expansion of its limits in April this sum was slated to rise further.The Congress had promised free drinking water to the residents in its manifesto released before the MC polls held in April. They were already drawing flak from the residents for failing to make garbage collection free as promised by them.One-month time to regularise connections||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/solan-mc-slashes-water-charges-under-new-policy-304316

The rumals are usually square or rectangle pieces of cloth, beautifully embroidered, and used to cover gifts and offerings. Traditionally, the rumals were exchanged between the families of the bride and the groom.‘Raas mandal’ and the ‘Krishna motif’ are very popular motifs and have a huge demand. The cloth used is usually unbleached muslin (very thin cloth). The embroidery form was a double satin stitch locally called do-rookha, the beauty of which lay in it being reversible, which makes it equally beautiful on both sides.“I started Chamba embroidery right after my marriage in an artist family in 2006 where my mother-in-law Lalita Vakil was already a national awardee in Chamba rumal embroidery in 1993 and my father-in-law was a passout from JJ School of Arts, Mumbai,” says Vakil.“I immediately fell in love with this craft and was inspired by the work of my mother-in-law,” she says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/anjali-vakil-bags-national-award-for-chamba-rumal-embroidery-304320

Even as a large number of trees have dried up, the state government has not taken steps to find out the reason.Palampur Divisional Forest Officer'State govt is not responsible'The land on which Chander Shekhar Vatika was developed does not belong to the Forest Department or the state government. Therefore, the department is not responsible for maintaining the deodars. The Central government, which owns the land, should have preserved the plants.There was a time when Palampur boasted of a dense deodar cover.The Forest Department says global warming and rising temperatures have adversely affected the growth of deodar trees, not just in Palampur but also in other towns of the state such as Dharamsala, Dalhousie and Kasauli.It is unfortunate that no efforts have been made to plant new deodar trees in the town over the past 10 years. Besides, there has been no post-plantation care. It is on record that Chander Shekhar Vatika developed near the SDM residence by the state government in 1992, where then late Prime Minister Chander Shekhar had planted deodar trees, is in a state of neglect and has been virtually abandoned by the Forest Department. Today, no tree exists in the area. If serious efforts are not made, the town will soon lose its green cover.Various voluntary organisations and environmentalists have lodged a strong protest with the state government over the felling of deodars in the town.The Palampur divisional forest officer says the land on which Chander Shekhar Vatika was developed does not belong to the Forest Department or the state government. “Therefore, the department is not responsible for maintaining the deodars planted here. The central government, which owns the land, should have preserved the plants,” he says.One deodar takes 70 years to grow fully. Palampur and Mussoorie are the only hill stations in the country where deodar trees are grown within the heights of 3,000 feet to 4,000 feet from the mean sea level.Picture of neglectChander Shekhar Vatika, developed near the SDM residence by the state government in 1992, is in a state of neglect and has been virtually abandoned by the Forest Department.

Farmers and vegetable growers, who earn their livelihood by cultivating cash vegetable crops such as cucumber, bottle gourd, okra, snake gourd and bitter gourd during the summer, are a harried lot as they are not even able to recover the input cost of their yield this year.Farmers are forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices at the wholesale sabzi mandis at Jassur and their efforts to sell their produce at the Pathankot mandi to recover transport expenses has also not borne fruit.Farmers lament that due to a bumper vegetable crop this season, their produce is fetching nearly half the price of last year. Inquiries made by The Tribune reveal that following the persistent demands of the fruit and vegetable growers, the state government had explored the possibility of establishing a processing unit in the area in 2019.The state Horticulture Department had submitted a feasibility report recommending setting up of a processing unit for vegetables and fruits at Nurpur but so far, the government has taken no initiative in this direction.Suresh Singh Pathania, Kangra district president of Bharatiya Kisan Union, has urged the government to announce a minimum support price (MSP) for all vegetables and fruits being grown in the district so that the growers do not have to sell their produce at throwaway prices in the wholesale markets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/nurpur-indora-farmers-sell-veggies-at-throwaway-rates-304328

He might have had some compulsions, which forced him to part ways with the BJP. The Chief Minister said that “Anil Sharma cannot blame me at least, God knows, because I gave him the opportunity to work collectively for the progress of Mandi. He might have had some compulsions, which forced him to part ways with the BJP. However, but he is still our MLA because the BJP did not expel him from the party.”“When the BJP top brass had decided to give ticket to Anil Sharma to contest the Assembly elections from Sadar assembly segment in Mandi I was asked to join Anil’s nomination in Mandi town. At that time I was on a visit to a remote area of my Assembly segment in Seraj. I walked for hours to reach the roadside and finally reached Mandi on the day of nomination filing of Anil. We worked relentlessly for Anil and he finally won with a good margin of votes,” he remarked.The Chief Minister said, “I want to forget all these things and we all should work collectively to keep Mandi’s pride high. Himachal has got its first Chief Minister from Mandi district. I asked Anil to forget all and work collectively for the progress of Mandi.”Despite differences with Anil Sharma, the Chief Minister said he agreed to a majority demands of Anil Sharma for the progress of Kotli in the Sadar Assembly segment of Mandi.Jal Shakti Minister Mahender Singh Thakur also targeted Anil by saying that “you had remained a minister and an MLA in the state during the BJP and Congress regimes from 1993 to 2021 but you failed to ensure progress of Sadar Assembly segment.”“Residents of Mandi district had lost an opportunity to have a Chief Minister from Mandi from 1962 till 2017 because of infighting. In 1962, when Karam Singh from Seraj was close to getting the post of CM, then Congress leader Pt Sukh Ram betrayed him. In 1993, when Congress leader Pandit Sukh Ram was close to Chief Minister’s post, then Congress leader from Mandi Kaul Singh Thakur, Rangila Ram Rao and Sher Singh obstructed his way,” he said.Congress leader and former Telecom Minister Sukh Ram is Anil’s father.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/jai-ram-thakur-i-gave-anil-sharma-opportunity-to-work-for-mandi-304329

The Mandi seat fell vacant following the demise of BJP MP Ram Swaroop Sharma.The committee has pointed out that around 3,000 bighas have been given to set up one of the country’s large power projects but the promises made to the affected families are yet to be fulfilled. “The people of the area gave whole-hearted support to Ram Swaroop Sharma and he won by a record margin but the promises he made to fulfil our demands are yet to be honoured,” said Bhagat Ram Bharti, president of the committee.“It is very unfortunate that the State Level Relief and Rehabilitation Advisory Committee has not met even once since 2017 to look into our demands,” he lamented. He added that despite directions issued for convening the meeting in 2019 and later in June 2019 the meeting had not been organised till date.They pointed out that their demands had figured in the BJP election manifesto but after the party formed the government in the state, it completely forgot the issue.The main demands of the people include giving one per cent royalty of the total power generated as is being done in the Rampur hydel project. Other major demands are jobs for the uprooted families and giving land ownership to those rendered landless. A total of 2,803 bighas have been acquired for the 1,500 MW project, affecting 480 families, and the houses of 362 persons have come under the acquired land.The recent disasters at Badseri and Nigulsari in Kinanur, where more than 24 people died, have brought about an awakening among the people who are opposing tooth and nail any new power project in their area. They strongly feel that the natural disasters are a warning against the destabilisation of the hills by setting up more power projects.Promises not fulfilled||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/power-project-oustees-threaten-bypoll-boycott-in-himachal-304330
