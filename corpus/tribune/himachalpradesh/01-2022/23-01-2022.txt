But these will be no ordinary Games. The severe oppression, including of freedom of expression, which the Chinese government inflicts on Tibetans and others under its rule demands equal attention,” said the letter by the International Campaign for Tibet.The Winter Games are scheduled to open on February 4. “As you are well aware, the Chinese government is one of the most brutal human rights abusers the world has seen in decades. Since falsely promising to improve its human rights record ahead of the last Beijing Olympics in 2008, China has cracked down viciously on Tibet, which Freedom House now ranks as the world’s least-free country alongside Syria.“In 2020, the US government also designated China’s persecution of the Uyghurs as genocide. The US and other governments have imposed a diplomatic boycott of the Olympics in response to Beijing not abiding by international norms. Knowing this, the International Olympics Committee should have had the moral fiber to demand the Chinese government adhere to internationally upheld standards of freedom and human rights to deserve the Games.“That has not taken place. Now, as the designated broadcaster of the Games, the NBC, too, has an ethical responsibility as a defender of freedom, particularly that of expression, and must go beyond business as usual”. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/us-broadcaster-urged-to-expose-chinas-oppression-in-tibet-363643

Vikas Matlotia, Kangra president of health mission contractual employees associationVikas Matlotia, Kangra district president of the State Health Mission Contractual Employees Association, said here yesterday that the state executive committee at its meeting on Thursday had decided to hold a protest on February 2 across the state against the indifferent attitude of successive state governments in granting regular pay scales to the contractual employees even after 23 years of service in the Health Department.He said that as many as 1,700 contractual employees had been serving in the Health Department in different centrally-sponsored programmes but they had no future as successive governments failed to formulate a policy to regularise their services.He lamented that in 2016, the previous Virbhadra Singh government had issued a notification to regularise these employees after eight years of service but the notification had been implemented only in two medical colleges— IGMC, Shimla, and Tanda Medical College, Kangra—depriving hundreds of employees working in the field of service benefits.Matlotia said that the issue of NHM contractual employees was also raised in the meeting of the Joint Coordination Committee but the government had taken no initiative in this direction. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/national-health-mission-staff-plan-mass-strike-on-february-2-for-regular-jobs-363641

Most of these structures are to be demolished for the widening of the highway to four lanes.Sources said that the committees were formed after the owners of many buildings had objected to the awards decided by the NHAI. The owners of the buildings alleged that they were getting low compensation for their houses and commercial buildings that had been acquired for the highway widening project.The NHAI has given the awards for the land acquired for the project in Nurpur subdivision. However, the awards for the structures were still being calculated due to objections raised by the owners. Many building owners alleged that if the issue of compensations was not settled with people whose land and structures had been acquired for highway widening, it could boomerang on the BJP in the forthcoming Assembly elections.The Deputy Commissioner said that many people were not satisfied with the compensation calculated for their structures by the NHAI. Now, committees comprising SDMs, officials of the state PWD and the NHAI had been formed. The compensation would be calculated as per the Central PWD rates for the construction of buildings. The officials had been directed to keep the interests of the people in mind while calculating the compensation.Jindal said that the committees had also been directed to settle compensation disputes by the first week of February so that the work to widen the highway could be expedited.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/panels-formed-to-finalise-awards-for-acquired-buildings-on-pathankot-mandi-highway-363637

This is the fourth phase of the National Highway Development Project on the Kalka-Shimla highway being executed by the NHAI. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 1,491.35 crore and the work will be executed on the hybrid annuity mode. Three years will be given to complete the work once the tender is allotted.Project Director Suresh Sharma says that the pre-tendering response has been lackluster as no construction company has shown interest. However, he hoped that once the tender is floated, bidders will come forward.Having learnt a lesson while widening the Parwanoo-Solan section, the NHAI officials have also included works like slope protection for which Rs 250 crore has been set aside. “Spending money on slope protection during the construction stage means lesser funds will be spent on its maintenance. Since crores of rupees have been added to the original budget while widening the 39-km Parwanoo-Solan section as well as the 22.91-km Solan-Kaithlighat section of the National Highway No. 5, it has been decided to add this component along with other costs,” says Sharma.The NHAI had terminated the contract of Chetak Enterprises, which was entrusted the task of widening the 27.45-km Kaithlighat-Dhalli section following tardy progress.As against 30 per cent work, barely 2 per cent work was executed till January 2020 and the company failed to honour the agreement. The work was assigned to the company in April 2018.“The Kaithlighat-Dhalli stretch has now been divided into two parts. The first package comprises a 17.465-km stretch from Kaithlighat to Shakral and the remaining 10 km from Shakral to Dhalli comprises the second package. Tenders will be floated before March,” says Sharma.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/few-takers-for-widening-work-on-kaithlighat-section-363636

While studying in Class VIII in 1930, he attended a Congress rally at Nadaun and was arrested while reciting a poem against the British and jailed in Dharamsala in Kangra district during the trial. He was sentenced to one-year imprisonment and he spent time in the jails of Gurdaspur, Ferozepur and finally in Lahore. He was in the Lahore jail when Bhagat Singh was hanged in March 1931.His grandson Atul Kahrota says that Lala Bhagat Ram used to narrate his experiences with British officers. He used to say that it was a frightful night at the Bostol jail when Bhagat Singh, Raj Guru and Sukhdev were hanged to death. Everyone was conscious about the movement of jail guards.During his active participation in the freedom movement, he kept motivating people against the British in Kangra district along with Comrade Paras Ram, Gopal Dass, Ami Chand, Saligram, Pandit Bhagat Ram, Lala Hemraj sood, Sarla Sharma, Thakur Hazara Singh, and Lala Nagaia Mal.Lala Bhagat Ram also participated in the Quit India Movement in 1942.

He remained the president of the District Congress Committee and a delegate of the Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee.Kranti Kumar, son of Lala Bhagat Ram, says various governments vowed to build a memorial to the freedom fighters, but nothing was done. There was a proposal to rename the local school after Lala Bhagat Ram, but to no avail. Announcements were also made to provide at least one government job to the kin of freedom fighters, but it had remained only on paper.Lala Bhagat Ram is survived by four sons — Kranti Kumar, Karam Chand Katna, Madan Lal and Desh Raj — and three daughters Vidhya Devi, Rajan Devi and Bimla Devi.Unfulfilled promises||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bhagat-ram-was-in-lahore-jail-when-bhagat-singh-was-hanged-363622

But these will be no ordinary Games. The severe oppression, including of freedom of expression, which the Chinese government inflicts on Tibetans and others under its rule demands equal attention,” said the letter by the International Campaign for Tibet.The Winter Games are scheduled to open on February 4. “As you are well aware, the Chinese government is one of the most brutal human rights abusers the world has seen in decades. Since falsely promising to improve its human rights record ahead of the last Beijing Olympics in 2008, China has cracked down viciously on Tibet, which Freedom House now ranks as the world’s least-free country alongside Syria.“In 2020, the US government also designated China’s persecution of the Uyghurs as genocide. The US and other governments have imposed a diplomatic boycott of the Olympics in response to Beijing not abiding by international norms. Knowing this, the International Olympics Committee should have had the moral fiber to demand the Chinese government adhere to internationally upheld standards of freedom and human rights to deserve the Games.“That has not taken place. Now, as the designated broadcaster of the Games, the NBC, too, has an ethical responsibility as a defender of freedom, particularly that of expression, and must go beyond business as usual”. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/us-broadcaster-urged-to-expose-chinas-oppression-in-tibet-363643

Vikas Matlotia, Kangra president of health mission contractual employees associationVikas Matlotia, Kangra district president of the State Health Mission Contractual Employees Association, said here yesterday that the state executive committee at its meeting on Thursday had decided to hold a protest on February 2 across the state against the indifferent attitude of successive state governments in granting regular pay scales to the contractual employees even after 23 years of service in the Health Department.He said that as many as 1,700 contractual employees had been serving in the Health Department in different centrally-sponsored programmes but they had no future as successive governments failed to formulate a policy to regularise their services.He lamented that in 2016, the previous Virbhadra Singh government had issued a notification to regularise these employees after eight years of service but the notification had been implemented only in two medical colleges— IGMC, Shimla, and Tanda Medical College, Kangra—depriving hundreds of employees working in the field of service benefits.Matlotia said that the issue of NHM contractual employees was also raised in the meeting of the Joint Coordination Committee but the government had taken no initiative in this direction. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/national-health-mission-staff-plan-mass-strike-on-february-2-for-regular-jobs-363641

Most of these structures are to be demolished for the widening of the highway to four lanes.Sources said that the committees were formed after the owners of many buildings had objected to the awards decided by the NHAI. The owners of the buildings alleged that they were getting low compensation for their houses and commercial buildings that had been acquired for the highway widening project.The NHAI has given the awards for the land acquired for the project in Nurpur subdivision. However, the awards for the structures were still being calculated due to objections raised by the owners. Many building owners alleged that if the issue of compensations was not settled with people whose land and structures had been acquired for highway widening, it could boomerang on the BJP in the forthcoming Assembly elections.The Deputy Commissioner said that many people were not satisfied with the compensation calculated for their structures by the NHAI. Now, committees comprising SDMs, officials of the state PWD and the NHAI had been formed. The compensation would be calculated as per the Central PWD rates for the construction of buildings. The officials had been directed to keep the interests of the people in mind while calculating the compensation.Jindal said that the committees had also been directed to settle compensation disputes by the first week of February so that the work to widen the highway could be expedited.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/panels-formed-to-finalise-awards-for-acquired-buildings-on-pathankot-mandi-highway-363637
23-01-2022||Ambika Sharma||Few takers for widening work on Kaithlighat section||Solan, January 22No construction company has participated in the pre-bidding tender issued by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for the widening of the 17.465 km Kaithlighat-Shakral section of the National Highway No. 5.NHAI officials attribute the lack of interest to Covid spread as other works have also suffered in the past two years. This is the fourth phase of the National Highway Development Project on the Kalka-Shimla highway being executed by the NHAI. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 1,491.35 crore and the work will be executed on the hybrid annuity mode. Three years will be given to complete the work once the tender is allotted.Project Director Suresh Sharma says that the pre-tendering response has been lackluster as no construction company has shown interest. However, he hoped that once the tender is floated, bidders will come forward.Having learnt a lesson while widening the Parwanoo-Solan section, the NHAI officials have also included works like slope protection for which Rs 250 crore has been set aside. “Spending money on slope protection during the construction stage means lesser funds will be spent on its maintenance. Since crores of rupees have been added to the original budget while widening the 39-km Parwanoo-Solan section as well as the 22.91-km Solan-Kaithlighat section of the National Highway No. 5, it has been decided to add this component along with other costs,” says Sharma.The NHAI had terminated the contract of Chetak Enterprises, which was entrusted the task of widening the 27.45-km Kaithlighat-Dhalli section following tardy progress.As against 30 per cent work, barely 2 per cent work was executed till January 2020 and the company failed to honour the agreement. The work was assigned to the company in April 2018.“The Kaithlighat-Dhalli stretch has now been divided into two parts. The first package comprises a 17.465-km stretch from Kaithlighat to Shakral and the remaining 10 km from Shakral to Dhalli comprises the second package. Tenders will be floated before March,” says Sharma.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/few-takers-for-widening-work-on-kaithlighat-section-363636

While studying in Class VIII in 1930, he attended a Congress rally at Nadaun and was arrested while reciting a poem against the British and jailed in Dharamsala in Kangra district during the trial. He was sentenced to one-year imprisonment and he spent time in the jails of Gurdaspur, Ferozepur and finally in Lahore. He was in the Lahore jail when Bhagat Singh was hanged in March 1931.His grandson Atul Kahrota says that Lala Bhagat Ram used to narrate his experiences with British officers. He used to say that it was a frightful night at the Bostol jail when Bhagat Singh, Raj Guru and Sukhdev were hanged to death. Everyone was conscious about the movement of jail guards.During his active participation in the freedom movement, he kept motivating people against the British in Kangra district along with Comrade Paras Ram, Gopal Dass, Ami Chand, Saligram, Pandit Bhagat Ram, Lala Hemraj sood, Sarla Sharma, Thakur Hazara Singh, and Lala Nagaia Mal.Lala Bhagat Ram also participated in the Quit India Movement in 1942.

He was injured in a lathi-charge at the Sandoo maidan in Bilaspur while addressing a meeting of the Praja Mandal.His entry along with of his family was restricted in Kehloor, Suket and Mandi states and all properties in these states were confiscated by the rulers.

Lala Bhagat Ram remained active in politics till he breathed his last at the age of 85 on December 12, 1999. He remained the president of the District Congress Committee and a delegate of the Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee.Kranti Kumar, son of Lala Bhagat Ram, says various governments vowed to build a memorial to the freedom fighters, but nothing was done. There was a proposal to rename the local school after Lala Bhagat Ram, but to no avail. Announcements were also made to provide at least one government job to the kin of freedom fighters, but it had remained only on paper.Lala Bhagat Ram is survived by four sons — Kranti Kumar, Karam Chand Katna, Madan Lal and Desh Raj — and three daughters Vidhya Devi, Rajan Devi and Bimla Devi.Unfulfilled promises||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bhagat-ram-was-in-lahore-jail-when-bhagat-singh-was-hanged-363622
