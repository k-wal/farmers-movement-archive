An enquiry was ordered on January 21, and the report was submitted on Monday, following which the suspension of three officials was ordered.On getting information, the Forest Department swung into action and counted 68 stumps of felled trees at Denkwan in Kandwal and Rit in Gangath forest beats.According to Viklap Yadav, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Nurpur, the forest territorial staff conducted a spot inquiry, following which the department suspended two forest guards deployed in Gangath and Kandwal forest beats and the Forest Block Officer of Gangath for their alleged dereliction of official duties.

Vehicles coming from other states will be levied a composite environmental fee to enter the town; Rs 100 and Rs 200 will be charged for LMVs, Rs 300 for medium-size vehicles and Rs 500 for heavy vehicles.Till now, the green tax is collected manually. Since its inception on June 19, 2004, there is a single window to collect the tax. Now with the automation of the barrier, tourists and common people will get rid of traffic jams, which worsens during the peak tourist season.Meanwhile, local residents have lauded the initiative of the Kullu administration. The Tribune had highlighted the issue on July 12 last year. The entire maintenance and upkeep of the green tax barriers is undertaken by the Kullu Tourism Development Council, headed by the Kullu Deputy Commissioner, which is running these barriers with the help of manual receipts and barricades, assisted by a few Home Guard personnel.Kullu DC Ashutosh Garg said the entire system was almost ready and the FASTag collection would be launched within a week. He said two lanes with boom barriers had been set up on the Rangadi barrier on the right bank road. He added the automation of the barrier would save time and provide transparency to the entire process. A green tax barrier has also been installed on the left bank road but this route is less frequented by tourists and the toll would collected here manually.The green tax barrier at Rangadi generally witnesses over 2,500 vehicles daily during the peak season and the rush further increases at weekend. An annual income of Rs 4 to Rs 5 crore is generated from the green tax barrier.Around Rs 70 crore had been collected as green tax at the barriers in the past 17 years while around Rs 65.50 crore had been spent to develop facilities for tourists such as parking lots, toilets at tourist spots, road repair, sanitation and beautification activities.Even as the earnings are used to improve civic amenities, questions about the conservation of greenery and reducing carbon emissions remain. Environmentalists opine that the amount collected at the green tax barriers should be utilised to conserve greenery and employ measures to reduce carbon emissions.Service to be launched within a week: DC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/soon-pay-green-tax-via-fastag-at-manali-barrier-364864

If the government still ignores our demand, we will go on a day’s strike on February 2. We will also decide how to take our protest forward after February 2”.The union is demanding the regularisation of the services of their members for the past two decades. “We have been fighting for our rights for over two decades now. Many states such as Haryana, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, etc., have formed a policy to regularise the services of NHM contractual employees. We fail to understand why the Himachal Pradesh Government is dragging its feet over the issue,” said Sharma.He said that the contractual employees were still being denied their due though they were the backbone of 22 NHM programmes running in the state. “Many employees have retired but they have got no gratuity. The serving employees get no benefits other than casual and medical leave. The situation is really discouraging for our people, who have given their best even during the pandemic,” he added.Sharma said that while states such as Punjab had started absorbing NHM contractual employees in the Health and Family Welfare Department, the Himachal government had not given any indication of adopting a similar policy. “There are many vacant posts in the Health Department. The government will get trained professionals if NHM employees are recruited against these posts. It will be a win-win position for everyone,” he added.Kullu: The contractual NHM workers wore black ribbons while performing duties at the Regional Hospital in Kullu.The District Press Secretary of the State Health Mission (NHM) Contract Employees Union said that they had urged the government to fulfil their demand for regular pay scales.

The duo was today produced before a Sundernagar court, which remanded them in police custody for five days.The SIT, on the information given by the arrested people, also confiscated more than 100 empty drums from a junk dealer at Baddi. These drums reportedly used to store extra neutral alcohol (ENA), which is the raw material used to manufacture spurious liquor.The duo are also linked to Yamuna Beverages Private Limited (YBPL) located at Nariwala in Paonta Sahib subdivision of Sirmaur district. The company was sealed in July 2021 after 13,802 litres of ENA was found on its premises stocked without a permit. As many as 5,155 cases of country-made liquor could be manufactured from this quantity of ENA. A penalty of about Rs 32 lakh was levied on the company and it caused a revenue loss of Rs 99,11,073 to the state exchequer. Besides, the Una unit of the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau had seized 900 boxes of country-made liquor manufactured at the YBPL in October 2021, which were being transported on a forged permit.Santosh Kumar, who is an authorised signatory of the YBPL, had sought a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the bureau officials at Una on January 6 for restarting the closed liquor unit. He had stated that the NOC was required by the state Tax and Excise Department, said Vigilance bureau officials.Ajay Grover was also an authorised signatory of the YBPL till early October last year and his name was changed just a week before the Vigilance bureau confiscated the liquor at Una, added the officials.The lab reports of the liquor seized by the Vigilance bureau proved that the amount of ethanol present in it was less than 40 degree proof litres, while the prescribed limit of alcohol content for human consumption in the state is 50 degree proof litres. A variation of only one degree is permissible in country-made liquor. This means that the alcohol content was pilfered for unauthorised use. The SIT is now inquiring the backward and forward linkages of the arrested duo. SIT confiscates 100 empty drums||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/hooch-tragedy-two-arrested-in-baddi-364852

He had earlier served as a mason in the Royal Bombay Regimental Centre of the British army in October 17,1939.Arjan was born on January 1, 1920. The family originally hailed from Mauli village in Kharar, which was part of Ambala district.He remained imprisoned for two years at various places such as Bahadurghat, Italy and France. Recognising his contribution to the freedom struggle, he was honoured with a ‘Tamrapatra’ by the government. He had served the British army at various places, including Egypt. He died on February 6,1993, at the age of 73.Arjan Singh has two sons and a daughter. His son Satish Singh serves in the Cantonment Board at Kasauli while his sister is married in Panchkula. His brother retired after serving in the Military Engineering Services here.Satish rues that the government has not done enough to honour his father’s sacrifice. “Being illiterate, Arjan Singh had little means of earning livelihood. We did not get any land or any other benefit from the government and it seems my father’s sacrifice has been forgotten”.Arjan Singh had come to Kasauli after Independence in 1948 in search of a job. “Since he was an ex-Army man, he secured a job in the local cinema hall where he had to control the crowd. Our family has since then settled in Kasauli,” says Satish.He recalls how his father used to narrate the inspiration behind joining the INA. The famous slogan of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, “Tum mujhe khoon do, mai tumeh azadi dunga” deeply motivated the youth in the British era and they were inspired to do something for the nation.He also reminisces how his father had spent several days in a forest without food after being surrounded by the British army.

Charanjit was also a member of the team which won silver at the 1960 Rome Olympics.Our team showed great characterWe were tested hard but also showed great character, and won the match by a narrow 1-0 margin to return home with that historic gold medal. — Charanjit Singh on his Olympic goldCharanjit had suffered a paralytic stroke around five years ago and his health deteriorated some two months ago. On Wednesday, he had to be rushed to hospital but his condition stabilised and he was brought back home, said his son VK Singh. However, he passed away around 5 am today and was cremated in the evening.The hockey legend, who hailed from Mairi village in Amb subdivision of Una district, had a passion for the sport since his student days in Lahore before Independence.He represented India in two Asian Games as well and was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 1963 and the Padma Shri the next year. After his career as a player was over, he served as Director (Sports) in HP University, and upon retirement he moved to Una city. Charanjit’s home ‘Olympus’ is located near Una’s Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, which he used to visit till his health allowed. One of the best halfbacks of the world when at his prime, Charanjit was over 30 when he first figured in the Olympics, at Rome in 1960, when India were beaten by Pakistan in the final. In 1962, India lost to Pakistan in the final of the Asian Games too.The Indians were eager to snatch back the Olympics gold in 1964 and under Charanjit, they won a few tournaments in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics. They were now considered the favourites again, and they remained unbeaten in the tournament, winning seven matches and drawing two in 12 days, including a sweet 1-0 over Pakistan in the final. Recalling that match last year, Charanjit said: “We were tested hard but also showed great character, and won the match by a narrow 1-0 margin to return home with that historic gold medal.”                                     #Hockey||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/hockey-captain-who-got-india-1964-olympic-gold-dies-at-92-364765

Vehicles coming from other states will be levied a composite environmental fee to enter the town; Rs 100 and Rs 200 will be charged for LMVs, Rs 300 for medium-size vehicles and Rs 500 for heavy vehicles.Till now, the green tax is collected manually. Since its inception on June 19, 2004, there is a single window to collect the tax. Now with the automation of the barrier, tourists and common people will get rid of traffic jams, which worsens during the peak tourist season.Meanwhile, local residents have lauded the initiative of the Kullu administration. The Tribune had highlighted the issue on July 12 last year. The entire maintenance and upkeep of the green tax barriers is undertaken by the Kullu Tourism Development Council, headed by the Kullu Deputy Commissioner, which is running these barriers with the help of manual receipts and barricades, assisted by a few Home Guard personnel.Kullu DC Ashutosh Garg said the entire system was almost ready and the FASTag collection would be launched within a week. He said two lanes with boom barriers had been set up on the Rangadi barrier on the right bank road. He added the automation of the barrier would save time and provide transparency to the entire process. A green tax barrier has also been installed on the left bank road but this route is less frequented by tourists and the toll would collected here manually.The green tax barrier at Rangadi generally witnesses over 2,500 vehicles daily during the peak season and the rush further increases at weekend. An annual income of Rs 4 to Rs 5 crore is generated from the green tax barrier.Around Rs 70 crore had been collected as green tax at the barriers in the past 17 years while around Rs 65.50 crore had been spent to develop facilities for tourists such as parking lots, toilets at tourist spots, road repair, sanitation and beautification activities.Even as the earnings are used to improve civic amenities, questions about the conservation of greenery and reducing carbon emissions remain. Environmentalists opine that the amount collected at the green tax barriers should be utilised to conserve greenery and employ measures to reduce carbon emissions.Service to be launched within a week: DC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/soon-pay-green-tax-via-fastag-at-manali-barrier-364864

If the government still ignores our demand, we will go on a day’s strike on February 2. We will also decide how to take our protest forward after February 2”.The union is demanding the regularisation of the services of their members for the past two decades. “We have been fighting for our rights for over two decades now. Many states such as Haryana, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, etc., have formed a policy to regularise the services of NHM contractual employees. We fail to understand why the Himachal Pradesh Government is dragging its feet over the issue,” said Sharma.He said that the contractual employees were still being denied their due though they were the backbone of 22 NHM programmes running in the state. “Many employees have retired but they have got no gratuity. The serving employees get no benefits other than casual and medical leave. The situation is really discouraging for our people, who have given their best even during the pandemic,” he added.Sharma said that while states such as Punjab had started absorbing NHM contractual employees in the Health and Family Welfare Department, the Himachal government had not given any indication of adopting a similar policy. “There are many vacant posts in the Health Department. The government will get trained professionals if NHM employees are recruited against these posts. It will be a win-win position for everyone,” he added.Kullu: The contractual NHM workers wore black ribbons while performing duties at the Regional Hospital in Kullu.The District Press Secretary of the State Health Mission (NHM) Contract Employees Union said that they had urged the government to fulfil their demand for regular pay scales.

The duo was today produced before a Sundernagar court, which remanded them in police custody for five days.The SIT, on the information given by the arrested people, also confiscated more than 100 empty drums from a junk dealer at Baddi. These drums reportedly used to store extra neutral alcohol (ENA), which is the raw material used to manufacture spurious liquor.The duo are also linked to Yamuna Beverages Private Limited (YBPL) located at Nariwala in Paonta Sahib subdivision of Sirmaur district. The company was sealed in July 2021 after 13,802 litres of ENA was found on its premises stocked without a permit. As many as 5,155 cases of country-made liquor could be manufactured from this quantity of ENA. A penalty of about Rs 32 lakh was levied on the company and it caused a revenue loss of Rs 99,11,073 to the state exchequer. Besides, the Una unit of the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau had seized 900 boxes of country-made liquor manufactured at the YBPL in October 2021, which were being transported on a forged permit.Santosh Kumar, who is an authorised signatory of the YBPL, had sought a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the bureau officials at Una on January 6 for restarting the closed liquor unit. He had stated that the NOC was required by the state Tax and Excise Department, said Vigilance bureau officials.Ajay Grover was also an authorised signatory of the YBPL till early October last year and his name was changed just a week before the Vigilance bureau confiscated the liquor at Una, added the officials.The lab reports of the liquor seized by the Vigilance bureau proved that the amount of ethanol present in it was less than 40 degree proof litres, while the prescribed limit of alcohol content for human consumption in the state is 50 degree proof litres. A variation of only one degree is permissible in country-made liquor. This means that the alcohol content was pilfered for unauthorised use. The SIT is now inquiring the backward and forward linkages of the arrested duo. SIT confiscates 100 empty drums||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/hooch-tragedy-two-arrested-in-baddi-364852

He had earlier served as a mason in the Royal Bombay Regimental Centre of the British army in October 17,1939.Arjan was born on January 1, 1920. The family originally hailed from Mauli village in Kharar, which was part of Ambala district.He remained imprisoned for two years at various places such as Bahadurghat, Italy and France. Recognising his contribution to the freedom struggle, he was honoured with a ‘Tamrapatra’ by the government. He had served the British army at various places, including Egypt. He died on February 6,1993, at the age of 73.Arjan Singh has two sons and a daughter. His son Satish Singh serves in the Cantonment Board at Kasauli while his sister is married in Panchkula. His brother retired after serving in the Military Engineering Services here.Satish rues that the government has not done enough to honour his father’s sacrifice. “Being illiterate, Arjan Singh had little means of earning livelihood. We did not get any land or any other benefit from the government and it seems my father’s sacrifice has been forgotten”.Arjan Singh had come to Kasauli after Independence in 1948 in search of a job. “Since he was an ex-Army man, he secured a job in the local cinema hall where he had to control the crowd. Our family has since then settled in Kasauli,” says Satish.He recalls how his father used to narrate the inspiration behind joining the INA. The famous slogan of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, “Tum mujhe khoon do, mai tumeh azadi dunga” deeply motivated the youth in the British era and they were inspired to do something for the nation.He also reminisces how his father had spent several days in a forest without food after being surrounded by the British army.

Charanjit was also a member of the team which won silver at the 1960 Rome Olympics.Our team showed great characterWe were tested hard but also showed great character, and won the match by a narrow 1-0 margin to return home with that historic gold medal. — Charanjit Singh on his Olympic goldCharanjit had suffered a paralytic stroke around five years ago and his health deteriorated some two months ago. On Wednesday, he had to be rushed to hospital but his condition stabilised and he was brought back home, said his son VK Singh. However, he passed away around 5 am today and was cremated in the evening.The hockey legend, who hailed from Mairi village in Amb subdivision of Una district, had a passion for the sport since his student days in Lahore before Independence.He represented India in two Asian Games as well and was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 1963 and the Padma Shri the next year. After his career as a player was over, he served as Director (Sports) in HP University, and upon retirement he moved to Una city. Charanjit’s home ‘Olympus’ is located near Una’s Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, which he used to visit till his health allowed. One of the best halfbacks of the world when at his prime, Charanjit was over 30 when he first figured in the Olympics, at Rome in 1960, when India were beaten by Pakistan in the final. In 1962, India lost to Pakistan in the final of the Asian Games too.The Indians were eager to snatch back the Olympics gold in 1964 and under Charanjit, they won a few tournaments in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics. They were now considered the favourites again, and they remained unbeaten in the tournament, winning seven matches and drawing two in 12 days, including a sweet 1-0 over Pakistan in the final. Recalling that match last year, Charanjit said: “We were tested hard but also showed great character, and won the match by a narrow 1-0 margin to return home with that historic gold medal.”                                     #Hockey||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/hockey-captain-who-got-india-1964-olympic-gold-dies-at-92-364765
