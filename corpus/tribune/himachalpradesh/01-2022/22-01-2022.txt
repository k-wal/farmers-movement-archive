As soon as the team of officials reached Bathan, hundreds of villagers along with the pradhan and members of the panchayat arrived there. They categorically told the SDM that they would not allow the installation of a stone crusher in their village. They told Sharma that the administration had no right to force the panchayat to issue an NOC for a stone crusher. The panchayat had in an open session already rejected twice the request for an NOC.Panchayat pradhan Seema Devi and up-pradhan Sat Pal said they would not allow mining as it would be a health hazard and also cause environmental degradation in the area. They added that stone crushers had made the lives of locals miserable.“The mining mafia operating in adjoining panchayats has damaged the village cremation ground, local paths, water supply schemes, and bridges. Most of the stone crushers function round the clock, and as a result children cannot study, elders cannot sleep and there is large scale pollution in the area,” they said.Earlier, a large number of villagers assembled at the site and threatened to hold a dharna if the government allowed the installation of a stone crusher without the consent of the panchayat.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned mining in the Neugal three years ago. Therefore, no part of the riverbed could be leased for mining. Besides, the Himachal HC had also directed the government not to allow mining in the area where it is banned without the approval of the NGT.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/stone-crusher-on-neugal-riverbed-opposed-363417

However, till date nothing has been done to shift the office of the ADGP police training to Palampur.He said Thakur always accepted the demands of the party leaders and MLAs. However, the state bureaucracy was not taking the CM seriously. The Assembly elections were due this year but the bureaucracy was not serious about bringing projects, even the ones which were laid by the Chief Minister, to the ground. This would affect the party’s prospects. “I would be writing to the Chief Minister to take bureaucrats to task as they were not taking his announcements seriously,” he said.Parveen was BJP MLA from Palampur from 2007 to 2012. He is considered close to former Chief Minister Shanta Kumar. After the party denied him ticket in 2017, Praveen contested as an independent. On the intervention of Shanta Kumar, Parveen Sharma was re-inducted into the BJP before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Sources here said that many BJP leaders from Palampur were miffed at the importance being given to state general secretary of party Trilok Kapoor from the area and are feeling sidelined. Due to the alleged infighting in Palampur, the BJP was routed in Palampur MC elections, losing 11 out of 13 wards.Cites example||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bureaucracy-not-taking-cms-words-seriously-ex-mla-363415

The graph of production started going downwards in 2011 but between 2016 and 2021, the output was less than 50 lakh boxes per year.The Kullu valley is famous for various varieties of apple, but declining production has made the orchardists concerned. This year, the production of apple was 55 lakh boxes, against 48 lakh boxes in 2020, which is still below average. Production in the past six years was the highest in 2019 (75 lakh boxes).This year, the orchardists received a double blow as the output was less and the growers did not get a fair price for their produce as well. Besides the initial season, 60 per cent of the apple boxes were sold for only Rs 500 to Rs 900 in the mandis of Kullu, along with the Azadpur Mandi in New Delhi and other markets of the country. Thus, the orchardists were forced to sell apple in local mandis.Orchardists Ramesh Chand, Hans Raj and Kishori Lal rue that they did not get a fair price this year and many of them could not even recover the input cost. Due to the decreasing production and unfair prices, they are getting financially weaker year after year. This year, too, the apple crop was destroyed by hailstorm in many areas while the crop stained by hail did not fetch a good price in many areas.Kullu Horticulture Department expert Uttam Prashar says that untimely snowfall, hailstorms and storms are damaging the crop during the flowering and setting season. To avoid this, the government is subsidising the installation of nets to protect the apple crop from hailstorm, he adds.Uneven weather worriesUntimely snowfall, hailstorms and storms are damaging the crop during the flowering and setting season.

The Ropeway and Rapid Transport System Development Corporation (RRTSDC) has cancelled the tender for its ambitious Rs 1,200 crore passenger ropeway project after waiting for a promoter for almost two years. Having failed to find any taker for the project through Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode, the RRTSDC has opted for bi-lateral funding mode to make the much-needed project a reality.“We had a couple of international companies interested in the project. But despite showing interest, nothing concrete was happening. So after extending the deadline for submitting the bid 18 times and still getting no response, we decided to call it off,” said a RRTSDC official.The RRTSDC had floated the Request for Proposal in May, 2020, inviting companies to design, construct, operate and maintain a passenger ropeway system to provide an alternative transport system for the city struggling with ever increasing traffic on its narrow roads.The project envisaged laying 22.1-km ropeway across the city with 26 stations from where the people could board and disembark in its first phase. In the next two phases, the plan was to connect places like Kufri, Mashobra and Chail with the ropeway system.“The plan remains more or less the same. The additional thing is, we have proposed a ropeway for Dharamsala too, along with Shimla,” the official said. The fresh proposal will now go to Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, through the state government.Much time has been lost in getting the project, which has the potential to change the way people will travel in the city, off the ground. “Covid has been the major spoilsport. Those interested could not travel to India because of the Covid-induced restrictions,” the official said.Meanwhile, it’s not the first ropeway project of the city that has got stuck. A ropeway from Tutikandi to Mall Road for which the foundation stone was laid in 2015 is defunct now. Besides decongesting the city road and giving a boost to tourism in the city, the ropeway would have earned Rs 10 crore for the Municipal Corporation.What the project envisagedThe project envisaged laying 22.1 km long ropeway across the city, with 26 stations from where the people could board and disembark, in its first phase.

As soon as the team of officials reached Bathan, hundreds of villagers along with the pradhan and members of the panchayat arrived there. They categorically told the SDM that they would not allow the installation of a stone crusher in their village. They told Sharma that the administration had no right to force the panchayat to issue an NOC for a stone crusher. The panchayat had in an open session already rejected twice the request for an NOC.Panchayat pradhan Seema Devi and up-pradhan Sat Pal said they would not allow mining as it would be a health hazard and also cause environmental degradation in the area. They added that stone crushers had made the lives of locals miserable.“The mining mafia operating in adjoining panchayats has damaged the village cremation ground, local paths, water supply schemes, and bridges. Most of the stone crushers function round the clock, and as a result children cannot study, elders cannot sleep and there is large scale pollution in the area,” they said.Earlier, a large number of villagers assembled at the site and threatened to hold a dharna if the government allowed the installation of a stone crusher without the consent of the panchayat.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned mining in the Neugal three years ago. Therefore, no part of the riverbed could be leased for mining. Besides, the Himachal HC had also directed the government not to allow mining in the area where it is banned without the approval of the NGT.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/stone-crusher-on-neugal-riverbed-opposed-363417

However, till date nothing has been done to shift the office of the ADGP police training to Palampur.He said Thakur always accepted the demands of the party leaders and MLAs. However, the state bureaucracy was not taking the CM seriously. The Assembly elections were due this year but the bureaucracy was not serious about bringing projects, even the ones which were laid by the Chief Minister, to the ground. This would affect the party’s prospects. “I would be writing to the Chief Minister to take bureaucrats to task as they were not taking his announcements seriously,” he said.Parveen was BJP MLA from Palampur from 2007 to 2012. He is considered close to former Chief Minister Shanta Kumar. After the party denied him ticket in 2017, Praveen contested as an independent. On the intervention of Shanta Kumar, Parveen Sharma was re-inducted into the BJP before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Sources here said that many BJP leaders from Palampur were miffed at the importance being given to state general secretary of party Trilok Kapoor from the area and are feeling sidelined. Due to the alleged infighting in Palampur, the BJP was routed in Palampur MC elections, losing 11 out of 13 wards.Cites example||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bureaucracy-not-taking-cms-words-seriously-ex-mla-363415

The project is estimated to cost Rs 215.35 crore.The MoU was signed at Panchkula by the Chief Secretaries of both states in the presence of Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur and his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar.Thakur said that the signing of the MoU would pave the way for fulfilling Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream of reviving the Saraswati river. He added that the project would be useful for Himachal Pradesh as 3.92 hectare metre water per annum would be earmarked for the state for drinking purpose and 57.96 hectare metre for irrigation in the project affected habitations.He said that the dam would not only be used primarily for the revival of the Saraswati river but also for water conservation in the region. He added that the Haryana Government would arrange funds for the project.Thakur said that both governments would be free to prepare tourism projects as well as any other infrastructure facility, which may be required for the welfare and development of local people, from their own resources, without compromising the primary objectives of the dam project.He said that 21 families of Himachal, which would be displaced, would be properly rehabilitated and the Haryana Government would bear the cost of the rehabilitation package for the oustees and the environmental protection package or any other unforeseen cost/ expenditure.Of the total proposed area, 31.16 hectares fall in Himachal (0.67 hectares of private landowners and 30.49 hectares of forestland). He said that the dam would get 224 hectare metre water from the Somb river of Himachal that falls into the Yamuna near Adi Badri in Yamunanagar district. He added that the HPPCL would be the executing agency for the Adi Badri dam and its related infrastructure.Khattar said that with the construction of the dam, the Saraswati river would flow throughout the year with 20 cusecs of water at all times. He added that the course of the Ghaggar river was said to be the course of the Saraswati river. The project would go a long way in promoting tourism activities in the area with the joint efforts of the governments of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.Khattar said that the project when completed would open avenues for tourism, and also recharge groundwater.                                     #JaiRamThakur                                     #ManoharLalKhattar                                     #Tourism||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/hp-haryana-sign-pact-for-dam-to-revive-saraswati-river-363397

Around 80 lakh to one crore boxes of apple are generally produced in the district, generating a business of about Rs 1,000 crore.But since 2016, the production of apple in the district has been declining due to climatic changes. The graph of production started going downwards in 2011 but between 2016 and 2021, the output was less than 50 lakh boxes per year.The Kullu valley is famous for various varieties of apple, but declining production has made the orchardists concerned. This year, the production of apple was 55 lakh boxes, against 48 lakh boxes in 2020, which is still below average. Production in the past six years was the highest in 2019 (75 lakh boxes).This year, the orchardists received a double blow as the output was less and the growers did not get a fair price for their produce as well. Besides the initial season, 60 per cent of the apple boxes were sold for only Rs 500 to Rs 900 in the mandis of Kullu, along with the Azadpur Mandi in New Delhi and other markets of the country. Thus, the orchardists were forced to sell apple in local mandis.Orchardists Ramesh Chand, Hans Raj and Kishori Lal rue that they did not get a fair price this year and many of them could not even recover the input cost. Due to the decreasing production and unfair prices, they are getting financially weaker year after year. This year, too, the apple crop was destroyed by hailstorm in many areas while the crop stained by hail did not fetch a good price in many areas.Kullu Horticulture Department expert Uttam Prashar says that untimely snowfall, hailstorms and storms are damaging the crop during the flowering and setting season. To avoid this, the government is subsidising the installation of nets to protect the apple crop from hailstorm, he adds.Uneven weather worriesUntimely snowfall, hailstorms and storms are damaging the crop during the flowering and setting season.

The Ropeway and Rapid Transport System Development Corporation (RRTSDC) has cancelled the tender for its ambitious Rs 1,200 crore passenger ropeway project after waiting for a promoter for almost two years. Having failed to find any taker for the project through Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode, the RRTSDC has opted for bi-lateral funding mode to make the much-needed project a reality.“We had a couple of international companies interested in the project. But despite showing interest, nothing concrete was happening. So after extending the deadline for submitting the bid 18 times and still getting no response, we decided to call it off,” said a RRTSDC official.The RRTSDC had floated the Request for Proposal in May, 2020, inviting companies to design, construct, operate and maintain a passenger ropeway system to provide an alternative transport system for the city struggling with ever increasing traffic on its narrow roads.The project envisaged laying 22.1-km ropeway across the city with 26 stations from where the people could board and disembark in its first phase. In the next two phases, the plan was to connect places like Kufri, Mashobra and Chail with the ropeway system.“The plan remains more or less the same. The additional thing is, we have proposed a ropeway for Dharamsala too, along with Shimla,” the official said. The fresh proposal will now go to Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, through the state government.Much time has been lost in getting the project, which has the potential to change the way people will travel in the city, off the ground. “Covid has been the major spoilsport. Those interested could not travel to India because of the Covid-induced restrictions,” the official said.Meanwhile, it’s not the first ropeway project of the city that has got stuck. A ropeway from Tutikandi to Mall Road for which the foundation stone was laid in 2015 is defunct now. Besides decongesting the city road and giving a boost to tourism in the city, the ropeway would have earned Rs 10 crore for the Municipal Corporation.What the project envisagedThe project envisaged laying 22.1 km long ropeway across the city, with 26 stations from where the people could board and disembark, in its first phase. In the next two phases, the plan was to connect places like Kufri, Mashobra and Chail with the ropeway system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/wait-for-shimla-passenger-ropeway-project-gets-longer-363392
