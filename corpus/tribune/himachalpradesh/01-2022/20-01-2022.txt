However, there was no loss of life, as no labourer was working there when the mishap took place.“A landowner had excavated a sizeable section of the hill to pave the way to an adjoining plot. Incessant rain in the area in the past few days triggered a massive landslide. Water seepage had loosened the soil and large chunks of debris fell on the under-construction building,” said Vipin, a local resident.The massive debris damaged the beams of under-construction building, which gave way. A hotel atop the hill on the Dharampur-Sanawar road has also become vulnerable to damage as a sizeable portion of the hill has eroded. This hotel had caved in several years ago, too, and was reconstructed.Kamlesh Kumari, pradhan of Gulhari gram panchayat, took stock of the situation and said, “A two-storey building was being raised at the affected site in Ward number 3.

They submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister alleging that high tariffs being charged by the truck unions of Una district had made their businesses unviable. They urged Thakur to intervene in the matter.In the memorandum (a copy is with The Tribune), the industrial associations alleged that many big investments had moved out of Una district due to the monopoly of the truck unions. They said that two paper mills in the Tahliwal area, which had invested about Rs 400 crore, had stopped their operations as their businesses had become unviable due to high transportation cost.Rajesh Kaushal, president of the Tahliwal Industrial Association, said that the industrial units in Una district were providing employment to about 40,000 people, most of whom are Himachalis. The industry was paying salaries to the tune of Rs 200 crore annually. “There are around 1,300 industrial units in Una involving an investment of about Rs 12,080 crore. The industries in Una are paying power bills of Rs 500 crore and contributing Rs 1,100 crore as revenue to the exchequer. They are also paying about Rs 180 crore as freight every year but still a few truck operators are being allowed to hold them to ransom,” he alleged.CS Kapoor, president of the Mehatpur Industrial Association, said that the truck unions were charging very high freight. “The market freight rate from Una to Delhi is Rs 18,000 whereas the Una truck unions are charging Rs 25,700. The freight from Delhi to Jaipur markets is Rs 22,500 but the truck unions are forcing the local industries to pay Rs 30,425. For Nepal, the market freight is Rs 3.30 per kg whereas the truck unions are charging Rs 8 per kg,” he said.Independent MLA from Dehra Hoshiar Singh accompanied the industrial associations to the Chief Minister, who assured them of looking into the issue.

The process of presentation - demo/proof of concept - and technical bid was completed on November 22.In the normal course, the tender is awarded within a week after the technical bid process is completed but the corporation had asked for the additional clarification and shortfall documents already submitted in the bid after one-and-a-half month.The logic behind seeking the additional clarification and shortfall documents after the completion of technical bid and allotment of marks is not understandable. It seems that an attempt is being made to bring someone, who earlier did not have the required marks mandatory to participate in the financial bid to be opened on January 24, 2022, alleged the director of a Hyderabad company, who could not apply due to initial restrictions.Legal experts are of the view that neither additional partner could be included, nor additional documents could be submitted after the technical bid is completed.Managing Director, HPSEDC, Mukesh Repaswal said after the evaluation of technical bid, minor clarification was sought on the recommendation of the technical committee and attributed the delay in to administrative reasons, besides Covid. “We have received no formal complaint in this regard,” he added.Students in government schools are losing the benefit of digitisation in the Covid times due to the delay caused in allotment of tender.

The freedom fighter was born on March 18, 1916, in Bhareri village, then part of Kangra district in Punjab province. He did his schooling from the local government school.“Despite repeated assurances, the successive governments have failed to bestow this honour on my father, who was an eminent freedom fighter,” rues his son Purshotam Kalia.He also lamented that there was little recognition for freedom fighters and despite several assurances, the government was yet to constitute a freedom fighters welfare board and a memorial at Dari near Dharamsala.After completing his education at Bhareri, Amin Chand moved to Amritsar and started working at a shop. Since the city was a major activity hub in the freedom struggle, he started attending meetings of revolutionaries.Purshotam revealed that his father was first apprehended by the British Police while on his way to deliver weapons and ammunition in 1936. He was imprisoned and sentenced to four years in jail at Lahore but was released before completion of the sentence. He was jailed again for anti-British activities in 1939.Amin Chand continued contributing to the independence struggle and was arrested again in 1942. In 1945, he was jailed in Rawalpindi and Multan. For his active participation in the freedom movement, Comrade Saab was appointed President of the Forward Block by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Later, he joined the movement with Lala Jagat Narayan.After India’s independence, Amin Chand stayed on in Amritsar for some time and then returned to his native place. In 1967, he contested the Vidhan Sabha elections from Nadaunta constituency (now Barsar) and went on to become the Deputy Speaker.He died on May 19, 1976, after a prolonged illness.

They submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister alleging that high tariffs being charged by the truck unions of Una district had made their businesses unviable. They urged Thakur to intervene in the matter.In the memorandum (a copy is with The Tribune), the industrial associations alleged that many big investments had moved out of Una district due to the monopoly of the truck unions. They said that two paper mills in the Tahliwal area, which had invested about Rs 400 crore, had stopped their operations as their businesses had become unviable due to high transportation cost.Rajesh Kaushal, president of the Tahliwal Industrial Association, said that the industrial units in Una district were providing employment to about 40,000 people, most of whom are Himachalis. The industry was paying salaries to the tune of Rs 200 crore annually. “There are around 1,300 industrial units in Una involving an investment of about Rs 12,080 crore. The industries in Una are paying power bills of Rs 500 crore and contributing Rs 1,100 crore as revenue to the exchequer. They are also paying about Rs 180 crore as freight every year but still a few truck operators are being allowed to hold them to ransom,” he alleged.CS Kapoor, president of the Mehatpur Industrial Association, said that the truck unions were charging very high freight. “The market freight rate from Una to Delhi is Rs 18,000 whereas the Una truck unions are charging Rs 25,700. The freight from Delhi to Jaipur markets is Rs 22,500 but the truck unions are forcing the local industries to pay Rs 30,425. For Nepal, the market freight is Rs 3.30 per kg whereas the truck unions are charging Rs 8 per kg,” he said.Independent MLA from Dehra Hoshiar Singh accompanied the industrial associations to the Chief Minister, who assured them of looking into the issue.

The process of presentation - demo/proof of concept - and technical bid was completed on November 22.In the normal course, the tender is awarded within a week after the technical bid process is completed but the corporation had asked for the additional clarification and shortfall documents already submitted in the bid after one-and-a-half month.The logic behind seeking the additional clarification and shortfall documents after the completion of technical bid and allotment of marks is not understandable. It seems that an attempt is being made to bring someone, who earlier did not have the required marks mandatory to participate in the financial bid to be opened on January 24, 2022, alleged the director of a Hyderabad company, who could not apply due to initial restrictions.Legal experts are of the view that neither additional partner could be included, nor additional documents could be submitted after the technical bid is completed.Managing Director, HPSEDC, Mukesh Repaswal said after the evaluation of technical bid, minor clarification was sought on the recommendation of the technical committee and attributed the delay in to administrative reasons, besides Covid. “We have received no formal complaint in this regard,” he added.Students in government schools are losing the benefit of digitisation in the Covid times due to the delay caused in allotment of tender. The funds for this project would expire in March.‘Attempt to favour someone’It is alleged that an attempt is being made to bring someone, who earlier did not have the required marks mandatory to participate in the financial bid to be opened on January 24.What law saysLegal experts are of the view that neither additional partner could be included, nor additional documents could be submitted after the technical bid is completed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/questions-over-delay-in-digitisation-of-schools-362748

The freedom fighter was born on March 18, 1916, in Bhareri village, then part of Kangra district in Punjab province. He did his schooling from the local government school.“Despite repeated assurances, the successive governments have failed to bestow this honour on my father, who was an eminent freedom fighter,” rues his son Purshotam Kalia.He also lamented that there was little recognition for freedom fighters and despite several assurances, the government was yet to constitute a freedom fighters welfare board and a memorial at Dari near Dharamsala.After completing his education at Bhareri, Amin Chand moved to Amritsar and started working at a shop. Since the city was a major activity hub in the freedom struggle, he started attending meetings of revolutionaries.Purshotam revealed that his father was first apprehended by the British Police while on his way to deliver weapons and ammunition in 1936. He was imprisoned and sentenced to four years in jail at Lahore but was released before completion of the sentence. He was jailed again for anti-British activities in 1939.Amin Chand continued contributing to the independence struggle and was arrested again in 1942. In 1945, he was jailed in Rawalpindi and Multan. For his active participation in the freedom movement, Comrade Saab was appointed President of the Forward Block by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Later, he joined the movement with Lala Jagat Narayan.After India’s independence, Amin Chand stayed on in Amritsar for some time and then returned to his native place. In 1967, he contested the Vidhan Sabha elections from Nadaunta constituency (now Barsar) and went on to become the Deputy Speaker.He died on May 19, 1976, after a prolonged illness.
