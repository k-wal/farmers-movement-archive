However, when it comes to providing free laptops to the meritorious students of the government schools under the Srinivasa Ramanujan Student Digital Yojna it has no additional funds.

Now just one week after the inauguration, the company has shut the ropeway project for maintenance.Sharma said that the MoU for the project was signed in 2015 during the previous Congress government. The present government delayed the execution of the project as it could not give necessary permissions in time. Now, a hurried inauguration of the project was done without letting the authorities complete all safety checks.Sharma said the Chief Minister also visited the Dharamsala war museum and an impression was given that the present government had constructed it. However, the fact was that the construction of the war museum was completed during the previous Congress government. Former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh had inaugurated the project. However, the present government failed to open it for public and tourists in the past four years. Even now only one floor of the museum had been opened for general public.Many other projects such as a tulip garden in Dharamsala had been shelved.

If potato and ginger with average production of about 2.30 lakh MT is also included in vegetables, the production will cross 20.50 lakh MT.Rain in lower areas, particularly in rain-fed places, is beneficial for wheat and other rabi crops. There was scanty rain after the sowing of wheat but rain in January has ended the dry spell, bringing cheer to farmers.It will also control the spread of yellow rust disease. “The average yield of wheat grown over 3.40 lakh hectares is 20 quintals per hectare and we are hopeful that timely rain will help us achieve the production target of 6,72,000 MT,” says Dhiman.“Due to dry weather, wheat grains are not gaining a proper size but rain has proved to be a boon,” says a local farmer, Amit. Rain is also beneficial for seasonal vegetables such as tomato, capsicum, brinjal and vegetables in the seedling condition.January rain brought cheer to farmersRain in lower areas, particularly in rain-fed places, is beneficial for wheat and other rabi crops.

31-01-2022||Subhash Rajta||Covid: Active cases, positivity rate dip, death count a concern in Himachal Pradesh||Shimla, January 30Even as the active case load has reduced by around 45 per cent over the last one week and the hospitality rate continues to be around 2.5 per cent, the number of deaths is not declining.On an average, seven to eight persons have succumbed to the virus every day over the last 10 days. In a wave that’s largely considered to be driven by a relatively mild omicron variant, the death count is worrisome.“Almost every victim in the latest wave had a co-morbid condition. A pure Covid death has been rare this time,” said NHM Director Hemraj Bairwa. “It shows the vaccination has had a good effect on healthy individuals,” he said.While the death rate continues to be a concern, the other Covid parameters such as the number of active cases, the positivity rate and the hospitalization rate appear to be moving in the right direction. The positivity rate has dropped down to 17-18 per cent from a high of 22-23 per cent a week back, and the hospitalization rate is also around 2 per cent.The number of active cases, in particular, has seen a massive decline over the last one week – from a high of 17, 295 on January 22, the count had nosedived to 9,453 by Saturday evening, a decline of over 45 per cent. The major reason for this steep decline, though, was the reduced testing per day in the wake of heavy snowfall about a week back.“The testing has been increased again and the active cases will rise proportionately. We will have to wait for the positivity rate to drop to a certain level before we can say the wave is on the decline,” said Bairwa.It is unlikely that the state will witness the peak of the third wave in the first week of February as was expected by the Health Department. “Given how things are panning out, it doesn’t look like the numbers will increase too much, unless the virus changes its behavior substantially. Nevertheless, we can’t let our guard down,” said Bairwa.Hospitalisation 2%Comorbidity behind most casualtiesAlmost every victim in the latest wave had a co-morbid condition.

Rising stress, uncertainty and financial insecurity are being cited as likely reasons.At least 709 suicides were reported in 2019, 856 in 2020 and 917 in 2021. With this alarming trend, the state police have started keeping a record of suicides in special registers kept at all 133 police stations in the state. The record has pointed out several vulnerable areas. The maximum cases in 2021 were reported in Baddi (31) followed by Sadar Solan, Sadar Hamirpur, Baijnath, Sadar Bilaspur and Ghumarwin.Attributing rising suicides in the industrial belt of Baddi to unsettled lives of migrants and poor economic conditions, Dr Sanjay Pathak, CEO, HP State Mental health Authority, said, “Uncertainty about future, financial insecurity and health and family-related stress leads to depression, which is the main cause of suicides.”DGP Sanjay Kundu said, “There is a need to involve all stakeholders to provide help to people in distress. We have requested the district administrations to take steps by roping in local bodies, health officials and NGOs to address the problem.”Experts say homemakers top the list of those taking the extreme step, followed by labourers, students, private sector employees, farmers and businessmen.A survey conducted by the State Mental Health Authority to assess the psychological impact of the pandemic revealed 42.92 per cent people were worried about their future and family, 40.46 per cent were stressed due to financial loss and 8 per cent put suicidal thoughts into action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/in-baddi-31-suicides-in-1-year-cops-flag-distressed-areas-365644

Now just one week after the inauguration, the company has shut the ropeway project for maintenance.Sharma said that the MoU for the project was signed in 2015 during the previous Congress government. The present government delayed the execution of the project as it could not give necessary permissions in time. Now, a hurried inauguration of the project was done without letting the authorities complete all safety checks.Sharma said the Chief Minister also visited the Dharamsala war museum and an impression was given that the present government had constructed it. However, the fact was that the construction of the war museum was completed during the previous Congress government. Former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh had inaugurated the project. However, the present government failed to open it for public and tourists in the past four years. Even now only one floor of the museum had been opened for general public.Many other projects such as a tulip garden in Dharamsala had been shelved.

If potato and ginger with average production of about 2.30 lakh MT is also included in vegetables, the production will cross 20.50 lakh MT.Rain in lower areas, particularly in rain-fed places, is beneficial for wheat and other rabi crops. There was scanty rain after the sowing of wheat but rain in January has ended the dry spell, bringing cheer to farmers.It will also control the spread of yellow rust disease. “The average yield of wheat grown over 3.40 lakh hectares is 20 quintals per hectare and we are hopeful that timely rain will help us achieve the production target of 6,72,000 MT,” says Dhiman.“Due to dry weather, wheat grains are not gaining a proper size but rain has proved to be a boon,” says a local farmer, Amit. Rain is also beneficial for seasonal vegetables such as tomato, capsicum, brinjal and vegetables in the seedling condition.January rain brought cheer to farmersRain in lower areas, particularly in rain-fed places, is beneficial for wheat and other rabi crops.

The government should tame it by restricting e-commerce companies, keeping in view the larger interests of the trading community. — Sumesh Sharma, president, HP Veopar Mandal                                     #BUDGET||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/simplify-gst-policy-in-budget-demands-himachal-pradesh-veopar-mandal-365717

However, many applicants in Kullu are being hassled as dealing executives at the passport kenda demand documents other than those listed on the official website.Karan, an applicant, says that he applied for changing his second wife’s name in his passport but the executive dealing with his application demanded a copy of their marriage registration certificate, which is not mentioned in the document adviser on the website.Some applicants say the applications of their families, including children, were not accepted on the pretext that the photographs on Aadhaar cards were not clear. They applied to change the photos, but still the applications were not accepted. He adds that additional chances for online appointment should be provided if the passport executive rejects a case on documents processed by government offices.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/applying-for-passport-a-herculean-task-in-kullu-365712

Due to it, people in the district are being forced to go to revenue officials to get records of their land for any sale, purchase or even renting out their properties.The problems are being complicated for people as due to shortage of revenue officials at the ground level people are being made to make multiple rounds to offices to get records of their land.Sunil Kumar, a resident of Dharamsala, said that he had purchased a piece of land in the city. “I should have got the revenue record of my land from the nearest Lok Mitra Kendra. However, when I went there, I was surprised to find out the land I had purchased was still in the name of the person from whom I brought it in online revenue records. On enquires from revenue officials I found that though temporary entry was made in my name in mutation register of local revenue officials, the record has not been updated online due to which it was still being reflected in name of the person from whom I bought it”, he said.Inquiries by The Tribune revealed that as per the rules, the revenue record has to be updated in each tehsil after every five years and uploaded on the online software developed by the state government. However, in many tehsils of Kangra district, including Dharamsala, records have not been uploaded online for the past about 10 years. Similarly, in many other tehsils the records have not been updated for the last 15 years.The state government under directions of the Union government was bound to upload the revenue records online so that the people can assess them online from anywhere. Sources here said that in a meeting held recently Deputy Commissioner Kangra, Nipun Jindal pulled up the officials of revenue department for not updating the records online.The Deputy Commissioner, when contacted, said that directions have been passed to revenue officials to update the revenue records online as early as possible. He said that work for updating the revenue records online was getting delayed due to some technical glitches in the software. The matter has been taken up with the competent authorities and hopefully the revenue records would be updated soon, he said.Delayed due to technical glitchesDirections have been passed to revenue officials to update the revenue records online.

31-01-2022||Subhash Rajta||Covid: Active cases, positivity rate dip, death count a concern in Himachal Pradesh||Shimla, January 30Even as the active case load has reduced by around 45 per cent over the last one week and the hospitality rate continues to be around 2.5 per cent, the number of deaths is not declining.On an average, seven to eight persons have succumbed to the virus every day over the last 10 days. In a wave that’s largely considered to be driven by a relatively mild omicron variant, the death count is worrisome.“Almost every victim in the latest wave had a co-morbid condition. A pure Covid death has been rare this time,” said NHM Director Hemraj Bairwa. “It shows the vaccination has had a good effect on healthy individuals,” he said.While the death rate continues to be a concern, the other Covid parameters such as the number of active cases, the positivity rate and the hospitalization rate appear to be moving in the right direction. The positivity rate has dropped down to 17-18 per cent from a high of 22-23 per cent a week back, and the hospitalization rate is also around 2 per cent.The number of active cases, in particular, has seen a massive decline over the last one week – from a high of 17, 295 on January 22, the count had nosedived to 9,453 by Saturday evening, a decline of over 45 per cent. The major reason for this steep decline, though, was the reduced testing per day in the wake of heavy snowfall about a week back.“The testing has been increased again and the active cases will rise proportionately. We will have to wait for the positivity rate to drop to a certain level before we can say the wave is on the decline,” said Bairwa.It is unlikely that the state will witness the peak of the third wave in the first week of February as was expected by the Health Department. “Given how things are panning out, it doesn’t look like the numbers will increase too much, unless the virus changes its behavior substantially. Nevertheless, we can’t let our guard down,” said Bairwa.Hospitalisation 2%Comorbidity behind most casualtiesAlmost every victim in the latest wave had a co-morbid condition.

Rising stress, uncertainty and financial insecurity are being cited as likely reasons.At least 709 suicides were reported in 2019, 856 in 2020 and 917 in 2021. With this alarming trend, the state police have started keeping a record of suicides in special registers kept at all 133 police stations in the state. The record has pointed out several vulnerable areas. The maximum cases in 2021 were reported in Baddi (31) followed by Sadar Solan, Sadar Hamirpur, Baijnath, Sadar Bilaspur and Ghumarwin.Attributing rising suicides in the industrial belt of Baddi to unsettled lives of migrants and poor economic conditions, Dr Sanjay Pathak, CEO, HP State Mental health Authority, said, “Uncertainty about future, financial insecurity and health and family-related stress leads to depression, which is the main cause of suicides.”DGP Sanjay Kundu said, “There is a need to involve all stakeholders to provide help to people in distress. We have requested the district administrations to take steps by roping in local bodies, health officials and NGOs to address the problem.”Experts say homemakers top the list of those taking the extreme step, followed by labourers, students, private sector employees, farmers and businessmen.A survey conducted by the State Mental Health Authority to assess the psychological impact of the pandemic revealed 42.92 per cent people were worried about their future and family, 40.46 per cent were stressed due to financial loss and 8 per cent put suicidal thoughts into action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/in-baddi-31-suicides-in-1-year-cops-flag-distressed-areas-365644
