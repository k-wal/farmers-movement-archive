He was also conferred with Shiromani Pant Rattan award.Baba Iqbal Singh worked relentlessly towards imparting value-based education in rural India.In-charge of the Kalgidhar Trust since 1965, before he had retired in 1987, he built the organisation brick by brick that now runs 129 CBSE-affiliated English medium schools, which have more than 70,000 children, most of them are from five rural North Indian states. Far from the urban milieu, these schools focus on value-based education to children from marginalised sections of society.There were only five students in his one-room school called ‘Akal Academy’ at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur. Baba Iqbal Singh used his pension to construct the school building and managed it for the first year. Earlier, it was a forest area. The following year, more than 70 children from nearby districts took admission. Many families also came forward to help the trust later, said staff of the trust.However, soon it was realised that establishing one school could not solve the problems faced by children in nearby districts. The trust thus opened Akal Academy in Muktsar in 1993.By 1999, it had opened 19 academies across Punjab and the count now goes up to 129 schools spread across Punjab, UP, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. Many students have nationally topped the IIT, IIM and NEET exams.As a social worker, Baba Iqbal Singh didn’t restrict himself just to the education sector. He was involved in every facet of community life ie. schools, hospital, colleges, women care centre and de-addiction centres. With his team, he set up Akal Charitable Hospital at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur, which provides medical care to rural poor and other deprived sections of society. Every year, medical camps are organised in which doctors from Mumbai, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab provide free medical care, including free surgeries, to poor people.Under a women empowerment programme, underprivileged young women are rehabilitated by way of education and jobs. — TNSPlayed significant role in edu sector                                     #BaruSahib                                     #Sikhs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/working-for-poor-padma-shri-iqbal-singh-passes-away-at-96-365402

It has demanded that all shops at the Ajivika Bhawan be allotted to street vendors. It has threatened to launch an agitation if the MC did not withdraw the decision.‘Intervene or face stir’If the government doesn’t intervene, the CPM will launch an agitation against this anti-poor decision. Sanjay Chauhan, former mayorFormer Mayor and CPM leader Sanjay Chauhan said today that the MC had planned to construct the Ajivika Bhawan in 2015 to rehabilitate the urban poor, who earned their livelihood through street vending. “The project was passed in the MC House. The Central Government gave Rs 2.5 crore and the state government Rs 50 lakh for the project. The construction of the bhawan started in 2016 and was to be completed in 2017,” said Chauhan.He alleged that the project was put on the back burner when the BJP was elected to rule the MC in 2017. “And when after much delay the complex is almost ready, the MC has circumvented the decided norms to auction 71 shops. This is an assault on the rights of the urban poor,” said Chauhan. “Also, the MC’s plan to use the parking at the complex for commercial purpose is against its own rules,” he said. —                                     #AjivikaBhavan||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/shimla-municipal-corporation-decision-to-auction-71-shops-anti-poor-says-cpm-365401

The littered areas emit a foul smell, contrary to the tall claims of Municipal Corporation (MC) officials of maintaining cleanliness in the town.Garbage dumps in localities such as Maranda, Ghuggar Tanda, Differpatt and Rajpur and even on main roads is a common sight. The lifting of waste from most of the MC wards is slow and in many areas, it is lifted after a week. In fact, poor sanitation in parts of Palampur town has become a nuisance for residents.The residents of the town, who had high hopes from the newly formed Municipal Corporation regarding cleanliness, are disappointed. Even after one year of the MC coming into being, no improvement has been seen on the ground. Many residents say that the condition was better when their areas were part of panchayats than it is now under the MC. Last year, 15 panchayats were merged with the municipal council to pave the way for the formation of the corporation.“Facing an acute shortage of manpower and resources, the civic body is struggling to keep the town clean. In the absence of an adequate number of sanitary workers, it has become difficult for the MC to keep the town clean,” says Anish Nag, Deputy Mayor, Palampur Municipal Corporation.He says at present the MC is paying Rs 19.40 lakh per month to two sanitary contractors tasked with keeping the town clean. As per the agreement, the contractors are supposed to recruit 180 workers in 15 wards. However, during surprise checking, it was found that the contractors had deputed only 114 sanitary workers in all 15 wards.Nag says that it is not possible to clean all 15 wards having a population over 50,000 with the help of 114 workers. He adds that the Municipal Commissioner has imposed a 30 per cent cut in the payment to be made to one of the contractors. Besides, proceedings for the recovery of excess payment made to the contractor has also been initiated.“As per the rules, there should be five sanitary workers against 1,000 persons in ever municipal body. However, the Palampur MC has only 114 sanitary workers for a population of over 50,000; there is a shortage of 136 workers,” says a senior officer of the Urban Development Department.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/paucity-of-sanitary-workers-municipal-corporation-struggles-to-keep-palampur-clean-365400

Sansarpur Terrace, Kangra, HP, partially used flavours of orange and strawberry, cartons and five empty drums of 20 litres capacity.

He was also conferred with Shiromani Pant Rattan award.Baba Iqbal Singh worked relentlessly towards imparting value-based education in rural India.In-charge of the Kalgidhar Trust since 1965, before he had retired in 1987, he built the organisation brick by brick that now runs 129 CBSE-affiliated English medium schools, which have more than 70,000 children, most of them are from five rural North Indian states. Far from the urban milieu, these schools focus on value-based education to children from marginalised sections of society.There were only five students in his one-room school called ‘Akal Academy’ at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur. Baba Iqbal Singh used his pension to construct the school building and managed it for the first year. Earlier, it was a forest area. The following year, more than 70 children from nearby districts took admission. Many families also came forward to help the trust later, said staff of the trust.However, soon it was realised that establishing one school could not solve the problems faced by children in nearby districts. The trust thus opened Akal Academy in Muktsar in 1993.By 1999, it had opened 19 academies across Punjab and the count now goes up to 129 schools spread across Punjab, UP, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. Many students have nationally topped the IIT, IIM and NEET exams.As a social worker, Baba Iqbal Singh didn’t restrict himself just to the education sector. He was involved in every facet of community life ie. schools, hospital, colleges, women care centre and de-addiction centres. With his team, he set up Akal Charitable Hospital at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur, which provides medical care to rural poor and other deprived sections of society. Every year, medical camps are organised in which doctors from Mumbai, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab provide free medical care, including free surgeries, to poor people.Under a women empowerment programme, underprivileged young women are rehabilitated by way of education and jobs. — TNSPlayed significant role in edu sector                                     #BaruSahib                                     #Sikhs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/working-for-poor-padma-shri-iqbal-singh-passes-away-at-96-365402

It has demanded that all shops at the Ajivika Bhawan be allotted to street vendors. It has threatened to launch an agitation if the MC did not withdraw the decision.‘Intervene or face stir’If the government doesn’t intervene, the CPM will launch an agitation against this anti-poor decision. Sanjay Chauhan, former mayorFormer Mayor and CPM leader Sanjay Chauhan said today that the MC had planned to construct the Ajivika Bhawan in 2015 to rehabilitate the urban poor, who earned their livelihood through street vending. “The project was passed in the MC House. The Central Government gave Rs 2.5 crore and the state government Rs 50 lakh for the project. The construction of the bhawan started in 2016 and was to be completed in 2017,” said Chauhan.He alleged that the project was put on the back burner when the BJP was elected to rule the MC in 2017. “And when after much delay the complex is almost ready, the MC has circumvented the decided norms to auction 71 shops. This is an assault on the rights of the urban poor,” said Chauhan. “Also, the MC’s plan to use the parking at the complex for commercial purpose is against its own rules,” he said. —                                     #AjivikaBhavan||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/shimla-municipal-corporation-decision-to-auction-71-shops-anti-poor-says-cpm-365401

The littered areas emit a foul smell, contrary to the tall claims of Municipal Corporation (MC) officials of maintaining cleanliness in the town.Garbage dumps in localities such as Maranda, Ghuggar Tanda, Differpatt and Rajpur and even on main roads is a common sight. The lifting of waste from most of the MC wards is slow and in many areas, it is lifted after a week. In fact, poor sanitation in parts of Palampur town has become a nuisance for residents.The residents of the town, who had high hopes from the newly formed Municipal Corporation regarding cleanliness, are disappointed. Even after one year of the MC coming into being, no improvement has been seen on the ground. Many residents say that the condition was better when their areas were part of panchayats than it is now under the MC. Last year, 15 panchayats were merged with the municipal council to pave the way for the formation of the corporation.“Facing an acute shortage of manpower and resources, the civic body is struggling to keep the town clean. In the absence of an adequate number of sanitary workers, it has become difficult for the MC to keep the town clean,” says Anish Nag, Deputy Mayor, Palampur Municipal Corporation.He says at present the MC is paying Rs 19.40 lakh per month to two sanitary contractors tasked with keeping the town clean. As per the agreement, the contractors are supposed to recruit 180 workers in 15 wards. However, during surprise checking, it was found that the contractors had deputed only 114 sanitary workers in all 15 wards.Nag says that it is not possible to clean all 15 wards having a population over 50,000 with the help of 114 workers. He adds that the Municipal Commissioner has imposed a 30 per cent cut in the payment to be made to one of the contractors. Besides, proceedings for the recovery of excess payment made to the contractor has also been initiated.“As per the rules, there should be five sanitary workers against 1,000 persons in ever municipal body. However, the Palampur MC has only 114 sanitary workers for a population of over 50,000; there is a shortage of 136 workers,” says a senior officer of the Urban Development Department.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/paucity-of-sanitary-workers-municipal-corporation-struggles-to-keep-palampur-clean-365400

However, no person was found in the building.Pawar told The Tribune that according to local residents, some people from Bilaspur had purchased the building from its original owner about five years ago. A large number of people frequented the place. As they kept German Shepherd dogs in the building, the villagers kept away from them.The building is located in an isolated place, and so was ideal for operating a liquor bottling plant. As spirit used in manufacturing liquor was not found, it appears it was taken away.The raiding team found empty bottles bearing the label of VRV Fools Limited-VRV Santra, unused holograms, batch punching machine, printed rolls bearing the label of VRV Fools Ltd. Sansarpur Terrace, Kangra, HP, partially used flavours of orange and strawberry, cartons and five empty drums of 20 litres capacity. The same liquor brand is at the centre of the Mandi hooch tragedy.As per the locals, a forest guard from Namhol in Bilaspur had bought the building some years ago from its original owner and may have sold it further.DSP, Baddi, Navdeep Singh said that a case under Sections 39(1)(c), 47, 56 of the HP Excise Act had been registered and a probe was underway. “The building owner will be traced by scrutinizing records of the Revenue Department and information about the person, who had secured the power meter, would be used in the probe”.                                     #IllicitLiquor||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/unearthing-of-bottling-plant-shows-illicit-liquor-trade-flourishing-365399
