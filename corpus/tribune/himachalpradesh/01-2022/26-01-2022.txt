From one end of the city to another, the overhead network of telecom cables is getting denser and clumsier by the day. Besides making the Smart City look clumsy, it also raises some safety concerns.“These cables are being laid haphazardly. At many places these cables are hanging so loosely that a person can easily get entangled,” said Vivek Sharma, a councillor from Totu ward. “There’s a danger of even the vehicles, especially the two wheeler drivers, getting caught in these cables. The authorities concerned need to ensure these cables are laid properly, keeping in mind the safety of people,” said Sharma.Rakesh Sharma, a councillor from Panthaghati ward, feels clumsy overhead network of the cables is a blot on the beauty of Shimla. “When Shimla came under Smart City Mission, there was a talk of underground ducting of all these cables. On the contrary, these overhead cables are increasing at a rapid pace,” said Sharma.Sharma also suggested that if the spread of this network can’t be controlled, the MC can at least demand a certain amount from these telecom companies. “The telecom companies are either using electricity poles or erecting their own poles for laying the cables. Since MC is the owner of land where majority of these poles are standing in the city, it should get some share from the income telecom companies are making,” said Sharma.Even as telecom companies are busy laying more and more cable in the city, some areas of the city are complaining lack of network over the past some time. “In my ward, the network issue has become very serious. People are not able to make calls, the Internet is very slow or totally down most of the time,” said Diwakar Sharma, a councillor from Majaith ward.“Students and those working from home are facing a lot of problems due to network issues.

The government was positively considering the issues of police constables but they should have been patient.“Efforts have been made to address all chronic issues that have been pending since the previous Congress government,” he said while talking to mediapersons after announcing a slew of benefits, especially for employees, at the statehood day function here.He said that several long pending demands of the employees and the pensioners had been met, notwithstanding the ‘uneasy’ financial health of the state. Employees play a crucial role in ensuring development of the state by implementing the policies and welfare schemes of the government. “We have been sympathetically considering all their demands and now we have tried to grant them financial benefits on a par with the Punjab pay scales,” he added.Thakur said that the demand of the police personnel, too, had been met as they had been striving for additional financial benefits. “It’s not that we were not responsive towards their demands but they should have kept patience and waited for the issue to be resolved,” he added.He said that over 11 lakh power consumers, too, would stand to benefit as up to 60 units would henceforth be free of cost and they would have to pay only the meter rent. “The power tariff for the remaining consumers whose consumption is up to 125 units has also been almost halved. They will now pay Re one per unit as compared to Rs 1.90 per unit,” he added.                                     #JaiRamThakur||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/constables-should-have-shown-patience-himachal-cm-jai-ram-thakur-364533

The 81-year-old, a popular Pahari litterateur and folk artist, has been an important figure in the promotion of the dialect and has dedicated his life to the cause of Sirmauri culture.Sarek was overwhelmed with joy at hearing the news. Talking to The Tribune he said, “I don’t think I deserve this honour. I attribute it to the good wishes of the people who have appreciated my efforts in keeping the age-old Sirmauri culture alive”.He has translated 51 poems of Rabindranath Tagore as part of a Central government project received by Chudeshwar Loknritya Mandal, Rajgarh.He is passionate about keeping alive the Sirmauri culture and traditions, rare values, cuisine, etc., for its richness and heritage value.Though Sarek believes that there has been a dip in the number of Sirmauri speakers, he says surveys conducted at their own level indicate that Sirmauri is still spoken in the region by a large number of people. “Sirmauri is the first language of not just the people of Sirmaur, but it is also spoken in some parts of Uttarakhand,” saya Sarek.Dharamsala: Lalita Vakil was overwhelmed at receiving Padma Shri, the highest civilian award, for her contribution in preserving the traditional art of Chamba ‘rumal’. “I have been overwhelmed with phone calls and people congratulating me since the government announced the award,” she said while talking to The Tribune.“I have been working for the promotion of Chamba ‘rumal’ for the past about 50 years. This award is not just a recognition for me but also for the traditional art of Chamba ‘rumal’ of Chamba district. I hope it will attract more people towards learning the art of making ‘rumal’ in the district and across the country,” Lalita said.She said she started promoting and preserving this dying art about 50 years ago. At that time there was no government support. “We used to go the DC, Chamba, for financial support. For the last few decades, I have travelled extensively across the country and abroad for the promotion of Chamba ‘rumal’.“I am happy that the state government is now patronizing this art. Students or women who learn Chamba ‘rumal’ knitting are paid Rs 300 daily by the government. Many centres are teaching the art of knitting Chamba ‘rumal’. I hope Chamba ‘rumal’ knitting gets linked to the livelihood of women in Chamba district. It was the only way in which traditional art of Chamba district can be preserved,” Lalita said.                                     #PadmaAwards||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/pahari-litterateur-chamba-rumal-artist-get-padma-shri-364528

Some discrepancies, however, existed in the new scales. To ensure optimum gains to all employees, I announce another option for them, besides two existing ones. However, if any section of employees is still unable to reap optimum benefits of the new pay scales, we can decide to rethink on them”.Thakur unfurled the National Flag and took the salute from the contingents of police, IRB Jungalberi, Home Guard jawans and NCC girls etc. Probationer DSP Pranav Chauhan commanded the parade.Thakur announced that the pensioners of the state government would also be given pension as per the new pay scales of the Punjab Government. This would benefit about 1.75 lakh pensioners to the tune of about Rs 2,000 crore. He also announced 31 per cent DA to all employees of the state on a par with the Central Government employees, which would provide financial benefits of Rs 500 crore.He also announced increase in the annual income for availing of the benefits of various welfare schemes from the existing Rs 35,000 to Rs 50,000 and the benefits of higher scales on an immediate basis to all eligible police constables.

Those consuming electricity up to 125 units would be charged only one rupee per unit. This decision would benefit over 11 lakh domestic consumers and cost Rs 60 crore to the state exchequer. He also announced reduction in the per unit cost of electricity from 50 paise to 30 paise for farmers. This benefit would be applicable from April 2022.Thakur said that the day also marked the closing ceremony of the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee year of the statehood of Himachal Pradesh. He paid rich tributes to the founder and first Chief Minister of the state, Dr YS Parmar.He said, “Himachal has made unparallel strides in all spheres.

Since MC is the owner of land where majority of these poles are standing in the city, it should get some share from the income telecom companies are making,” said Sharma.Even as telecom companies are busy laying more and more cable in the city, some areas of the city are complaining lack of network over the past some time. “In my ward, the network issue has become very serious. People are not able to make calls, the Internet is very slow or totally down most of the time,” said Diwakar Sharma, a councillor from Majaith ward.“Students and those working from home are facing a lot of problems due to network issues. We had apprised the telecom companies of the issue and the Mayor has also brought the problem to the notice of the Deputy Commissioner. Nevertheless, the problem continues to persist,” said Sharma.More overhead wiresWhen Shimla came under Smart City Mission, there was a talk of underground ducting of all these cables.

26-01-2022||---||Constables should have shown patience: Himachal CM Jai Ram Thakur||Shimla, January 25Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur today said that his government had always been sympathetic towards the issues concerning employees, including police constables, and other sections of society and injustice would not be allowed to happen to anyone. The government was positively considering the issues of police constables but they should have been patient.“Efforts have been made to address all chronic issues that have been pending since the previous Congress government,” he said while talking to mediapersons after announcing a slew of benefits, especially for employees, at the statehood day function here.He said that several long pending demands of the employees and the pensioners had been met, notwithstanding the ‘uneasy’ financial health of the state. Employees play a crucial role in ensuring development of the state by implementing the policies and welfare schemes of the government. “We have been sympathetically considering all their demands and now we have tried to grant them financial benefits on a par with the Punjab pay scales,” he added.Thakur said that the demand of the police personnel, too, had been met as they had been striving for additional financial benefits. “It’s not that we were not responsive towards their demands but they should have kept patience and waited for the issue to be resolved,” he added.He said that over 11 lakh power consumers, too, would stand to benefit as up to 60 units would henceforth be free of cost and they would have to pay only the meter rent. “The power tariff for the remaining consumers whose consumption is up to 125 units has also been almost halved. They will now pay Re one per unit as compared to Rs 1.90 per unit,” he added.                                     #JaiRamThakur||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/constables-should-have-shown-patience-himachal-cm-jai-ram-thakur-364533

The 81-year-old, a popular Pahari litterateur and folk artist, has been an important figure in the promotion of the dialect and has dedicated his life to the cause of Sirmauri culture.Sarek was overwhelmed with joy at hearing the news. Talking to The Tribune he said, “I don’t think I deserve this honour. I attribute it to the good wishes of the people who have appreciated my efforts in keeping the age-old Sirmauri culture alive”.He has translated 51 poems of Rabindranath Tagore as part of a Central government project received by Chudeshwar Loknritya Mandal, Rajgarh.He is passionate about keeping alive the Sirmauri culture and traditions, rare values, cuisine, etc., for its richness and heritage value.Though Sarek believes that there has been a dip in the number of Sirmauri speakers, he says surveys conducted at their own level indicate that Sirmauri is still spoken in the region by a large number of people. “Sirmauri is the first language of not just the people of Sirmaur, but it is also spoken in some parts of Uttarakhand,” saya Sarek.Dharamsala: Lalita Vakil was overwhelmed at receiving Padma Shri, the highest civilian award, for her contribution in preserving the traditional art of Chamba ‘rumal’. “I have been overwhelmed with phone calls and people congratulating me since the government announced the award,” she said while talking to The Tribune.“I have been working for the promotion of Chamba ‘rumal’ for the past about 50 years. This award is not just a recognition for me but also for the traditional art of Chamba ‘rumal’ of Chamba district. I hope it will attract more people towards learning the art of making ‘rumal’ in the district and across the country,” Lalita said.She said she started promoting and preserving this dying art about 50 years ago. At that time there was no government support. “We used to go the DC, Chamba, for financial support. For the last few decades, I have travelled extensively across the country and abroad for the promotion of Chamba ‘rumal’.“I am happy that the state government is now patronizing this art. Students or women who learn Chamba ‘rumal’ knitting are paid Rs 300 daily by the government. Many centres are teaching the art of knitting Chamba ‘rumal’. I hope Chamba ‘rumal’ knitting gets linked to the livelihood of women in Chamba district. It was the only way in which traditional art of Chamba district can be preserved,” Lalita said.                                     #PadmaAwards||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/pahari-litterateur-chamba-rumal-artist-get-padma-shri-364528

Some discrepancies, however, existed in the new scales. To ensure optimum gains to all employees, I announce another option for them, besides two existing ones. However, if any section of employees is still unable to reap optimum benefits of the new pay scales, we can decide to rethink on them”.Thakur unfurled the National Flag and took the salute from the contingents of police, IRB Jungalberi, Home Guard jawans and NCC girls etc. Probationer DSP Pranav Chauhan commanded the parade.Thakur announced that the pensioners of the state government would also be given pension as per the new pay scales of the Punjab Government.
