He was also conferred with Shiromani Pant Rattan award.Baba Iqbal Singh worked relentlessly towards imparting value-based education in rural India.In charge of Kalgidhar Trust since 1965, before he had retired in 1987, he built the organisation brick by brick that now runs 129 CBSE-affiliated English medium schools which have more than 70,000 children, most of them are from five rural North Indian states. Far away from the urban milieu, these schools focus on value-based education to children from marginalised sections of society.शिक्षा, चिकित्सा और समाजसेवा के क्षेत्र में उल्लेखनीय योगदान करने वाले श्री इक़बाल सिंह जी के निधन से बहुत दुःख हुआ। उनकी सेवाओं के सम्मान स्वरूप, उन्हें वर्ष 2022 में पद्मश्री के लिए चुना गया। उनके परिवार व प्रशंसकों के प्रति मेरी गहन शोक-संवेदनाएं।  With only five students in a one-room school called ‘Akal Academy' at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur, Baba Iqbal Singh used his pension to construct the building and managed the school for the first year. Earlier, it was a forest area. The following year, more than 70 children from nearby districts took admission. Many families also came forward to help the trust later, said staff of the trust.Pained by the passing away of Baba Iqbal Singh Ji. He will be remembered for his efforts to increase education among youngsters. He tirelessly worked towards furthering social empowerment. My thoughts are with his family and admirers in this sad hour. May Waheguru bless his soul.  However, soon it was realised that establishing one school could not solve problems faced by children in nearby districts. The trust thus opened Akal Academy in Muktsar in 1993. By 1999, it had opened 19 academies across Punjab and the count now goes up to 129 schools spread across Punjab, UP, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. Many students have nationally topped the IIT, IIM and NEET exams.Deeply saddened to know about the demise of Shiromani Panth Rattan Baba Iqbal Singh Ji. The spiritual leader was recently honored with Padma Shri for his exemplary social work. May Guru Sahib grant peace to the departed soul. My condolences & concerns for his family & followers. pic.twitter.com/luVFxYLEzJ  As a social worker, Baba Iqbal Singh didn’t restrict himself just to the education sector, he was involved in every facet of community life ie. schools, hospital, colleges, women care centre and de-addiction centres. With his team, he set up Akal Charitable Hospital at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur, which provides medical care to rural poor and other deprived sections of society. Every year, medical camps are organised in which doctors from Mumbai, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab provide free medical care including free surgeries to poor people.Deeply saddened by the demise of social worker & philanthropist Shiromani Panth Rattan, Sardar Baba Iqbal Singh Ji.

As a result, the office of Superintendent Engineer, PWD quality control, has shifted from Dharamsala to Dharampur.The Dharampur Assembly constituency is represented by IPH Minister Mahinder Thakur. The shifting of another office from Kangra district has triggered a war of words. Congress leaders from the area allege discrimination against Kangra while BJP leaders are on the back foot over the issue.AICC secretary RS Bali, said that ever since the BJP had formed government in the state, Kangra district had hardly got any new project. Instead, many government offices and projects had been shifted out of the region. Earlier, the office of Chief Engineer (projects) was shifted from Fatehpur subdivision of Kangra to Mandi.The Mid Himalayan Project of the Forest Department that was to be implemented in Kangra, Hamirpur and Una districts was closed and the offices associated with it were shifted to other regions of the state, Bali alleged.Ajay Mahajan, district president of the Congress, said the government had been giving a step-motherly treatment to Kangra district despite the fact that the BJP has 10 MLAs and three ministers from the district. It is strange that the BJP MLAs and ministers from Kangra were not opposing the government move to shift out government offices from the district. The people of Kangra, which has 15 Assembly segments, would give an apt reply to the BJP in the forthcoming Assembly elections, he added.BJP MLA from Dharamsala Vishal Nehria said that he had taken up the matter with the Chief Minister. “I have been trying to bring in other major projects to Dharamsala but the shifting of office from Dharamsala to Dharampur was unfortunate. I will visit Shimla soon to sort out the matter”, he said.The shifting of Chief Engineer IPH (projects) office from Fatehpur to Mandi was an issue during the recent Fatehpur byelections. Now the shifting of another government office from Dharamsala is likely to generate political heat in Kangra district.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/shifting-of-pwd-office-from-dharamsala-stirs-row-365148

The Planning Department has reportedly refused to provide an additional amount of Rs 25 lakh to meet the escalated costs.Taking no savings pleaA budget provision of Rs 25 crore each was made for 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic sessions for the purpose. The Education Department requires additional funds amounting to Rs 25 lakh to purchase laptops for students of 2019-20 session, as the cost has increased in the past two years.But the department has been asked to scale down the configurations to bare minimum level to manage within the available budget or opt for smartphones as additional allocations were not possible in the absence of any savings.“The Administrative Department, may make appropriate decision at its own level if it wishes to go for distribution/purchase of laptops by revising the cost downwards to make their configuration to bare minimum level required by the students or distribute smartphones instead of laptops within the available resources,” Kultar Singh Rana, Under Secretary, Higher Education, stated in a letter to the Director, Higher Education.A parent, whose son was a student of the 2019-20 session, said it was a matter of concern that in the present era of fast changing Information Technology, the meritorious students would be provided laptops with bare minimum configuration, simply because the government was unable to provide an additional amount of Rs 25 lakh.As many as 19,850 students of 2018-19 and 2019-20 sessions are waiting for laptops as the government could not take a decision regarding their purchase. However, smartphones would be given to about 10,000 meritorious students of 2020-21, for which the tendering process is on, sources in the Education Department said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/distribution-of-laptops-to-students-hangs-fire-365132

When the government has announced protocols for marriages and political functions, why similar protocols are not implemented for coaching centres. It seemed that Covid was spreading only through educational institutes, he adds.There are hundreds of youths, who are employed in coaching centres, and their livelihood has been hit.

The measure was supposed to strengthen field enforcement units to check illicit liquor trade, which causes revenue losses to the state exchequer.Even a provision of the World Bank-funded trace and track IT-enabled project, which also figures in the policy, for better regulation of liquor bottling units has not been introduced. The desired targets of the World Bank-funded Himachal Pradesh Public Financial Management Capacity Building Programme for excise have not been achieved. The programme is aimed at digitisation of excise administration, including all liquor manufacturing and bottling plants, by plugging revenue losses. No targets have been achieved till now as per the implementation status and the results report accessed by The Tribune. The state has, therefore, failed to secure the financial aid of more than Rs 5 crore due to tardy implementation.Even restructuring of the department, which includes separation of the excise and GST wings, has been pending for years.More than 100 inspectors and 10 assistant commissioners, who were spared from various inter-state multi-purpose barriers, could have been utilised for the job. The inter-state barriers were discontinued to allow seamless flow of goods after the introduction of the e-way bill system under the GST.                                     #IllicitLiquor||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/illicit-liquor-trade-booming-in-absence-of-excise-policy-365104

The PWD and other government departments, on the direction of the high court, have made the submission of X forms mandatory for the clearance of the bills of the contractors.The X forms are issued by the Mining Department to see whether the sand and gravel used in the construction work was mined legally. The contractors, however, allege that the stone crusher owners do not give them X forms.Navneet said that the contractors had been made a scapegoat. It was the duty of the department and the police to check illegal mining. “We take bills and pay the GST over the material purchased from stone crushers, which we then submit to the department for the clearance of our bills. Why are the contractors being asked to ensure that the material mined is legal when it is the duty of the Mining Department?” he added.He said the contractors had proposed to the government to levy a cess on them for the mined material if it wants more revenue. They should not be harassed for paper work.The issue of non-payment of bills to the contractors was also discussed during the winter session of the Assembly. Congress MLA from Dalhousie Asha Kumari took up their cause and said in Chamba where there were a very few sand and gravel quarries, the contractors were facing additional problems.They had to source material from Punjab and the stone crusher owners there did not issue X forms to them, Asha had stated.The government, however, maintained that the bills were being withheld on the directions of the high court. It would move the court to provide them relief.What is X formX forms are issued by the Mining Department to see whether sand and gravel used in the construction work was mined legally.

Stories of the brave should be preserved, regardless of the time they fought in. If we forget General Zorawar Singh, Victoria Cross winners Lala Ram and Captain Bhandari Ram, it will be akin to forgetting our history,” said Suresh Nadda, the eldest son of the late soldier.Born on July 24, 1919, in Serva Geharwin village of Bilaspur district, Capt Bhandari joined the British army as a sepoy in 1941. As part of the Baluch battalion, he showed extraordinary bravery while fighting the Japanese troops in Burma in 1944, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. After Independence, he was absorbed in the Dogra Regiment. He fought the 1947-48 war against Pakistan, the 1962 war against China and the 1965 war against Pakistan. He retired as an Honorary Captain in 1969.Despite his long and illustrious association with the Army, Nadda feels the country is gradually forgetting him and his family. To substantiate his allegations, he cites the complete lack of communication with the family from the government and the Army after the soldier’s death in 2002. “Until his death, he would receive invitation from the state and Central government for Republic Day and Independence Day functions. However, after his death, the family has been forgotten. There are no invites for any functions, neither from the government, nor from the Army,” he rued.British agencies, on the contrary, continue to be in touch with the family. “He received a lot of respect and honour in England. They invited him every third year with two guests until he was alive. During these visits, he would be called to the Buckingham Palace and various embassies. Even I travelled with him several times on these all-expenses covered visits,” said Nadda, who retired as a manager from the State Bank of India. “Even today, we continue to get courtesy mails and phone calls from England,” he said.Asserting that the family seeks no monetary or other benefits from the government, Nadda said all he wanted was for the identity of his father to be preserved. “There’s not even a statue of my father in the state. There was a link road diverting from the Bilaspur-Hamirpur highway into our village named after him, but that too is gone now due to the fourlaning of the road,” he said.Nadda suggested that war memorials should be built at the district level, where statues of war heroes should be built and their legends should be written down. “Our coming generations should know about these heroes and their valour,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/kin-feel-wwii-heros-legend-not-preserved-365098

He was also conferred with Shiromani Pant Rattan award.Baba Iqbal Singh worked relentlessly towards imparting value-based education in rural India.In charge of Kalgidhar Trust since 1965, before he had retired in 1987, he built the organisation brick by brick that now runs 129 CBSE-affiliated English medium schools which have more than 70,000 children, most of them are from five rural North Indian states. Far away from the urban milieu, these schools focus on value-based education to children from marginalised sections of society.शिक्षा, चिकित्सा और समाजसेवा के क्षेत्र में उल्लेखनीय योगदान करने वाले श्री इक़बाल सिंह जी के निधन से बहुत दुःख हुआ। उनकी सेवाओं के सम्मान स्वरूप, उन्हें वर्ष 2022 में पद्मश्री के लिए चुना गया। उनके परिवार व प्रशंसकों के प्रति मेरी गहन शोक-संवेदनाएं।  With only five students in a one-room school called ‘Akal Academy' at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur, Baba Iqbal Singh used his pension to construct the building and managed the school for the first year. Earlier, it was a forest area. The following year, more than 70 children from nearby districts took admission. Many families also came forward to help the trust later, said staff of the trust.Pained by the passing away of Baba Iqbal Singh Ji. He will be remembered for his efforts to increase education among youngsters. He tirelessly worked towards furthering social empowerment. My thoughts are with his family and admirers in this sad hour. May Waheguru bless his soul.  However, soon it was realised that establishing one school could not solve problems faced by children in nearby districts. The trust thus opened Akal Academy in Muktsar in 1993. By 1999, it had opened 19 academies across Punjab and the count now goes up to 129 schools spread across Punjab, UP, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. Many students have nationally topped the IIT, IIM and NEET exams.Deeply saddened to know about the demise of Shiromani Panth Rattan Baba Iqbal Singh Ji. The spiritual leader was recently honored with Padma Shri for his exemplary social work. May Guru Sahib grant peace to the departed soul. My condolences & concerns for his family & followers. pic.twitter.com/luVFxYLEzJ  As a social worker, Baba Iqbal Singh didn’t restrict himself just to the education sector, he was involved in every facet of community life ie. schools, hospital, colleges, women care centre and de-addiction centres. With his team, he set up Akal Charitable Hospital at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur, which provides medical care to rural poor and other deprived sections of society. Every year, medical camps are organised in which doctors from Mumbai, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab provide free medical care including free surgeries to poor people.Deeply saddened by the demise of social worker & philanthropist Shiromani Panth Rattan, Sardar Baba Iqbal Singh Ji.

As a result, the office of Superintendent Engineer, PWD quality control, has shifted from Dharamsala to Dharampur.The Dharampur Assembly constituency is represented by IPH Minister Mahinder Thakur. The shifting of another office from Kangra district has triggered a war of words. Congress leaders from the area allege discrimination against Kangra while BJP leaders are on the back foot over the issue.AICC secretary RS Bali, said that ever since the BJP had formed government in the state, Kangra district had hardly got any new project. Instead, many government offices and projects had been shifted out of the region. Earlier, the office of Chief Engineer (projects) was shifted from Fatehpur subdivision of Kangra to Mandi.The Mid Himalayan Project of the Forest Department that was to be implemented in Kangra, Hamirpur and Una districts was closed and the offices associated with it were shifted to other regions of the state, Bali alleged.Ajay Mahajan, district president of the Congress, said the government had been giving a step-motherly treatment to Kangra district despite the fact that the BJP has 10 MLAs and three ministers from the district. It is strange that the BJP MLAs and ministers from Kangra were not opposing the government move to shift out government offices from the district. The people of Kangra, which has 15 Assembly segments, would give an apt reply to the BJP in the forthcoming Assembly elections, he added.BJP MLA from Dharamsala Vishal Nehria said that he had taken up the matter with the Chief Minister. “I have been trying to bring in other major projects to Dharamsala but the shifting of office from Dharamsala to Dharampur was unfortunate. I will visit Shimla soon to sort out the matter”, he said.The shifting of Chief Engineer IPH (projects) office from Fatehpur to Mandi was an issue during the recent Fatehpur byelections. Now the shifting of another government office from Dharamsala is likely to generate political heat in Kangra district.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/shifting-of-pwd-office-from-dharamsala-stirs-row-365148

The Planning Department has reportedly refused to provide an additional amount of Rs 25 lakh to meet the escalated costs.Taking no savings pleaA budget provision of Rs 25 crore each was made for 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic sessions for the purpose. The Education Department requires additional funds amounting to Rs 25 lakh to purchase laptops for students of 2019-20 session, as the cost has increased in the past two years.But the department has been asked to scale down the configurations to bare minimum level to manage within the available budget or opt for smartphones as additional allocations were not possible in the absence of any savings.“The Administrative Department, may make appropriate decision at its own level if it wishes to go for distribution/purchase of laptops by revising the cost downwards to make their configuration to bare minimum level required by the students or distribute smartphones instead of laptops within the available resources,” Kultar Singh Rana, Under Secretary, Higher Education, stated in a letter to the Director, Higher Education.A parent, whose son was a student of the 2019-20 session, said it was a matter of concern that in the present era of fast changing Information Technology, the meritorious students would be provided laptops with bare minimum configuration, simply because the government was unable to provide an additional amount of Rs 25 lakh.As many as 19,850 students of 2018-19 and 2019-20 sessions are waiting for laptops as the government could not take a decision regarding their purchase. However, smartphones would be given to about 10,000 meritorious students of 2020-21, for which the tendering process is on, sources in the Education Department said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/distribution-of-laptops-to-students-hangs-fire-365132

The government on Monday extended the period of Covid restrictions and the coaching centres and schools would remain closed till February 1.Sukrit Sagar, who runs a coaching centre in Kangra, says it is ironic that the government has not allowed the coaching centres to open while political gatherings of less than 300 people and marriage partes with 50 per cent capacity in halls are allowed.Shakti Sharma, who gives tuition, says that for the past two years, his centre was lying closed due to the restrictions, ruining the livelihood of many educated youths.Jyoti Mathur, another tutor in Dharamsala, says that the government decision to keep the coaching centres closed is baseless. When the government has announced protocols for marriages and political functions, why similar protocols are not implemented for coaching centres. It seemed that Covid was spreading only through educational institutes, he adds.There are hundreds of youths, who are employed in coaching centres, and their livelihood has been hit. While in the third wave of Covid, the government has kept everything open, the centres continue to remain closed. —                                     #Covid19||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/permission-to-open-coaching-centres-denied-tutors-fume-365113

The measure was supposed to strengthen field enforcement units to check illicit liquor trade, which causes revenue losses to the state exchequer.Even a provision of the World Bank-funded trace and track IT-enabled project, which also figures in the policy, for better regulation of liquor bottling units has not been introduced. The desired targets of the World Bank-funded Himachal Pradesh Public Financial Management Capacity Building Programme for excise have not been achieved. The programme is aimed at digitisation of excise administration, including all liquor manufacturing and bottling plants, by plugging revenue losses. No targets have been achieved till now as per the implementation status and the results report accessed by The Tribune. The state has, therefore, failed to secure the financial aid of more than Rs 5 crore due to tardy implementation.Even restructuring of the department, which includes separation of the excise and GST wings, has been pending for years.More than 100 inspectors and 10 assistant commissioners, who were spared from various inter-state multi-purpose barriers, could have been utilised for the job. The inter-state barriers were discontinued to allow seamless flow of goods after the introduction of the e-way bill system under the GST.                                     #IllicitLiquor||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/illicit-liquor-trade-booming-in-absence-of-excise-policy-365104

The PWD and other government departments, on the direction of the high court, have made the submission of X forms mandatory for the clearance of the bills of the contractors.The X forms are issued by the Mining Department to see whether the sand and gravel used in the construction work was mined legally. The contractors, however, allege that the stone crusher owners do not give them X forms.Navneet said that the contractors had been made a scapegoat. It was the duty of the department and the police to check illegal mining. “We take bills and pay the GST over the material purchased from stone crushers, which we then submit to the department for the clearance of our bills. Why are the contractors being asked to ensure that the material mined is legal when it is the duty of the Mining Department?” he added.He said the contractors had proposed to the government to levy a cess on them for the mined material if it wants more revenue. They should not be harassed for paper work.The issue of non-payment of bills to the contractors was also discussed during the winter session of the Assembly. Congress MLA from Dalhousie Asha Kumari took up their cause and said in Chamba where there were a very few sand and gravel quarries, the contractors were facing additional problems.They had to source material from Punjab and the stone crusher owners there did not issue X forms to them, Asha had stated.The government, however, maintained that the bills were being withheld on the directions of the high court. It would move the court to provide them relief.What is X formX forms are issued by the Mining Department to see whether sand and gravel used in the construction work was mined legally.

Stories of the brave should be preserved, regardless of the time they fought in. If we forget General Zorawar Singh, Victoria Cross winners Lala Ram and Captain Bhandari Ram, it will be akin to forgetting our history,” said Suresh Nadda, the eldest son of the late soldier.Born on July 24, 1919, in Serva Geharwin village of Bilaspur district, Capt Bhandari joined the British army as a sepoy in 1941. As part of the Baluch battalion, he showed extraordinary bravery while fighting the Japanese troops in Burma in 1944, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. After Independence, he was absorbed in the Dogra Regiment. He fought the 1947-48 war against Pakistan, the 1962 war against China and the 1965 war against Pakistan. He retired as an Honorary Captain in 1969.Despite his long and illustrious association with the Army, Nadda feels the country is gradually forgetting him and his family. To substantiate his allegations, he cites the complete lack of communication with the family from the government and the Army after the soldier’s death in 2002. “Until his death, he would receive invitation from the state and Central government for Republic Day and Independence Day functions. However, after his death, the family has been forgotten. There are no invites for any functions, neither from the government, nor from the Army,” he rued.British agencies, on the contrary, continue to be in touch with the family. “He received a lot of respect and honour in England. They invited him every third year with two guests until he was alive. During these visits, he would be called to the Buckingham Palace and various embassies. Even I travelled with him several times on these all-expenses covered visits,” said Nadda, who retired as a manager from the State Bank of India. “Even today, we continue to get courtesy mails and phone calls from England,” he said.Asserting that the family seeks no monetary or other benefits from the government, Nadda said all he wanted was for the identity of his father to be preserved. “There’s not even a statue of my father in the state. There was a link road diverting from the Bilaspur-Hamirpur highway into our village named after him, but that too is gone now due to the fourlaning of the road,” he said.Nadda suggested that war memorials should be built at the district level, where statues of war heroes should be built and their legends should be written down. “Our coming generations should know about these heroes and their valour,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/kin-feel-wwii-heros-legend-not-preserved-365098

The bird counting exercise will be undertaken on January 31.According to Rahul Rahane, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Wildlife Hamirpur, 26 teams comprising two to three members each have been constituted. During the last fortnight arrival of around 90,000 birds of 86 different species was recorded. Final counting exercise was usually undertaken on January 31 every year.1.10 lakh birds visited wetland area last yearInquiries reveal that last year the bird count was 1.10 lakh amid the bird flu outbreak, a dreaded disease which had killed a large number of migratory birds in the wildlife sanctuary in the Pong wetland. This year the wildlife authorities sent birds’ samples for testing after regular intervals to check bird flu but their laboratory reports have been tested negative.The authorities are expecting a rise in the number and species of migratory birds this year. The bird count is likely to cross last year’s number.Migratory birds, coming from Siberia, Mongolia, Tibet, China, Pakistan and Iraq throng the wetland wildlife sanctuary on the onset of every winter making this man-made water body eco-friendly.
