I hope it will attract more people towards learning the art of making Chamba Rumal in Chamba district and across the country,” Lalita Vakil said.Lalita started the work of promoting and preserving the dying art of making Chamba Rumal 50 years ago. “At that time there was no government support for my work. We used to go the Chamba DC for financial support and used to get Rs 15 month after much lobbying. In the last few decades I have travelled extensively across the country and in foreign countries for the promotion of this art,” she said.“I am happy that the state government was now patronising Chamba Rumal art. The students or ladies who learn Chamba Rumal knitting are paid a daily of Rs 300 now by the government. Many centres have also come up that teach the art of knitting Chamba Rumal. I just hope that this art gets linked to the livelihood of women in Chamba district. It was the only way in which traditional art of Chamba district can be preserved,” Lalita added.                                     #PadmaAwards                                     #PadmaShri||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/chamba-artist-lalita-vakil-honoured-with-padma-shri-364402

Employees have started giving their options for the same but it has been brought to my notice that some anomalies existed in the new scale, which will deny them its optimum gain. So apart from the two options, I announce another one so that no employee is bereft of optimum gains of the new pay scale. Also, if any section of employees is unable to reap the benefits of the new pay scale, we can take a decision to re-think on it."The CM also announced that 1,75,000 pensioners will be granted pension on the Punjab pattern which will put a monetary burden of Rs 2,000 crore on the state exchequer."My government recently announced 28 per cent DA on the new pay scale and today I announce 31 per cent DA for the state government employees, which will put a monetary burden of Rs 500 crore on the state exchequer annually."While elaborating on the developmental initiatives, he said the financial eligibility of various social welfare schemes has been enhanced from Rs 35,000 to Rs 50,000 and this will benefit socially and economically weaker sections. About a lakh additional beneficiaries from the poorer section will receive Rs 125 crore through this announcement.In a bid to placate the constable who had raised a banner of revolt, he also announced that constables who have become eligible for pre-revised higher scales would be immediately given so. Detailed directions would soon be issued for its implementation.The CM spared no effort to make the most of this statehood day to appease various sections of the society.He also announced 60 units free power per month to low income group families and domestic users having power utilisation of 125 units per month would be given power at Re 1 per month .

He added that the prolonged closure of schools had badly affected the health and psychology of children.He said that parents were mounting pressure on private school managements to reopen their institutions as their wards were facing eyesight and psychological problems while attending online classes at home and using mobile phones for hours.Gulshan said that recently, World Bank’s Global Education Director Jaime Saavedra had claimed that there was no justification in keeping schools closed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Saavedra, whose team has been tracking the impact of Covid-19 on the education sector, states that there is no evidence that the reopening of schools caused a surge in Covid cases,” he added.When the government had allowed hassle-free entry of tourists, besides allowing public transport, bars, restaurants, there was no justification in keeping schools closed for such a long time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/assn-urges-govt-to-reopen-schools-364154

They were also on the run since January 19.Paid Rs10K rentAdditional SP, Baddi, Narinder Kumar said that the police teams visited their residences but could not find them. Even their family members had no knowledge about this nefarious work or their whereabouts.Gurdev, who hails from Swarghat, had constructed a new house and he did not even turn up during its inaugural ceremony, according to his family members, said the police.Since the plant was raided at the instance of Gaurav Manhas, alias Goru, who is the kingpin of the spurious liquor trade, various police teams had been constituted to trace his whereabouts in the state and outside.The police had seized a cache of 39 drums, 47 empty VRV cartons, 4,500 empty bottles and other incriminating material from Gujarhatti on Friday evening.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/illegal-bottling-plant-accused-still-elusive-364143
25-01-2022||Ambika Sharma||Trace and track system to check illicit liquor trade||Solan, January 24Extra neutral alcohol (ENA) from bottling and manufacturing plants is finding way to illegal markets, given the scale of the illegal liquor trade unearthed by the Special Investigation Team (SIT).ENA is the raw material used to manufacture alcohol and cases have come to light where its stock was either found missing or excess stock than permitted was found at the plants.This was despite the fact that a factory inspector is permanently posted at such plants to monitor its working.As much as 11,000 bulk litres of ENA was found missing from the stock of a Jogindernagar-based bottling plant in Mandi district on January 18 during a surprise inspection conducted by the State Taxes and Excise Department (STED). This was exactly a day before the hooch tragedy led to the death of seven persons in Sundernagar.A liquor factory Yamuna Beverages Private Limited (YBPL) in Paonta Sahib was sealed in July 2021 after 13,802 litres ENA was found stocked without permit. As many as 5,155 cases of country liquor could have been manufactured using it.It was allowed to function after it requested to use its legal ENA stock.The working of the department was again brought under the scanner after the Una unit of the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau seized 900 boxes of country-made liquor which were being transported without permit.Officials said the ENA was often pilfered in drums during its transportation and sold in illegal markets. Its crude mixing under unhygienic conditions in chemical-laced drums alters its composition in illegal factories like the one unearthed in Nalagarh on Friday evening.Commissioner, STED, Yunus said to tighten the noose around the units, a trace and track system would be introduced.An inspector posted at Goverdhan Bottling at Gallu in Jogindernagar was placed under suspension and the plant’s licence was suspended today following irregularities during inspection where 11,000 bulk litres of ENA was detected on January 18.He added that the factory inspector of the YBPL had been suspended while an inquiry was underway in the liquor haul seized by the Vigilance.It was, however, shocking that the inquiry had failed to conclude even three months after the case came to fore. The official in Sirmaur had also sought a no-objection certificate from the Vigilance to re-start the factory.The Commissioner also said the licence of KM Distillery at Parwanoo had been suspended in December. The police had seized 700 boxes of country liquor, transported illegally in a truck , from KM Distillery in April last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/trace-and-track-system-to-check-illicit-liquor-trade-364140

He was married to Mohini Devi. The couple had no child.Mohini Devi told The Tribune, “My husband drove the vehicle of Bose and was considered his close aide.”“During the freedom struggle, my husband was tortured and was kept in prison at several locations, including Burma, currently known as Myanmar, by the British during 1942 to 1946. In prison, he, along with other freedom fighters, had dug out a tunnel with bare hands to escape from the prison. He, along with his comrades, escaped from the prison and reached India,” she added.Prakash Chand Thakur, the nephew of the freedom fighter, said, “After Independence, he worked on an Indo-German project in Mandi. Later he was appointed as an operator for the construction of Pandoh dam. During construction on October 8, 1974, a boulder from a hill hit him, killing him on the spot. His name was inked on the list of the martyrs of the Pandoh dam in Mandi.”“In 1972 Mool Raj was awarded Tamra Patra by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for his contribution to the freedom struggle,” he added.He said, “Earlier, the district administration had used to invite the family on the functions of Republic Day and Independence Day but for the past few years, we have not been invited.”                                     #freedomfighter                                     #NetajiSubhasChandraBose||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/family-of-ina-veteran-awaits-road-to-house-364137

I hope it will attract more people towards learning the art of making Chamba Rumal in Chamba district and across the country,” Lalita Vakil said.Lalita started the work of promoting and preserving the dying art of making Chamba Rumal 50 years ago. “At that time there was no government support for my work. We used to go the Chamba DC for financial support and used to get Rs 15 month after much lobbying. In the last few decades I have travelled extensively across the country and in foreign countries for the promotion of this art,” she said.“I am happy that the state government was now patronising Chamba Rumal art. The students or ladies who learn Chamba Rumal knitting are paid a daily of Rs 300 now by the government. Many centres have also come up that teach the art of knitting Chamba Rumal. I just hope that this art gets linked to the livelihood of women in Chamba district. It was the only way in which traditional art of Chamba district can be preserved,” Lalita added.                                     #PadmaAwards                                     #PadmaShri||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/chamba-artist-lalita-vakil-honoured-with-padma-shri-364402

He added that the prolonged closure of schools had badly affected the health and psychology of children.He said that parents were mounting pressure on private school managements to reopen their institutions as their wards were facing eyesight and psychological problems while attending online classes at home and using mobile phones for hours.Gulshan said that recently, World Bank’s Global Education Director Jaime Saavedra had claimed that there was no justification in keeping schools closed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Saavedra, whose team has been tracking the impact of Covid-19 on the education sector, states that there is no evidence that the reopening of schools caused a surge in Covid cases,” he added.When the government had allowed hassle-free entry of tourists, besides allowing public transport, bars, restaurants, there was no justification in keeping schools closed for such a long time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/assn-urges-govt-to-reopen-schools-364154

They were also on the run since January 19.Paid Rs10K rentAdditional SP, Baddi, Narinder Kumar said that the police teams visited their residences but could not find them. Even their family members had no knowledge about this nefarious work or their whereabouts.Gurdev, who hails from Swarghat, had constructed a new house and he did not even turn up during its inaugural ceremony, according to his family members, said the police.Since the plant was raided at the instance of Gaurav Manhas, alias Goru, who is the kingpin of the spurious liquor trade, various police teams had been constituted to trace his whereabouts in the state and outside.The police had seized a cache of 39 drums, 47 empty VRV cartons, 4,500 empty bottles and other incriminating material from Gujarhatti on Friday evening.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/illegal-bottling-plant-accused-still-elusive-364143
25-01-2022||Ambika Sharma||Trace and track system to check illicit liquor trade||Solan, January 24Extra neutral alcohol (ENA) from bottling and manufacturing plants is finding way to illegal markets, given the scale of the illegal liquor trade unearthed by the Special Investigation Team (SIT).ENA is the raw material used to manufacture alcohol and cases have come to light where its stock was either found missing or excess stock than permitted was found at the plants.This was despite the fact that a factory inspector is permanently posted at such plants to monitor its working.As much as 11,000 bulk litres of ENA was found missing from the stock of a Jogindernagar-based bottling plant in Mandi district on January 18 during a surprise inspection conducted by the State Taxes and Excise Department (STED). This was exactly a day before the hooch tragedy led to the death of seven persons in Sundernagar.A liquor factory Yamuna Beverages Private Limited (YBPL) in Paonta Sahib was sealed in July 2021 after 13,802 litres ENA was found stocked without permit. As many as 5,155 cases of country liquor could have been manufactured using it.It was allowed to function after it requested to use its legal ENA stock.The working of the department was again brought under the scanner after the Una unit of the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau seized 900 boxes of country-made liquor which were being transported without permit.Officials said the ENA was often pilfered in drums during its transportation and sold in illegal markets. Its crude mixing under unhygienic conditions in chemical-laced drums alters its composition in illegal factories like the one unearthed in Nalagarh on Friday evening.Commissioner, STED, Yunus said to tighten the noose around the units, a trace and track system would be introduced.An inspector posted at Goverdhan Bottling at Gallu in Jogindernagar was placed under suspension and the plant’s licence was suspended today following irregularities during inspection where 11,000 bulk litres of ENA was detected on January 18.He added that the factory inspector of the YBPL had been suspended while an inquiry was underway in the liquor haul seized by the Vigilance.It was, however, shocking that the inquiry had failed to conclude even three months after the case came to fore. The official in Sirmaur had also sought a no-objection certificate from the Vigilance to re-start the factory.The Commissioner also said the licence of KM Distillery at Parwanoo had been suspended in December. The police had seized 700 boxes of country liquor, transported illegally in a truck , from KM Distillery in April last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/trace-and-track-system-to-check-illicit-liquor-trade-364140

He was married to Mohini Devi. The couple had no child.Mohini Devi told The Tribune, “My husband drove the vehicle of Bose and was considered his close aide.”“During the freedom struggle, my husband was tortured and was kept in prison at several locations, including Burma, currently known as Myanmar, by the British during 1942 to 1946. In prison, he, along with other freedom fighters, had dug out a tunnel with bare hands to escape from the prison. He, along with his comrades, escaped from the prison and reached India,” she added.Prakash Chand Thakur, the nephew of the freedom fighter, said, “After Independence, he worked on an Indo-German project in Mandi. Later he was appointed as an operator for the construction of Pandoh dam. During construction on October 8, 1974, a boulder from a hill hit him, killing him on the spot. His name was inked on the list of the martyrs of the Pandoh dam in Mandi.”“In 1972 Mool Raj was awarded Tamra Patra by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for his contribution to the freedom struggle,” he added.He said, “Earlier, the district administration had used to invite the family on the functions of Republic Day and Independence Day but for the past few years, we have not been invited.”                                     #freedomfighter                                     #NetajiSubhasChandraBose||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/family-of-ina-veteran-awaits-road-to-house-364137

It will also provide sufficient evidence to crack blind cases. — Sanjay Kundu, DGPAs many as 4,048 CCTV cameras were installed last year and their total number as on December 31, 2021, was 27,890. The requirement is to install 54,790 CCTV cameras to meet the target (saturation point), but we will surpass it by installing additional 13,000 cameras. In total, 67,000 CCTV cameras will be installed,” said DGP Sanjay Kundu while talking to The Tribune here today.The third eye (CCTV cameras) would be installed in all vulnerable and strategic locations, besides, inter-state and inter-district borders, temples, important offices, police stations, educational institutions, areas prone to illegal mining, markets, railway station, taxi stands, bus stop and main squares.“The Deputy Commissioners of all districts have been requested to release funds for the installation of CCTV cameras. Money is also being sought from temple trusts, mining fund, road safety fund and a few other departments,” he said.Business establishments, hotels, industries, training institutes, shops and other institutions were being persuaded to set up CCTV cameras under the public private partnership mode, he added.Kundu said, “The integration of CCTV cameras, automatic number plate recorder (ANPR) cameras and body cameras will help in reducing crime, maintaining law and order, and keeping a vigil on anti-social elements. It will also provide sufficient evidence to crack blind cases”.“We have the example of Baddi where crime has reduced by 30 per cent and the recovery rate of stolen property has shot up to 100 per cent after the introduction of evidence-based policing and governance with the CCTV surveillance matrix,” the DGP said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/26-900-more-cctv-cameras-to-be-installed-by-2025-dgp-364118
