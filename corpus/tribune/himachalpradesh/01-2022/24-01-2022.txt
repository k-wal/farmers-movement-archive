In a statement issued here today, he said this was being done despite the fact that illicit liquor had killed more than half a dozen persons in the CM’s home district.Agnihotri said governments need to act against mafia, irrespective of the latter’s political affiliations. He said the Congress party was very clear saying that all types of mafia, including liquor, land, mining and drugs, was thriving in the state during the last four years and no action was being taken against them.MAFIA THRIVINGThe governments need to act against mafia, irrespective of the latter’s political affiliations. All types of mafia, including liquor, land, mining and drugs, is thriving in the state and no action is being taken against them. —Mukesh Agnihotri, Leader of oppositionReferring to Jai Ram Thakur’s hint of a Congress leader’s role in protecting the illicit liquor accused, Agnihotri dared the Chief Minister to reveal the name of the Congress leader. He accused the Chief Minister of misleading the people of the state on the failures of his own government. He reiterated the Congress demand of a strict action against the liquor mafia which had blatantly percolated on to the streets and in the households.The Congress leader said the price of a bag of cement had crossed Rs 450, which was about Rs 280 during the Congress rule. Industrialists were shying away from setting up units in the state and health infrastructure was paralysed. The cost of electricity had gone up sharply and the government had failed to address the employment needs of the youth who had returned back to their homes during the pandemic.Replying to Jai Ram Thakur’s remarks of a huge divide in the Congress leadership in Himachal Pradesh, Agnihotri said the Chief Minister should stop worrying about the Congress. “Jai Ram Thakur is a Chief Minister by proxy and his time is running out”, he said, adding that even the BJP knows the people of the state have made up their mind to see the back of the ruling party in the coming elections.Agnihotri said despite slogans of a ‘double engine’ development model with BJP governments at the Centre and the state, there has no big investment by the Centre in Himachal Pradesh during the last four years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/agnihotri-accuses-bjp-govt-of-shielding-liquor-mafia-363876

This has paved the way for transfer of forestlands on which houses of Pong Dam oustees are located in their name.The landless Pong Dam oustees have been living without any land in their names. They were deprived of all facilities, including water and power connections in many cases, due to erroneous entries in revenue records.Deputy Commissioner Kangra, Nipun Jindal said the cases of 124 landless Pong Dam oustees have been referred to Settlement Office for correcting entries in revenue record in which the land on which houses of these oustees were located were declared forest land. This would make the landless oustees owners of the land on which their houses were located. While 124 cases have already been referred to Settlement Office some more have applied and their cases were being examined, he said.Most of the landless oustees of Pong Dam were farm labourers who were settled on common land of villages along Pong Dam lake. When the Pong Dam was constructed their houses were submerged in Pong Dam lake. They then shifted to upper areas and settled on common lands of their villages. In 1980s the state government converted all common lands into forestlands in revenue records.The revenue officials at that point of time without carrying any ground level survey, converted entire common lands in the state to forest land in revenue papers. This was done despite the fact that people were settled on the land. The residents of villages, who were settled on common lands, became encroachers on forest lands after that and were deprived of all facilities including power and water connections.The district administration of Kangra initiated the process of correcting the revenue entries and the error in transferring houses of the oustees into forest land after the issue was highlighted by The Tribune.Sources here said that similar cases in which houses of people settled on common lands being converted into forestland have cropped up in other areas of the district also. In many villages such as Khaiara near Dharamsala, many SCs in the village were settled on common land of the village. After the entire common land was converted into forestland the people, who had settled on common lands, have become encroachers on forest lands and have been facing action from forest department. Many residents of Himachal who were settled here for generations have been deprived of their rights as the common lands in the state were converted into forest lands.The officials in the revenue department said that though the district administration has initiated the process of revenue corrections for Pong Dam oustees, the state government should take call on similar exercise for resident residents settled on common lands converted into forest lands.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/cases-of-124-landless-oustees-forwarded-for-settlement-363874

24-01-2022||Subhash Rajta||3-4 ft snow in January to pave way for bumper apple crop in Himachal||Shimla, January 23Abundant snowfall in January has brought a smile on the faces of apple growers. The orchards above 7,000 feet have received 3-4 feet snow this month, paving the way for a good crop this season.“We haven’t seen such a good snowfall in the month of January over the last 3-4 years. The snowfall from December 15 to January 30 is like gold dust for apple,” said Lokinder Bisht, an orchardist from Rohru. Aurobindo Bhinta, an orchardist from Baghi, agrees. “We have had much of snowfall in the month of February over the last few years. Having such a good snowfall in January is a great start to the coming season,” he said.Experts, too, believe that the snowfall in December and January is much more beneficial to apple than the February and March snow. “As the duration of sunlight is less in December and January compared to February and March, the snow takes time to melt,” said SP Bhardwaj, a horticulture expert.“The gradual melting of snow keeps the temperatures low, which helps in providing the required chilling hours to the plant. Also, the slow melting ensures retention of moisture over a longer period of time, which is a critical factor in determining the crop,” said Bhardwaj. He said the moisture helps nutrients dissolve nicely into the soil and the plants get good nutrition in active season. “When plants get good amount of nutrients, it will result in good bloom, which will ensure good setting and good fruit,” said Bhardwaj.Besides, most orchardists believe if there is a good snowfall in January, the chances of hailstorm at the time of flowering will reduce. During the last season, orchardists sustained damages due to hailstorm and snowfall in the late April. “With abundant snowfall in January, there’s less likelihood of hailstorm at the time of bud swelling and flowering in March and April,” said Bisht.                                     #Himachalapples||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/3-4-ft-snow-in-january-to-pave-way-for-bumper-apple-crop-363861

In a statement issued here today, he said this was being done despite the fact that illicit liquor had killed more than half a dozen persons in the CM’s home district.Agnihotri said governments need to act against mafia, irrespective of the latter’s political affiliations. He said the Congress party was very clear saying that all types of mafia, including liquor, land, mining and drugs, was thriving in the state during the last four years and no action was being taken against them.MAFIA THRIVINGThe governments need to act against mafia, irrespective of the latter’s political affiliations. All types of mafia, including liquor, land, mining and drugs, is thriving in the state and no action is being taken against them. —Mukesh Agnihotri, Leader of oppositionReferring to Jai Ram Thakur’s hint of a Congress leader’s role in protecting the illicit liquor accused, Agnihotri dared the Chief Minister to reveal the name of the Congress leader. He accused the Chief Minister of misleading the people of the state on the failures of his own government. He reiterated the Congress demand of a strict action against the liquor mafia which had blatantly percolated on to the streets and in the households.The Congress leader said the price of a bag of cement had crossed Rs 450, which was about Rs 280 during the Congress rule. Industrialists were shying away from setting up units in the state and health infrastructure was paralysed. The cost of electricity had gone up sharply and the government had failed to address the employment needs of the youth who had returned back to their homes during the pandemic.Replying to Jai Ram Thakur’s remarks of a huge divide in the Congress leadership in Himachal Pradesh, Agnihotri said the Chief Minister should stop worrying about the Congress. “Jai Ram Thakur is a Chief Minister by proxy and his time is running out”, he said, adding that even the BJP knows the people of the state have made up their mind to see the back of the ruling party in the coming elections.Agnihotri said despite slogans of a ‘double engine’ development model with BJP governments at the Centre and the state, there has no big investment by the Centre in Himachal Pradesh during the last four years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/agnihotri-accuses-bjp-govt-of-shielding-liquor-mafia-363876

This has paved the way for transfer of forestlands on which houses of Pong Dam oustees are located in their name.The landless Pong Dam oustees have been living without any land in their names. They were deprived of all facilities, including water and power connections in many cases, due to erroneous entries in revenue records.Deputy Commissioner Kangra, Nipun Jindal said the cases of 124 landless Pong Dam oustees have been referred to Settlement Office for correcting entries in revenue record in which the land on which houses of these oustees were located were declared forest land. This would make the landless oustees owners of the land on which their houses were located. While 124 cases have already been referred to Settlement Office some more have applied and their cases were being examined, he said.Most of the landless oustees of Pong Dam were farm labourers who were settled on common land of villages along Pong Dam lake. When the Pong Dam was constructed their houses were submerged in Pong Dam lake. They then shifted to upper areas and settled on common lands of their villages. In 1980s the state government converted all common lands into forestlands in revenue records.The revenue officials at that point of time without carrying any ground level survey, converted entire common lands in the state to forest land in revenue papers. This was done despite the fact that people were settled on the land. The residents of villages, who were settled on common lands, became encroachers on forest lands after that and were deprived of all facilities including power and water connections.The district administration of Kangra initiated the process of correcting the revenue entries and the error in transferring houses of the oustees into forest land after the issue was highlighted by The Tribune.Sources here said that similar cases in which houses of people settled on common lands being converted into forestland have cropped up in other areas of the district also. In many villages such as Khaiara near Dharamsala, many SCs in the village were settled on common land of the village. After the entire common land was converted into forestland the people, who had settled on common lands, have become encroachers on forest lands and have been facing action from forest department. Many residents of Himachal who were settled here for generations have been deprived of their rights as the common lands in the state were converted into forest lands.The officials in the revenue department said that though the district administration has initiated the process of revenue corrections for Pong Dam oustees, the state government should take call on similar exercise for resident residents settled on common lands converted into forest lands.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/cases-of-124-landless-oustees-forwarded-for-settlement-363874

24-01-2022||Subhash Rajta||3-4 ft snow in January to pave way for bumper apple crop in Himachal||Shimla, January 23Abundant snowfall in January has brought a smile on the faces of apple growers. The orchards above 7,000 feet have received 3-4 feet snow this month, paving the way for a good crop this season.“We haven’t seen such a good snowfall in the month of January over the last 3-4 years. The snowfall from December 15 to January 30 is like gold dust for apple,” said Lokinder Bisht, an orchardist from Rohru. Aurobindo Bhinta, an orchardist from Baghi, agrees. “We have had much of snowfall in the month of February over the last few years. Having such a good snowfall in January is a great start to the coming season,” he said.Experts, too, believe that the snowfall in December and January is much more beneficial to apple than the February and March snow. “As the duration of sunlight is less in December and January compared to February and March, the snow takes time to melt,” said SP Bhardwaj, a horticulture expert.“The gradual melting of snow keeps the temperatures low, which helps in providing the required chilling hours to the plant. Also, the slow melting ensures retention of moisture over a longer period of time, which is a critical factor in determining the crop,” said Bhardwaj. He said the moisture helps nutrients dissolve nicely into the soil and the plants get good nutrition in active season. “When plants get good amount of nutrients, it will result in good bloom, which will ensure good setting and good fruit,” said Bhardwaj.Besides, most orchardists believe if there is a good snowfall in January, the chances of hailstorm at the time of flowering will reduce. During the last season, orchardists sustained damages due to hailstorm and snowfall in the late April. “With abundant snowfall in January, there’s less likelihood of hailstorm at the time of bud swelling and flowering in March and April,” said Bisht.                                     #Himachalapples||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/3-4-ft-snow-in-january-to-pave-way-for-bumper-apple-crop-363861
