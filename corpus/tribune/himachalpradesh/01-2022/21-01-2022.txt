Besides, as per law, no land could be leased without public hearing.Villagers said mining would result in large-scale environmental degradation besides causing damage to village roads, water channels, cremation ground, local paths, water supply schemes and bridges.The people assembled on the Palampur-Hamirpur highway near Thural to lodge their protest and threatened to hold a dharna if the government moved ahead with the decision. They also requested local MLA Vipin Singh Parmar to intervene in the matter.The SDM said the memorandum would be forwarded to the higher authorities.

The findings of the research team were published in the journal ‘Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics’ recently.The petals of the Himalayan ‘buransh’ (rhododendron arboreum) plant are consumed in various forms by the local population for its varied health benefits. The scientists of the IIT, Mandi, and the ICGEB carried out scientific tests on the extracts of buransh petals containing various phytochemicals, with particular focus on antiviral activity.The researchers showed through experimental assays that non-toxic doses of the petal extracts can inhibit Covid in Vero E6 cells (cells derived from kidney of an African green monkey that are commonly used to study infectivity of virus and bacteria), without any adverse effects on the cells themselves.The research was led by Dr Shyam Kumar Masakapalli, Associate Professor, BioX Centre, School of Basic Science, IIT, Mandi; Dr Ranjan Nanda, Translational Health Group; and Dr Sujatha Sunil, Vector Borne Disease Group, ICGEB, New Delhi. The paper has been co-authored by Dr Maneesh Lingwan, Shagun, Falak Pahwa, Ankit Kumar, Dileep Kumar Verma, Yogesh Pant, Lingarao VK Kamatam and Bandna Kumari.Dr Masakapalli says, “Among different types of therapeutic agents being studied, phytochemicals are considered particularly promising because of their synergistic activity and natural source with fewer toxicity issues. We are hunting for promising molecules from the Himalayan flora using multi-disciplinary approaches.”Dr Nanda says, “We have profiled and investigated the phytochemicals of rhododendron petals sourced from Himalayan flora and have found it to be a promising candidate against the Covid virus.”                                     #Buransh                                     #IITMandi                                     #study||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himalayan-buransh-can-help-treat-covid-iit-mandi-study-363082

He served in the Armed Force Guard of the British army and took part in the World War II.He then joined the Indian National Army (INA). However, the veteran’s services got no government recognition even as he passed away in July 1988. The government did not extend any financial assistance even for his last rites, his family laments.The INA veteran had five sons. The eldest, Yashpal Singh Pathania (76), told The Tribune that his father was taken as Prisoner of War (PoW) in 1942 by Germany. “As a PoW, he languished in jails for around three years. After he was released, he came in contact with Netaji Subhas Chander Bose and joined the INA. He also took part in the freedom movement led by Bose,” he said.On the 25th anniversary of Independence, he was honoured with ‘Tamrapatra’ by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.Yashpal said the government should recognise his father’s services. “A memorial gate should be build in his memory in my father’s native village or a road should be named after him so that his services can be cherished,” he said.Abhishek Pathania, Munshi Singh’s grandson, said the government should assist the kin of freedom fighters by giving them preference in government jobs. Also, low-interest loans should be extended to encourage them to seek self-employment opportunities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/ina-veterans-family-rues-lack-of-aid-recognition-363080

The two districts have an abundant production of stone fruits such as apricot, plum and peach, spices such as ginger and garlic, and mushroom.“In Solan district, the Industries Department have sanctioned three projects for processing mushrooms under this scheme, though 15 applications were received,” says Ashok Gautam, who looks after the ODOP scheme, District Industries Centre, Solan.He says that the process to sanction more units is underway, including a Rs 29-lakh facility at Manju in Arki subdivision and two others at Basal and Solan.Mushroom growers in Solan, acclaimed as the Mushroom City of India, however, resents that the lack of facilitation by the government has hit their prospects. “No compost unit has been set up after the closure of the earlier one, the land of which was acquired for the widening of the national highway at Chambaghat. Buying a bag of compost from other states costs Rs 100 as while it is locally available at Rs 65. This has made cultivation unviable,” a grower says.In Sirmaur district, little enthusiasm has been witnessed for the scheme, which offers a maximum subsidy of Rs 10 lakh or 35 per cent of the project cost.“Efforts to tie up with leading brands for garlic and ginger paste have failed to yield results, as they offer little to a grower,” another official says.

All three main government hospitals, namely Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital (IGMC), Kamla Nehru Hospital (KNH) and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (DDUH), have seen a worryingly high number of staff catching the infection over the last one week or so.Simultaneous infectionIt’s the first time during the pandemic that so many staff have caught the infection simultaneously. — Dr Surinder Singh, IGMC PrincipalIGMC worst hitWhile over 50 doctors, 75 nurses and 40 class IV employees have tested positive at the IGMC over the last one week, the count at KNH and DDU stands at 25 and 37, respectively.While over 50 doctors, 75 nurses and 40 class IV employees have tested positive at the IGMC over the last one week, the count at KNH and DDU stands at 25 and 37, respectively.IGMC principal Dr Surinder Singh said that the hospital had managed to render smooth services so far to the patients. However, he feared the situation could become a little problematic if the virus continued to infect the staff at this rate.“In that case, we will have to reassess and see what measures are required to be taken,” he said.The silver lining, however, is that none of the healthcare workers in all three hospitals has shown severe symptoms and are hence not hospitalized. “Also, the infected staff is reporting back on duty after seven days, which was not the case in the earlier two waves. That’s making the situation a little better for us,” said Dr Singh.Meanwhile the KNH, state hospital for mother and child, is struggling to cope with the situation. The hospital was already short on nursing staff and the absence of 16 staff nurses for at least a week has worsened the situation. “We have cut down routine surgeries, but we haven’t allowed emergency services to get affected,” said KNH MS Dr Ravinder Mokta.At DDUH, eight doctors are among the 37 staff which tested positive over the last week or so. “At the moment the patient load is less in the hospital, so this spurt hasn’t affected our services,” said DDUH Dr Lokinder Sharma. “Nevertheless, people need to strictly follow Covid appropriate behavior,” he said.                                     #DDUH                                     #IGMC                                     #KamlaNehruHospital||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/surging-covid-cases-hit-shimla-hospitals-hard-363059

In fact, the state had proposed to the Centre a ropeway scheme funded centrally on the pattern of Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). “Over 50 per cent of rural roads in Himachal have been built under the PMGSY. If a similar scheme is launched for ropeways, it will help improve connectivity in remote areas. It’s an eco-friendly mode and may even prove cost-effective compared to roads,” he said.Relief for school Board pensionersThe CM said it was on his persuasion that the Centre had established a ropeways corporation. “Detailed project reports will soon be prepared for ropeways in different parts of the state. Already, a project in Mandi has reached tender stage,” he said.On expanding Gaggal airport, he said for this, the Pathankot-Mandi four-lane highway needed to be realigned and the matter had been taken up with the National Highways Authority of India. About Mandi international airport, he said an MoU would soon be signed between the Airports Authority of India and the Himachal Government.

The findings of the research team were published in the journal ‘Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics’ recently.The petals of the Himalayan ‘buransh’ (rhododendron arboreum) plant are consumed in various forms by the local population for its varied health benefits. The scientists of the IIT, Mandi, and the ICGEB carried out scientific tests on the extracts of buransh petals containing various phytochemicals, with particular focus on antiviral activity.The researchers showed through experimental assays that non-toxic doses of the petal extracts can inhibit Covid in Vero E6 cells (cells derived from kidney of an African green monkey that are commonly used to study infectivity of virus and bacteria), without any adverse effects on the cells themselves.The research was led by Dr Shyam Kumar Masakapalli, Associate Professor, BioX Centre, School of Basic Science, IIT, Mandi; Dr Ranjan Nanda, Translational Health Group; and Dr Sujatha Sunil, Vector Borne Disease Group, ICGEB, New Delhi. The paper has been co-authored by Dr Maneesh Lingwan, Shagun, Falak Pahwa, Ankit Kumar, Dileep Kumar Verma, Yogesh Pant, Lingarao VK Kamatam and Bandna Kumari.Dr Masakapalli says, “Among different types of therapeutic agents being studied, phytochemicals are considered particularly promising because of their synergistic activity and natural source with fewer toxicity issues. We are hunting for promising molecules from the Himalayan flora using multi-disciplinary approaches.”Dr Nanda says, “We have profiled and investigated the phytochemicals of rhododendron petals sourced from Himalayan flora and have found it to be a promising candidate against the Covid virus.”                                     #Buransh                                     #IITMandi                                     #study||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himalayan-buransh-can-help-treat-covid-iit-mandi-study-363082

He also took part in the freedom movement led by Bose,” he said.On the 25th anniversary of Independence, he was honoured with ‘Tamrapatra’ by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.Yashpal said the government should recognise his father’s services. “A memorial gate should be build in his memory in my father’s native village or a road should be named after him so that his services can be cherished,” he said.Abhishek Pathania, Munshi Singh’s grandson, said the government should assist the kin of freedom fighters by giving them preference in government jobs.

Later, a team headed by Tikkam Thakur, Deputy Commissioner, Excise and Taxation Department, along with the police reached the bottling plant and took the entire stock of liquor in its possession. The sale and supply of liquor from the plant were also stopped.Later, several teams of the Excise Department along with the police inspected and verified the liquor stocks lying with wholesalers in the district to trace the brand seized in Sundernagar. Besides, retail liquor shops were also inspected at various places.Vivek Mahajan, Joint Commissioner, Excise and Taxation (North Zone), told The Tribune that the search operation was still going on at various places. “The department team is still inside the bottling plant. However, the brand of spurious liquor supplied in Sundernagar by the mafia has not been recovered so far. The spurious liquor seized in Sundernagar carried the batch number of August 2021,” he said.According to sources, liquor is being illegally supplied to different districts of the state from Chandigarh and Punjab for the past few years. The mafia is supplying liquor on the doorsteps of people at a cheaper price than available at official vends. It is also luring roadside dhabas and tea stalls. The police and the Excise Department are aware of the illegal trade but they have failed to act against the mafia.An excise contractor said that the mafia was supplying liquor at half the price at which it was sold at officially allowed shops. He added because of the illegal sale of liquor their businesses had been hit hard in the past two years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/liquor-bottling-plant-at-palampur-inspected-363068

The two districts have an abundant production of stone fruits such as apricot, plum and peach, spices such as ginger and garlic, and mushroom.“In Solan district, the Industries Department have sanctioned three projects for processing mushrooms under this scheme, though 15 applications were received,” says Ashok Gautam, who looks after the ODOP scheme, District Industries Centre, Solan.He says that the process to sanction more units is underway, including a Rs 29-lakh facility at Manju in Arki subdivision and two others at Basal and Solan.Mushroom growers in Solan, acclaimed as the Mushroom City of India, however, resents that the lack of facilitation by the government has hit their prospects. “No compost unit has been set up after the closure of the earlier one, the land of which was acquired for the widening of the national highway at Chambaghat. Buying a bag of compost from other states costs Rs 100 as while it is locally available at Rs 65. This has made cultivation unviable,” a grower says.In Sirmaur district, little enthusiasm has been witnessed for the scheme, which offers a maximum subsidy of Rs 10 lakh or 35 per cent of the project cost.“Efforts to tie up with leading brands for garlic and ginger paste have failed to yield results, as they offer little to a grower,” another official says. Though successive state governments have announced to set up apple processing plants in Solan as a poll promise, little has been done.                                     #Governmentscheme                                     #ODOP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/one-district-one-product-scheme-makes-little-headway-363064

As a result, patients have to go to private hospitals for ultrasound tests.Earlier, there were two radiologists here but since November, the posts were lying vacant. Patients allege that they have to pay a hefty amount to get the test done at private facilities in the absence of ultrasound facility here.Posts of pharmacist, physio also vacant Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Naresh says that all 37 posts of medical officer are filled. If a radiologist is deputed, a medical officer will have to be transferred. The authorities concerned have been informed about the vacant and required posts at the hospital.The hospital caters to the residents of Kullu, Lahaul and some parts of Mandi district. As many as 21 posts of paramedical staff, including lab technicians, are vacant here. There are 178 sanctioned posts in the hospital and 157 of them are occupied.Of the nine sanctioned posts of senior lab technician, three are vacant for a long time due to which some tests could not be conducted at the laboratory on the hospital premises. Also, one post of pharmacist, one post of physiotherapist, five posts of cleaner, one post of Class-IV employee and three posts of driver are also vacant.The 300-bed hospital receives around 450 patients at the OPDs of orthopaedics, gynaecology, paediatrics, ENT and other departments every day.Local residents say they have urged the state government to provide a radiologist so that patients can utilise the ultrasound facility available at the hospital. Other vacant posts should also be filled on priority to ensure better health facilities.                                     #Hospital                                     #RadiologistVacancyinKullu||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/kullu-hospital-sans-radiologist-for-2-months-363060
21-01-2022||Subhash Rajta||Surging Covid cases hit Shimla hospitals hard||Shimla, January 20Sudden spurt in Covid cases over the last 10 days is threatening to disrupt services in Shimla hospitals. All three main government hospitals, namely Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital (IGMC), Kamla Nehru Hospital (KNH) and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (DDUH), have seen a worryingly high number of staff catching the infection over the last one week or so.Simultaneous infectionIt’s the first time during the pandemic that so many staff have caught the infection simultaneously. — Dr Surinder Singh, IGMC PrincipalIGMC worst hitWhile over 50 doctors, 75 nurses and 40 class IV employees have tested positive at the IGMC over the last one week, the count at KNH and DDU stands at 25 and 37, respectively.While over 50 doctors, 75 nurses and 40 class IV employees have tested positive at the IGMC over the last one week, the count at KNH and DDU stands at 25 and 37, respectively.IGMC principal Dr Surinder Singh said that the hospital had managed to render smooth services so far to the patients. However, he feared the situation could become a little problematic if the virus continued to infect the staff at this rate.“In that case, we will have to reassess and see what measures are required to be taken,” he said.The silver lining, however, is that none of the healthcare workers in all three hospitals has shown severe symptoms and are hence not hospitalized. “Also, the infected staff is reporting back on duty after seven days, which was not the case in the earlier two waves. That’s making the situation a little better for us,” said Dr Singh.Meanwhile the KNH, state hospital for mother and child, is struggling to cope with the situation. The hospital was already short on nursing staff and the absence of 16 staff nurses for at least a week has worsened the situation. “We have cut down routine surgeries, but we haven’t allowed emergency services to get affected,” said KNH MS Dr Ravinder Mokta.At DDUH, eight doctors are among the 37 staff which tested positive over the last week or so. “At the moment the patient load is less in the hospital, so this spurt hasn’t affected our services,” said DDUH Dr Lokinder Sharma. “Nevertheless, people need to strictly follow Covid appropriate behavior,” he said.                                     #DDUH                                     #IGMC                                     #KamlaNehruHospital||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/surging-covid-cases-hit-shimla-hospitals-hard-363059
21-01-2022||Lalit Mohan||Himachal to go in for more ropeways, says CM Thakur||Dharamsala, January 20The Himachal Pradesh Government would push for building more ropeways for public transport, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said here today.In an interview with The Tribune, Thakur said he had raised the matter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as the Union ministries of Surface Transport and Finance. In fact, the state had proposed to the Centre a ropeway scheme funded centrally on the pattern of Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). “Over 50 per cent of rural roads in Himachal have been built under the PMGSY. If a similar scheme is launched for ropeways, it will help improve connectivity in remote areas. It’s an eco-friendly mode and may even prove cost-effective compared to roads,” he said.Relief for school Board pensionersThe CM said it was on his persuasion that the Centre had established a ropeways corporation. “Detailed project reports will soon be prepared for ropeways in different parts of the state. Already, a project in Mandi has reached tender stage,” he said.On expanding Gaggal airport, he said for this, the Pathankot-Mandi four-lane highway needed to be realigned and the matter had been taken up with the National Highways Authority of India. About Mandi international airport, he said an MoU would soon be signed between the Airports Authority of India and the Himachal Government. The CM held meetings with various BJP block organisations of Kangra district to gather feedback for forming a strategy for the Assembly poll. He later inaugurated a cow sanctuary at Multhan in Kangra.                                     #Himachalropeway                                     #PMGSY||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-to-go-in-for-more-ropeways-says-cm-thakur-363004
