They stated when the employees of other departments had been given higher grades after two years of service why the condition of eight years had been put on them.They said that in the new pay scales there was no reference to the probation/rider period and the police constables had been singled out. They added that the rule of eight years service for the higher grade was applicable to over 5,700 police constables recruited in 2015 and subsequently.They sought permission to record comments in the roznamcha (daily police diary) that they had stopped taking meals in the mess as a mark of protest. These constables are demanding the grant of Rs 10,300+3,200 pay scale after two years instead of eight years.Following the Chief Minister’s comment that he was not aware that constables were boycotting mess meals, their families and relatives again took to social media.“The state government is not sympathetic towards the demand of the constables, who constitute a discipline force that works day and night in the time of calamities, agitations, for maintaining law and order,” their relatives stated.“They are not only 5,700 constables but 5,700 families, which constitute a sizeable vote bank, and the indifferent attitude of the state government will not benefit it in the upcoming state Assembly elections,” said their well wishers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/constables-seek-nod-to-mention-meal-boycott-in-daily-diary-362525

The Chief Minister is scheduled to inaugurate the Dharamsala ropeway project built at a cost of Rs 200 crore in the city. It is the biggest private investment in Kangra district in the past four years.Tussle for creditBJP MLA from Dharamsala Vikas Nehria has claimed credit for it. In a press conference held recently, the MLA said that the Dharamsala ropeway was the biggest project that would be gifted by the Chief Minister to the city. It would help boost tourism in the region and also ease traffic rush between Dharamsala and McLeodganj.Former minister and AICC secretary Sudhir Sharma in a press statement, has claimed that the BJP was trying to take credit for the development projects brought up by the previous Congress government. The MoU of the Dharamsala ropeway project was signed between the state Tourism Department and Dharamsala Ropeways company in 2015. The present government had contributed to delaying the project, he said.Sharma said that if the BJP government wants to claim credit for the ropeway project, it should also tell the people of Dharamsala what happened to the second capital status accorded to the city by the previous Congress government. The BJP government could not bring up the Central University of Himachal Pradesh (CUHP) campus in Dharamsala . The war museum was brought in Dharamsala by the previous Congress government and was inaugurated by late CM Virbhadra Singh. However, the BJP government had failed to open it for general public in the past four years of its tenure, he alleged.Congress spokesperson Rajesh Sharma, in a press conference held here today, said that instead of indulging in such a gimmick, the government should tell people why the expansion of the Gaggal airport had not been started, why the work on the Himani-Chamunda ropeway project had not been initiated and why the work for the IT park project proposed for Dharamsala had not begun, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/cong-bjp-leaders-spar-over-projects-in-dsala-362524

I see my efforts towards raising awareness about organ donation as a tribute to my son,” said Dr Mahajan, a professor of surgery at the Indira Gandhi medical College (IGMC) and Hospital.Little knowledgeMost people know just about eye donation but have little idea about organ donation. So a lot of efforts are required to raise awareness on this front. — Dr Mahajan, Professor of Surgery, IGMCIncidentally, when the State Organ Tissue Transplant Organisation was set up at the IGMC last year, Dr Mahajan was made the nodal officer of the organisation.Dr Mahajan says there is little awareness about organ donation among people. “Most people know just about eye donation but have little idea about organ donation. So a lot of efforts are required to raise awareness on this front,” he said.Nevertheless, Dr Mahajan said many people from the state have donated the organs of their loved ones at the PGI over the last few years. “Most people agree to donate the organs once they are told how the noble gesture could give a new lease of life to as many as seven to eight people. Around 30-35 people from the state donated organs at the PGI over the last couple of years,” said Dr Mahajan.Dr Mahajan delivers talks in collaboration with NGOs. His last lecture was for the webinar organsied by Umang Foundation a couple of days back. “Besides, talks are organised at rotary clubs and societies for raising the awareness,” said Dr Mahajan. “Also, we are planning talks at schools and colleges and organising marathons and cyclothons in the future,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/igmc-doc-raises-awareness-about-organ-donation-362522

He does not have a permanent source of income. His elder brother Virender, who is fighting cancer, lives in Ludhiana, while three sisters are married.Ganga Singh was born in 1916 in the house of Thola Singh. After completing his matriculation, he went to Lahore in 1934 where his uncle Maha Singh was working in The Tribune office. He enrolled into the British Army as Cavalry Rasaldar and got married to Gian Devi.In 1936, Ganga Singh came in contact with Subhash Chandra Bose and deserted the British Army to join the Indian National Army, said Narinder’s elder sister Santosh. She said he served in Italy, Germany and France and was also taken a prisoner of war (PoW) by the British. He was later court-martialled by the British Army and officially removed from service.For nine years, the family did not hear a word about Ganga Singh and presumed him dead till one day in August 1945, he reappeared in the village. Those nine years were also tough on his wife who was shunned by her in-laws and parents. With no financial assistance, she just had a single room to live.Narinder said after the end of the World War, his father, along with many others, crossed the Gobi Desert to reach India. On August 15, 1972, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi awarded Ganga Ram with the ‘Tamrapatra’ for his services. He later joined the government printing press at Shimla from where he retired at the age of 60.“On my father’s death in 1993, the district administration sent a sum of Rs 1,100, to which I added another Rs 1,000 and donated the amount to ‘Shaheed Parivar fund’,” said Narinder. He wants that the sacrifices by his father should be a source of inspiration for the village youth, but feels “nobody remembers freedom fighters now”.“We are willing to make some contribution if the panchayat decides to construct a village gate or put up our father’s bust at some prominent place,” he said.Narinder said he had left his job as a driver to look after his ailing father. His mother died in 2002. He now owns a pickup truck, but the pandemic had dried up options for a steady income. The panchayat does not even care to look into the issue of waterlogging near their house, he rues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/ina-veterans-family-in-una-faces-hardships-362509

The roads were reportedly constructed using JCB machines to transport construction and other material. The Tirthan valley is a gateway to the eco-fragile Great Himalayan National Park region, which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.No action against offendersThese roads raise a question mark on the functioning of the mining, fisheries and forest departments, besides the district administration and the police.The Tirthan valley is home to Himalayan trout. This fish moves upstream and downstream during the breeding season. Disturbing the natural course of the river will have an adverse impact on its survival and reproduction. It may perish completely if illegal mining in the river goes unchecked. Other aquatic species are also being adversely affected due to such man-made blockades, he adds.A local resident alleges that such mass-scale violation of rules is being done by tampering with the river course but nobody has tried to curb the menace. The authorities concerned should initiate action so that natural resources could be preserved. A regular vigil should be maintained and the authorities concerned should not be waiting for complaints to be filed.Kullu valley faces the threat of ecological degradation due to haphazard quarrying and mining on the riverbeds of the Beas, Parbati and their tributaries. All forest guards, police posts in-charges, junior engineers of the PWD and the Jal Shakti Vibhag, block development officers, ACFs, SHOs and DSPs, including officials of 39 other government departments are empowered to check illegal mining and challan offenders but miscreants usually evade action.The police frequently carry out inspections and penalise those involved in illegal mining but the offenders do not hesitate to repeat the offence. Environmentalist Abhishek Rai and others have demanded strict action against the offenders so that such illegal acts are not repeated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/temporary-roads-on-tirthan-riverbed-disturb-its-natural-flow-362507

They stated when the employees of other departments had been given higher grades after two years of service why the condition of eight years had been put on them.They said that in the new pay scales there was no reference to the probation/rider period and the police constables had been singled out. They added that the rule of eight years service for the higher grade was applicable to over 5,700 police constables recruited in 2015 and subsequently.They sought permission to record comments in the roznamcha (daily police diary) that they had stopped taking meals in the mess as a mark of protest. These constables are demanding the grant of Rs 10,300+3,200 pay scale after two years instead of eight years.Following the Chief Minister’s comment that he was not aware that constables were boycotting mess meals, their families and relatives again took to social media.“The state government is not sympathetic towards the demand of the constables, who constitute a discipline force that works day and night in the time of calamities, agitations, for maintaining law and order,” their relatives stated.“They are not only 5,700 constables but 5,700 families, which constitute a sizeable vote bank, and the indifferent attitude of the state government will not benefit it in the upcoming state Assembly elections,” said their well wishers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/constables-seek-nod-to-mention-meal-boycott-in-daily-diary-362525

The Chief Minister is scheduled to inaugurate the Dharamsala ropeway project built at a cost of Rs 200 crore in the city. It is the biggest private investment in Kangra district in the past four years.Tussle for creditBJP MLA from Dharamsala Vikas Nehria has claimed credit for it. In a press conference held recently, the MLA said that the Dharamsala ropeway was the biggest project that would be gifted by the Chief Minister to the city. It would help boost tourism in the region and also ease traffic rush between Dharamsala and McLeodganj.Former minister and AICC secretary Sudhir Sharma in a press statement, has claimed that the BJP was trying to take credit for the development projects brought up by the previous Congress government. The MoU of the Dharamsala ropeway project was signed between the state Tourism Department and Dharamsala Ropeways company in 2015. The present government had contributed to delaying the project, he said.Sharma said that if the BJP government wants to claim credit for the ropeway project, it should also tell the people of Dharamsala what happened to the second capital status accorded to the city by the previous Congress government. The BJP government could not bring up the Central University of Himachal Pradesh (CUHP) campus in Dharamsala . The war museum was brought in Dharamsala by the previous Congress government and was inaugurated by late CM Virbhadra Singh. However, the BJP government had failed to open it for general public in the past four years of its tenure, he alleged.Congress spokesperson Rajesh Sharma, in a press conference held here today, said that instead of indulging in such a gimmick, the government should tell people why the expansion of the Gaggal airport had not been started, why the work on the Himani-Chamunda ropeway project had not been initiated and why the work for the IT park project proposed for Dharamsala had not begun, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/cong-bjp-leaders-spar-over-projects-in-dsala-362524

I see my efforts towards raising awareness about organ donation as a tribute to my son,” said Dr Mahajan, a professor of surgery at the Indira Gandhi medical College (IGMC) and Hospital.Little knowledgeMost people know just about eye donation but have little idea about organ donation. So a lot of efforts are required to raise awareness on this front. — Dr Mahajan, Professor of Surgery, IGMCIncidentally, when the State Organ Tissue Transplant Organisation was set up at the IGMC last year, Dr Mahajan was made the nodal officer of the organisation.Dr Mahajan says there is little awareness about organ donation among people. “Most people know just about eye donation but have little idea about organ donation. So a lot of efforts are required to raise awareness on this front,” he said.Nevertheless, Dr Mahajan said many people from the state have donated the organs of their loved ones at the PGI over the last few years. “Most people agree to donate the organs once they are told how the noble gesture could give a new lease of life to as many as seven to eight people. Around 30-35 people from the state donated organs at the PGI over the last couple of years,” said Dr Mahajan.Dr Mahajan delivers talks in collaboration with NGOs. His last lecture was for the webinar organsied by Umang Foundation a couple of days back. “Besides, talks are organised at rotary clubs and societies for raising the awareness,” said Dr Mahajan. “Also, we are planning talks at schools and colleges and organising marathons and cyclothons in the future,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/igmc-doc-raises-awareness-about-organ-donation-362522

He does not have a permanent source of income. His elder brother Virender, who is fighting cancer, lives in Ludhiana, while three sisters are married.Ganga Singh was born in 1916 in the house of Thola Singh. After completing his matriculation, he went to Lahore in 1934 where his uncle Maha Singh was working in The Tribune office. He enrolled into the British Army as Cavalry Rasaldar and got married to Gian Devi.In 1936, Ganga Singh came in contact with Subhash Chandra Bose and deserted the British Army to join the Indian National Army, said Narinder’s elder sister Santosh. She said he served in Italy, Germany and France and was also taken a prisoner of war (PoW) by the British. He was later court-martialled by the British Army and officially removed from service.For nine years, the family did not hear a word about Ganga Singh and presumed him dead till one day in August 1945, he reappeared in the village. Those nine years were also tough on his wife who was shunned by her in-laws and parents. With no financial assistance, she just had a single room to live.Narinder said after the end of the World War, his father, along with many others, crossed the Gobi Desert to reach India. On August 15, 1972, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi awarded Ganga Ram with the ‘Tamrapatra’ for his services. He later joined the government printing press at Shimla from where he retired at the age of 60.“On my father’s death in 1993, the district administration sent a sum of Rs 1,100, to which I added another Rs 1,000 and donated the amount to ‘Shaheed Parivar fund’,” said Narinder. He wants that the sacrifices by his father should be a source of inspiration for the village youth, but feels “nobody remembers freedom fighters now”.“We are willing to make some contribution if the panchayat decides to construct a village gate or put up our father’s bust at some prominent place,” he said.Narinder said he had left his job as a driver to look after his ailing father. His mother died in 2002. He now owns a pickup truck, but the pandemic had dried up options for a steady income. The panchayat does not even care to look into the issue of waterlogging near their house, he rues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/ina-veterans-family-in-una-faces-hardships-362509

The roads were reportedly constructed using JCB machines to transport construction and other material. The Tirthan valley is a gateway to the eco-fragile Great Himalayan National Park region, which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.No action against offendersThese roads raise a question mark on the functioning of the mining, fisheries and forest departments, besides the district administration and the police.The Tirthan valley is home to Himalayan trout. This fish moves upstream and downstream during the breeding season. Disturbing the natural course of the river will have an adverse impact on its survival and reproduction. It may perish completely if illegal mining in the river goes unchecked. Other aquatic species are also being adversely affected due to such man-made blockades, he adds.A local resident alleges that such mass-scale violation of rules is being done by tampering with the river course but nobody has tried to curb the menace. The authorities concerned should initiate action so that natural resources could be preserved. A regular vigil should be maintained and the authorities concerned should not be waiting for complaints to be filed.Kullu valley faces the threat of ecological degradation due to haphazard quarrying and mining on the riverbeds of the Beas, Parbati and their tributaries. All forest guards, police posts in-charges, junior engineers of the PWD and the Jal Shakti Vibhag, block development officers, ACFs, SHOs and DSPs, including officials of 39 other government departments are empowered to check illegal mining and challan offenders but miscreants usually evade action.The police frequently carry out inspections and penalise those involved in illegal mining but the offenders do not hesitate to repeat the offence. Environmentalist Abhishek Rai and others have demanded strict action against the offenders so that such illegal acts are not repeated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/temporary-roads-on-tirthan-riverbed-disturb-its-natural-flow-362507
