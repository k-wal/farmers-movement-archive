The Tibetan government-in-exile will elect its head on May 14.In the last phase of the polls to the post of the president of the CTA only two candidates—Pempa Tsering and Aukatsang Kelsang Dorjee—are in the fray, Wangdu Tsering said.However, Pempa Tsering, the former chairman of Tibetan parliament, is the front runner.During the first phase of elections, there were eight candidates contesting for the post of Sikyong. Pempa Tsering secured the maximum votes (24,488) followed by Dorjee (14,544).Sikyong is the head of the Kashag or Cabinet, part of the executive branch of the CTA, and the post was created by the Tibetan parliament in 2011 to provide democratic governance to the exiled Tibetan community.Prior to that, Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama used to exercise the powers as temporal head of the Tibetan community in all affairs.Lobsang Sangay, who became the first Sikyong of the CTA, has held the post for two terms, and according to the constitution, he cannot contest for a third term.Pempa Tsering had lost to Sangay in 2016.“We are sending a clear message to Beijing that there is no democracy in China and Tibetans don’t enjoy freedom but under the great leadership of his holiness the Dalai Lama, we in-exile have been given this gift of democracy and today is a proud day,” Sangay told reporters.According to Wangdu Tsering, 83,079 voters are participating in the electoral exercise.“We have two kinds of elections—one is for the presidential election of the CTA and the second is parliamentary. There are two nominees contesting for the post of the president and Tibetans are also voting to choose 45 members of parliament. We will declare the results on May 14,” he said.

He was interacting with goat farmers after distributing 19 superior Gaddi breeding bucks among them.Chaudhary said these breeding bucks were being provided to the farmers with the objective to bring overall breed improvement. He said the scientists of the department of animal genetics and breeding, Dr GC Negi College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (COVAS), had raised these bucks after two stages of selection and scientific management. They were free from any disease that could be transmitted to progeny through the bucks, causing heavy economic losses to the farmers, he said. He advised the farmers to fully utilise the potential of the bucks because the superior ones would pass on the desired production traits in the progeny and ultimately improve the income of farmers.The Vice-Chancellor also talked about various welfare schemes for gaddi farmers and said an elaborated programme would be organised during the golden jubilee celebrations of HP statehood.Mandeep Sharma, Dean, COVAS, emphasised the utility of the project to the farmers. MM Singh, Director, extension education, highlighted the role of breeding bucks for improving the overall productivity of the flock.Dr PK Dogra, head, department of livestock farm complex, said the ongoing ‘’All India Coordinated Research Project on Goat Improvement’’ was being implemented under the umbrella of the Central Institute for Research on Goats at Makhdoom, Mathura.Till date, more than 250 superior breeding bucks had been provided to the farmers. He said more than 1,600 pure Gaddi goats were being monitored under the project. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/agriculture-university-to-help-gaddis-during-migration-237457

The situation aggravates on weekends when thousands of tourists throng Kasauli and its surrounding areas.The Garkhal junction, where five roads converge, is the major bottleneck as narrow single-lane roads are unable to bear massive traffic.Sanjay Rana, SHO, KasauliRoads need to be widenedThe deployment of additional manpower to manage traffic at the busy junctions leading to Kasauli will not solve the problem till the roads are widened. The entire staff from the Garkhal police post and the Kasauli police station is deputed on weekends to ensure smooth flow of traffic.The authorities have failed to construct a bypass to ease congestion despite directions by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in this regard.An expert committee, which had studied the carrying capacity of the Kasauli Planning Area in 2017, had recommended the development of a transport area before the Garkhal junction with adequate parking for trucks. The committee, it its study, had described the Kimughat chowk and the chowk near the PWD office as the major bottlenecks.The Kasauli Planning Area had registered a growth rate of 43 per cent during 1991-2001, which is much higher than that of the state. Hotel occupancy during the peak season is 95 per cent while it is below 30 per cent on normal days.“The deployment of additional manpower to manage traffic at the busy junctions leading to Kasauli will not solve the purpose till the roads are widened. The entire staff from the Garkhal police post and the Kasauli police station is deputed on weekends to ensure smooth flow of traffic,” said SHO, Kasauli, Sanjay Rana.The width of these roads has remained static despite a multifold increase in vehicular movement. Though the 2015 development plan for the KPA had recommended the widening of Garkhal Bazaar and the improvement of the junction at Kimmughat, it has failed to catch the attention of the state government.Deputy Commissioner, Solan, KC Chaman, admitted that the Garkhal junction is one of the major bottlenecks. He said a meeting of officials from the Revenue, PWD and others departments would be convened to work out an alternative bypass.He said this had become all the more significant after the four-laning of the Parwanoo-Solan highway.Sub Divisional Magistrate Sanjeev Dhiman said, “Efforts are on to create parking lots at Garkhal and Kasauli to decongest roads and a serious thought will be given to decongest the Garkhal junction and remove other bottlenecks at the earliest”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/no-end-to-traffic-jams-on-kasauli-roads-237444

It was decided in the Cabinet meeting yesterday to issue directions that only two or three officers should come to welcome the Chief Minister while others should remain seated at functions or come when summoned, he added.Una, Kangra and Solan are the worst-hit districts in the state; they share borders with Punjab and Haryana. “We will ask the district administrations and the police to keep a strict vigil to ensure that there are no big gatherings in these border districts, whether of locals or residents of adjoining states,” he added.Thakur said that while it took almost four months for the active Covid cases figure to touch 4,000 last year, we are surpassing this figure in less than a month this time. He also expressed concern over the high fatality figure and the fact that Covid is attacking the younger age people. At present, Himachal has over 4,675 cases and has registered 1,090 deaths, though on February 20 the fatality count was merely 218.
