Police officials deputed at the interstate borders at Kandwal, Damtal and Indora in Kangra district and Mehatpur, Gagret, Daulatpur and Polian in Una district stopped and checked passengers coming to the state in buses and cars. The bus passengers were asked to produce RT-PCR test negative reports or register themselves at the Covid e-portal of the Himachal Government to gain entry to the state.Cops at riskThose travelling in cars were also stopped and asked to produce the e-portal generated QR codes that were scanned at the borders. At Mehatpur, some pilgrims coming from Uttar Pradesh were turned back, as they had not registered themselves at the e-portal and also did not have the RT-PCR negative reports.However, locals going for jobs or business to Punjab were allowed hassle-free movement after inquires and production of identity proofs. This came as a big relief for thousands of locals, who commute to Punjab every day for livelihood.Kangra SP Vimukt Ranjan told The Tribune that the main objective of the restrictions was to ensure that state residents coming from Covid hotspots stay in home quarantine for seven days or they get an RT-PCR test negative report. The government has already notified that those coming to the state for business or jobs and returning in 72 hours shall be exempt from registration on the e-portal. So, locals are being allowed movement across the border without hassles, he added.Meanwhile, some officials term the restrictions enforced today as a wastage of precious resources. A senior health official said that Covid cases reported in Una and Kangra districts were higher in number than adjoining districts of Punjab. The positivity rate of 35 per cent in Kangra was among the highest in the state. So, Himachal requires more resources for the care and treatment of Covid patients rather than focusing on enforcing restrictions, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/locals-allowed-hassle-free-movement-across-border-in-himachal-pradesh-245737
