Several tractor-trailers, trucks and dumpers can be seen carrying extracted mining material.Large-scale illegal mining in the area has become a matter of serious concern. The Himachal Pradesh High Court as well as the state government had imposed a complete ban on mining activities in the Beas in Jaisinghpur. However, there is no one to implement the orders. The illegal activity is not only causing huge revenue losses to the state exchequer but also large-scale environmental degradation. Not only government land but also private properties have been affected by illegal mining. Villagers have been protesting against the illegal practice, particularly near residential areas.Many residents complain that the water level along the riverbank has gone down by 20 feet to 30 feet because of large-scale extraction of stones with the help of heavy machinery such as JCB machines and earth movers. They say a number of domestic animals have died after falling into deep trenches dug by the mining mafia.A local environmentalist, Adarash Himachali, has released a satellite picture of illegal mining in the Beas damaging water supply schemes, power supply lines and other public properties.The government, NGT and the Himachal Pradesh High Court have banned the use of heavy machinery such as JCB machines for mining in the state, still such equipment are being used blatantly.A senior Mining Department officer says that as per the directions of the NGT and the state government, they were bound to earmark the area allotted for mining with red flags so that illegal mining is not done outside the leased area. But no such marking is visible anywhere in the area.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/water-level-goes-down-illegal-mining-picks-up-at-jaisinghpur-240722

However, this year, the Punjab Government was not allowing Himachal farmers to sell their wheat crop there. Police nakas had been set up on the borders to stop the Himachal farmers from taking their wheat to Punjab mandis.Problems farmers facingPunjab arhtiyas said that if they were found purchasing wheat from outsiders, cases could be registered against them. “We have no option but to keep our wheat with us until someone buys it at the MSP of Rs 1,925 per quintal,” he said.

Kangra DC Rakesh Prajapati admitted that the farmers were facing problems. He said the FCI had set up a centre at Fatehpur in the district to buy wheat at the MSP. “We have requested the FCI to set up more centres so that the farmers do not face problems.

However, the Jal Shakti Department has set a deadline of June-end for its the completion. It will benefit 18,000 villagers.The scheme was initiated in 1979 at a cost of Rs 48.8 lakh when Shanta Kumar was the Chief Minister.Kutlehar MLA Virender Kanwar, Minister of Agriculture, Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Animal Husbandry, said since there was no water source atop the Ramgarh ridge, new groundwater lift schemes had been created at Samoor village and the distribution network was being augmented.Kanwar said 70 per cent of the work had been completed and the crisis of drinking water in Salangri, Bohru, Sakon, Gharvasada, Talai, Handola and Jagatkhana panchayats had been resolved.Executive Engineer of the Jal Shakti Department AK Bansal said 40 new water storage tanks had been proposed, of which 26 were ready and seven had been commissioned. Those put to public use included 6.74-lakh litre tank in Salangri village, 2.47-lakh litre tank at Bohru, 1.09-lakh litre tank at Sakon, 1.25-lakh litre tank at Gharvasada, 95,000-litre tank at Talai, 37,000-litre tank at Handola and 35,000-litre tank at Jagatkhana.The Executive Engineer said pipelines with enhanced diameter measuring about 11.2 km had already been laid, adding that a water treatment plant was also under-construction to ensure good quality drinking water during monsoon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/june-deadline-for-ramgarh-dhar-water-scheme-240745

At a video-conference with DCs, he instructed the Agriculture Department to prepare a database on weather and crop conditions to assist the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA).4,13,134 hectares total area under crops1,46,508 hectares hit by poor rainfallOf the total 4,13,134 hectares under crops, 1,46,508 hectares have been hit owing to poor rainfall. The maximum loss has been in Bilaspur district where 20,280 hectares of the total 28,020 hectares of cropped area have been affected. Likewise, in Chamba, 3,571 hectares of land has been affected.Khachi asked the Jal Shakti Department to identify water suppliers and fix rates for transporting drinking water as and where required, to maintain all traditional water resources, clean up natural water bodies and ensure adequate water sterilisation tablets in each district. The Chief Secretary said as of now, there was no fodder scarcity.He asked all Chief Medical Officers to constitute emergency teams in case of an epidemic due to water-borne diseases.Main rivers in the Kangra valley — Neugal, Binwa and Baner — which are a source for over 200 water supply schemes, are almost dry. With the snowline receding each year, the discharge in traditional water sources has dwindled.The water discharge in Changer area of Palampur has fallen to 30 per cent. “As groundwater is available in abundance up to the higher reaches of the Himalayas, the government should shift dependence from surface water to groundwater,” suggested an expert working on global warming.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-stares-at-drought-chief-secretary-orders-action-plan-240524
