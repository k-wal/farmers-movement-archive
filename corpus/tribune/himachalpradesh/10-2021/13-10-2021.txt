The farmers of the border areas of Kangra district, including the Fatehpur constituency, grow paddy on the banks of the Beas.Candidate’s campaigning opposedEarlier, the farmers used to sell their produce in the mandis of adjoining areas of Punjab. But now the Punjab Government has banned the entry of paddy from other states into its mandis. On the intervention of the state government, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has decided to open three mandis in Kangra from October 16 to procure paddy.Recently, when BJP candidate Baldev Thakur went to campaign in the Mand area of Fatehpur, the paddy farmers opposed him said that he should come only when the procurement of paddy begins on October 16.Another problem that the paddy farmers of Kangra are facing is that there is no rice sheller in the district. Hence even private mills will not procure paddy.Sumesh Singh, a resident of the Mand area, said that the farmers in the border areas of the state were already resorting to distress sale of paddy at Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,400 per quintal to middlemen against the MSP of Rs 1,940 per quintal.Kangra Deputy Commissioner Nipun Jindal said that earlier the FCI was not ready to procure paddy in the district, as there was no rice shelling mill there. However, when the government intervened the FCI decided to set up three procurement centres at Fatehpur, Riali and Indora. The paddy procurement would start on October 16, he adds.Sources said that farmers doing cultivation on the banks of the Pong Dam lake were likely to face another problem. A large number of Pong Dam oustees had settled in surrounding areas. They were doing farming on the banks of the Pong Dam lake, which is legally government land. Such farmers would not be able to sell their produce to the FCI, as now they would have to upload the revenue papers of the land on the e-portal for the purpose. As most of Pong Dam oustees were doing farmers on government land, they would not be able to upload the revenue papers on the e-portal and thus would not be able to sell their paddy at the FCI mandis.The issue of the Pong Dam oustees has been a political issue in Kangra district for quite some time. Rajan Sushant, a former BJP MP, who is now contesting as Independent candidate, rose to prominence due to the agitations for the rights of the Pong Dam oustees. Recently, when the Forest Department stopped farmers from growing crops on the banks of the Pong Dam, Sushant and even local BJP legislators opposed the decision tooth and nail.Jindal said that as per the rules, the registration of revenue papers on the e-portal was mandatory to sell paddy at the FCI centre. FCI officials were not available for comments despite repeated calls on their mobile phones.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/fatehpur-assembly-byelection-issues-of-paddy-farmers-a-concern-for-bjp-323890

As many as 527 soldiers laid down their lives for the sake of the country, of which 52 martyrs were from Himachal. Congress leaders should refrain from giving such comments during the election campaign.”“Pratibha also said that earlier she was not interested in contesting the Mandi Lok Sabha byelection. If so, then she should not contest under compulsion,” Thakur stated.The Chief Minister said that factionalism in the Congress had come to the fore. Each leader was trying to prove himself bigger. “The Congress has roped in Navjot Singh Sidhu and Kanhaiya Kumar as its star campaigners in the state. It was Sidhu, who first called Rahul Gandhi ‘Pappu’, while Kanhaiya Kumar is facing sedition charges,” he said.“Pratibha Singh has served two terms as MP from Mandi.

However, the present BJP government is providing jobs to outsiders, which is sheer injustice to the local unemployed people.”“The former Chief Minister had ensured tremendous development across the state without any bias,” she said.“During the BJP regime in the state and at the Centre, inflation has increased manifold, which has affected the life of the common man.

It was for the first time that the Congress failed to get lead even in one of 17 Assembly segments that constitute the Mandi parliamentary constituency. The BJP won the seat by a record margin of 3.98 lakh votes.Of the past 10 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP and the Congress have won the Mandi seat for five times each. The Congress has fielded Pratibha Singh in the byelection this time in the hope of getting sympathy votes. She has the added advantage of having been the MP from Mandi in 2004 and 2013.The BJP has reposed faith in Brig Khushal Thakur (retd), a Kargil War hero. He is a known face in Mandi as he had spearheaded the agitation of the Four-Lane Sagharsh Samiti for higher compensation for acquired land.“Even if the Congress loses the Mandi byelection but manages to get a lead in a few Assembly segments, it will be considered an achievement,” said a senior Congress leader. The three tribal Assembly segments of Kinnaur, Lahaul and Spiti and Bharmour, which are part of the Mandi seat, have traditionally been Congress strongholds and as such Pratibha would be hoping to get a considerable lead there.The Congress is hoping to get a massive lead in the Rampur Assembly seat, which falls in Shimla district and was home to Virbhadra. Besides, it also hopes to make a dent in the BJP vote bank in the Anni constituency in Kullu, which shares boundary with Rampur, on the opposite banks of the Sutlej.On the other hand, the prestige of the CM is at stake in the byelection; Mandi is his home turf. In fact, an adverse outcome of the bypoll can spell trouble for Thakur, a five-time MLA from the Seraj constituency in Mandi district.“The emotions of the people of Mandi are with the BJP and I am confident that people will wholeheartedly support the party candidate,” says the Chief Minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/sympathy-vote-can-congress-make-up-for-2019-defeat-in-mandi-323895

The foundation stone of the building was laid by former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh in 2016 and the construction work was started immediately.

Information gathered by The Tribune reveals   that with the change in the government in 2017,   the allocation of funds for the project was stopped.  In the past two years, only Rs 1 crore had been released against the requirement of  over Rs 3  crore.  The funds  were utilised to meet liabilities and no money was left for the construction work.

It has directed that henceforth, boards, corporations or other institutions would not entertain, much less consider and decide, the recommendations of any employee association or union for non-consensual transfer of employees.A Division Bench comprising Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Satyen Vaidya stated that any employee association or union in the state resorting to such a practice would be liable to be de-recognised and disqualified for all intents and purposes.The court passed the orders on a petition filed by an employee of the HP State Electricity Board alleging that office-bearers of the HP State Electricity Board Ministerial Service Association had recommended his transfer. He urged the court to initiate appropriate proceedings against the office-bearers for interfering with the working of the board by making requests or proposals to transfer the petitioner and other employees.The court observed, “We are appalled by the gross indiscipline existing in the board where members of different employee associations or unions have been addressing communications directly to the Chief Minister, being oblivious of the conduct rules or intentionally ignoring them. This practice requires to be discontinued forthwith”.The court said, “What is more distressing is that the employee associations or unions are acting as extra-constitutional authorities and are making recommendations for non-consensual transfers, especially of their opponents”.The court disposed of the petition and directed that a copy of the order be sent to the Chief Secretary for circulating this to all departments, boards and corporations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/no-transfer-at-staff-unions-behest-himachal-hc-323909
