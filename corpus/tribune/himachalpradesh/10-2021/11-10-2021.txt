Six centres in Una were closed recently following lapse in service and infrastructure, as pointed out by the inspection team, while 10 centres were either unable to fulfill the minimum standards of service or became financially unviable due to decrease in number of patients during Covid-19.Eleven centres were closed down in Una, five in Solan, two in Kangra and one each in Mandi and Shimla districts, and at present, the number of private de-addiction and rehabilitation centres functioning in the state is around 60, with a capacity of about 1,400. The number of drug addicts is rapidly increasing in the state and closure of a large number of these centres in the private sector has created the problem of shortage of rehab facilities.He said inhuman treatment with patients in de-addiction and rehabilitation centres was a crime and a case of murder under Section 302 of the IPC would be registered if torture or cruel treatment led to death in any facility.It had been brought to their notice that some centres were threatening or using physical force with inmates and in some cases, deaths had been reported, Dr Pathak stated.He said that as per Section 20 subsection (1) and (2) of the Mental Health Care Act 2017, patients admitted to these centres had the right to protect themselves from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and a case of murder would be registered if the torture led to death of inmates. Moreover, persons contravening any provision of the Act would be liable to be punished with imprisonment of six months and fine under Section 108 of the Act, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/world-mental-health-day-20-rehabilitation-centres-shut-for-ill-treatment-322918

The situation has come to such a pass that the manufacturing of several drugs can go off the shelf if the prices are not controlled. Rajesh Gupta, President, HDMAThe pharmaceutical industry has been battling the price rise ever since Covid hit the world. Price rise ranging from 25 per cent to 300 per cent has been registered in APIs and other raw materials from the pre-Covid era, threatening the viability of MSME units.“The steep hike has enhanced the capital induction by three times, hitting the survival of 550 units. The situation has come to such a pass that the manufacturing of several drugs can go off the shelf if the prices are not controlled,” said president, Himachal Drug Manufacturers Association (HDMA), Rajesh Gupta.Since the MSME units are finding it difficult to operate under such circumstances, the Himachal Drug Manufacturers Association (HDMA) is demanding the constitution of a pharmaceutical raw and packaging material task force to protect the industry and avoid the shortfall of medicines.“The prices of APIs like paracetamol, which stood at Rs 300 per kg in the pre-Covid era, have now increased to Rs 900-Rs 1,000 per kg,” added Gupta.SL Singla, adviser, HDMA, said, “A substantial decline has been registered in the production of paracetamol-based drugs and several other formulations due to hike in the price of its API. The government should act fast to devise a mechanism to check the price rise.”“The task force can include members of related ministeries like the Health and Family Welfare, the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers, the Ministry of Commerce and Niti Ayog. They should keep a watch on the manufacturers of bulk drugs and their price,” said Gupta.Prices of exicipients and solvents, used to aid manufacturing, like glycerin, propylene glycol, iso propyl alcohol have registered a steep hike.“Mono cartons and corrugated packaging prices have increased from 25 to 40 per cent while the PVC price, used for blistering of tablets and oral liquid bottles, has shown a steep increase from 25 per cent to 30 per cent. Vials, ampoules, flip-off seals, butyl seals too have registered a hike in their price,” said Munnish Thakur, association general secretary.Not only this, the freight of containers for import and export has gone up 6 to 9 times compared to the pre-Covid era globally owing to their shortage.Even the logistics have registered an increase of 10-20 per cent owing to the hike in the prices of petrol, diesel and CNG.Though an extensive data pertaining to these facts were compiled and submitted through the Chief Minister to the Prime Minister’s Office almost a year back, little has been done to take preventive measures, rue investors, who are now demanding an early resolution to the problem.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/api-price-hike-hits-pharma-units-322921

Taking Rs 1,500 as an average price per box, the Rs 4,000 crore mark has been breached,” said Gyan Verma, senior marketing officer, Horticulture Department. “The figure doesn’t include the procurement done by the HPMC and Himfed and the private CA stores,” he said.2.7 cr boxes marketedAround 2.70 crore apple boxes have already been marketed in the APMC mandis or outside so far. Taking Rs1,500 as an average price per box, the Rs4,000 crore mark has been breached. Senior Marketing Officer, Horticulture DeptVerma further said the arrival of apple in the market had not slowed down yet. “Over one lakh boxes are still hitting the market every day. The trend should sustain towards the end of this month as we are expecting around 30 lakh boxes more from Kinnaur. By the end of the season, we will have comfortably surpassed our prediction of 3.22 crore boxes this year,” said Verma.Incidentally, the procurement of C grade apple through Market Intervention Scheme has seen significant increase this year. “Normally, the production of C grade apple is around 30 per cent of the total crop. This time, this percentage has jumped to around 45 to 50 per cent,” said Verma.“Apart from the apple sold through MIS, the C Grade apple was sent to the mandis, too, in boxes. Apple packed in seven layer boxes, without adequate colour, deformed and rusted have been included in this category,” said Verma.While the major reason for the massive jump in the percentage of C grade apple was persistent hailing, untimely snowfall and a spell of drought, Verma said the aging plantation was also contributing to it.“The plantation done in the 70s and 80s is aging now and those trees hardly provide 30 per cent of quality fruit. Even though growers are fast shifting to newer varieties, the number of old trees is still quite significant,” he said. “Eventually, people will have to shift to new varieties to have quality yield and get good prices.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/apple-business-crosses-rs-4k-cr-mark-in-himachal-322922

It is the switch over from a disciplined force to the flexibility of politics which he considers a greater challenge.Also read: Mandi bypoll: Delayed Kiratpur-Manali highway key issueThakur (67), who took pre-mature retirement in 2010 while serving as Station Commander at the Army Training Command here, had been appointed the Chairman of the HP Ex-servicemen Corporation, a post he gave up before filing his nomination. He worked as general manager with a private firm for five years which executed the Atal Tunnel project.People are intelligent. Terming the poll a shradhanjali to Virbhadra Singh will not work.... Ex-CM was very mature and respected, but elections are fought on issues.“I am in no doubt about my victory as I have won the toughest battles, but adapting from a strictly hierarchical and structural force like the Army to politics, which requires immense flexibility, will be a challenge for me,” he said in an interview with The Tribune.However, having vociferously raised the inadequate land compensation in the Kiratpur-Manali four-lane project, he is already used to a public life. He was a strong contender for the Mandi Lok Sabha seat even in 2014, when he lost the race to Ram Swaroop Sharma.“People are very intelligent and terming the election a shradhanjali to former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh will not cut ice for the Congress,” he said when asked about the sympathy factor that the Raja’s wife Pratibha Singh is invoking to woo the electorate.Virbhadra was a very mature and respected leader, but elections are fought on issues, he hastened to add.“I have realised that a politician has the power to bring into focus people’s issues and if I am elected, I will raise all core issues in Parliament,” he remarked.He is very firm in stating that he believes in constructive, positive and development-oriented politics with interest of the people being paramount.“My agenda for the elections is to strengthen the infrastructure which in turn will give a fillip to tourism and in the process generate the much-needed employment,” he outlines his priorities.He says having served in the Army, he understands the strategic importance of strengthening infrastructure like all-weather roads, tunnels, good communication network in the border areas like Kinnaur and Lahaul Spiti which share boundary with China.“The execution of the Manali-Leh rail line project would not only be very crucial from the defence point of view but also for heralding economic prosperity in Himachal,” he says.Captured Tiger hill||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/terming-poll-a-tribute-to-ex-cm-wont-work-for-congress-brig-khushal-thakur-retd-322931

It is in a pathetic state for the past many years. The condition of the Sundernagar-Aut stretch is highly deplorable. During the rainy season, the entire stretch of the highway from Mandi to Aut becomes treacherous due to deep cutting of hills for the four-laning project. With no rail connectivity and limited flights to Manali, the road is virtually the lifeline of the tourism industry. The delay in its four-laning has caused strong resentment among the residents of Mandi as well as Kullu-Manali.The Kullu-Manali Hoteliers Association has time and again raised the issue with the authorities concerned, but to no avail.Anup Thakur, former president of the association, said the bad condition of the highway had adversely affected the tourism and allied sectors. While locals feel that the issue will affect the voting pattern in the upcoming Mandi bypoll, observers say it is difficult to assess the impact of the same.Besides tourism, farming is also affected by the delayed project. Farmers of Kulllu and Lahaul and Spiti, who transport their produce to distant markets through this highway, face a lot of hardships.Locals are also sore at being denied enhanced compensation for their acquired land, which the BJP had promised prior to the elections. Joginder Walia, spokesperson for the Sangharsh Samiti, said even after four years in power, the BJP did nothing to fulfil the promise.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/mandi-bypoll-delayed-kiratpur-manali-highway-key-issue-322802
