10-10-2021||Shimla||Natural farming gives Himachal apple growers edge||Apple grower Shakuntala Sharma in upper Shimla in Himachal Pradesh has reasons to smile. The apples she produced under natural conditions without the use of chemicals and fertilisers have fetched a record price of over Rs 100 per kg."The moment a buyer in the local market saw the label of natural apples on my boxes, he instantly said he would purchase the entire stock at this price. By adapting to natural farming, I saved Rs 50,000-60,000 on the total cost of cultivation," an elated Shakuntala said.Shakuntala’s orchard is located in Theog area, some 40 km from here. She is growing apples by adopting the Subhash Palekar Natural Farming (SPNF), a technique to do cultivation through non-chemical use, and this concept is gaining ground in the hill state where producers are particularly vulnerable to impacts of the climate crisis, such as extreme heat, deficit precipitation and pest attacks.According to Shakuntala, vegetable buyers have started coming to her farm and giving her good prices.But the agricultural alchemy of the heavy use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides comes with a toll in degrading the soil of orchards and damaging the ecosystem.Countering the farming's growing problems, the SPNF method is based on homemade inputs made from 'desi' cow's dung and urine and locally available resources.Narrating his story about how overuse of fertiliser was impacting his income, another grower Ravinder Chauhan from Samoli panchayat in Rohru block, said he was in financial stress as he faced multiple problems in apple orchard due to ever increasing expenditure on chemical sprays. "The shift to natural farming has helped me earn good profits in the last three years," he said.Chauhan, who cultivates eight bighas (a bigha is roughly a fourth of an acre) with natural farming, has sold an apple box of 25 kg for Rs 4,200-4500 in far-off states like Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka. He said the fluctuation of prices in the normal market did not affect him as his apples were chemical free. "I fixed the rate in advance," he added.The non-chemical low-cost climate-resilient SPNF technique is being promoted for agriculture and horticulture crops in the state as a part of Prakritik Kheti Khushhal Kisan Yojana, launched by the state government in 2018. According to the State Project Implementing Unit, a total of 1,33,056 farmers are practicing natural farming in the state, either partially or fully, involving 7,609 hectare. This includes 12,000 apple orchardists.While the farmers are happy with the results of natural farming in terms of zero dependence on external markets, production, farm health and reduced expenditure, they have started making efforts to build their own linkages for marketing of their produce.Some of them are getting good rates in local markets, others are sending them across the country and many have started getting buyers at doorsteps.One such grower is Surender Mehta from the Lalpani Dochi village in Chopal block who found buyers in Jaipur and Delhi."This year, a Jaipur-based agro trading company lifted apple boxes from my village. They paid me 10-15 per cent more than the normal price of apples produced with chemical fertilizers and pesticides. It saved my hassle and money involved in transporting the produce," he said."I felt so good when I was offered Rs 150 more for a box of 10 kg pears even in a local market when I told the buyer that my produce is chemical-free and natural," he added. Another progressive grower Varun Rangta from Jubbal sold the entire apple lot of around 200 boxes produced by natural farming techniques in Delhi, Chennai, Nagpur and Pune.Sushma Chauhan, a grower from Shillaru, says awareness on the chemical-free natural produce is increasing. Even her hail damaged apples found the market.Prakritik Kheti Khushhal Kisan Yojana Executive Director Rajeshwar Singh Chandel said, "The State Project Implementing Unit is looking for farmers for local-based marketing models, which they have evolved on their own. This will help us converge the successful farmer-market linkages with our programme, wherein we are looking at connecting all farmers with the market."   He said the farmers have not only shown their mettle on farm with SPNF, but have successfully made market linkages also.Scientific studies in the state show the SPNF technology has reduced the cost of cultivation in apple crop by 56.5 per cent, while the net returns in apple crop have increased by 27.4 per cent. The incidence of scab and marssonina blotch in apples is also less in natural farming compared to the conventional practices. More so, the farmers are able to take multiple crops on the same farm by adopting SPNF.More than 90 per cent of Himachal Pradesh's apple produce goes to the domestic market. Apples constitute 49 per cent of the total area under fruit crops and 85 per cent of the state's fruit economy comes to Rs 4,000 crore.The Economic Survey of 2020-21 stated that the area under apple production in the state had increased from 400 hectares in 1950-51 to 1,14,144 hectares in 2019-20. The production was normal with 70 million boxes in 2019-20. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/natural-farming-gives-himachal-apple-growers-edge-322711
10-10-2021||Shimla||Himachal setting up Murrah buffalo breeding farm||The Himachal Pradesh government will be setting up a Central-funded Murrah buffalo farm with an outlay of Rs 506.45 lakh for the genetic upgrading and dairy extension services, state Animal Husbandry Minister Virender Kanwar said on Sunday.The breeding farm, which will produce the high-quality fertile and disease-free bovine stock, will be set up by the Himachal Pradesh Livestock and Poultry Development Board in Burnoh in Una district.The Murrah buffalo is the most preferred choice of many dairy farmers.The Minister said the aim of the farm is to produce high-yielding calves to enhance the overall milk production.The native Murrah breed, nationally recognized as an indigenous by the National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources in Karnal, is of its distinct characteristics and constitutes 359,979 (55 per cent) of the total 646,565 buffalo population in the state.The state will set up three ultra-modern sheds at an initial cost of Rs 75 lakh to rear 50 high-genetic buffaloes, comprising 30 adult and 20 heifers.The freshly calved high pedigreed 30 adult female buffaloes in first or second lactation and 20 disease-free heifers will be purchased from government farms.The state will high grade semen to farmers and the surplus will be supplied to neighbouring states -- Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh -- to meet the growing demand, said Kanwar.The Murrah buffalo farm will be equipped with scientific waste management and rainwater harvesting facilities and a fodder farm.To reduce the operational cost of farms, own forage and silage preparation from green fodder crops will be practiced, said the minister.The fodder production will be undertaken with a cost of Rs 15 lakh to reduce the cost of rearing the animals so as to make the project economically viable and the dung is to be used as organic fertilizer manure for green fodder cultivation.Surplus green fodder is proposed to be utilized for silage production to be used in lean periods, he added.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-setting-up-murrah-buffalo-breeding-farm-322704

His father and BJP MLA Anil Sharma too has stayed away from campaigning for the BJP candidate though he had met Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur last week.During the 2019 parliamentary poll, Sukh Ram had met Virbhadra Singh in Delhi to plead him to campaign for his grandson. Now, it remains to be seen whether he will reciprocate the gesture in case Pratibha Singh, Congress candidate or her son Vikramaditya Singh, asks him to campaign.

Sukh Ram has won the Mandi seat thrice in 1984, 1991 and 1996.Ashray was initially in the Congress but later joined the BJP on being denied the Lok Sabha ticket from Mandi in 2019.He struck a deal with the Congress and was fielded by the party in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, which eventually resulted in his father losing his ministerial berth in the Jai Ram Cabinet.Ashray had lost to the BJP’s Ram Swaroop by a record margin of almost four lakhs in the 2019 parliamentary poll.Uncertainty over their role||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/anil-sharma-ashray-sharma-leave-everyone-guessing-322468
