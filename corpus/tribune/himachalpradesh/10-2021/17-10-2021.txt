It had also failed to address the issues of the people affected by the road widening project. The affected people were being given only factor-1 (two-time) compensation while the BJP had promised four-time compensation.Rathore claimed that the Congress would win all four byelections in the state as the voters were aware of the poor policies of the government. “The skyrocketing prices of diesel, petrol and cooking gas have made the lives of common people miserable. The state government has recruited outsiders in various departments, leading to resentment among local unemployed youths. Development had come to a standstill in the past three and a half years. The BJP government has failed to present a report card of development works before the byelections in the state,” he said.Rathore said that the government had failed to check the spiralling prices of essential commodities. The debt had increased manifold due to the wrong economic policies of the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/nh-project-hit-cheated-by-bjp-rathore-325517
