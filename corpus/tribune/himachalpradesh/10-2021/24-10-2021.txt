Sports association members should shun favouritism and focus on improving games, said Anurag Thakur, Union Minister for Information Broadcasting, Sports and Youth Affairs, today while addressing the newly elected office-bearers of the Himachal Pradesh Olympics Association (HPOA) at Parwanoo.He stressed the need for performance-linked incentives and accountability of sports associations to improve performance at the international level. “Do not accept a post merely for acquiring name and fame but for nurturing the future of sportspersons,” he said.Anurag directed the HPOA to prepare a road map within three months and execute it within three to five years. “Himachal can be made a hub of high-altitude training in athletics,” he added.“All states have been directed to enlist top three priorities where handicaps, such as need for better coaches will be overcome by coordination between the state and central associations. All blocks will have a sports facility in the next five years. Himachal should set an example by becoming a model state in the basic sports infrastructure with better coordination between various departments,” he said.The Union minister stressed optimum utilisation of resources and said, “Several stadiums created at a cost of crores of rupees are underutilised. Indoor stadiums can be created at a cost of Rs 25 to Rs 30 lakh where four mat games can be played. The world-class stadium at Dharamsala has been set up at a cost of Rs 45 crore due to optimum utilisation of resources”.He lauded sportsmen for bagging 19 medals in paralympics though he thought that games such as shooting required more attention. He exhorted the HPOA to rope in corporate houses and retired officials having a philanthropic mindset to adopt talented sportsmen.Anurag called upon all associations to introspect and ensure their contributions to the betterment of sports. “Teams should be selected through competitions rather than through trials. Members should shun favouritism in sports and focus on improving games,” he said.He also advised eminent sportsmen doing various jobs to opt for coaching and directed the association to make a pool of such sportsmen. “International coaches can be used to train state-level coaches and a check list of the fitness level and other key parameters should be prepared to enhance performance”.The newly elected office-bearers of the HP Olympic Association for 2021-2025 are: Chief patron—Anurag Thakur; patron—Rajiv Saizal; president : Virender Kanwar; senior vice-president—Sukh Ram Chaudhary; vice-presidents—Ishwar Rohal and Munish Sharma; secretary general—Rajesh Bhandari; treasurer—Tej Parkash Chopra; and joint secretaries—Ramesh Chauhan, Raj Kumar Bharanta, Devi Dutt Tanwar and Pradeep Sharma.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/select-sports-teams-through-contests-than-trials-anurag-thakur-328838

Brick-kiln owners claim that it is due to the rise in the prices of coal, he adds. “The kiln owners are taking advantage of the coal crisis in thermal plants in the northern region to unfairly increase the prices in the name of increase in the coal prices. The government should intervene to stop them from exploiting people,” he alleges.The prices of sand and gravel have almost doubled in the past three months. The prices of sand that were around Rs 30 to Rs 32 per cubic feet in Dharamsala and Rs 20 to Rs 22 in Una have gone up to Rs 42 to Rs 45 per cubic feet and Rs 30 to Rs 35 in the respective regions.The owners of stone crushers or mining lease holders are blaming the high prices of fuel for the increase in costs. A stone crusher owner say that the transportation cost of sand and gravel and the increase in diesel price was being passed onto the consumers.Sources say that due to the strictness of the authorities on mining in the state, the cost has increased due to a shortage of material.The prices of cement have also increased by Rs 10 per bag. In the Dharamsala region, the cost of a cement bag now ranges between Rs 390 and Rs 395 whereas in the Una region, it has gone up to Rs 380 to Rs 385 from Rs 370 to Rs 375 per bag.Neeraj Kant, Mining Officer, Una, says that the department has no control over the prices of construction material.
