It had advocated the need to develop a mechanism to monitor the quality of construction in panchayats by the Rural Development Department. Notably, there are no buildings regulations in rural areas till now.It has also been recommended to check constructions along the highways to avoid the repetition of such incidents and the rules followed in Haryana, which restrict ribbon development, have been cited in support. Ribbon development is the unorganised residential or commercial development taking place in a linear pattern along a road.Ribbon development, however, has become the norm even in the TCP areas. A large number of hotels were coming up on both sides of the road the Dharampur-Kasauli road near Sanawar village. This has shrunk the already narrow road and traffic jams have become routine. The unscientific dumping of muck along the road was further adding to the problem.Secretary TCP Rajnish Kumar, when contacted, said, “Semi-urban settlements where development activities are taking place can be brought under the purview of the TCP regulations following a recommendation by the field officials. A Cabinet sub-committee headed by the Revenue Minister Mahinder Singh is already examining the areas which should be included or excluded from the TCP regulations in the state.”The findings of the enquiry committee, which were sent to the state government, have been lost in the files. Recommendations like engaging a structural engineer to design a building, constructed within 50-m distance of a road and also getting its sub-soil investigation done by an NABL-approved lab, have only remained a paper formality.Residents in the rural areas have little access to structural engineers and buildings are often constructed on the advice of labourers. “The concept of structural engineer is not followed due to absence of such experts,” said building contractor Arun Kumar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/no-lessons-learnt-after-2019-building-collapse-319727

They were greeted by traffic snarls at various points on the Dharampur-Kasauli and Dharampur-Sanawar road where a slew of new resorts are coming up.“A traffic jam for a few minutes on the Dharampur-Kasauli road has a cascading effect. Within minutes, vehicles line up on both sides of the road and it takes long to streamline the traffic,” said a policeman at the Garkhal junction where five roads converge.Trucks carrying construction material further add to their pain. There is no restrictions on loading or unloading of the material by truckers on the roadside, causing obstruction to traffic.Some hotels either have no parking or their approach roads are too steep. Vehicles can be seen lined up along the roads. This was further aggravating the road chaos.“Since the basement parking has been banned by the NGT after the two-and-a-half-storey norm was introduced for buildings in the Kasauli Planning Area, new hotels have been left without parking,” said Rocky Chimni, vice-president, Kasauli Residents and Welfare Association. He added that though hotels were witnessing a good business this time, traffic snarls had sullied the image of the popular destination.Some hotels in the rural areas have not made provision for parking, forcing the guests to park their vehicles on the road, said Rajesh, a tourist.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/traffic-snarls-at-garkhal-junction-irk-kasauli-visitors-319734

He said unless and until facilities are improved, the volume of trade is unlikely to pick up.The trade which had touched almost Rs 10 crore in 2015 has been on the decline as in 2019 the total volume of trade was Rs 3.05 crore. “The failure of the government to create facilities like a jeepable road right up to Tibet border, a trade centre at Chuppan, allowing livestock trade, water facility at Shipki and addition of new items to the trade list are some of the major deterrents for the growth of trade,” point out traders.They rue that the disinterest of the state government in promoting cross border trade is so evident from the fact that despite Rs 70 lacs having being sanctioned for the trade centre at Chuppan, work has not even been allotted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/trade-with-china-hit-amid-pandemic-traders-want-improved-facilities-319737

However, no headway has been made.Earlier, senior officials of the NHAI had met Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur and Forest Minister Rakesh Pathania in this regard.The NHAI had already approved the construction of the first phase of the project between Pathankot (Kandwal) and 32 Miles in Kangra district in March. Land compensation has also been paid to the affected parties.Global bids for the first phase of the project were opened by the NHAI on March 26 and the construction work of the highway, costing Rs 1,002.11 crore, was awarded to a Gurugram-based construction company that has already shifted its machinery to construction sites near Pathankot. If forest and environment clearances are not granted before October 15, the NHAI will have to pay heavy damages to the company as per conditions of tender agreements.The 219-km Pathankot-Mandi road project of the Union Government has strategic importance as it links Pathankot with Leh, Ladakh and other forward areas. Considering Defence requirements, the Union Government wants to complete it early.

State president, Surinder Jain, said, “Increase in the GST rate from 12 to 18 per cent will have a spiraling effect on the price of commodities like apples and other fruits which are packed in these boxes.”A representation was also given to the Union Finance Minister at Panchkula. The manufacturers want the state government to take up the matter with the GST council in its next meetingJain added that, “The corrugated box manufacturers have been battling abrupt hike in the price of kraft paper for the last two years. An increase of 6 per cent in the GST rate of corrugated boxes will have a debilitating effect on our business.”The investors said the GST on corrugated boxes has been 12 per cent since its inception in July 2017 and it was on a par with its major raw material-kraft paper and paperboard. Since kraft paper constitutes almost 76-80 per cent of the finished box, any hike in tax on boxes will increase the tax rate on boxes substantially.“All users of corrugated boxes like fruit, vegetable, many pharma items, food items, liquor, etc., do not fall under the ambit of the GST. Hike in GST rate will, therefore, raise price of these commodities and result in undue burden on the manufacturers,” added Jain.The manufacturers contended that they are MSME with a large number of them being micro and small sector enterprises. “This increase will hit cash flow in the market. Earlier , 3 per cent cash flow of sales was required but the new development will push it to 9 per cent and no customer will offset this additional cost of finance.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachals-corrugated-box-makers-rue-hike-in-gst-from-12-to-18-pc-319740

Both Irrigation and Public Health Minister Mahender Singh and Education Minister Govind Thakur are rather reluctant to take on the Congress though victory is almost assured. “Ensuring victory in the Mandi Lok Sabha bypoll is the CM’s headache as it is his home turf and his reputation will be at stake,” said a senior leader. However, the irony is that the ministers do not want to contest.Backstabbing by leadersThe absence of prominent Congress leaders from a district-level protest organised by the Congress in Dharamsala last week embarrassed the senior leadership. When asked about their absence, senior Congress leaders said they could not come due to their personal reasons. However, in private, they talked of backstabbing by some leaders on various occasions.Wooing bigwigs for ticketTicket aspirants are making all-out efforts to secure the favour of the poll panels of their parties at Arki.
