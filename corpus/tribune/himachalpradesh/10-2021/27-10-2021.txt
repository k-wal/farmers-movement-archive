The team would stay in the village and the project would be installed in 10 days. The project was being managed by HIMURJA, a government enterprise.Jai Ram Thakur, Chief Minister, is monitoring the progress of the project. Residents of Bara Bhangal had called on him in Dharamsala three months ago and highlighted the issue. Later, the CM directed the DC to provide the power supply to the village before the onset of the winter.The government had installed a 40 KVA hydropower plant in the village in ‘90s when the late Congress leader Pandit Sant Ram was the MLA from Baijnath. However, it had been lying non-functional for the past 10 years.Bara Bhangal is located in the Dhauladhar hills and one has to trek at least 70 km through mountain passes to reach the village.

The reason being that the Municipal Corporation and the Forest Department have contrary views on the requirement of forest clearance for the project.While the Forest Department insists the project will need clearance under the Forest Conservation Act (FCA), the Municipal Corporation is hoping for a clearance through a Cabinet sub-committee and hence, is yet to apply for the FCA.“Land disputes have been cleared, the Tree Authority Committee has forwarded the matter to the Cabinet sub-committee and the work to save The Ridge will start immediately after the elections are over,” said Mayor Satya Kaundal.Forest officials, however, have a different take on the matter. “As per records, a major chunk of the site is forest land and if it is put to any non-forest use, the clearance under the FCA is must,” said DFO (Urban) Anita Bhardwaj. “Even if the MC gets clearance for the felling of trees, the land will still continue to be forest land so the MC will need to apply for clearance under the FCA,” said the DFO.To avoid FCA clearance in this case, the MC had cited a precedent where it was given a piece of land at Krishna Nagar for building a community hall without having to apply for FCA clearance. The Forest Department, however, feels the two sites are not of similar nature. “The two sites are not comparable, so the FCA exemption is not possible in this case,” said a forest official.The Mayor, however, is confident of starting the work after November 2. “We have seen the revenue records. Most of the land is government land and the MC has the possession. The forest land is only a minor chunk. We will start the work and if clearance is required for forest land, we will apply for it,” said the Mayor.The restoration work of the sinking portion of The Ridge, which is to be funded under the Smart City Mission and executed by the PWD, has been delayed for one reason or the other many times. If the matter is not resolved in time, The Ridge could sink further. Work to start after pollLand disputes have been cleared, the Tree Authority Committee has forwarded the matter to the Cabinet sub-panel. The work will start immediately after polls. — Satya Kaundal, Mayor, ShimlaClearance a prerequisiteAs per records, a major chunk of the site is forest land and if it is put to any non-forest use, the clearance under the Forest Conservation Act is must.— Anita Bhardwaj, DFO (Urban)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/shimla-mc-forest-department-differ-on-fca-nod-ridge-work-may-be-delayed-330199

The bypoll is being held due to the demise of sitting BJP MP Ram Swaroop on March 17.The CM has been focusing mainly on the Mandi seat, although Arki, Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai seats will also go to the polls. Retaining the Mandi seat, which the BJP won by a record margin of almost four lakh votes in 2019, has become a compulsion for Thakur, as an adverse outcome on his home turf will give a chance to his detractors within the party to demand change of leadership.Based on the outcome of the 2017 Assembly elections, the BJP is certainly on a firm footing as it has MLAs in 13 of the 17 Assembly segments that form part of the Mandi parliamentary constituency. The Congress has only three sitting MLAs in Kinnaur, Kullu and Rampur while Independent legislator from Jogindernagar (Prakash Rana) has been aligning with the ruling party.In case inflation and unemployment emerge as major poll planks, the going may get tough for the BJP. On the other hand, if the sentiment of protecting Mandi’s pride comes into play with Jai Ram being the first CM from here, the ruling party could sail through.The Congress hopes to get big lead in Virbhadra’s home town Rampur, besides support of tribal voters of Kinnaur, Lahaul & Spiti and Bharmour. Relatively lesser number of voters in tribal areas that form part of the Mandi constituency and early onset of winters may be a cause of worry for the party.Pratibha won this seat in 2004 and 2013 and even defeated Jai Ram Thakur, but the biggest difference this time is that she does not have the backing and support of the “Raja” who passed away on July 8. On both occasions when she won, Virbhadra was the CM. She, however, hopes to cash in on the sympathy factor by seeking votes as “shradhanjali” to her late husband.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/mandi-bypoll-pratibha-singh-banks-on-sympathy-litmus-test-for-cm-in-home-district-330125
