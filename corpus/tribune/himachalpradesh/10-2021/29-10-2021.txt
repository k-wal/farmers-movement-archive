29-10-2021||Confronted with the challenge of four byelections amidst the Covid pandemic||CM Jai Ram Thaku predicts easy win in Mandi, Fatehpur, Arki||With campaign over, how do you see BJP’s prospects in the four bypolls?I am confident that the BJP will do well. In Mandi, we will register victory with a handsome margin while in Arki and Fatehpur, our candidates will win by comfortable margins. As far as Jubbal-Kotkhai is concerned, the BJP chances have improved despite the presence of a rebel.Sympathy alone not enoughI want to make it clear that elections are not fought on emotions but on concrete issue like development. We too have a lot of regard for Virbhadra but sympathy alone is not enough. Maybe, people in some parts of Rampur, Kinnaur and Lahaul Spiti vote out of sympathy. — Jai Ram Thakur, CMDo you think issues like price rise and unemployment can work against the BJP?The Congress desperately tried to make price rise its biggest weapon against us as the major poll plank but failed miserably. People are very wise and understand that this is a peculiar situation arising due to Covid pandemic. They know that both Central and state governments have tried their best to keep the wheels of development moving despite severe constraints and challenges due to Covid.Do you feel the Congress will be able to ride high on the sympathy factor, especially in Mandi with his wife seeking votes as a tribute to Virbhadra?I want to make it clear that elections are not fought on emotions but on concrete issues like development. We, too, have a lot of regard for Virbhadra but sympathy alone is not enough. Maybe, people in some parts of Rampur, Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti vote out of sympathy but then the same sentiment will be at play in Mandi, from where I hail. The BJP, too, can have sought sympathy votes as our sitting MP Ram Swaroop, who had won by a record margin of about four lakh, had passed away. But we desisted from doing so.Do you feel the poll results will be a reflection on your four-year rule?Yes, to some extent the results will be a referendum on our four-year rule with 20 Assembly segments going to the polls in one go. Hypothetically, if the Congress does well, the party will get an impetus for next year’s Assembly poll. However, I would like say that one year is a very long period and the situation can change drastically either way.With just about one year left for the 2022 Assembly poll, what will be your regime’s agenda?There are several tasks that we would like to accomplish. This includes roping in some major investment from the private sector for which a ground-breaking ceremony will be held shortly. Also, I would like to see progress on the ambitious project of an international airport at Nagchala in Mandi. There are several such schemes, which we will unfold in the coming days.In case of an adverse outcome in the bypoll, do you feel any threat of a leadership change?In the first place, there is no chance of the BJP not doing well in the bypoll. Even if hypothetically, we assume that the BJP does not fare well, there is no question of a change in leadership as my government is very stable and there are no issues against me. I will abide by any decisionof the top leadership in the interest of the party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/cm-jai-ram-thaku-predicts-easy-win-in-mandi-fatehpur-arki-331136
29-10-2021||Pratibha Chauhan||Himachal bypoll: Bragta to dent BJP vote bank, Rohit Thakur to benefit||Tribune News ServiceShimla, October 28The Jubbal-Kotkhai Assembly byelection is set for a keen triangular contest. The presence of BJP rebel Chetan Bragta in the fray as an Independent candidate is bound to make a dent in the ruling party’s vote bank.There has been a virtual revolt in the Jubbal-Kotkhai BJP Mandal as all office-bearers deserted the party over the denial of ticket to Chetan Bragta, leaving it in an awkward position. Chetan, son of former minister Narinder Bragta, was denied the ticket at the last minute, angering party workers and evoking sympathy.The turmoil in the BJP is bound to benefit Congress candidate Rohit Thakur, who is hoping to romp home comfortably. Rohit, grandson of former Chief Minister Ram Lal Thakur, is a mild mannered and affable person. He has a political legacy, which he has protected ably. As such, the fight though seems triangular is primarily between Rohit Thakur and Chetan Bragta; BJP candidate Neelam Saraik is clearly lagging behind. The revolt in the party has left her practically without any organisational backup.The resentment among apple farmers is also haunting the BJP. Narinder Bragta, a former Horticulture Minister, had vociferously raised issues concerning the apple growers. Adverse remarks by Horticulture Minister Mahender Singh on apple marketing had enraged apple growers, who could give vent to their anger in the byelection.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-bypoll-bragta-to-dent-bjp-vote-bank-rohit-thakur-to-benefit-331137

29-10-2021||Ambika Sharma||Nauni university’s French bean variety recognised at nat’l level||Tribune News ServiceSolan,October 28French bean cultivar Lakshmi (P-37), developed by a team of the Department of Vegetable Science, Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Nauni, has been recognised at the national level. This variety was bred by a team of university scientists, led by late Prof AK Singh, in 1991.Ready in 60-70 daysThe cultivar gets ready for harvesting in 60-70 days after sowing. It bears string-less, meaty, straight, green pods which are approximately 15 cm in length and has a yield of 160-170 quintals per hectare. Dr AK Joshi, Head, Department of vegetable scienceThough the variety was developed three decades ago, its cultivation largely remained confined to Himachal only. Scientists of the Department ofVegetable Science have been working on its maintenance, multiplication, and dissemination.A team of All India Coordinated Research Project on Vegetable Crops (AICRP-VC), comprising Dr AK Joshi, Dr Ramesh Kumar Bhardwaj, Dr Sandeep Kansal, Dr Kuldeep Thakur and Dr DK Mehta, have been undertaking its testing and adoption at the national level. In the recently held 39th Group Meeting of AICRP-VC organised virtually at the Indian Institute of Vegetable Research, Varanasi, the Lakshmi cultivar was adjudged the best national cultivar.Explaining the advantages of the variety, Dr AK Joshi, Head, Department of Vegetable Science, said, “The cultivar gets ready for harvesting in 60-70 days after sowing. It bears string-less, meaty, straight, green pods which are approximately 15 cm in length and has a yield of 160-170 quintals per hectare.”Dr Joshi said the cultivar outperformed other pole-type cultivars of French bean even after 30 years of its release in different agro-climatic zones of India.The university advocates the use of this variety in the relay-cropping system which is being practised by farmers of mid-hills, where it is cultivated in between the rows of tomatoes. This can enhance productivity and income up to Rs 35,000 on the same land in a season.Appreciating the efforts of the team, Vice Chancellor Dr Parvinder Kaushal said the recommendation at the national level is a testament to the quality of the variety and a tribute to its breeder.Dr Kaushal opined that the recommendation at the national level is a step towards enhancing farmers’ income. He advised the scientists to explore avenues where the popular varieties released by the university could be promoted for cultivation at the national level too.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/nauni-universitys-french-bean-variety-recognised-at-natl-level-331180
