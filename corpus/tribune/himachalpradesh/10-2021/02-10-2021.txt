Penpa Tsering said that today also coincides with the 72nd founding anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party and through issuing the counter-response titled 70 Years of Occupation and Oppression, the CTA vehemently declares that there was nothing to celebrate about the day.The conference was also attended by Secretary Karma Choeying of the Department of International Relations, CTA’s official spokesperson Tenzin Lekshay, Tibetan Policy Institute (TPI) Director Dawa Tsering, and Senior Researcher Dr Tenzin Desal.In his address, Penpa Tsering said the 96-page official response released by the CTA comprehensively highlights the factual chronological events countering China’s narrative on Tibet regarding the historical status of Tibet while also opposing China’s legitimising the occupation of Tibet.“It is absolutely not 70 years of liberation, but in fact, 70 years of suppression and oppression”, said Penpa Tsering.He added that the so-called Peaceful Liberation of Tibet claimed by China was just a disguise to cloak the truth and misinform both Chinese people and the global community to advance the Chinese Communist Party’s ideology.The official response of the CTA details the facts of the landmark 17 points agreement and its successive violations by the Chinese counterpart.“The education policy implemented by China in the past 70 years is only aimed at the destruction of Tibetan language and hence, Tibetan identity,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/middle-way-approach-only-solution-to-tibet-conflict-318896

The Nigam’s shared vision was to emerge as a 25,000 MW company by 2040, he added.Sharma said, “The SJVN has developed expertise and raised efficiency levels. There will be no cost or time overrun in projects under construction and the problem of silting in the 1,500 MW Nathpa-Jhakri project has been solved to a large extend by an in-house technology and the repairs that earlier took about 70 days are being done in eight to 10 days”.He said that the SJVN would invest Rs 75,000 crore by 2030, including Rs 23,000 crore in Himachal. The SJVN had signed six MOUs with the Himachal Government during the Global Investors’ Meet in Dharamsala in November 2019 and the work had started on two projects. The work was about to start on the third project while the survey and the preparation of a DPR was underway with regard to the remaining three projects, he added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/stakeholders-nod-will-be-taken-for-hydel-projects-in-himachal-sjvn-318897

The state agencies are yet to take any action but a few local NGOs have come forward to treat stray animals dying in different parts of Palampur and its adjoining areas.The disease is a contagious viral infection. “In Palampur, over 30 stray animals are critical, with cows being the most affected,” said Parminder Bhatia, head of the Sani Sewa Sadan, who has come forward to treat stray animals in the town.Though the state government has vaccinated the animals under the Central Government’s National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP), the vaccination drive is yet to reach in rural areas. The drive was halted midway.During a visit to various villages, residents told The Tribune that animals were dying every day. They also alleged that the Animal Husbandry Department was not extending any help to the villagers.A senior professor of the Animal and Veterinary Sciences Department of the CSK HPKV University confirmed that a large number of animals were coming to to the vet clinic daily for the treatment of foot and mouth disease.Palampur SDM Amit Guleria said that he had requested the Animal Husbandry Department to start a massive drive to treat animals and control the disease.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/foot-mouth-disease-kills-milch-cattle-in-palampur-318898

We have lost everything else as there was no time to take any belongings,” said a crestfallen Adityavir Thakur, who works at a school. He had bought the top floor of the ill-fated building five years ago for about Rs 40 lakh, and that too, with the savings of his father and grandfather.“Though the panic had set in about 10 days back, architects and engineers assured us that the foundation would be strengthened to prevent collapse,” said another flat owner.The building had developed cracks on September 29 and the administration, too, had been alerted, who got the building evacuated yesterday morning.DC Aditya Negi said four other buildings, two above and two below the collapsed building had also been evacuated yesterday. He said polythene sheets had been spread to prevent further seepage.The seven affected families today waited anxiously for the administration to let them retrieve whatever little could be saved, but they were not allowed to go near the site.Now, questions are being raised on the failure of the authorities concerned in checking if there were any violations as per the approved building plan, the ownership of the land on which the building was raised and if the basement was dug, which could have triggered the disaster.Principal Secretary, TCP, Rajneesh maintained that the directives of the NGT were being honoured in letter and spirit.Some locals said Kachi Ghati, as the name suggests, had come up on loose strata of debris dumped during construction in the main town. Several high-rise buildings have come up there despite the area not being suitable for such heavy structures.The incident has exposed the haphazard construction, though majorly curbed by the National Green Tribunal order, banning all new construction in the Core and Green Zone and restricting new buildings in other parts of the town to a mere two-and-a-half storey.QUESTIONS BEING RAISED||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/their-world-came-crashing-down-within-a-split-second-318907

She would contest the elections, as per her wishes. The party holds former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh and his family in high regard.About the issues on which the Congress would contest the elections, Rathore said that in Shimla district the exploitation of apple farmers by corporates and middlemen this year would be the rallying point.

Besides, they can rope in any expert in case they feel their opinion is required,” said Rajneesh, Principal Secretary, TCP and Urban Development. He said the government had taken a serious note of the incident and all corrective measures would be taken to prevent recurrence of such mishaps.The building had been granted approval by the Nagar Panchayat in 2003, before the area was brought under Special Area Development Authority (SADA) the same year. The area of Kachi Ghati was merged into Shimla MC in 2006. “On bare perusal of the record, permission was granted by Nagar Panchayat for a six-storey structure. The three-member committee will look into all other aspects which led to the collapse,” said Ashish Kohli, Commissioner, Shimla Municipal Corporation.The multi-storied building, including a sloping roof (attic) and a basement, collapsed yesterday after its foundation was weakened due to seepage of water. Though there was no loss of life, the collapse threatened at least five nearby buildings, including a hotel, all of which have been evacuated, said Deputy Commissioner Aditya Negi.The incident comes within a week of the rap from NGT, which rejected state government’s plea to allow construction of a lift, ramp, visitors’ room and parking at the secretariat. The NGT also refused any relaxation in the limit of two and a half storeys fixed by it earlier, within the state capital. The courts have also barred the government from bringing about yet another retention policy, with six already being there.Out of the over 25,000 unauthorised constructions in the state awaiting regularisation, a majority are located in the Shimla Planning Area and that too on steep slopes and sliding zones. The fact that the state capital is still expanding on the basis of the 1979 Interim Development Plan (IDP) speaks volumes of the scant regard being paid towards regulated and planned growth by successive regimes, despite adverse remarks by the courts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/panel-to-probe-shimla-building-collapse-318951
