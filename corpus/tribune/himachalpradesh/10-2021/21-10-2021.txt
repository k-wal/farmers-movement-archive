The party urged the High Court to take cognisance of the scam and cancel the wrongful admissions.Attacking the VC and other top administrators, the CPM asked what procedure was being followed for the admissions. “Even if the university had reserved seats for the children of the faculty, was this facility extended to all employees or just to the children of top administrators,” the CPM questioned.Ridiculing the university’s explanation that it would help the children of university’s lower-rank employees to get higher education, CPM secretary Babu Ram asked whether the VC was also a lower-ranked employee of the university. The party members said they would launch an agitation against these wrongful admissions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/take-notice-of-wrong-admissions-cpm-to-himachal-hc-327311

He was a prominent Rajput leader of Kangra district. He was elected as an MLA from Fatehpur in 2002, 2012 and 2017.The Congress has fielded his son Bhawani Singh Pathania. Bhawani had been in a corporate job in Mumbai and was not in touch with the electorate. He has decided to carry forward the legacy of his father. He is banking on the sympathy of voters for his father, besides the issues of price rise and rising unemployment, to win the election.The BJP has fielded Baldev Thakur, a local party worker. There was a campaign in the BJP to field a local candidate. Baldev is a ground-level worker that is his strength. However, he is also battling infighting. Baldev had contested as an Independent in 2017 against the party candidate Kirpal Parmar. He took about 13,000 votes and Kirpal lost by a narrow margin of just about 2,000 votes.Kirpal was again lobbying for ticket but the party chose Baldev over him. Kirpal supporters have not forgotten Baldev’s role in the previous election. The BJP leader is demanding votes, claiming that an MLA of the ruling party can bring development in the area.Rajan Sushant, former BJP MP from Kangra, was the third serious contender. Rajan had also represented the Fatehpur constituency in 1998 and 2007. He left the BJP just before the 2019 parliamentary poll and became the state chief of AAP. Now, he is contesting as an Independent.Rajan has been working and holding dharnas in Fatehpur for the past six months. He is laying stress on the old age pension scheme implemented for 90,000 government employees recruited in Himachal after 2004. He has given up his pension to support the demand. His political fortune depends on the outcome of the byelection and he is leaving no stone unturned to win the battle.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-bypoll-infighting-continues-to-plague-bjp-congress-327268

Since per unit price of power has increased, the state has been making profit for the past one month or so,” said an official of the Himachal Pradesh State Load Dispatch Centre (HPSLDC), the agency that monitors the buying and selling of power in the state.Opinions page: Time to plan coal exit: The current power crisis has provided India an opportunity to consider renewablesSells hydro electricity at Rs14/unitThe official said the power rate jumped to the highest permissible limit of Rs 20 per unit on several occasions. “The price usually fluctuates between Rs 2.50 and Rs 6, but for at least 10 days in October the average price range has been Rs 11-14 a unit. The past few weeks have indeed been profitable,” he said. Much of the surplus power is going to the energy exchange. “We don’t have many bilateral power pacts where the price remains fixed. The exchange is market driven and rates are fixed as per demand and supply on a daily basis,” the official said.Against the per day consumption of 3 lakh units, the state is currently generating 4.30 lakh units. “Though the generation is coming down gradually, we still have 1.30 lakh surplus units every day,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/amid-coal-crisis-windfall-for-power-surplus-himachal-327255
