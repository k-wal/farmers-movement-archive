Our entire fleet of around 3,500 buses stayed off the road,” said union’s state president Rajesh Parashar.Seeking exemption in road taxMeanwhile, some efforts have begun at the government level to make the private operators call off the strike. “We will have a high-level meeting tomorrow morning to find some solution,” said a senior government official.With Himachal Pradesh Road Transport (HRTC) also not plying buses on all its routes and private operators taking all their buses off the road, the general public faced problems at different places.“As people have restricted their travel because of the pandemic, the strike did not cause much problem to the public. Yes, people faced some problem during peak hours, but we couldn’t have helped it,” said Parashar.Meanwhile, the HRTC has asked all its depots to run additional buses to ensure people did not face much inconvenience because of the strike. “In the urban areas, we didn’t see much problem because HRTC increased its buses. But in the rural areas, where only a handful of HRTC and private buses play, people did face problems. In many buses in rural areas, overcrowding was also seen because of the shortage of buses,” said Kaushal Mongta, a zila parishad member from Saraswati Nagar, Rohru.Toughening their stand further, Parashar said if their demands for the exemption of road tax and grant of working capital were not met in the next couple of days, the union start taking measures like hunger strike.“We could also start burning down the buses in case the government doesn’t lend a helping hand to us,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/strike-successful-claim-himachal-pradesh-bus-operators-247945

While the hospital’s own ambulance broke down years back, the 108 Ambulance has not been operational since December. Given the remote location of the place and the raging pandemic, the non-availability of a functional ambulance could prove dangerous to local people.“We have apprised the Chief Minister, Secretary Health, local MLA, CMO Shimla and BMO about the problem but nothing has been done so far,” said Lokender Chauhan, a local youth. “The CMO had visited the hospital on March 23 and she had assured us that a new ambulance would be provided within 15 days. More than a month-and-a-half has passed since then, but again nothing has happened,” he said.Incidentally, the hospital caters to around 20,000 people of the area. Besides, the hospital is short on staff and facilities. Therefore, most cases have to be referred to other centres like Solan and Shimla, both around 150 km away from the place.“We ask for ambulance generally from Haripurdhar or try and arrange taxis to shift the patients,” said a doctor from the hospital.A hospital employee said that sometimes ambulances are either not available at other hospitals or take long time coming. “Serious patients can’t wait that long and lose their lives waiting for the ambulance,” he said.Chauhan said the non-availability of functional ambulance is even more dangerous in the times of the pandemic.“What happens if a Covid patient isolated at home needs to be shifted immediately to either Shimla or Solan?” asked Chauhan. As per the doctor, there are around 20 patients in home isolation in the area.“We have written to the Chief Minister to again apprise him of the problem the people of the area are facing. We hope he will understand and do something about it,” said Chauhan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/kupvi-chc-caters-to-20-000-persons-but-has-no-ambulance-247946

Once, a person accepts the status, he no longer remains a simple individual only, but an integral part of governance.This was held by the High Court while dismissing a petition filed by a doctor challenging his transfer order issued on April 27. He had been transferred on deputation to the makeshift hospital, Palakwah, Una, from Civil Hospital, Dehra (Kangra).Rejecting the plea, a Division Bench comprising Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice CB Barowalia observed: “The petitioner cannot be permitted to shirk his duties and responsibilities. This tendency has to be strictly dealt with.”The court observed, “The petitioner has failed to realise that health workers, policemen and other frontline workers are already beset with an overwhelming load of Covid patients and are exhausted”.It said, “The state is fighting the grimmest battle against Covid, which is nothing short of a disaster, and, therefore, it is imperative that the frontline workers are made to work on a rotation basis or else the health system is likely to collapse.”The Bench observed, “This is rather an unfortunate case where a doctor, who had been ordered to be posted at a Covid makeshift hospital on deputation, has, instead of joining and protecting precious human lives, filed an instant writ petition, assailing the order.”The only ground for assailing the order of deputation was that the petitioner in 2018 had met with an accident and remained hospitalised for five months, therefore, be unable to serve at the place of deputation.It observed, “We gather an impression that the petitioner is trying to escape from duties that have now been assigned to him. We are quite sure that the petitioner, by claiming himself to be a frontline worker against the Covid fight, must have got himself vaccinated out of turn, but is now shirking his responsibility.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/high-court-dismisses-docs-plea-against-transfer-247958
