The visitors enjoy various adventure activities at the pass, besides the scenic view. Snow is witnessed on the pass till the end of June.Local residents had also urged the government to restore the Manali-Rohtang road so that the tourist hotspot does not lose its appeal. The livelihood of a large number of people is dependent upon tourist arrival at the Rohtang Pass. The tourism industry stakeholders are hopeful that the region would witness tourist arrival once the second wave of Covid subsides.During the peak tourist season, 1,200 vehicles having online permits are allowed to cross the Gulaba barrier for tourism purposes, as per the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to protect the fragile ecology of the region.Manali SDM Raman Gharsangi said that tourists would be allowed with the condition to follow the Covid protocols and the prevailing government guidelines. He added that permitted commercial activities could also take place. The administration would provide permits manually, as only a few tourists were visiting Manali. He added that the system of online permits could be restored later, if required.The permit for light motor vehicles and medium utility vehicles is available for Rs 550 and for heavy motor vehicles for Rs 600, including the congestion charges of Rs 50 and Rs 100, respectively.Himachal Pradesh Travel Agents Association president Budhi Parkash Thakur said that the Rohtang Pass is a world famous tourist destination and the backbone of the tourism industry in Manali. He added that tourists prefer to visit Kothi, Gulaba and Marhi during the winter as well and efforts should be made to keep the flow of tourist traffic smooth till the snowpoint on the Manali-Rohtang road throughout the year. He said that online permits should be provided to avoid crowding to seek manual permits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bro-restores-rohtang-pass-traffic-to-resume-after-2-days-260615

The district authorities seem to be dithering over taking action in the case.MLA’s claimArun Kumar, MLA, has been claiming that there was a time when the patients were not getting beds anywhere in Kangra district. People were coming to him for help and he, as a public representative, had got them admitted to non-Covid Civil Hospital.In a statement issued today, HPCC secretary Ajay Verma and Nagrota Bagwan block Congress committee president Mann Singh alleged that the action should be taken against health officials for keeping Covid patients in the Civil Hospital.They alleged that the BJP MLA was claiming that he facilitated the admission of a large number of Covid patients to the hospital. The district health authorities had been maintaining that the hospital was never notified as Covid centre.The leaders alleged that the MLA was behind the spread of the virus in Nagrota Bagwan and a case should be registered against him and the doctors, who were in-charge of the hospital under the Disaster Management Act.Meanwhile, Arun Kumar has been claiming that there was a time when the patients were not getting bed anywhere in Kangra district. The people were coming to him for help and he, as a public representative, had helped them.However, by claiming that the corona patients were not getting beds in Kangra, the MLA has questioned the working of his party government.As per reports, the mother of his personal assistant had tested positive on May 15 and was admitted to the Covid hospital, Paprola. However, after just four days, she was moved from Paprola to Nagrota Bagwan hospital.The CMO, who had marked an inquiry into the incident, said the report was yet to be received. Only the DC could notify a hospital as Covid facility and no notification was issued in this regard.When asked if the doctors had committed a mistake by keeping Covid patients in general hospital, he said anything could be said after the inquiry report was received. About the claims of the MLA that he got treated many such patients in the hospital, the CMO refused to comment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/congress-wants-fir-against-nagrota-mla-doctors-260619

These people were unable to visit the nearby vaccination centre due to the lack of road connectivity.Pharmacist Ramesh Verma, health workers Kala Thakur and Yachan were part of that health team that put efforts to visit this remote panchayat to vaccinate people. These health employees are being appreciated by people of Mandi for their courage and dedication towards their duty.Residents of the area said the state government had approved a link road for this panchayat a few years ago. However, the construction work was going on at a sluggish pace.Tilak Chauhan, pradhan of the Sartoyala gram panchayat, told The Tribune that the panchayat area was scattered and many residents had to cover a 13-km distance on foot to reach the panchayat office. Due to the ongoing construction of a road in the area, the pedestrian path leading to this panchayat, too, is damaged at a few places. As a result, it was tough for the health team to climb up a hilltop or descend from the hill to reach the panchayat area without the help of a JCB machine.”“As many as around 40 residents of this panchayat were vaccinated at their door step at Sartyola by the health team on the request of the gram panchayat. These senior citizens were unable to visit the vaccination centre at Mahunaag. We are thankful to the health authorities for facilitating vaccine at people’s doorstep,” he said.Karsog MLA Hiral Lal announced that these health employees would be honoured for their dedication.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/health-officials-take-help-of-jcb-machine-to-reach-remote-village-260620

Gandhi added that the government had announced an interest subvention and working capital loan scheme for the stakeholders last year but because of the stringent norms hardly anyone could avail of the facility. The Tourism Department organised video conferences meeting with the hoteliers on April 19 for taking their feedback on the scheme and reassured them that it would be modified for the benefit of the stakeholders but even after one and a half month nothing had been done.The government had announced relief on property tax, electricity, water charges and all renewal fees but unfortunately nothing concrete emerged and all promises remain verbal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/hoteliers-seek-relief-threaten-to-launch-protest-260621

The action of the Solan police was politically motivated, taken at the behest of local BJP leaders.He said that ever since the BJP lost the Municipal Corporation elections in Solan in April, it had let loose vendetta against the businessmen of Solan, holding them responsible for its defeat.
