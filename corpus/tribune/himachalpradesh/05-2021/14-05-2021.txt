Beneficiaries will be informed of their turn two days in advance. Beneficiaries must register for the vaccination programme beforehand. There will be no on-site registrations.The state government has planned some 1,070 sessions in all 12 districts of the state. Of this, 228 will be held in Kangra, the largest district and also the most affected  by the pandemic. The rest dividebd thus:  Mandi (154); Shimla (136); Solan (98); Sirmaur (82); Una (79); Chamba (78); Kullu (71); Hamirpur (66); Bilaspur (59);  Kinnaur (14); Lahaul and Spiti (5). Authorities said the number of sessions was decided on the basis of population according to the 2011 Census.Kangra district 21.26 per cent of the state’s population, followed by Mandi (14.39 per cent); Shimla (12.7) and Solan (9.13). These are also the most affected districts in the state. Additionally, more doses have been allocated to four districts that have more than 30 per cent positivity rate—Sirmaur (38.4%), Shimla (34.10%), Solan (31.10%) and Mandi (30.60%).In a bid to cope with a staff crunch, CMOs have told not to hold vaccination sessions for other age groups on these days.  Sites having large catchment areas like the urban clusters would be consistent in vaccination while those in the rural areas can be rotated to ensure equity.Spacious places like schools can be used to avoid overcrowding. Health officials could coordinate with Deputy Commissioners and Superintendents of Police to ensure law and order at these sites.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-to-start-vaccinating-people-between-18-and-44-on-may-17-252825

Sources say that the health authorities with the help of philanthropists have procured enough oxygen cylinders for the existing bed capacity of Covid hospitals in Kangra but there are not enough regulators fitted with flow meters and humidifiers.They say that the health authorities are trying to procure regulators through which oxygen can be supplied to two patients at a time from one cylinder. The authorities believe that as the number of patients requiring oxygen due to Covid is increasing every day, they may not be able to procure enough cylinders. If a sufficient number of regulators for oxygen cylinders are procured, the problem of cylinder shortage can also be sorted out.The sources say that the district administration is unable to procure oxygen regulators because of its acute shortage in the country. The administration has urged the state government for help in procuring oxygen regulators. It has also requested ministers in the state government and Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur for help to procure or import oxygen regulators.They say that generally oxygen regulators are imported. These days, several countries have banned commercial flights from India and so the import of oxygen cylinder regulators is proving to be difficult.Besides, there is a shortage of cylinder regulators in Una and Chamba districts as well. The sources say that regulators are not available in markets as many people are keeping oxygen support systems at their homes. Earlier, only hospitals or industries used these regulators.Deputy Commissioner, Kangra, Rakesh Prajapati admits that there is a shortage of oxygen cylinder regulators in the district. He says that the government is trying to procure regulators and he hopes that these will be available with the Kangra health authorities at the earliest.He says that the bed capacity in the district has been raised to above 500. “There is enough supply of oxygen and oxygen cylinders in the district.

An all-party meeting prior to it will help create a common approach to deal with the situation,” it said, assuring its support in the fight against the pandemic.The CPM said an ordinance should be passed to check the hoarding of and overcharging for all life-saving drugs.

14-05-2021||Shimla||Rising positivity rate in Himachal’s 4 districts a worry||A high positivity rate of 26.3 per cent in Himachal has placed the state’s health services under a tremendous strain. The positivity and fatality rate has been on the rise for the past one week with 66 deaths recorded on Wednesday and 63 on Thursday. The count is too high for a small state like HP.The state saw a jump of 6 per cent in positivity rate within a week. The fatality rate stands at 1.42. The active cases have touched a record 40,000 while the total cases since the outbreak of the pandemic have crossed the 1.50 lakh mark.Weddings and Kumbh returnees have proved to be super-spreaders. Even though the state government claims to produce more oxygen than is required, families who have lost their dear ones blame non-availability of the life-saving gas for the deaths. Alarmingly, the positivity rate has crossed 30 per cent in four districts — Sirmaur (38.4%), Shimla (34.10%), Solan (31.10%) and Mandi (30.60%).Even though the government has imposed a Covid curfew, the damage has already been done. The recent decision of the government to restrict the number of invitees to weddings to 20 has come rather late.Kangra has been the worst-hit, reporting 1,277 new cases and 15 deaths on Thursday. Managing the swelling number of patients requiring hospitalisation has become a daunting task for the district administration. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/rising-positivity-rate-in-himachals-4-districts-a-worry-252569
