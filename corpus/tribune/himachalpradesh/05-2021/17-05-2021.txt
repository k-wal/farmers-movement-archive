The ruling BJP has 44 MLAs in the 67-member House and they are expected to remain in touch with their constituents, especially during such an unprecedented calamity, said party insiders while pointing out the failing at a recent meeting.Top officials of corporations should also actively involve themselves in supplementing the efforts of the government and lead the cadre from the front, the office-bearers felt.Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur too had recently asked MLAs and other senior leaders to visit families which had lost their members to the pandemic and help them with the last rites.The violation of instructions like capping the number of guests at weddings has added to the spurt in Covid cases in villages, said a BJP leader.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/weak-reachout-by-himachal-pradesh-mlas-bjp-cadre-upset-253956

Thanks to our dedicated volunteers, whom we pay just Rs 6,000 per month as honorarium, we have managed to provide this service without any interruption. Shifting the bodies to mortuary, wrapping up the patients declared brought dead and transporting the bodies to crematorium, this NGO, Lok Kalyan Samiti, has been working tirelessly to ensure dignified cremation to even those abandoned by their family members.“We have been handling Covid dead bodies and patients at the IGMC for almost a year now. We have a small team of 10-12 volunteers. By the grace of god, not a single person has tested positive so far even though we have handled and transported around 450 bodies to crematorium,” said Rajesh Saraswati, the NGO administrator.The NGO has been working at the IGMC for over a decade now. Before Covid, it was into helping out poor and helpless patients with food, medicine, blood donation, etc. “When the designated staff showed reluctance to handle dead bodies, we offered our services. Thanks to our dedicated volunteers, whom we pay just Rs 6,000 per month as honorarium, we have managed to provide this service without any interruption,” said Saraswati.Even after having seen and handled hundreds of bodies over the last one year, many abandoned by their family members, the volunteers have not allowed fatigue, fear or stress to bog them down.“Someone had to do this. We consider ourselves lucky that that we got an opportunity to do it,” said Yoginder Rana, a volunteer from Kumarsain. “It’s really painful to see family members not even coming close to the dead. It’s moments like these that motivate us to keep doing what we are doing,” he said.Most of these volunteers have not been home since last year. “There’s absolutely no time to go home. We have not taken a day off for the last many months. Besides, we avoid going home fearing we might pass on the infection to our family,” said Vijay, who hails from Aani.With Covid deaths being reported from homes as well, the NGO has started home service free of cost. “In the case of a Covid death at home in MC limits, our volunteers pick up the body and transport it to the crematorium without any charges,” said Saraswati.While these volunteers are going beyond the call of duty to serve humanity without any grudge or complain, they are pained to see some bodies abandoned by their family members. “Please don’t do this, don’t let fear overpower you. There’s no danger if one takes proper precautions,” said Vimal Thakur, organizing secretary of the NGO.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/ngo-working-tirelessly-for-victims-253962

Nurpur SDM Dr Surinder Thakur confirmed that the administration had received the offer from over one dozen teams of such 100 volunteers.He said the administration would ensure that cremation of Covid victims would be performed with active participation of these volunteers in the presence of at least one senior government official under strict Covid protocol. He said during the past three days, the assistance of these volunteers had already been taken in cremating Covid victims at Kandwal, Domal, Khazan, Mamooh-Gurchal, Jonta and Nagabari villages.Some local social organisations, family charitable trusts and individuals have also donated adequate quantity of medicines and health check-up devices such as digital thermometers, pulse oximeters etc.A group of youths in the town has started a food helpline called ‘Mission Ann Seva’ for delivering home cooked meals twice a day to Covid patients undergoing home isolation.

A long wait for approvals from the TCP has given rise to illegal constructions in the area. An architect at Bir says that he had submitted the site plans of six buildings in the TCP office two years ago, but was yet to get approval.Several people have applied for approvals of site plans for residential and commercial buildings in the past one year, but they are yet to get a response from the TCP.Unplanned constructions have reduced the open area in this hill resort, posing a threat to the security of flyers. In the past few years, a sudden increase in the number of tourists has led to the mushrooming of hotels, shops and restaurants in the area. Hardly any open area is left for flyers for safe landing. Haphazard constructions near the landing site is a serious issue. Besides, wrong parking near the landing site has made things worse.Tourists say if timely action is not taken, no place will be left for landing and it will be a major setback to the hill resort. The SADA has imposed various taxes like green tax and fee for pilots, but there are no facilities for tourists. In Billing, there is no washroom and similar is the situation at Bir, Chogan and Tibetan Colony.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/unplanned-constructions-mar-bir-billing-beauty-253966

The case fatality rate (CFR) in Himachal Pradesh is 1.42 per cent with districts such as Sirmaur, Shimla, Solan and Mandi having a positivity rate of over 30, which is certainly alarming.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/in-covid-second-wave-most-fatalities-in-50-60-age-group-in-himachal-253943

The university has stated that no excuse would be entertained for not appearing in the interview.The decision of the university has puzzled candidates as public transport has been suspended during the curfew which has now been extended in Himachal till May 26. The interviewsfor over a dozen posts of assistant professor, associate professor and professor in the departments ofeconomics and physicsand the International Centre for Distance Education and Open Learning (ICDEOL) are scheduled from May 25 to 28.It has been clearly mentioned in the letter sent to candidates on May 6 that “no argument or plea such as breakdown of bus or rail service, non-receipt of call letter, illness will be accepted for non-appearance in the personal interview”. Candidates said the language of the letter reeked of “insensitivity” of the authorities.Some applicants said they were apprehensive that any exposure at this time could put their lives at risk. They also questioned the rationale behind taking hasty decisions.A teacher said the interview should be postponed till the situation improves and the university should be sensitive in such a critical time.The university had advertised 300 posts of teaching and non-teaching staff, out of which 125 had been filled.

These taxes should be reduced considerably to help the taxi operators in the current Covid crisis as they are facing huge financial crisis.“Ever since corona curfew was imposition in the state, I am sitting idle at my home. I was using my vehicle as a taxi, which is the sole source of income. Now as I can’t operate my taxi it is getting difficult to meet daily expenditure of my family,” Praveen Sharma, a taxi operator in Mandi town, said.Like Praveen Sharma, there are a large number of other taxi operators and taxi drivers across the state, who have lost their livelihood.Mahender Gularia, president of taxi operators union, Mandi, said that during corona curfew many people were using their private vehicles for commercial purpose to ferry people from one place to other in an illegal way.“So, we urge the state government to allow taxis to operate observing Covid protocol across the state, which will be a huge relief for us. In Mandi district alone, there are around 2,000 taxis, which are off road since the corona curfew was imposed,” he said.“We urge Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur to understand the plight of the taxi operators and take a decision accordingly for their welfare across the state as soon as possible,” he demanded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/in-financial-distress-taxi-drivers-urge-himachal-govt-to-allow-service-253955
