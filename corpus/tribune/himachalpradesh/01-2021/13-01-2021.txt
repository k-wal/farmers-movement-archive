Hundreds of voters are missing from the SEC’s lists in almost every panchayat, Sharma alleged in a statement issued here.He claimed that names of those who voted in the last panchayat and assembly elections and who even have voter ID cards are also missing from the voter list.“Even my name has been found missing. When such kind of negligence or conspiracy can happen to an ex-minister, then one can easily understand the anguish of a common man,” he added.Sharma claimed the names of voters were deleted as part of a “well-thought-out conspiracy” as most of them are those who support the Congress party’s ideology.He said he would approach the high court so that the SEC can be questioned on the big difference between the electoral rolls of the last Vidhan Sabha elections, Panchayati Raj elections and the upcoming polls and why thousands of voters of the state are being “denied” the right to vote.The counting of votes for the PRI elections will be taken up on January 22. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/ex-hp-minister-claims-names-of-hundreds-of-voters-missing-from-electoral-rolls-in-every-panchayat-197941

One, it is not possible to start the ‘one nation, one card’ scheme until the biometric system is not functional,” said Food and Civil Supplies Director Abid Hussain. “Two, it will help stop leakages. A person will not get ration without the biometric authentication,” he said. As many as 18 states have resumed the biometric authentication.The Director said the standard-operating procedures (SOPs) had been drafted and sent to all PDS shops to ensure the safety. “The SOPs like sanitisation of machines after use and no crowding around the shops will be followed,” said Hussain.As for the use of iris scanners for identification of the consumers, Hussain said the plan would not fructify before April next year. “We got EPoS machines checked for compatibility with iris scanners. Unfortunately, the machines were not found compatible,” he said.“The contract of our current vendor expires in April 2022. So, we are thinking of floating an RFP in which we will ask for machines compatible with iris scanners,” he said.The department had planned to have iris scanners at fair price shops by April. Besides negating the need to touch the machines, the use of iris scanners will bring down the cases of fingerprint mismatch reported in biometric devices.“There are about 5 per cent to 7 per cent complaints in fingerprint mismatch in biometric system. With iris scanners, it will come down to 1 per cent,” said Hussain.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/biometric-system-back-for-pds-consumers-in-himachal-197562
