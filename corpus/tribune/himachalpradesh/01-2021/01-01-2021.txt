01-01-2021||Shimla/Chandigarh||Chandigarh, most of Punjab and Haryana, colder than Shimla; read why||Chandigarh and most of the plains in Punjab and Haryana were on Friday colder than the 'Queen of Hills' ‚ÄîShimla.The reason: the sun is shining brightly in Himachal Pradesh these days while a thick blanket of fog refuses to lift off from most parts of the northern Indian plains.Many places on the plains‚ÄîAmritsar, Ludhiana, Patiala, Ambala and Hisar were colder than hilly tourist destinations Shimla, Kufri, Dharamsala and Dalhousie in Himachal Pradesh, the Met Office in Chandigarh said.Chandigarh, located in the Shivalik foothills, recorded a minimum temperature at 6.1 degrees Celsius, while Shimla, located around 7,000 feet above sea level, saw a low of 6.8 degrees, Kufri 4.8 degrees, Dalhousie at 7 degrees and Dharamsala 3.2 degrees Celsius.Shimla, the Queen of Hills, is recording the 'warmest' days owing to long sunny spells, while cities like Chandigarh, Amritsar, Karnal, New Delhi and Lucknow, located in the plains, are reeling under a severe cold wave as the sun remains fogged out. Some parts of Delhi recorded 1.1 degree Celsius, coldest so far this season.Hill destinations have been experiencing long hours of sunny weather for over a week and the day temperatures in most places have risen. The dry weather would prevail till January 4, the Met office in Shimla said.But nights and mornings are intensely cold.Data accessed from the weather bureau indicates the weather in hill destinations of Shimla, Kufri, Narkanda, Chail, Kasauli, Dharamsala, Palampur, Dalhousie and Manali is 'warmer' in the day, perfect for a break from the biting chill of the plains."What a pleasant sun in Shimla. In Delhi, basking under the sun these days is a rare occasion," said tourist Sahil Khanna."We are enjoying the long sunny days," his wife Shilpi added.Manmohan Singh, director of the meteorological department in Shimla, told IANS that the maximum temperatures increased by one-two degrees due to prevailing dry weather.He said the humidity level of plus 80 per cent causes fog."In the plains it is more than 80 per cent. However, in the hills it's around 50 per cent these days."Hisar in Haryana shivered at minus 1.2 degrees Celsius, while it was 0.2 degree in Narnaul, 4.4 degrees in Ambala and 3.5 degrees in Karnal.Punjab's Faridkot recorded a low of 0.2 degree Celsius."It will be bright and sunny till January 4, when there are chances of widespread snow and rain in the state," added Singh.

01-01-2021||Ambika Sharma---||Shortage of urea hits Paonta, Shillai farmers||Tribune News Service Solan, December 31 The shortage of urea  has severely hit farm operations in Paonta Sahib and Shillai areas of Sirmaur district for over a month.  Urea is chiefly used by wheat growers during sowing, which begins from November 15. The Himachal Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing and Consumer‚Äôs Federation (HIMFED) is the state‚Äôs nodal agency for supplying fertilisers  to farmers. Besides,  IFFCO has also been authorised to   enrol cooperative societies  for supplying  fertilisers to farmers. A  HIMFED field  official, while agreeing to the shortage of urea in the Paonta Sahib area, said the supply was much less than the demand and the stock of societies was nil in December. She  informed that the societies generally secured urea from IFFCO and in case they were unable to get the requisite stock, they are provided by HIMFED. ‚ÄúThe supply of urea has been much less than the requirement since the last few months. Against the requirement of about 10,000 to 15,000 bags for Paonta Sahib used last year, barely 6,000 to 7,000 bags were available this year since November 15.‚Äù Grown over 26,700 hectares, the district produces 53,400 metric tonnes of wheat  annually. The crop which is sown from November 15 to December 15 is generally harvested in April and May. Managing Director, HIMFED, KK Sharma said the quota of fertilisers is allocated by the Government of India and the rack amounting to 26,000 metric tonnes has already been exhausted by the state. He  said about 10 metric tonnes of urea, which was an additional requirement,  would be made available from National Fertilizers Limited tomorrow in the Paonta Sahib area. Other areas battling with the shortage will also be provided urea at the earliest, he assured.  Congress leader Aninder Singh Notty said the shortage of urea has been plaguing the Paonta Sahib and Shillai areas and sowing of wheat was severely hit. It was neither available in time not in adequate quantity, and officials  of HIMFED were unable to give any satisfactory response. He alleged that the capacity of urea-producing plants had been reduced by 33 per cent by the Union Government since 2019  which will lead to lesser  agrarian produce.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/shortage-of-urea-hits-paonta-shillai-farmers-192128

According to the police, till 8 pm today, 8,966 vehicles entered Shimla, while 5,645 vehicles left the town. Data showed that from December 29, a total of 22,910 vehicles had entered Shimla while 15,966 vehicles had returned. The huge influx resulted in most parking lots being packed to capacity, forcing visitors to park along the roads.The influx of such a large number of tourists despite night curfew in Shimla has brought cheer to the beleaguered hotel industry which has been reeling under the impact of Covid since March. Most hotels have received good bookings after a long gap since Christmas, which is expected to continue through the week. The hoteliers were demanding lifting of the night curfew but the government chose to tread cautiously and continued with the restrictions.The tourists danced to the tune of music being played on The Ridge to ring in the New Year with police personnel having a harrowing time, asking everyone to keep their masks on. However, all festivities will have to come to a halt at 10 pm when night curfew starts.Certain parts of the town, especially Cart Road where parking lots are located, witnessed traffic jam though in other parts, traffic continued to move at a snail‚Äôs pace. The trial run of the musical fountain on The Ridge, next to the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, proved to be a new attraction for tourists as well as locals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/covid-curbs-fail-to-deter-revellers-192141
