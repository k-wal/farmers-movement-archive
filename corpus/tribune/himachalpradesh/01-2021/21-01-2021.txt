The ground floor will continue to house the bus stand. A sum of Rs 21.50 crore has been spent on its construction and it will facilitate tourists, who have to struggle to park their vehicles in the peak tourist season.To end traffic woesThe then Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced Rs 15 crore for the project in September 2017 during her visit to the town.Vehicles are parked along roadsides all over the town not only creating a mess in the peak tourist season but also causing inconvenience to pedestrians.Aman Gupta, a local businessman, said, “The coming up of this parking will boost tourism as people face parking woes in the town. It will also facilitate the locals as an earmarked and safe parking will be available.”Its completion has been delayed by several months owing to the absence of labourers in the wake of Covid outbreak and delay in shifting of high tension electricity lines.However, a few locals expressed reservations over parking rates announced by the cantonment authorities. A sum of Rs 400 per day has been fixed for a car and this was in addition to Rs 100 one has to pay as entry fee for taking one’s vehicle inside the town.Devinder Gupta, vice-president, Cantonment Board, said rates were reasonable with Rs 100 being fixed for the first four hours and Rs 20 per subsequent hour and Rs 400 per vehicle fixed for 24-hour parking.Terming it a boon for the cantonment town which faces scarcity of space, he said, “A sum of Rs 21.50 crore has been incurred on this project which will accommodate 500 vehicles.

As per these amendments, no construction shall be allowed within a radius of two metres from the existing trees and five metres from the forest boundary measured from the circumference of an existing tree.Illegal tree fellingThere have been several instances where builders have not only illegally felled trees to pave way for the construction, but also resorted to ways and means to dry up the trees. Once a tree dries, permission can be sought to fell it, which is being done by many realtorsThe amendments pertain to Regulation for Environment and Health so that the forest cover can be protected. Similar provisions already exist in many other parts of the state, including the state capital, so as to protect the green cover.There have been several instances where builders have not only illegally felled trees illegally to pave way for the construction but also resorted to ways and means to dry up the trees.

Gaurav Khanna has set up a hosiery and knitting unit in a remote area located 10 km from Dalhousie. The woollens being produced at the unit find place in leading brand stores such as Fabindia and are also exported to the US and Canada.Khanna, owner of Lall Ji Knitwares, said his father was a cloth merchant in Dalhousie. “Till 1997, we were selling uniforms at various schools of the region. I did MBA in 1998 and joined my father’s business. I found that we were not selling items at our shop that were in demand. People came to our shop and demanded capes, ponchos and other woollen products,” he added.He said he bought land in a remote village on the Dalhouise-Chamba road and started a knitting unit. The first piece that he created at the unit was 1.5 kg heavy. It took him two years to learn to create the right product. “The biggest challenge was to find a market. Out marketing team visited 150 stores in Punjab, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir before a retailer bought first three pieces created at out knitting unit. Now, we are vendors for Fabindia and many other leading retail stores of the country. Most of the products created by us are in demand and there is advance booking for these,” Gaurav claimed.He said that he imported yarn and wool from China, Italy and Australia. “Occasions” and “Havick” from Scotland are two major brands created by Lall Ji Knitwares. The finished products, besides being sold in India are also exported to the US and Canada, he added.The unit is producing about 30,000 woollen pieces a year and employs about 50 local persons. Gaurav said he intended to expand his unit but the plan was halted due to Covid-19 this year. “However, the pandemic has also brought a positive development. Many artisans working in the hosiery industry in Ludhiana are from Himachal and do not intend to go back. We are getting calls from skilled labour for employment,” he added.Asked why he did not use wool produced in Himachal, Gaurav said the wool sold in Himachal was not washed and contains grease, which makes it difficult to be used in hosiery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/chamba-hosiery-finds-place-in-leading-brand-stores-201494

The project, though, has not been scrapped altogether. “We have now asked the Municipal Corporation to prepare a fresh proposal. Once the MC prepares it, we will have a look at it,” the official said.Deal with Bengaluru firm scrappedThe decision may have saved the government some money, but the wait for the much-anticipated service in the city just got longer. According to sources, it had taken more than a year to bring the project close to fruition and nothing can be said how long it will take for the project to complete now.For the record, the Bangaluru-based company was shortlisted for running the service in September last year and the project was supposed to be allotted to it in the first week of October following which it would have started building up the required infrastructure like docks.According to information then, a one-sided trip on the identified stretches would have cost an individual a mere Rs 5 and the company would get Rs 1.31 lakh per cycle for a period of six years.Three stretches – CTO to Summerhill, Chotta Shimla to Shimla Club and Sanjauli to the IGMC – were chosen for running the service in the first phase. Given that all three are sealed roads where common people can’t drive, the service would have offered a much-needed mode of transport. Besides, the availability of cycles would have taken a few vehicles off the road and spared many the endless parking woes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/wait-for-bicycle-sharing-service-gets-longer-201497

The theft was committed soon after the material valued about Rs 20 lakh reached Baddi.The SP also directed the dealers to choose a trustworthy cargo agency, install high quality CCTV cameras on their premises and outside as well, hire security guards for surveillance and also use anti-theft burglar alarm locks for additional safety.There are 10 to 12 major traders and about 70 smaller traders who supply pharmaceutical raw materials such as active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients in the Baddi area.The BBN area is known as the pharmaceutical hub of Asia owing to the presence of about 350 manufacturing units there.

Around 65.6 per cent respondents were of the view that the implementation of welfare schemes and bringing the needy people under the fold of these schemes was important while 65.9 per cent of them said that the gram sabhas should be strengthened by increasing the participation of members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/corruption-good-governance-missing-from-manifestos-survey-201509

21-01-2021||Gaurav Kanthwal||What Atal tunnel brings to the people of Lahaul-Spiti||Tribune News ServiceKeylong, January 8Around 30 lakh tourists visited Kullu and Manali every year, but this time, not even one lakh crossed Lahaul-Spiti district.The journey from Manali to Keylong—the district headquarters—was 116 km only, but Rohtang La (3,978 m) stood like a colossus—whipping up rough winds and inclement weather to make it nearly impassable.Not very long ago, travelling by road to Keylong, in winters, was unthinkable while in summers, one had to think twice.As the skies turned grey, choppers would return midway to Manali.The journey from Manali to Keylong, or further up to Leh, was so fraught with hazards, that local taxi drivers kept an oxygen cylinder handy, in case an altitude sickness worried tourists.Border Road Organization (BRO), Himachal Pradesh government and several agencies toiled for 10 years to unlock this forbidden land with the Atal Tunnel on October 3, 2020.It is 9.02 km long and considered as the longest tunnel in the world above 10,000 feet.The tunnel cuts the distance between Manali and Keylong by 46 km, but importantly, gives all-weather access to the Lahaul and Spiti and further up to Leh.“As many as 5,450 vehicles crossed the tunnel (2,800 from Manali side and 2,650 from Lahaul side) on December 27 this year,” said Superintendent of Police, Kullu, Gaurav Singh.Roughly, this means 22,000 visitors on a single day, close to one-fifth of the total tourists in the Lahaul valley in the whole previous year.A year ago, such an influx of tourists was unthinkable, but the tunnel, "a technological marvel", as the locals said, has made it possible.The "Technological Marvel" is a moniker, that localities keep calling the 9.02 km long tunnel.This tunnel has made life easy.Worming through the verdant slopes of Solang is an uplifting experience till the South portal, followed by a curiosity-filled drive-through of 15 minutes under the glare of LED lights and accompanying gadgetry. Technological advancements are often the first things feted for such engineering marvels—a tunnel through a stream-strewn mountain is no mean feat—but nature’s assent also plays a big role in keeping the passageway going throughout the year.On the other side of the tunnel is North Portal, bewitching the tourists with crisp sunlight on a canvass of crimson yellow in fall.Sissu, the first town as one steps into Lahaul valley, is a picture of contrast with the turquoise blue of river Chandra flowing through the sparkling white bed of sand.In winters, everything evens out in snowy white with a slight dip in temperature.The Atal tunnel has opened up the valley for the outside world, but it has also exposed it to its vagaries.Hiramani Kashyap, assistant professor of tourism and hospitality in the government postgraduate college, Kullu said: “There is an urgent need of dustbins, public toilets and parking space at small stops on the main highway. The government needs to develop multiple tourist destinations in the valley to hold up the tourists for two-three day before they decide to move ahead to Leh or back to Manali.”It's been only three months since the tunnel was thrown open, but already Lahaul and Spiti are witnessing long queues of vehicles— sometimes as long as three kilometres.There is a feeling among the tourists and locals that the valley is not fully ready to welcome the outside world. It may take some time for the infrastructure to develop.Chetan, proprietor of Karma Cottage in Jispa village says, “People like to stay here because Jispa valley is open, colourful. It gives a momentary respite from barren hills and cold desert. But the accommodation in hotels and guest houses is not enough to cater to the influx of tourists.”What is happening now is that the tourists come from Manali in the morning for sightseeing and return to Manali before it gets dark.“We only get traffic jams, litter, tourist nuisance and pollution. There is still some time for an average shopkeeper or a hotelier’s earning to go up on the main highway,” said Des Raj, a guest house owner near Sissu.While the business community is still to benefit from tourists, the easy access to Manali is a big thumbs up for the agriculturists, especially potato growers. Potato is the last crop of the season for the Lahaul farmers. The season begins in April-May and the produce is ready by October-November. With little storage facilities, early snowfall in October used to block the roads for months, leaving the sacks of potato rotting out in the open.Lahaul Potato Society chairman, Sudershan Jaspa, said: “The tunnel cuts the cost and the time of transportation to half, which means 50% saving in the cost of transportation for the potato farmers. Conventionally, potato growers take their produce to Manali for grading (classification according to the size) on their own cost. We are hoping that seed potatoes for West Bengal, Bihar and Karnataka will now be available on time.”The vegetable growers, too, will be benefited, but they will have to wait for the impact till next year as the tunnel opened in October this year and by then the season was almost over.Cabbage, green peas, hops, sea buckthorn and medicinal herbs are the major agricultural products of this region. It is said that Lahaul supplies green peas to the biggest vegetable markets of the country when production stops everywhere.Lahaul and Spiti district has an area of 14,000 square metres and a population of just 31,500 (2011 census). Area-wise, it is the largest district of the state but population-wise it is the smallest.The tribal folks of this area are landlocked by three major geographical features: Rohtang La (3,978m) separating Lahaul-Spiti from Kullu valley; Kunzum Pass (4,590m) separating Lahaul from Spiti and Baralacha La (4,890m) separating Lahaul from Leh district.The Himachal Pradesh police department crime data shows an amazing aspect of society here.It is hard to believe that there have been less than 700 instances of criminal cases registered since January 1, 2001.Environmental conditions, religious beliefs, sparsely populated areas and peace-loving nature of the tribal folks are considered to be the contributing factors in this zen garden.The biggest change this tunnel is going to make in the lives of the majority of the natives here is putting an end to the winter migration (November to April) of the majority of the people to low-lying areas.The official data points that there has been a 30% cut in the winter migration in its very first year.On the other hand, easy access to the outside world will bring in a deluge of commercialization and alter the way of living here in the coming years.Ajay Kumar, a native of Lahaul, said: “At present, they may not want too much outside interference, but with time, they may learn to showcase the tribal culture to outsiders.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/what-atal-tunnel-brings-to-the-people-of-lahaul-spiti-195531
