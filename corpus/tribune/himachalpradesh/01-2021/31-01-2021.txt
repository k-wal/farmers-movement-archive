31-01-2021||Chandigarh||Rain deficient in Punjab, Himachal during January; surplus in Haryana||Rainfall in the first month of this decade has been significantly below normal in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, though Haryana experienced surplus rain during this period.Punjab received 11 mm rain from January 1 to January 30 against the long period average of 19.8 mm, accounting for a deficiency of 45 per cent, according to data compiled by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Though the districts lying alongside the state’s western border received normal to excess rain, other parts of the state recieved below par rainfall. Tarn Taran was the wettest district during this period with an excess of 89 per cent while Faridkot was the worst hit with a deficiency of 92 per cent.In the hill state of Himachal Pradesh, the deficiency was 56 per cent, IMD data shows that the state received 37.6 mm rain against the long period average of 86.4 mm. The rain was below normal in all districts in the state during this month, with the deficiency being highest in Mandi.The rain was surplus by 59 per cent in Haryana during January. IMD recorded 21.3 mm rain against the long period average of 13.4 mm. Barring four districts, Fatehabad, Ambala, Yamunanagar and Panchkula, all other districts received normal to above normal rain.The weather department has predicted that under the influence of a fresh western disturbance, light isolated rain or snow is very likely over the Western Himalayan region during February 1-3.Subsequently, due to the absence of any active western disturbance, below-normal rain or snow is likely over northern parts of the country, including the Western Himalayan region, till February 10.According to IMD, minimum temperatures are prevailing in the range of two degrees Celsius to 10 degrees Celsius over most parts of northwest and adjoining areas, which are generally below normal.Considering the prevailing wind pattern at lower levels, no significant change in minimum temperatures is very likely these parts during the next 3-4 days but will rise by 2-3 degrees Celsius thereafter. Dense to very dense fog will also be experienced in several parts of Punjab and Haryana over the new few days and foggy conditions would reduce thereafter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/rain-deficient-in-punjab-himachal-during-january-surplus-in-haryana-205952

Earlier estimations were carried out unscientifically. With the robust baseline data in hand, we can now repeat the snow leopard estimation once in four-five years to know their population trends—rising or declining,” he said.Officials involved in the snow leopard estimation said camera trapping surveys were conducted at 10 sites to representatively sample all the strata i.e. high, low and unknown.The camera trap deployment over the mountainous terrains was led by a team of eight local youth of Kibber village and more than 70 frontline staff of the forest department who were trained in this technique as part of the Snow Leopard Project that started in 2018.They were spotted at all 10 sites—Bhaga, Chandra, Bharmour, Kullu, Miyar, Pin, Baspa, Tabo, Hangrang and Spiti—suggesting the snow leopard is found in its entire habitat in Himachal Pradesh, either as resident individuals  of a population or as dispersing individuals navigating through these connecting habitats, says the study.The Forest Minister said the results provide a robust baseline for the wildlife wing to set up a long-term monitoring project to track the population of snow leopard and its wild prey species.The Nature Conservation Foundation had earlier carried out the snow leopard occupancy survey in 2012 in Lahaul-Spiti, Kinnaur and Chamba districts through interaction with locals, mainly herders.“There were many gaps in the previous survey that was more on assumptions. Now, we have robust statistics that indicates the state supports a good population of the snow leopard that shares a wide-ranging habitat,” Bijour told IANS.However, wildlife experts have expressed concern over the rising population of the abandoned dogs in high mountains that might pose a threat to the snow leopards and their food chain.Another first-of-its-kind the latest study by the state wildlife wing through the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) says the rise in population of feral dogs in habitat of the snow leopard is a matter of concern.Chief Wildlife Warden-cum-State Project Director of SECURE Himalaya, Archana Sharma, told IANS that the issue of feral dogs in high-altitude areas is a bit concerning as they are reported to lead to biodiversity loss, depredations  of wildlife species and also competing with large carnivores like the snow leopard.As globally, few studies are available documenting the impact of feral dogs on wildlife, hence, in order to understand their current population status and impacts in Lahaul-Pangi landscapes this study was conducted under the programme  entitled ‘SECURE Himalayas—Securing livelihoods, conservation, sustainable use and restoration of high range Himalayan ecosystems.ZSI Scientist Lalit Kumar Sharma said multi-pronged approach of camera trapping, trail sampling, non-invasive genetics and questionnaire survey was used to gather information on the feral dogs in Lahaul-Pangi landscape.He said the feral dog density was found to be 2.78 individuals per 100 sq km on an average ranging from 1.4 to 5.5 individuals per 100 sq km in Lahaul and Pangi areas.Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) Anil Thakur said as per the ZSI report the feral dog are preying upon the marmot, the blue sheep and rodents species, Also their the diet is dominated by domestic livestock, a matter of great concern.He said although the population density of feral dogs is not at alarming stage, but this is the right time to start mitigation planning of the imminent threat in the Himalayan ecosystems.Thakur favoured long-term monitoring and more intensive studies to understand the possible impact by the feral dogs on wildlife using the different monitoring protocols.According to Manoj Thakur, State Project Officer with SECURE Himalaya, on the basis of the ZSI findings the state Forest Department and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in association with local community will start the feral dog management by sterilisation and awareness generation.Apart from the Spiti Valley, the state’s Pin Valley National Park, the Great Himalayan National Park and the Pangi and Bharmour areas of Chamba district have a sizable population of snow leopards.The snow leopard landscape is dominated by Buddhists, who mostly grow peas and potatoes and have adapted themselves to co-exist with the wild animals as the species are deeply embedded in their folklore. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-supports-snow-leopard-population-shares-man-animal-bondage-205940

He chose 25 members of women self-help groups to run it.Rural enterprise“In order to maintain wayside amenities after identifying land at Bag Pashog panchayat, it was decided to open a small shop to serve local delicacies and women from self-help groups were roped in after initial screening,” said Pruthi, who wants to replicate the idea in other parts of the district. More facilities such as a small guesthouse, a local kitchen and a skill development centre were added to the project as funds were drawn from the Rural Development, Tourism, and Panchayati Raj Departments, NABARD, politicians as well as industries by way of corporate social responsibility. The project has converged various state and Central schemes to provide a livelihood option to rural women.Ventures such as leaf plate manufacturing, knitting and sewing are undertaken in the skill development centres and products manufactured there are sold through the ‘’Him Ira’’ shop as well as a kiosk provided on the roadside. “To ensure environmental conservation, a green building has been developed where an e-rickshaw has also been provided to enable women to fetch water from a nearby spring. Interventions such as a solar power plant, rainwater harvesting, scientific disposal of waste, vermin compost pits, etc., have also been provided,” said Pruthi.The 25 women, who work in shifts, have ensured that those visiting ‘’She Haat’’ are provided local delicacies as well as other dishes. They have registered a sale of more than Rs one lakh in its very first month. They also maintain accounts while displaying locally manufactured products, including pickles, woollens, jams, honey, herbal tea, etc. A rare mix of rural and modern kitchens is seen in the Haat as women dish out local delicacies while also serving the guests other cuisines. The district administration is endeavouring to train them further to hone their culinary skills and enhance their productivity.Buoyed by the initial success, the women are determined to work harder to ensure more profitability for the “Haat” in the coming days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/rural-women-run-haat-in-sirmaur-a-success-205597
