I didn’t even experience anything mild after taking the shot. It was exhilarating to get inoculated and contribute to the national fight against COVID,” Panda said.Asked if he had apprehensions before taking the shot, the joint secretary rank officer who has previously served in the ministries or food, civil supplies and petroleum and natural gas, said, “I had no apprehensions whatsoever. I was always clear that I have to take the vaccine. There was no dilemma. The vaccines have passed the regulatory rigours and are safe.”Panda added that bureaucrats serving in health systems are also being covered in phase one of the inoculation drive along side health workers.Panda has been at AIIMS for three years and urged everyone registered for the shot in phase one to accept the vaccine and build immunity against the virus.“All of past year we ate and drank anything anyone said would build our immunity against Covid. Why not take the vaccine? It’s no silver bullet against the virus but it sure offers protection from disease,” said Panda whose brother Debasis Panda is also an IAS officer of 1987 batch from Uttar Pradesh Cadre and is currently posted as Secretary to government of India in the Department of Financial Services.Panda said people must be conscious of a scenario of potential resurgence of COVID as being witnessed in the European countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/exhilarating-says-first-serving-bureaucrat-to-get-covaxin-202578

She lost her father when she was just two-year-old and last year, she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.Her father, a soldier with the 8th Dogra Battalion, sustained serious wounds in the Kargil War and died in 2010. “We were still struggling to deal with the death of her father when she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes,” said Nisha’s mother. “It was distressing for all of us. We had to give her insulin injections five times a day, which was very painful for her.”In a relief, a doctor couple of the IGMC, Shimla, Dr Jitender Mokta and Dr Kiran Mokta donated an insulin pump worth Rs 2 lakh to Nisha. “The insulin pump makes the life of a diabetic patient much easier,” said Dr Mokta. “The risk of kidney damage is high and frequent hospitalisation is common for diabetic patients. With the proper use of the pump, hospitalisation is almost nil and patients can lead almost a normal life,” said the doctor.He suggested that the government should subsidise the cost so that more people could use it. On receiving the pump, Nisha had one question – could she play badminton now without any risk to her health?

In the past five years, over 24 gliders have crashed at different places in Kangra and adjoining Mandi districts killing 10 pilots, including foreigners.Several organisations and victims’ kin have demanded a complete ban on paragliding till proper rules are incorporated and separate agencies constituted by the state government to implement the same.Billing in Kangra district is among the top paragliding sites in the world. The place has regularly been hosting the prestigious Paragliding World Cup. But in the absence of rules to govern the sport, it has started courting controversies.Only last month, Canadian pilot Cheval Christian Yaves Mare was killed when his paraglider crash-landed near Bir. Cheval was flying alone when the tragedy occurred. He had no knowledge of topography of Dhauladhar ranges which led to mishap. In another mishap in February 2020, 24-year-old para glider Akshya and co- pilot Shyam Lal were killed. Both had taken off from Billing but were untrained.Likewise in 2018, a Singaporean pilot Kok Chang had died after his glider crash-landed in high mountains of Dhauladhar hills after he took off from Billing. His body was spotted by rescue teams after many days. Earlier two Russian pilots were killed in similar mishapsTwo years back, Max Kent McGowan, a US pilot, remained stranded in snow-covered mountains for 60 hours after taking off from Billing when his glider moved in wrong directions bordering Chamba district. He had to land at Bir after two hours but heavy rain, snowfall and high velocity wind forced him to land in high mountains.He had neither insurance cover nor permission from the administration to fly.Besides, other two foreign pilots one Russian and Latvian sustained serious injuries when their gliders crashed near Jhatingari in Mandi district and in Bundla hills of Palampur.Both the pilots had flew from Billing.It is on record that the bodies of many pilots remained untraced till date. Even their gliders were not spotted.Though the state tourism department has laid down the rules and guidelines in this regard these rules are hardly followed. The authorities normally swing into action and some checking is done when the media highlights illegal flying.As per Aero Space Rules laid down in the year 2004 the state government has made mandatory to have a licence for the pilot issued by Aero Sport Society of India, carry internationally homologated design parachute with helmet, have two-way radio communication system with instrument panel, altimeter, barometer and compasswith speed indicator and two first aid kits equipped with medicines and bandages.Besides, there should be ground support with a retrieval vehicle, insurance cover for two persons in tandem flights and insurance support for arranging helicopter in the case of emergency.Recent fatalities||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/paragliding-mishaps-rising-in-himachal-state-agencies-under-lens-202242

He asked the PWD to fix responsibility and take action against the erring contractor and engineers who were responsible for substandard construction of this bridge.Thakur directed that the work of Rs 162-crore sewerage projects for Manali town and surrounding villages for which the pipes worth Rs 21 crore had already been purchased should be started. He asked the officers of the Jal Shakti Vibhag to ensure completion of this project in a fixed time frame.He directed that all the formalities be completed early to pave the way for construction of a modern auditorium at Rambag in Manali, where events like winter carnival could be organised.Expressing dissatisfaction over unnecessary delay in the construction of two blocks of the civil hospital in Banjar, the Chief Minister directed that this work must be completed by January 2022. He said that the work on Banjar by-pass road should be started at the earliest as the state government had already approved a sum of Rs 734.40 lakh for this project. He directed the Deputy Commissioner to monitor progress on all the ongoing projects so that unwanted delays due to small reasons could be avoided.Thakur said that the work on construction of Kullu bus stand was in its final stage and it would be dedicated to the people in March.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/restore-traffic-on-kullu-bridge-by-march-himachal-cm-202243

It was advertised in various newspapers and was uploaded on the IGMC and government websites, too. The process was totally transparent,” said Dr Janak Raj.Bobby, however, alleged that it was indeed done to bring in a particular person and evict him. “I will like to request both political parties to keep at least hospitals out of politics. Every time the government changes, it appoints its own people at key administrative posts, hampering the smooth functioning of the hospitals,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/dejected-sarabjeet-to-close-langar-at-igmc-by-march-31-202244

The number of the endangered animal in the state is 73.Detected at 10 sitesForest Minister Rakesh Pathania said the assessment of snow leopard population had been completed by the state wildlife wing in collaboration with the Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF), Bangalore, following the protocol aligning with the SPAI (Snow Leopard Population Assessment in India) protocols of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests .It is the first scientifically robust estimate of snow leopards and its prey for the state. Snow leopard is the state animal. The study covered the entire potential snow leopard habitat: an area of 26,112 sq km utilising a stratified sampling design. Camera trapping surveys were conducted at 10 sites.Pathania, while congratulating the wildlife wing for this achievement, said that such long-term studies could prove very useful in detecting the effects of conservation at the ground level and Himachal Pradesh could also be an example for other states.He said the exercise revealed that snow leopard density ranged from 0.08 to 0.37 individuals per 100 sq km with the trans-Himalayan regions of Spiti, Pin valley and upper Kinnaur recording the highest densities, both of the predator and its prey, mainly ibex and blue sheep.The camera trap deployment over the mountainous terrain was led by a team of eight local youth of Kibber village and more than 70 frontline staff of the HPFD were trained in this technique as part of the project.Another revelation from the study is that a bulk of snow leopard occurrence is outside protected areas, reiterating the fact that local communities are the strongest allies for conservation in snow leopard landscapes.

The Finance Department has decided to raise these loans with the last quarter of the financial year 2020-21 coming to an end on March 31.The two installments of Rs 500 crore each are being taken for a period of 10 and 12 years from the open market. The Rs 1,000-crore loan will be received by January 27.The mounting debt trap of over Rs 58,000 crore has been a cause of worry for the state government. With little avenues of resource generation, Himachal remains dependent on loans for undertaking development works. Most of the development works, be it in roads, health, education, housing and infrastructure are undertaken under various Centrally sponsored schemes.With this loan of Rs 1,000 crore, the Himachal Government can now only raise a loan of Rs 1,500 crore only for the current financial year. The state government has so far raised Rs 5,000 crore during this financial year. It could raise additional loan as Centre has given the offer of taking two per cent extra loan, which will allow the BJP regime to raise Rs 1,000 crore extra, besides the remaining Rs 1,500 crore.With all major sectors taking a severe hit due to Covid pandemic, it is being expected that the BJP regime will have to take the remaining limit of Rs 1,500 crore by March 31, 2021 when the financial year ends. The recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission will also come into effect after March 2021.The Rs 450-crore special interest free 50-year-loan to Himachal Pradesh given by the Union Finance Ministry in October 2020 came as a breather for the sagging economy which is already under a huge debt trap with little revenue generating avenues.
