The operation lasted till noon.Though the unit had a valid NOC for fire fighting, but since fire led to disruption of the power supply it rendered the equipment ineffective.The staff too lacked training to operate the equipment, which delayed fire-fighting operations, said Sharma.He said goods worth Rs 5 crore were saved by the fire staff.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/parwanoo-based-industrial-firm-suffers-rs-2-crore-lose-in-massive-fire-194556

An environmental compensation worth Rs 1.86 crore has also been imposed on them for violating the provisions of the Water Act, 1974, and Environmental Protection Act, 1981 by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB).The board noted that the four units — Winsome Textiles, Auro Textiles, Auro Dyeing and Auro Textile-II — were neither complying with the prescribed discharge standards nor notified inlet quality standards and caused water pollution in its orders dated January 1, a copy of which was available with The Tribune. Board officials were not available for comments despite several calls.A joint inspection committee of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had observed in November 2019 that these textile units engaged in dyeing processes generate category-IV effluents comprising concentrated dyes. The pipeline carrying these effluents was found non-functional and choked as they carried concentrated effluents from these units. Not only this, a major portion of this effluent got mixed with category 1 effluent and could not be treated appropriately.The CETP was not found fit for treatment of fixed dissolved solids (FDS) measuring around 22,000 mg/litre being received from these textile units. This was causing considerable pollution to the Balad river as all treated effluents are finally discharged into it by the CETP.The NGT had expressed concern over pollution in Balad river in Baddi and had directed the SPCB to close polluting activities and recover environmental compensation from the polluter in June 2020 after receipt of this report.The state board had issued show cause notices to these units in June 2020 and had asked them why their power supply should not be disconnected and an interim environmental compensation may not be imposed on them as per the laid norms. The textile units were directed to chalk out action plans and install their own treatment system to treat these effluents and follow inlet and treatment quality standards.This order was challenged by the textile units in the high court which while disposing their petitions had directed the state government to take appropriate directions as per law against the polluting units while observing that no industry can be allowed to pollute water bodies.Three textile units have been levied environmental compensation for 160 days from July 25, 2020 to December 31, 2020 while Auro Textile has been levied it for 140 days. Regional officer of the SPCB has also been directed to ensure compliance within seven days by the member secretary, SPCB.Generating category-IV effluents||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/crackdown-on-polluting-units-4-baddi-textile-factories-shut-194159

He has been identified as Mukesh Kumar, a resident of Saheed Bhagat Singh Nagar in Punjab. He has been booked under the Mining Act and Section 379 of the IPC.The machine has been impounded. No vehicle was found on the site to transport the quarry material, informed police officials.As the use of the earth excavation machine in a riverbed is banned, its operation in the heart of the industrial area points towards local involvement. “Contractors executing government works can’t use illegally mined material, as per the High court directions.The departments will not clear their bills till they produce transit pass (Form W) and supplementary pass (Form X) for the construction material used in the works they had executed,” said Mining Officer Kulbhushan Sharma.Illegal mining along the bordering areas is, however, done by people from Punjab and Haryana.This is not the lone case where an earth excavation machine was being used in illegal mining on government land in the Baddi area where several cases have come to the fore in the recent months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/illegal-mining-in-baddi-cops-seize-machine-194160

To start with, about 150 teachers of social sciences and correspondence courses which were in grey area were asked to submit faculty reports. Other departments will follow suit,” Kumar told The Tribune.The internal quality assessment cell is perusing the reports of all departments — which includes research projects, students guided, classes taken during semester/year, webinars, conference, workshop, guest lectures, memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed, fellowships, awards and placements. To facilitate campus placement, the university is tying up with industries and other employment providers.In order to cut short delays for sanction of funds for various activities, Rs 50 lakh (one lakh for each department) has been sanctioned in advance and it has been made mandatory for each teacher to publish at least three research papers, the VC said, adding that four new courses, including Defense Studies, Environmental Sciences, Library Science and M.Sc Microbiology were also introduced.The ranking is based on parameters such as the quality of the institute, students, faculty, teaching learning practices and resources, research and innovation culture of the institute, professional practices, placement and other graduation outcomes, outreach and inclusivity, industrial tie-ups, international collaborations and the perception of the institute in the academic and professional world.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/after-slip-in-ranking-himachal-pradesh-university-takes-steps-to-fix-lapses-194149

These people use fertilisers and pesticides to protect their crops. “I have learnt that farmers are using some kind of fertiliser imported from Punjab that is in the form of pebbles. Birds are consuming these pebble-shaped fertiliser and dying in a large number,” he said.He alleged that though the Supreme Court had banned ploughing of land along the Pong lake, as it is part of the international wetland area and the wildlife sanctuary, a large number of politically-influential people were growing crops there during the winter when the water in the lake recedes. Earlier also, there had been reports of birds dying in a large number due to pesticides or fertilisers being used on crops. The government should get these facts checked by sending independent experts to the Pong dam lake area, he said.The former minister said that the wetland area receives over one lakh migratory birds during the winter. It also receives the largest number of Bar-headed goose.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/deaths-could-be-due-to-fertilisers-ex-minister-194151
