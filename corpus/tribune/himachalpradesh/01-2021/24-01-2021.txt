24-01-2021||Shimla||HP farmers to add flavour to Indian cuisine with home-grown 'heeng'||After offering pest-free potatoes and exotic vegetables that are foodies' delight, farmers of Himachal Pradesh are set to add flavour to the Indian culinary life by offering home-grown asafoetida (heeng) -- a first for the country -- in the coming years.Agriculture Minister Virender Kanwar told IANS on Sunday that the first plantation of asafoetida, which gives a zing to the recipes due to its unique pungent smell owing to high sulphur content, was done successfully on an experimental basis in Kwaring village in Lahaul Valley at an altitude of 11,000 feet on October 15, 2020.Thereafter, 'heeng' cultivation was also taken up in the state's other high-altitude areas like Keylong, Beeling and Madgran in Lahaul-Spiti district, Janjhehli and Moviseri in Mandi district and Kalpa and Pooh in Kinnaur district.The expensive oleo-gum-resin will be ready for extraction from the roots of the plants after five years of plantation, he said.Heeng, a perennial plant, is otherwise native to the deserts of Iran and mountains of Afghanistan, where it is grown in substantial numbers.'Heeng' is one of the widely used spices in Indian cuisine, and the country consumes around 50 per cent of the total world production. Currently, around 1,200 tonnes of raw 'heeng' worth around Rs 600 crore is imported annually, mainly from Afghanistan.At present, 5,000 square metres of land has been covered by 'heeng' plantation in Himachal Pradesh. Approximately 302 hectares would be brought under its cultivation in five years under the pilot project.Kanwar said that more snow-bound areas would be brought under 'heeng' cultivation if the project is a success, which is monitored by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT) based in Palampur and the Agriculture Department.The Indian Himalayas with dry and extremely cold conditions and an annual rainfall of not more than 200 mm are considered conducive to 'heeng' cultivation.Scientists say since the plant roots penetrate very deep, sandy and clay soil is best suited for its cultivation.As per the Agriculture Department, 2,100 'heeng' saplings have been provided to 45 farmers and 1,233 saplings planted at an experimental farm of the CSIR-IHBT.As part of the project, a capacity-building programme was organised for officers of the department in July 2020. The department is identifying farmers and providing them seedlings, technical know-how, and other infrastructure free of cost to motivate them to go for 'heeng' cultivation.The farm scientists of the CSIR-IHBT are providing the technical know-how to update the skills of the farmers involved in the pilot project.Kanwar pointed out that the cultivation of 'heeng' held the potential to change the economic condition of people living in cold desert areas of the hill state.The ultimate aim is, the Minister said, to prepare the state for the cultivation of 'heeng' on a commercial scale."There is hardly any Indian kitchen that does not use 'heeng'. Its cultivation will not only help save foreign exchange but also boost the economy of tribal regions that remain covered in snow for the most of the year," the Minister added.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/hp-farmers-to-add-flavour-to-indian-cuisine-with-home-grown-heeng-203015

In 2017, Obama met the spiritual leader in New Delhi, sixth in the series, to discuss promoting peace in the world.The Dalai Lama-George W Bush proximity came to the fore when the leader-in-exile in an interview in 2012 with Piers Morgan, then with CNN, said: “I love President Bush.”“Really?” Morgan asked. “Yes, really,” he replied.“As a human being. Not as a president of America. Sometimes his policy may not be very, very successful but as a person, as a human being, very nice person. I love him.”The 85-year-old monk, who was enthroned two years before President Biden was born, has lived in exile in India since fleeing Tibet during a failed uprising against the Chinese government in 1959.On his first day in office, President Biden signed an executive order for the US return to the Paris climate accord, which earned accolades, including one from the Dalai Lama.Former US president Franklin Roosevelt also had sent the Dalai Lama a pocket-watch as a gift when he was a young boy. The Dalai Lama, who visits only on invitation, described the gold watch as magnificent and even took it with him when he fled Tibet in 1959.In his election campaign, Biden had said if voted to power, his administration would sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in Tibet, besides meeting with His Holiness the Dalai Lama.“The invitation to His Holiness from the White House would provide an opportunity to discuss the situation in Tibet and to advance US support for the ‘middle-way approach’,” a representative from the spiritual leader’s office told IANS.The ‘middle-way approach’ demands ‘greater autonomy’ for the people in Tibet.Echoing similar sentiments, activist and poet Tenzin Tsundue, who twice “breached the wall” by unfurling protest banners during the visits of Chinese premiers to India, said: “Tibet emerged as one of the contesting issues during the US election campaigns.”“President Joe Biden promised to meet His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The Tibet support resolution — Tibetan Policy and Support Act (TPSA), 2020 — was also passed by bipartisan support to show that Tibet is an important issue in dealing with China.”“As Tibetans, we must make sure we secure our interest from among American tussle with China. The US has benefitted tremendously from its One-China policy, which supports China’s 70 years of occupation of Tibet and China’s trade compared to any instances of Tibet support efforts,” Tsundue told IANS.In a congratulatory letter to Biden on becoming the 46th President, the Dalai Lama wrote: “The whole world places its hope in the democratic vision and leadership of the United States…Once again I take this opportunity to express our gratitude for your long-standing support for the Tibetan people. It has been our good fortune to have enjoyed the friendship and encouragement of the American people and their leaders in our endeavour to protect and preserve our ancient Buddhist culture, a culture of peace, non-violence and compassion.”In her speech at the Congressional Gold Medal award-giving ceremony by President George W Bush at the Capitol Hill in Washington on October 17, 2007, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would always be grateful to Chairman Tom Lantos for affording many Members of Congress their first meeting with His Holiness in 1987.The 14th Dalai Lama was born on July 6, 1935, in a small village in the remote Amdo region of Tibet.

At a Zila Parishad ward in Indora, 6,000 votes were cancelled as the voters could not decipher the hand-written names of the candidates.Bali alleged that it was for the first time that printed electoral rolls were not used in panchayat elections.

The Congress would soon expose the shortcomings and bring these to the public notice, he said.Besides, the names of the voters were missing in large numbers in almost all panchayats. In Haler panchayat near Kangra, initially a person was declared a winner. Other candidate protested and in recounting, he came out to be the winner.

Both seats in Shillai block — Kando Bhatnol and Gawali — have been won by Congress candidates Vidhya Devi and Chameli Devi. Shillai MLA Harshwardhan Chauhan has strengthened his stronghold over the Shillai constituency by bagging the two seats.The Devthi Majgaon seat in Rajgarh block has been bagged by Congress’ Vinay Bagnal. Rajgarh is also the home turf of the state BJP president Suresh Kashyap and losing this seat has lent a major blow to the saffron party. The BJP’s Seema Devi won from Sangrah, Nirmala Devi from Bankla, Pushpa from Kala Amb, Surender Singh from Dadahoo and Satish Thakur from Shilanji.Neelam Devi, who won as an Independent from Bag Pashog, is a BJP rebel and her victory is significant as she has won on the home turf of BJP’s state president Suresh Kashyap. Congress candidate Poonam Thakur emerged second from this ward while BJP candidate Lalita Sharma was a poor third. Losing this seat reflects adversely on Kashyap’s hold in his home ward and does not augur well for the ruling party which was hoping to bag maximum seats in the zila parishad.

The ruling BJP failed to secure a majority as its candidates could win only seven seats while Congress-backed candidates could bag only three seats.Four BJP rebels — Asha Parihar, Amar Singh Thakur, Rina Devi and Kamlesh Pawar — won against official nominees, as the party could not prevail upon them to withdraw from the contest. It was also observed that they had the tactic support of a section of the party leaders who were now jubilant at their victory.BJP candidates who won are Hira Kaushal from Darla, Bhuvneshwari from Dhundan, Darpana Thakur from Dharampur, Ramesh Thakur from Darwa, Amar Chand from Barotiwala, Shanti Devi from Khera and Rahul Sharma from Bawasani.The BJP lost the Kasauli-Garkhal seat which is the home turf of the local MLA and Health and Family Welfare Minister Rajiv Saizal. The seat was bagged by a BJP rebel, Rina Devi, who had contested the poll after being refused a ticket by the party. It remains to be seen whether the BJP rebels would support the party in electing the two top posts as the ruling party has much at stake in the district after losing two civic bodies.The Congress, which held the outgoing zila parishad, could secure only three seats. Its wining candidates were Rajinder Singh from Saproon, Sarbjeet Kaur from Manjholi and Mukhtiyar Kaur from Kundlu ward.Three wards — Domehar, Dhundan and Ratwari — lying in Arki, which is the home turf of former Chief Minister Virbhadhra Singh, have been lost by the Congress. These seats were held by the Congress in the outgoing term.Interestingly, Hira Kaushal, who won from the Darla ward as a BJP candidate, was refused the ticket by the Congress. Another Congress candidate, Nirmala Devi, forfeited her security from Dhundan ward. She is the sitting zila parishad member and vice-president of the State Mahila Congress. Yet another Congress candidate, Neelam Raghuvanshi, who lost from Darla ward, is the secretary of the State Mahila Congress.Weak organisational support and poor ticket distribution led to Congress’ dismal performance in the district opine political observers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/independents-hold-the-key-to-top-posts-in-solan-202803
