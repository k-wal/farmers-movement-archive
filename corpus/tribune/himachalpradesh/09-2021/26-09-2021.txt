He virtually interacted with beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana from Shimla and asked them to suggest ways to improve the public distribution system (PDS).Goyal instantly established a rapport with the participating beneficiaries by referring to local crops and the natural beauty of Kangra and Chamba.

He added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had worked as the BJP state in-charge for Himachal, loves the people of the state and his concerns for them were visible during meetings. “Himachal Pradesh has made tremendous progress in all spheres of life during its 50 years of statehood. The state had not only done pioneering work in various sectors, but also shown a way to other states,” he said.Goyal said that the schemes launched by the Union Government since 2014 were aimed at the uplift, welfare and development of every section of society. Most of the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana expressed satisfaction over the supply of free ration though Nisha Thakur, a resident of Dodra Kwar in Shimla district, complained about disruptions in Internet services affecting the education of children during the pandemic.She also requested the Union minister for the construction of a 12-km road on the Uttarakhand side as the area remains cut off from the rest of the state from November to April due to snowfall. CM Jai Ram Thakur said that he had recently visited the area and assured Nisha that the needful would be done.Another beneficiary Saroj Kumari from Hamirpur told Goyal that the money they saved by way of free ration they get was utilised for the online studies of their children while Usha Devi from Chamba said that free ration helped the poor sustain their lives during the pandemic when there was no work.Chudamani from Mandi said that Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana helped farmers in the transportation of their produce to mandis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/suggest-ways-to-improve-pds-piyush-goyal-asks-beneficiaries-316186

A number of accidents have taken place on the bridges as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has not been able to replace these.The NHAI had taken over the highway four years ago for its widening to four lanes but there is no sign of improvement or widening till date. The matter has been hanging fire as the state government has been unable to make land available for the project. Earlier, the road was with the PWD, which had replaced 60 per cent of the bridges and even maintained the highway.A preferred routeIt may be recalled that these bridges were constructed over a century ago during the British rule and have already outlived their lives, while many have been declared unsafe. With the manifold increase in the traffic on the highway, these bridges could collapse any time. Also, due to these narrow bridges, traffic jams have become a routine in Maranda, Mattor and Sahapur areas. The foundations of some of these bridges have also been washed away.The bridge on the narrow curve near Mattor (Kangra) and Kalu Di Hatti opposite petrol pump on the NH has become a major accident hazard. Light vehicles and two-wheelers mainly bear the brunt as these roll down into khuds because of the heavy traffic. In the past six months, three persons have lost their lives at this point.Anil Sen, project director, NHAI, says that the national authority is well versed with the situation. It has already completed the tendering process for the first package between the Chakki bridge and 32 Mile, and all bridges in this part of the highway will be replaced soon, he adds.Likewise, the tendering process for the remaining phases was also in progress and soon the construction work would be awarded. In case of the areas where the road is to be bypassed, the matter pertaining to the replacement of narrow bridges would be discussed with the NHAI and the state government. He admitted that because of rising traffic on the highway, all narrow bridges need to be replaced urgently.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/100-yr-old-bridges-on-pathankot-mandi-nh-virtual-deathtraps-316193

Since the Swan and its tributaries are the only source of sand in Una district, it has led to a shortage of sand and rise in the prices of sand and gravel in the area.The price of sand, which was about Rs 15 per cubic feet, has gone up to over Rs 22 per square feet. Amarjeet Singh, a resident of Una, who is getting his house constructed, said he faced a lot of difficulties in procuring sand. Wherever sand was available, it was being sold at a very high cost, he added.Unauthorised miningUna Mining Officer Neeraj Kant said that the open leaseholders would not be allowed to lift material from the Swan riverbed till they get the area allotted to them under mining leases demarcated. “There are about 32 open mining leaseholders in Una district and all of them have not yet got the area, from where they can mine sand, demarcated. The decision against allowing mining till the areas of the leaseholders are not demarcated was taken by the committee headed by the Director, Industries,” he added.The committee appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which had recently visited Una district, had pointed out that mining was taking place outside the leased areas.People involved in the mining industry, however, allege that they were being subjected to unreasonably harsh measures in the district.The president of the stone crusher association of Una, Dimple Thakur, said that the Una district administration had increased the penalty on JCB machines and tippers found involved in illegal mining up to Rs 4 lakh. The scope of the Mines and Minerals Act of Himachal Pradesh was so vague that anybody could be booked for illegal mining, he added. After the order, many machinery owners have stopped giving their equipment to the stone crusher owners.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/ban-lifted-but-leaseholders-still-cant-mine-sand-in-swan-riverbed-316196

He later did postgraduation in political science from Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla.He attributes his success to his father Daljeet Singh, who is a farmer, and his mother, a retired primary schoolteacher.“It was in August 2017 while doing M.

The work is yet to start but the existing highway has developed potholes on many stretches.The road condition has worsened in the past four years.

There was earlier a government primary school in the building, which was closed a few years ago, and now the government is planning to close the senior secondary school also so that rich and influential persons can be accommodated, the petitioner claimed.The petitioner alleged that poor, orphan and migrant children study in the school and the students are being pressed by officials with threats of spoiling their result and are  being lured.The court directed the respondents to submit their reply before the next date and posted the matter after two weeks.
