These would have the requisite technical know-how to handle and investigate cyber crime cases.He said the police administration had started a skill development training programme for police personnel to hone their investigative skills.“Under this programme, the stakeholders will undertake two-day skill development indoor training every month at the district headquarters in which resource persons would impart training to the police personnel in every field of their working,” he said.The SP further said that in order to improve the living conditions of police personnel ‘Arkshi Adarsh Awas Yojana’ had been launched in the district in which police barracks would be given a facelift.Sharma, who recently joined the district and visited inter-state border police stations, said that during district crime meeting, he had directed all police stations to identify spots on the inter-state border and crime sensitive areas for installing CCTV cameras. This will enable police to track anti-social elements and miscreants.Underlining the need to curb the menace of drug trafficking, he said the police would do its best to snap inter-state supply line of synthetic drugs and break the financial back of main drug suppliers.“Elected representatives of gram panchayats, local bodies and NGOs and even societies are also supposed to play a vital role in the rehabilitation of drug addicts and to save youngsters from falling prey to drug abuse,” he asserted.He said the police would activate Nasha Nivaran Samitis constituted at the police station level to wean away addicts from drugs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/nurpur-palampur-to-have-cyber-crime-cells-311298

As a result, they have to walk this distance to reach the roadside and find a transport facility.“On Monday, villagers carried a pregnant woman on their shoulders to reach the roadside to arrange transport to the Banjar hospital. However, due to the long distance, it took them hours to reach the roadside. Due to the delay, the woman had to go through severe pain and finally gave birth on the roadside,” said Ramesh Dhami, a resident of the village.Agitated residents of the village said it was high time that the state government provided a proper road connectivity to the village along with transport facilities.They said a road was one of the basic things required to ensure development of an area and the state government should make efforts in this regard.Ajay Kumar, vice-pradhan of the Gadaparli gram panchayat, said, “We are urging the state government to provide road connectivity to the villages of this panchayat, which is a remote panchayat of Banjar subdivision. In emergency cases, people face a lot of inconvenience in taking their family members to hospital. Sometimes, people lose their lives due to the delay in getting medical care.”“Besides, without road connectivity, it is not easy to transport our agricultural and horticultural produce to distant markets in time,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/no-road-link-to-village-kullu-woman-gives-birth-en-route-hospital-311304

We expect to recover over Rs 10 crore from these stalls as the shopkeepers had not been paying rent for the last three years,” said Commissioner Ashish Kohli.A standoff had ensued between the MC and the shopkeepers after the MC introduced per-square-foot system to determine the rent of the shops in 2018. The shopkeepers, who had been paying nominal rent for these properties stopped paying it. The deadlock was broken a while back when the MC agreed to withdraw the per-square-foot system and the shopkeepers agreed for a 20 per cent hike in the rent. While the hike seems significant, it’s not much in reality. As many shopkeepers had been paying between Rs 300 to Rs 2,000 per month, the 20 per cent hike is virtually nothing. As per the agreement, the minimum rent for shops has been fixed at Rs 500.“Many shopkeepers have been occupying these shops for more than 50 years. Even if we had gone for litigation, the shopkeepers too would have had a strong case,” said Kohli.“The MC has not got any amount in three years. Now, at least we will start earning something,” said Kohli. He said the MC would charge the use and occupation charges, determined through per-square-foot system. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/shimla-mc-to-get-rs-10-cr-rent-from-shops-stalls-311305

He said the entire population was expected to be vaccinated with the second dose by the end of November and the rate of positivity in the state was estimated at 0.7 per cent only.The Himachal Pradesh government had challenged the high court’s order on the ground that there was no need for it to constitute district-level Monitoring Committees as the state government had already constituted several committees from the panchayat to the state level.The HC had constituted a committee for each district in the state consisting of the DCs, Secretary of the District Legal Services Authority and the President of the Bar Association at the district headquarters for monitoring the position in relation to the pandemic and suggesting measures to curb its spread.Observing that it was aware of the work done by the state, the high court had said that it was of the view that a set of guidelines could not operate for the entire state and, hence, a local monitoring committee would be “more useful in such circumstances”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/covid-19-supreme-court-stays-hc-order-on-monitoring-panels-311315
