He has topped his category for the blind candidates.Having missed the merit list by a whisker twice, Umesh feels it was a challenge to keep oneself motivated while preparing for the third time. “Apart from the current affairs nothing changes and in order to beat the monotony I tried to learn something than merely grasping.”Not deterred by the rejections which one faces in various walks of life, Umesh asserted that, “One can either feel dejected or can be motivated to overcome the problems and I chose the latter.”After completing his schooling from his village school, he had joined Government Degree College, Nahan, for graduation and later Himachal Pradesh University for his post graduation in political science.“Passion to join the UPSC was gradually imbibed in me. It began by reading newspaper interviews of successful candidates. Even dubbed South Indian movies where IAS officers are depicted in challenging and dynamic roles motivated me,” he added.He attributes his success to his father Daljeet Singh who is a farmer, his mother, a retired as a primary school teacher, his elder brother Jitender, who is serving in the merchant navy and his sister-in-law Neeru. “My entire family stood behind me and motivated me to achieve my aim,” Umesh said.Umesh has not only excelled in his post graduation but cleared UGC’s National Eligibility Test as well as Junior Research Fellowship while doing MA in political science.“It was in 2017 August while doing M.Phil at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), I realised that that I going nowhere in my career despite being 24 plus and started UPSC preparation though it picked up pace in 2018,” he asserted.He missed the merit list of UPSC in 2019 by 20 merely marks after successfully clearing the written. He narrowed down this difference to 8 marks in the second attempt in 2019. “Since I was pursuing PhD while preparing for the UPSC, I focused on self-study only.”All praise for the JNU, Umesh says, “It offers the most congenial atmosphere for a person with disabilities and I was fortunate to pursue my MPhil and PhD in political science and international relations from there though I had missed getting admission in post graduation.” He had opted for the same subject in the UPSC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/sirmaur-youth-cracks-upsc-exam-tops-his-category-316073

As many as 29,374 students have shifted from private to government schools in middle, secondary and higher secondary level this year.As per the data compiled by the Department of Higher Education after the completion of the admission process for session 2021-22, the enrolment in Class VI to VIII and Class IX to XII was 1,78,443 and 3,01,446, respectively, as on September 23. The numbers have witnessed an increase of 29,374 pupils as compared to the preceding year, implying that there was a shift from private schools to government schools during the pandemic period.The highest number of 9,215 students shifted to government schools in Kangra district, followed by Una (4,027), Hamirpur (3,446), Shimla (2,901), Mandi (2,195), Solan (1,866), Bilaspur (1,818), Kullu (1,803), Chamba (1,475), Sirmaur (591) and Kinnaur (127).The trend has been attributed to a number of factors, with the main being the drop in incomes due to the loss of business and jobs. In many cases, the death of earning family members, cut in salaries and online teaching forced the parents to opt for government schools.Better facilities, sound infrastructure, spacious classrooms, well-equipped laboratories, rich collection of books in libraries and playgrounds gave an edge to private schools but during the pandemic, with the outdoor activities suspended, the difference between private and government schools had diminished. Further, the high fee structure and annual fee hike by private schools was a burden for middle-class families, who had little option but to pull their wards out of private schools.Amarjeet Sharma, director of Higher Education, said the state government had launched the “Har Ghar Pathshala” programme for effective online teaching in government schools, which was closely monitored for constant improvement, coupled with regular assessment of students and remedial steps to improve learning levels of weak students. It had played a significant role in attracting students to government schools.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/over-29k-students-shift-from-private-to-government-schools-this-session-in-himachal-315714
