02-09-2021||New Delhi||NGT refuses to allow multi-level parking project in Shimla||The National Green Tribunal has refused to permit a project of multi-level parking and other commercial activities, including a Hotel on the railway land at Shimla in Himachal Pradesh.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson justice A K Goel said the project is not permissible as per the earlier directions of this tribunal which held that new constructions were required to be restricted in the core/green/forest area and even constructions for public utilities were required to be regulated to protect ecology.The tribunal rejected the submission of the petitioners that the supervisory committee, formed to evaluate construction of exceptional nature, has recommended the proposal for construction of multilevel parking which also has construction for commercial purposes/hotel.It also refused to agree with the submission that the project is necessitated by directions of the High Court and to promote public interest in controlling traffic congestion."We are unable to entertain the applications. Admittedly, the project is not permissible as per the directions of this tribunal, which have attained finality. The directions of this Tribunal are in the nature of an order in rem (against a thing). So long as the same stand, no order permitting the said project can be allowed," the bench said in its August 31 order.The green panel said that even if a part of the project is held to be of public utility, in that garb the main project is of commercial nature and goes upto three stories above the hill level."We, thus, do not find it appropriate to entertain the applications to review/modify the order of this tribunal," the bench said.The NGT said that the supervisory committee itself has found that the project is partly of public utility and partly for commercial purposes and is not within the purview of directions of this tribunal."It is difficult to say that the entire project is necessitated by the order of the High Court, as sought to be contended. Precautionary principle is significant in such matters and in the main judgement such projects have been found to have potential for disasters, based on expert studies," the NGT said.The NGT in 2017 had banned all construction, residential or commercial, in any part of the "green, forest and core areas" of Himachal Pradesh and within three metres of the national highways.It had also formed the Supervisory Committee to consider and evaluate the need for construction of buildings of exceptional nature and make recommendations, if necessary.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by Rail Land Development Authority seeking directions to permit the project of multi-level parking and other commercial activities, including Hotel on the railway land (Railway Godown below Winter Field) at Shimla.

Therefore, he locked the complex after its inauguration and didn’t hand over possession of the building to the MC, dismaying residents who were planning to use the parking facility. The three-storey parking-cum-shopping complex has the capacity to accommodate as many as 150 light vehicles and has 24 shops. The foundation stone of the project was laid by then Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh on February 3, 2016, near Hanuman Temple. It was proposed to be completed in one year but the MC failed to do so for want of funds.Ironically, miscreants removed the foundation stone of the complex but the authorities concerned didn’t install the same before its inauguration.Suresh Dogra, building contractor, said he had a liability of Rs 80 lakh towards the Nurpur MC. He said he had locked the complex as the MC failed to release the amount despite repeated requests. He said he would not hand over physical possession of the complex to the MC till his payment was cleared.When contacted, Ashok Sharma, president, Nurpur MC, said the contractor had no right to keep its possession after official inauguration of the complex. “The MC is in the process to auction shops of the complex and the outstanding payment of the contractor will be released after the auction,” he said.Former MLA and Kangra district Congress president Ajay Mahajan had termed the inauguration event of the complex as ridiculous as neither had it been opened for paid parking of private vehicles nor had its shops been auctioned even after one and half months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/dues-pending-contractor-locks-new-parking-complex-in-nurpur-305378

The situation had, however, deteriorated in August.With no water having being supplied in Circuit House where the local MLA DR Shandil stayed, he decided to take stock of the situation. Water tankers were used to supply water in Circuit House today.He paid a visit to the water lifting site at Gaura where the JSV staff apprised him about the problem of erratic power supply.Water is lifted from two sources – the Giri and the Ashwani. Though a 32 KV power station was set up at the Giri lifting site at Gaura village after spending Rs 5 crore some years ago, it has failed to give respite to the JSV.The lack of manpower to rectify faults at night and the leakage in supply pipes further add to the scarcity.“About 10 per cent water is lost due to leakage and the silt during the rains is another deterrent,” added Ravikant.He apprised the MLA that in the past 10-12 days, power cuts had been disrupting the lifting of water for hours. “The lifting of water was also hit due to a technical issue in the power infrastructure last night, affecting the water supply to the town. With no one being available to rectify the power snags, a single disruption halted water lifting for hours,” added the Executive Engineer.Shandil directed the staff to check the leakage and ensure that power issues were also sorted out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/solan-reels-under-water-crisis-305375

Over 3,800 people living in the Nurpur section of the highway from Kandwal to Sehuni are demanding one project one rate and a fair compensation but the Competent Authority Land Acquisition designated by the NHAI have so far announced two compensation awards for the same land at different rates, causing resentment among them.The Congress workers and the affected people led by Chander Kumar, state party vice-president, Ajay Mahajan, Kangra district president, and Rajesh Pathania, president of the Himachal Manavadhikar Lok Body (HMLB), took out a procession from the Bachat Bhavan to the mini secretariat and raised anti-government slogans.
