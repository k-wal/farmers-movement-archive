The local Municipal Corporation had transferred eight kanals to the state Urban Development Department for the project in 2009. However, the land is still lying unused. The present market value of the land is over Rs 25 crore.The foundation stone of the project was laid twice by former Chief Ministers Prem Kumar Dhumal and Virbhadra Singh on June 8, 2008, and in 2014. The state government had announced to construct the parking project under the private-public partnership (PPP) model, but the project has failed to take off.Laid by Dhumal, VirbhadraInformation gathered by The Tribune revealed that the project was allotted to a Gurgaon-based builder and an MoU was also signed, but in the past 10 years not even a single brick has been laid.Ashish Butail, local MLA, said the state government should immediately begin the construction of the project as even the appeal of the builders had been dismissed by the high court. He said he had taken up the issue with the state Urban Development Department, but no headway had been made in the past three months.There has seen manifold increase in the number of vehicles. Over 5,000 to 7,000 vehicles are added to the town and its adjoining areas every month.

The sheep shearers of the Wool Federation of Himachal have once again threatened to go on strike from September 23. This would mean that wool shearing operations in the entire state will come to a halt, causing losses to shepherds.The Wool Shearers’ Association said that last year, too, its members had gone on strike demanding the regularisation of their jobs in the Wool Federation of India. It added at that time Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur had assured them of fulfilling their demand. However, one year had passed since then, but they were yet to be absorbed even as contractual employees in the federation.CM had promised to fulfil their demand, they claimTilak Chand, president of the Wool Shearers Association, said that around 15 shearers of the federation had been working on a commission basis for the past eight to 12 years. They were being paid for the number of sheep they shear. It means they are employed only for a small period in a year. About 15 wool shearers had the responsibility of shearing about seven lakh sheep in the state, he added.“We travel to different parts of the state to shear wool off sheep. Due to the lack of job security, we decided to give up shearing last year. The government assured us to absorb us in the wool federation on a contractual basis. However, nothing has been done so far. So, we have decided to go on strike once again,” he said. Last year, thousands of shepherds of Himachal had suffered losses as their sheep could not be sheared in time. They claim that the value of wool goes down if it is not sheared in time.The Chairman of the Wool Federation of Himachal, Trilok Kapoor, said that the demand of sheep shearers was genuine. “The matter is under the consideration of Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur. I am personally pursuing the matter of regularisation of the jobs of sheep shearers. If 15 sheep shearers are absorbed in government jobs, it will not create much financial burden on the government,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/sheep-shearers-up-in-arms-seek-regular-job-309964

Over Rs 1.70 lakh was spent on these barriers, which were set up with financial assistance from the Municipal Council (MC). However, the barricades are not working for the past two years. Also, a police hut built along with these barricades to control traffic is being used as a dustbin by residents.The barriers were installed at Niazpur near the mini secretariat building on the Court Road. The one-way traffic system flopped in town as the barriers stopped working and the police huts too have been lying idle. No police or Home Guards personnel have been deployed here. Traffic rules are being violated by habitual offenders, causing frequent traffic jams in markets.As per the one-way traffic system, notified by the district administration on February 1, 2015, no four-wheeler is allowed to enter the town from Niazpur and the Court Road. Such vehicles can enter from Chogan and exit to Niazpur and the Court Road.
