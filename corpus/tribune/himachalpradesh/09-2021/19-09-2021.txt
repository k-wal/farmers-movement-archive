About 100-metre road was washed away in 2018.The area is prone to landslides due to the seepage of water in the hill. The PWD had constructed a temporary road within 15 days as a stop-gap arrangement. The road is narrow with the Beas on the one side and loose hill on the other. Now, the PWD is building a slab culvert to provide a permanent solution to commuters.KK Sharma, Superintending Engineer, PWD, Kullu, said even earlier, breast walls and pipes had been laid but the volume of water seepage was not going through the pipes. He said the tarring of the 300-metre stretch would also be done and work would be accomplished by October.The official said a 30-metre bypass had been made for the smooth traffic movement during the construction work.This left bank road connects many villages between Kullu and Raison. Heavy vehicles cannot cross the Raison bridge and the road is the only link to areas between Kullu and Naggar.

First lady Savita Kovind, Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar and Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur were also present.Ram Nath Kovind, President Need to make sacrifice for future generationWe must always remember that the constraints of resource finiteness can only be partly addressed by human innovation. For the rest, sacrifice by our generation is the only recourse. CAG has a big role to play in making us aware of the sacrifices we need to make for our future generations.The President said that the past 18 months had been very trying for the country, as the pandemic had hit the economy hard. “The government has taken various fiscal measures to alleviate distress, often financed through money borrowed from our children and grandchildren, thus necessitating its proper use,” he said.Kovind said that audit engagements provided a unique opportunity for gaining a deep understanding of the system and suggesting improvements. “The governments take serious note of the advice of the CAG, which positively impacts our public service delivery standards,” he added.The President said that for citizens’ convenience, government processes were increasingly getting digitalised and the fast expanding technology frontier had reduced the distance between the state and the citizens. “Through direct benefit transfer, the money can reach the poorest of poor even in the remotest corner of the country at the push of a computer button. From the audit perspective, this is a small challenge but a huge opportunity,” he added.He said that the sylvan surroundings of the National Academy of Audit and Accounts were a great place for learning pursuits. “These surroundings also teach us of a very onerous responsibility of leaving the same pristine nature for our future generations to enjoy,” he added.“We must always remember that the constraints of resource finiteness can only be partly addressed by human innovation. For the rest, sacrifice by our generation is the only recourse. CAG has a big role to play in making us aware of the sacrifices we need to make for our future generations,” he said.The President said that the independence enshrined in the Constitution was something to be cherished and all young officers need to fully imbibe these qualities. Comptroller and Auditor General of India Girish Chandra Murmu welcomed the President, Governor and the Chief Minister on the occasion. Director General of the National Academy of Audit and Accounts Sunil S. Dadhe detailed various activities being undertaken at the academy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/economy-hit-by-covid-make-best-use-of-resources-president-ram-nath-kovind-313088
