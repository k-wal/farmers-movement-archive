The HPTDC has 53 hotels and 17 cafetarias.The restrictions like a mandatory negative RT-PCR report or vaccination certificates have also proved to be a hindrance in the free flow of tourists. With international flights being restricted, there is practically no foreign tourists, who used to travel to Kinnaur-Lahaul Spiti during August-September.Officials from the HPTDC have specially been sent to Kolkata to hold talks with travel operators so that the Bengali tourists, who used to visit Himachal during Puja holidays, can be encouraged to visit the hills. Arrangements have been made to pick up tourists from the Chandigarh airport and drive them up to Shimla as part of a package. The HPTDC has an office and staff at Ahmedabad to facilitate the arrival of tourists as Himachal has been a favourite destination with the Gujaratis.Desperate efforts are being made to somehow get tourists to travel and feel safe at the HPTDC properties, where Covid guidelines and social-distancing norms will be followed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-pradesh-tourism-to-promote-destination-weddings-305744

The department was also to work out the modalities to execute the project at the earliest. The work was further assigned to the Ropeways and Rapid Transport System Development Corporation HP Limited, under the Transport Department, but the company was not in a position to execute it due to the lack of funds and technical expertise”.The reply stated, “The project was initiated bythe Urban Development Department. Moreover, the Transport Department is already in the process of establishing a transport nagar at Nadaun for which funds stands committed. Hence, the matter has been reviewed and it has been considered appropriate to transfer the Solan transport nagar project again to the Urban Development Department by placing the matter before the Cabinet for orders.”Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur had laid the foundation stone of the project in April 2018. Initially, the Urban Development Department was to execute the project and bear its cost pegged at Rs 21.22 crore.

The Chief Minister had even announced Rs 2 crore for the project ahead of the municipal corporation elections in April but It proved to be a mere poll gimmick.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/fate-of-solan-transport-project-hangs-in-balance-305750
