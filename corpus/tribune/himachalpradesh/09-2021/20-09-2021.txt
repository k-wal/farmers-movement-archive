||Merged areas of Dharamsala may pay property tax from 2019||Tribune News Service Dharamsala, September 19 With the government not responding to two resolutions of the Dharamsala Municipal Corporation regarding the property tax waiver, the areas merged with the local body might have to pay property tax from 2019. The hoteliers also might not get exemption for the period when complete lockdown was imposed in the wake of coronavirus. The Dharamsala MC had sent resolutions to the state government for waiving property tax on hoteliers for a period during which complete lockdown was imposed. The resolutions were sent by the MC in 2019 for extending urban tax waiver for the merged areas in 2020 for exemption on property tax. The MC had sought waiver on property tax and other urban taxes on eight merged areas of the local body. The Dharamsala municipal council was upgraded to corporation in 2015.  The previous Congress government had exempted all taxes on eight villages merged in the corporation for two years. In 2017, when the BJP government came to power, it  extended the exemption on the property tax on the merged areas for till 2019.  After 2019 the residents of the merged areas once again pleaded that since no extra benefit was given to them, the exemption should be extended further two years till 2021. The MC passed a resolution in 2019 and sent it to government. However, the government has not responded to the resolution. BJP Mayor Onkar Nehria admitted that the local body had sent resolutions to the state government regarding exemption on urban taxes for hoteliers and for merged areas till 2021, but the government has not responded to the resolutions. The matter would be taken up with Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur. “I hope the government will respond positively to the resolutions”, he said. MC Commissioner Pradeep Thakur said that since the government has not responded to the resolutions, the local body has moved to gather property tax from the merged areas and hoteliers. The survey to impose property tax on merged areas has already been completed and corporation officials would soon be sending recovery notices to the people, he said. The sources here said that hard pressed for finances due to the lockdown, the government was pressing on local bodies to gather taxes and manage their own finances.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/merged-areas-of-dharamsala-may-pay-property-tax-from-2019-313524

It adds that lesser tax will also reduce the scope of tax evasion by scrap dealers and will make them GST compliant“The GST Intelligence wing has unearthed several cases where scrap dealers have claimed input tax credit fraudulently, which means underpayment of tax and revenue loss to the government,” says Megh Raj Garg, association president.“This has added to the woes of the law abiding manufacturers, who, too, have been facing notices from the tax authorities to give the details of scrap purchases. Besides, the manufacturers are also being denied GST credit where the scrap dealers have shown irregular credit distribution,” says Garg.The situation has become so alarming that supply disruptions are being caused, as the manufacturers have been directed not to deal with the erring scrap dealers. “This has severely hit the continuity of our business and targeted steel production will be hard to achieve, as envisaged in the National Steel Policy 2017”.The association has suggested a reduction in the GST, which it feels will reduce the scope of tax evasion and will lead to a corresponding increase in the government revenue.“As per an estimate, scrap dealers have availed of fraudulent input tax credit of almost 50 per cent. A reduction in the GST will therefore increase revenue by several crores of rupees”.The association contends that it contributes about 35 per cent steel to the national production and recycles iron and steel to make similar products. It is a strategically key sector for developing the national economy.The manufacturers have also suggested other options such as a levy under the reverse charge mechanism on sales to the manufacturers where the GST can be collected from them. Another option is the GST on the supply of scrap on a concessional rate of 1 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/steel-producers-want-gst-on-metal-scrap-cut-to-5-pc-313530

20-09-2021||Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur has emerged as a youth icon in the state. Each time he visits the state||Anurag Thakur, a youth icon||The sensitive PrezPresident Ram Nath Kovind was forced to stay at a hotel during his visit to Shimla as “Retreat”, the summer Rashtrapati Bhawan at Mashobra, became out of bounds with some staff members testing positive. There were strict restrictions on the movement near the hotel in Chaura Maidan, where Kovind was staying. Sensing the inconvenience that might have been caused to the public, the President, during a stroll on the Ridge, asked people if they felt hassled. The people obviously remarked in the negative, but were highly impressed by the concern shown by the President.Ignoring common man’s plightWhen the multi-crore new Circuit House (pic) was inaugurated at Solan, local MLA Dr Shandil’s joy knew no bounds. Despite being a two-term MLA, he had been staying in the Circuit House where the lack of room availability had been inconveniencing him at times. The ecstatic MLA could not hide his joy as he took to social media to thank the Chief Minister for inaugurating a project conceived by him. While the common man is daily facing hefty traffic challans, politicians have spared no thought to speed up parking projects as their vehicles are rarely challaned. One wonders why the common man’s woes are too trivial for the VIPs, who claim they are in politics to serve the people.Glorious momentsThe golden jubilee celebrations of statehood at the Vidhan Sabha saw many former Speakers, ministers and MLAs taking part in the function. One could see former minister Vijai Singh Mankotia and former MP Dhani Ram Shandil, both former Army officers too, took part in the function adorning their medals. Legislators, who have been members of the house, were seated in the visitor’s gallery, which they probably ever entered. Though the shifting of the venue for lunch from the expansive Peterhoff to the Vidhan Sabha library, because of the President’s security, made the place crowded, it was surely a glorious moment for all.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/anurag-thakur-a-youth-icon-313578
