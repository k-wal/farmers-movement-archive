The charge sheet rate in 2020 was around 79 per cent, as compared to 73.6 per cent in 2019 and 72.2 per cent in 2018. Indeed, the book acknowledges how an increase in women’s participation in law enforcement could help bring down crimes against women.  Crimes against women include murder with rape, abetment to suicide cruelty to women, dowry deaths, kidnapping, acid attack, outraging modesty, immoral trafficking, cybercrime targeting women, and other crimes related to women.The book also highlights the experience of Himachal’s first IPS women officer (1996 batch) Satwant Atwal Trivedi who is also the first IPS women officer of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Border Security Force (BSF) to inspire the young girls. ‘Veerangana’ captures the journey of women in HP Police and recognises their stellar role in policing and contribution towards women empowerment in the state and the society, DGP Sanjay Kundu said, adding: “our women officers send a strong message of women empowerment thereby helping other women get the freedom to walk freely and fearlessly in public places and follow their ambition”.The other initiatives to increase women’s participation in law enforcement include the establishment of all-women police stations in all the districts barring Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti, introducing 24X7 Gudiya helpline and shakti button app for women in distress and staring Samarth Yojna to impart unarmed combat training to girls studying in schools and colleges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/increase-in-womens-participation-in-law-enforcement-could-curb-crimes-against-women-says-new-coffee-table-book-317889

The Sub Divisional Magistrate of Bhoranj in the district was appointed as Competent Authority for Land Acquisition (CALA), which started disbursing the compensation to the stakeholders. It is learnt that due to sluggish response of the website of the NHAI, transfer of the funds to the accounts of the beneficiaries was being delayed. There are over 6,728 land accounts having over 15,000 stakeholders who would be paid compensation.Notably, 19.5-km stretch of the NH-70 falls in the district and 287 buildings would be razed to widen this stretch of the NH. This stretch starts from Hamirpur town to Awahdevi and includes Drogan, Darkoti, Tapre, Bari, Tikkar, Barara, Panjot, Sameerpur and Sangroh villages.The CALA had started disbursing compensation to stakeholders about a week ago and it could only transfer Rs. 9.49 crore to 393 beneficiaries. It is learnt that one such entry was taking over 15 minutes and if this speed continued, it would take at over four months to distribute the compensation.Rakesh Sharma of CALA said the process to disburse compensation had started and over Rs 9 crore had been disbursed. Speaking on the delay, he said that slow connectivity was cause of delay and would be improved soon.DC Devashweta Banik said that CALA Bhoranj and NH staff had been directed to ensure disbursements of compensation within two months. Some technical difficulties were being faced on the online software for disbursement and the NHAI authorities had been asked to resolve them on priority, she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/hamipur-delay-in-relief-disbursal-flayed-317547

They also expressed their resentment against the grant of a month’s permission for the fair on the ground owned by the state Sports and Youth Affairs Department. The trade fair is slated to begin on October 5.Intriguingly, the Kangra district administration had not allowed any trade activity such as makeshift vends, stalls and merry go round swings in the the Janmashtami festival held at the historical Brij Raj Swami temple here in view of the Covid threat. Similarly, the Kullu district administration had also declined to allow trade and cultural activities during the week-long Dasehra celebrations from October 15 to 21.Anil Kumar, former vice-president of the Nurpur Beopar Mandal, alleged that the government authorities had adopted double standards in granting permission for trade activities in the state-level Janmashtami festival and for the trade fair starting on October 5. “A big crowd of people along with children from surrounding areas will throng the trade fair for purchasing various things and enjoying merry go round swings posing the threat of Covid spread. The businessmen, who have already borne the brunt of the lockdowns during the first and second Covid waves, will now face another market slump during the festive season next month,” he lamented.Nurpur SDM Anil Bhardwaj said that he had received a written complaint from local traders and he would take a decision on it after reviewing the situation.

Following the complaints, the MC has issued notices to the hotel owners and action is expected against them.Mayor Onkar Nehria said that the residents of Upper Bhagsu had complained that a new hotel constructed in their area was a threat to their houses. “We have issued a notice to the property owner and action will be taken as per the law,” he added.Meanwhile, the MC has been accused of being selective in taking action against hotels and commercial properties built in violation of the building bylaws. Naresh Kumar, a resident of Dharamsala, said, “The road leading to the Dalai Lama temple is dotted with several multi-storey hotels built in violation of the building bylaws. However, the MC has not taken action against them, as many of these properties are owned by influential people of the town”.Sources said that no action had been taken even on complaints filed by government offices regarding illegal buildings in the McLeodganj area. The local office of the Union Ministry of Foreign Affairs that acts as a liaison centre with the Dalai Lama, has often complained regarding illegal hotels having come up around its building.However, the Mayor denied the allegations and said that action was being taken in all cases.After the July 12 flash flood, residents of Bhagsunag in Upper Dharamsala have become sensitive to illegal constructions in their area.

The counting of votes will take place on November 2. “The model code of conduct will remain enforced in eight districts barring Una, Hamirpur, Bilaspur and Sirmaur,” said C Palrasu, Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), here today. He added that he would be holding a meeting with all administrative heads as the enforcement of the model code of conduct was not an option but a mandate, that too non-negotiable.The Mandi parliamentary seat had fallen vacant on the demise of BJP MP Ram Swaroop Sharma in March this year, while the byelection to the Fatehpur Assembly constituency in Kangra was necessitated due to the death of sitting Congress MLA Sujan Singh Pathania. The Jubbal-Kotkhai and Arki Assembly seats fell vacant following the deaths of BJP legislator Narinder Bragta in July, and former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh on August 8, respectively.As per the Election Commission of India (ECI) mandate, all personnel on poll duty shall be vaccinated with both doses, as a precautionary measure. Though the ECI has laid down norms for the byelections, restricting the number of people for the door-to-door campaign to a mere five and a maximum of 1,000 persons during rallies by star campaigners, ensuring adherence to the norms will certainly be a Herculean task.“The polling percentage in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was 72 and in the 2017 Assembly elections it was 74. Now, we have set a target of 80 per cent voting as every eligible voter must exercise his or her right to franchise,” said Palrasu.
