They ask when a seminar will be organised to stop the pension being given to the legislators in the state. Sources said that the posters were pasted outside some government offices in Dehra in the past few days when the state BJP executive committee meeting was underway at Dharamsala.The posters reflect the growing resentment among people over the hefty pension being paid to the legislators in the state while government employees, who were recruited after 2004, are not entitled to pension under the old system and would get just contributory pension.At the Jan Manch held at Dehra recently, a person had raised a question over the pension and perks being provided to the legislators, drawing a huge applause from the people present there.Former MP Rajan Sushant has launched a statewide campaign seeking the restoration of the old pension scheme for the employees and also stopping pension of the MLAs and the MPs. He has written to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha to discontinue his pension. There are about 90,000 Himachal Government employees, who are covered under the new pension scheme. People, who have suffered huge business losses and lost jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic, are also questioning the perks and pension being given to the legislators.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/posters-question-perks-pension-to-legislators-215292

The Congress activists led by former Rajya Sabha MP Viplove Thakur, former minister GS Bali, Palampur MLA Ashish Butail, district president of the party Ajay Mahajan, former MLAs Sanjay Rattan and Yog Raj started a march from Sunhet village on the Dehra-Chintpurni road. The march concluded at the main ground in Dehra town where the Congress leaders addressed the party workers.Viplove Thakur said the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state had brought an economic crisis and unprecedented taxes were being levied on people. The petrol and diesel pricehad risen to the highest levels ever. A tax of over Rs 50 per litre was being levied on petrol and diesel, which is the highest in the world. The high diesel prices were leading to the rise in the prices of essential commodities. Bali said that the Centre had duped people by giving them one LPG cylinder free of cost under the Ujjwala Yojana, as it was now charging Rs 800 per cylinder from poor people, who barely earn about Rs 3,000 per month. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/congress-protests-rise-in-fuel-prices-215295
