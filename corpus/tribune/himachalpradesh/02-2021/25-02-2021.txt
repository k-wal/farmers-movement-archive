Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur, who is also the Finance Minister, will present the Budget on March 6.The Chief Minister is likely to speak about the victory registered by the BJP in the rural electuibs. Barring Kullu and Shimla districts, the BJP managed to capture all zila parishads in the state. Moreover, Thakur will seek credit for welfare schemes like the Grahini Suvidha Yojana, providing LPG gas to every household, redress of grievances through the Jan Manch and free healthcare under Himcare.The Congress will try to corner the government over the grim financial health of the state. “While the debt trap has crossed Rs 60,000 crore, there is no effort by the government to either generate revenue or cut down on wasteful expenditure,” alleged Mukesh Agnihotri, CLP leader.Agnihotri said that the Congress would raise the issue of “murder of democracy” by the BJP in its desperation to capture zila parishads.“Never before has any government misused its official machinery to steal public mandate, the way BJP regime did,” he alleged. He said the Congress feared that the BJP regime would again misuse official machinery to register victory in the elections to four municipal corporations of, Dharamsala, Mandi, Palampur and Solan, due in April.The Congress would target the government on its failure to check the price rise and unemployment. Another issue, which could echo in the Assembly, is illegal mining.The Congress will also hit out at the government on the fake degree scam and alleged irregularities in private universities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/cong-to-corner-govt-over-price-rise-joblessness-217050

The right to marry or, for valid reasons, not to marry, as well as the right to choose a spouse is a well-recognised right in the Indian society since ancient era, it stated.  The petition filed by Sanjeev Kumar stated that he and a girl had been friends for the last few years and liked each other a lot.

This is contrary to the basic objective of the GST Act, which dwells on one nation one tax and is levied on both raw material as well as finished goods, rue investors.Honour promiseThe government had promised in the Budget speech of 2017 to abolish the AGT on iron and steel and it should honour the assurance. — Rajiv Aggarwal, investor from Baddi“The industries have to file a separate monthly return as well as an annual return for the AGT for the import and export of goods from the state, besides GST returns. This is contrary to one return for all indirect taxes,” said Rajinder Singh, a Baddi-based investor.“Even if the AGT is considered a tax on transportation, it is not justified as it enhances the cost compared to in other states. It makes the industry uncompetitive and defeats the very purpose of the GST, which dwells upon one nation one tax,” said Rajiv Singla of Kundlas Loh Udyog, Baddi.“The state government had promised in the Budget speech of 2017 to abolish the AGT on iron and steel and it should honour the assurance,” said Rajiv Aggarwal, another investor from Baddi. He added that immense paper work involved in the filing and assessment of the AGT returns was added hassles and it should be done away with to facilitate the industry. They termed the tax as illegal, unjust and contrary to the objective and spirit of the GST Act, 2017 and also a violation of the provisions of the Constitution of India.Though the industry is demanding the abolition of the AGT for the past several years, the government has not paid heed to the issue, as the cash-strapped state is dependent on loans and cannot afford to do away with taxes.The industries are chiefly located in the Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh industrial area as well as Kala Amb and Paonta Sahib in Sirmaur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/industry-wants-agt-on-iron-steel-abolished-217057
