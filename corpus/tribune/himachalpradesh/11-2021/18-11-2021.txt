He added that legislatures must deliberate on introducing Zero Hour so that public issues could be raised by elected representatives effectively. Birla said it was the responsibility of the Speakers to ensure that every member of the House gets time to speak and raise important public issues. Birla said efforts should be made for creating a single platform where the entire nation can see the proceedings of all the legislatures across the nation and get inspired and benefit from all such quality debates.He said steps needed to be taken to ensure time-bound implementation of the recommendations of the parliamentary committees.Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur said there should be quality debates based on research in legislatures rather than tearing and hurling papers on the floor of the House. Thakur said Parliament and Assemblies needed to strengthen democracy by deliberating on quality changes and legislations to meet public expectations and new challenges. Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar also spoke on the occasion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/legislatures-should-rein-in-indiscipline-and-ensure-qualitative-and-constructive-debates-says-lok-sabha-speaker-om-birla-339806

In February 2020, he appeared in the IIT exam and scored 40.33 out of 100 marks and became eligible for admission to M.Sc at the NIT.In June 2020, the results of the fifth semester were declared and he was given only five out of 70 marks in one of the papers, due to which he could not get admission to the NIT.

But the re-evaluation result was declared after the counselling for M.Sc and by that time all seats had been filled and the petitioner did not get admission.The petitioner alleged that though he again cleared the IIT exam this year, mental harassment and depression, which he had faced, caused irreparable damage.

Fly ash is generated by various textile units. Instead of ensuring its scientific dumping, it is being dumped at various empty places.32-bigha site encroachedThings have come to such a pass that even a 32-bigha site, selected for setting up an inspection and automatic vehicle testing centre with an expenditure of Rs16.35 crore at Baddi, has been dotted with illegal fly ash dumps.Things have come to such a pass that even a 32-bigha site, selected for setting up an inspection and automatic vehicle testing centre with an expenditure of Rs 16.35 crore at Baddi, has been dotted with illegal fly ash dumps.Though the Industries Minister has directed officials of the Transport Department to clear the site, the dumping continues at the site.Chief Executive Officer, BBN Development Authority, Richa Verma, said the DC, Solan, had constituted a committee to identify places for its scientific disposal.Committee member secretary, SDM, Nalagarh, Mahendra Pal, however, said the committee had empanelled five persons, who had offered their land for dumping as the government land couldn’t be spared.Since land is already scarce in the BBN, the government land should be put to use for public utility like parking, skill development centres, etc, instead of making it a dumping yard, said Vikas, a local resident.Solan DC Kritika Kulhari said the SDM had been asked to seek comments from the pollution control board and the Industries Department regarding the mechanism to dispose the ash.Member Secretary, State Pollution Control Board, Apoorv Devgan, said a site for dumping the fly ash had to be chosen by the local administration in consultation with stakeholders. A report would be sought from field officials regarding the unscientific dumping of ash and action would be taken against violators.“Fly ash is a health hazard and industrial units generating it are supposed to ensure its scientific disposal. It is supposed to be sent to cement, brick or tiles manufacturing. The authorised dumping site is also supposed to be reclaimed by way of undertaking vegetation over it as per norms of the Central Pollution Control Board,” said experts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/illegal-fly-ash-dumping-polluting-baddi-barotiwala-nalagarh-belt-339595

We need to have a road map for these crucial 25 years which will have a positive impact on people, besides accelerating the pace of development,” he said.The mantra for the next 25 years, the PM said, should be a sense of duty—in our action, conduct and behaviour— both inside and outside the House.Modi said the general public perception about leaders was that they only indulged in politicking, whereas the reality was that every political party had people dedicated to social service. “These leaders who do selfless service in helping the needy, should share their experiences with other members in the House on specified days so that others could get inspired to serve society,” he remarked. The PM also stressed the need for enhancing the productivity of the House by having discipline and commitment among members and giving opportunity to young MPs and women to raise issues.Talking about “One Nation-One Legislative Platform”, the PM said that a digital platform must be developed which will not just give the required technological boost but link all Assemblies and Councils in the country. He also laid emphasis on making all Vidhan Sabhas and Parishads paperless.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/focus-on-duty-discipline-healthy-debate-pm-modis-mantra-for-legislators-339393
