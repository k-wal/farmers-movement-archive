Senior leaders are stressing the need to rein in growing indiscipline in the party.The issue of growing indiscipline damaging the party, especially in the four byelections, was taken up prominently at the crucial Core Group meeting being held here. The party has got reports from various quarters throwing light on the factors that led to the bypoll debacle, but it strongly feels that vote undercutting by its own leaders harmed its interests the most.‘Discontent among workers against govt to blame’Senior leaders such as national BJP vice-president Saudan Singh, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur, state BJP president Suresh Kashyap, former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal, senior party functionaries, ministers and MLAs are attending the three-day meetings of the Core Group, State Executive and the BJP Legislature here. The meetings are primarily focusing on the reasons for the byelection defeat so that corrective measures could be taken even if it involved major changes, both in the government and the organisation.“The party has taken a serious view of the attempts made by some leaders to sabotage and damage the party and show-cause notices will be issued to them shortly,” said Randhir Sharma, BJP’s chief spokesperson, while taking to mediapersons here. He admitted that the unfavourable bypoll results were an eyeopener for the BJP and the party was deliberating on the shortcomings to formulate a new strategy to ensure victory in the 2022 Assembly elections.“Decisions such as change in the leadership or organisation and Cabinet rejig are taken by the party’s central leadership and as such these issues are not being discussed at the Core Group meeting. As is the norm in the BJP, it is the Chief Minister who will lead the party in the elections,” said Sharma.He said that the Congress should not be under misconception about its victory in the 2022 Assembly elections, as it has around 10 to 12 claimants to the Chief Minister’s post. The Congress should stop dreaming about victory as ‘Dilli abhi door hai’, he addedSharma said that the BJP would focus on training workers, besides launching a Maha Sampark programme so that the schemes and policies of the government could be taken to people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/to-check-indiscipline-bjp-to-issue-show-cause-notice-to-24-342895

Party national Vice-President Saudan Singh is also attending the meeting.The extended core group meeting focused on shortcomings and deficiencies that led to defeat.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/performance-of-in-charges-morcha-heads-reviewed-342896

Appointing 465 inspectors and other regulatory staff for medical device regulation was under active consideration of the ministry as it was an emerging area of concern.”Dr Dimple Kasana, Director, Central Research Institute, said the institute had initiated the development of therapeutic antisera for Covid-19 in collaboration with ICMR-National Institute of Virology and an ICMR-approved Covid testing lab was set up in 2020.She said the DPT vaccine manufactured in the new C-Good Manufacturing Practices lab was for the universal immunisation programme since 2020.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/officer-government-ensured-speedier-manufacture-of-covid-vaccine-342897

It is also the first vaccine to be approved for use in children in the 12-17 years age group in India. People were keenly awaiting to get this jab administered to their children, he added.“The ZyCov-D vaccine can be used on children up to 12 years of age and once its use is kick-started, another part of the population can be covered. The government will take a decision as to when to put the vaccine to use depending upon its availability in sufficient quantity,” said Dr Bhardwaj.Besides, 549 batches of Covishield, 466 batches of Covaxin, seven batches of Janssen and 24 batches of Sputnik-V had also been released for use.“The CDL is the first vaccine testing lab accredited to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories. It has a capacity of pre-release certification of nearly 7,000 batches every year. This capacity is likely to increase up to 8,000 batches this year, given the large scale testing of various Covid vaccines,” said Dr Bhardwaj.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/cdl-releases-indias-first-dna-vax-for-covid-342898

The committee has also thrown light on the possible reasons that could have led to the collapse.He said the committee had given its opinion on issues like safety of the four structures adjoining the site where the building collapsed. This includes suggestions like ensuring structural stability and retrofitting. The MC had ordered demolition of two of the buildings, above the collapsed structure, which has been stayed by the HC.The eight-storey building had collapsed in Kachi Ghati area of the city on October 1 as its foundation weakened due to continuous seepage of water. Though there was no loss of life as the building had been evacuated, the disaster raised questions on the slackness on part of the TCP Department and Shimla MC in enforcing building norms under the TCP Act, 1977.The collapse of the buildings has brought into focus the manner in which haphazard and unauthorised structures are being raised all over the town. The Kachi Ghati area, being unstable and with loose soil, is not suitable for heavy structures. Despite the instability of the strata, several high-rise buildings have been raised in the Kachi Ghati area even after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) restricted all constructions to two-and-a-half storeys in Shimla and banned all new constructions in the Cores Area.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/panel-submits-report-on-building-collapse-342900

But the road passing through this area comes under Chamba division of the Public Works Department. The maintenance of the road is also undertaken by the PWD.The local people are being charged entry fee at a post set up by the forest department near Miadigala, he regretted adding that many locals from Chamba visit Khajji Nag temple at Khajjiar every day. Apart from this, the people, who travel in their private vehicles to Lakkarmandi, Jandrighat, Bakrota, Moti Tibba and GPO for their work, also have to pay entry fee every day.Thakur warned that if the government did not give exemption in entry fee on private vehicles of the local people, the Congress would stage a protest against the policy of the wildlife wing and the government.
