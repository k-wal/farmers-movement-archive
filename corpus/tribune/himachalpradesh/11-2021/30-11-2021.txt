The inquiry was conducted by the high court, the notification stated.The court appointed district judge Rakesh Kainthla as the inquiry officer who in his report held Sharma guilty of taking a bribe.As a result of the inquiry, all the charges have been proved and the court has decided to recommend that the punishment of dismissal from service be imposed upon Sharma, the notification added. “Now, therefore, the Governor, Himachal Pradesh having considered the recommendations of the High Court and in exercise of the powers vested in him under Clause (ix) of Rule 11 of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 and all other powers enabling him in this behalf, hereby orders dismissal of Gaurav Sharma from the Himachal Pradesh Judicial Services with immediate effect,” the notification said.According to the inquiry report, two cases filed by Saini pertaining to cheque bounce under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act were pending in Sharma's court when he was posted as ACJM Sundernagar in 2017.Sharma called Saini in his chamber and demanded money from him in lieu of settlement of cases, the report added.Subsequently, Saini lodged a complaint with the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau.After the matter was brought to the notice of the high court, a team of 14 officials was formed and Sharma was nabbed from his official residence on January 31, 2017 at around 9 pm, it added.The case under Prevention of Corruption Act against Sharma is still pending before the special judge at Mandi in which evidence will be recorded next month.

The workers blocked roads and commuters had to change route and drive five to 10 km extra to reach their destinations.The police pushed away demonstrators and stopped them from entering the Secretariat.

The industry is heavily dependent on China, which supplies 65 per cent APIs to the domestic industry.Several pharmaceutical manufacturers, including the Himachal Drug Manufacturers Association (HDMA), had taken up the issue with the ministry.Joint Drug Controller, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Eshwara Reddy, said, “The Drug Technical Advisory Committee has recommended bar coding on API labels and this will ensure genuineness of the product. This will make available the QR code, which can be scanned to obtain the details of manufacturer like batch number, date of manufacturing, etc.The ministry has approved the bar coding on active pharmaceutical ingredients and its notification will be issued soon.”SL Singla, Adviser, HDMA, said, “Though pharmaceutical manufacturers are supposed to use API meant for Indian Pharmacopoeia but instances have come to the fore where API under the food grade and not meant for use in medicines has been supplied.”Apart from ensuring that the GST is paid on a batch of the API, there is little control over its trading. Re-packing and re-labelling of APIs by local traders enhances the chances of its quality being compromised upon and measures like bar coding and the scanning of the QR code will help a manufacturer check its authenticity.Since the manufacturers have little facility to test the active pharmaceutical ingredients at their end, small manufacturers, particularly who operate on credit, face problems in getting quality APIs, said other manufacturers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/ministry-to-introduce-bar-coding-on-apis-for-quality-344426

The temple attracts a heavy rush of devotees, but has failed to attract the attention of the successive governments for tourism promotion.The shrine is estimated to have been built in 8 AD by the Hindu Shahi dynasty and has a Mahabharata connection. The cluster consists of a central Lord Shiva shrine and over 15 smaller ones.Bathu-ki-Ladi had submerged in the Pong Lake, a reservoir created by the Pong Dam in early 1970s. Since then, these temples are only accessible from March to June when the water level recedes. The temples are accessible by boat from Dhameta and Nagrota Surian and by road from Jawali.Since the land on which these temples were built falls under the Pong reservoir, the government had awarded compensation for building a new shrine at Bainan Attarian, where idols were to be shifted after the construction of the dam. However, the temple structure was never relocated.Besides being a popular destination for pre-marriage photo shoots, several singers have shot videos at the shrine. However, the successive state governments have failed to develop infrastructure to enhance the beauty of the place, which has a wide scope for eco-tourism activities.Interestingly, even after remaining submerged for a long time, no major damage has been observed in the structure because it is made of a strong stone called “bathu”.The elected representatives of panchayati raj institutions of the Fatehpur development block adjoining the Pong Lake have urged the government to bring this historical place on the tourism map. They say that the state government as well as those managing this ancient structure have abandoned it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bathu-temples-tourism-potential-untapped-344438

The businessmen’s body has sought immediate revocation of the notification issued by the Government of India.Sumesh Sharma, president of the mandal, today said the trading community, which was already passing through a financial crisis due to Covid, would suffer another setback after the GST rates are enhanced.After the lockdown owing to the pandemic and unhealthy competition of online trading, businessmen were facing difficulty in surviving. “The proposed enhanced GST rates will rub salt into the wounds of the traders already struggling for survival,” he lamented.Sharma said the state Veopar Mandal and its executive members had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him not to increase the GST rates, as it would result in price rise and corruption, besides trading complications. “How can we survive when a trader has to pay more tax than his margin of profit,” he questioned.The mandal president said the Centre had made the GST regime complicated by bringing in 950 amendments to the GST structure during the past over four years, without taking the traders into confidence. He said the GST structure had made the trading a complex affair and even stamped traders as culprits if they were not aware of the amendments brought into the tax structure. “Squeezing business, rising GST rates and arduous tax structure has made the lives of traders miserable and their business has become unviable,” Sharma added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/traders-flay-hike-in-gst-on-textile-footwear-items-344439

This is a sign of change and we have to convert it into an opportunity to ensure good governance,” he added.The minister stressed that ULB representatives should focus on better coordination with officials for improved governance. “Sometimes, confrontation among elected representatives of ULBs and local officials is seen.

30-11-2021||The resignation by former Rajya Sabha MP Kripal Parmar as vice-president of the state BJP||Parmar's threat works||Political arroganceThe arrogance of senior functionaries of the ruling party has become a hot topic among party workers. They are accusing the functionaries of creating groupism within the party at the constituency level. Recently, a party functionary used vituperative language against a government official, much to the shock of many leaders. Seniors are hoping that the functionary will be removed from the important post he is holding after the BJP debacle in the byelections.Poll rout meet a formalityThe BJP’s much-delayed fact-finding committee meet to ponder over the causes of the embarrassing defeat in the byelections has been reduced to a formality. The problem of senior leaders being given a raw deal did not get attention. Though it is perceived to be the main cause of the widening rift among various factions, few lessons appear to have been learnt by ruling party leaders. BJP workers lamented that politics over room bookings in the Circuit House to embarrass senior leaders would fail to do any good. With the party's not adopting its principles like one person, one post, such meets will do little to uplift the party’s sagging image.Goof-up or deliberate?Though the government sought a prompt explanation into the goof-up, resulting in former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal’s allotted room being changed, the incident has yet again exposed the chinks and lack of coordination between the government and the organisation. The change in the room, which irked Dhumal and his supporters, might not have been deliberate, but a wrong message has gone among party workers. “It might be viewed as a small incident but it reflects the complete absence of official accountability and the deliberate sidelining of senior leaders in the present set-up,” said a senior leader.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/parmars-threat-works-344452

30-11-2021||Ambika Sharma||17 months on, Chail helipad project in Himachal still to take off||Tribune News ServiceSolan, November 29The development of a helipad at Jhajha village in the Chail valley remains a distant dream even 17 months after the project was approved by the state government.On the demand of the Chail Hoteliers Association, the government had approved the project in June last year. Around 6.19 bighas of land was selected for it and various departments such as the PWD, Jal Shakti, Power, and Forest were to give no-objection certificates (NOCs) to pave the way for the transfer of land to the Tourism and Civil Aviation (TCA) Department.Delayed NOCs to blame?Rati Ram, Deputy Director, Tourism and Civil Aviation, says, “Efforts are afoot to speed up the project as NOCs have been secured from various departments. This will pave the way for the transfer of 6.19 bighas at Jhajha village to the TCA Department.” Officials had initially shown promptness in executing the project and the officials of various departments had also conducted a joint inspection in June. The work, however, slowed down due to the delay in getting NOCs, the one from the Forest Department was received a few months ago.Divisional Forest Officer, Solan, Shreshtanand says, “The Forest Department granted the NOC about two months ago though the field staff had raised objections initially as the land in question is forestland.” Kandaghat SDM Vikas Sood says all NOCs have been procured and the case has been sent for the transfer of land to the Deputy Commissioner.Devinder Verma, president of the Chail Hoteliers Association, says, “The construction of a helipad in the Chail valley will help attract high-end tourists and uplift the area’s economy.” He laments that the project has been going on at a tardy pace and the association has been persuading officials to speed it up.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/17-mths-on-chail-helipad-project-still-to-take-off-344321
