As per the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), only the sale of green firecrackers was allowed on Diwali.The sale of firecrackers was allowed from 8 am to 8 pm only in the notified places after procuring the requisite permission from the SDM office while cracker bursting was allowed from 8 pm to 10 pm on Diwali.However, all restrictions remained only on paper, and no government agency checked the violations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/despite-curbs-crackers-sold-in-crowded-markets-334572

It feels great to open up the theatre for people after such a long time,” said Sahil Sharma, owner of the theatre.“In the two shows today, around 50 people in for both the shows,” he said.Incidentally, Shimla had four single-screen theatres, Regal, Rivoli, Ritz from the colonial era and Shahi, which started screening movies from 1953. While Regal was gutted in the mid-80s, Rivoli shut shop in 2010, when the district administration did not renew its licence and declared the building unsafe. A few days back, the Municipal Corporation issued orders to demolish the building.Ritz and Shahi, however, continued despite the mounting costs and falling profits until Covid-19. While Ritz folded up operations in the middle of the pandemic earlier this year, Shahi has reopened to see how long it can continue in the times that are no longer conducive for single-screen cinema.“Running a single-screen cinema has become a loss-making proposition. Distributors don’t offer good money to single screens and the price of tickets is also very nominal,” said Sharma.“The government needs to extend a helping hand to single screens. We have already lost three single-screen theatres in the city, and Shahi is the only one left. These theatres should have been preserved, as people have so many memories associated with them,” said Sharma.All four cinemas were located in the heart of the town, only a kilometre or so from each other. The cinemagoers had a wonderful time when all these four theaters were running. “There were people, who watched four shows in a day, one each in all of these four theatres,” recalled Sharma. While the other three catered mainly to the gentry, Shahi was primarily opened for the common man. “We mainly catered to labour class and youth, as we charged much less compared to other cinemas. Many a time, contractors brought labourers for a show before and after the apple harvesting season,” said Sharma.With multiplexes almost beyond of the reach of lower income groups, the reopening of Shahi is indeed a welcoming development.Suffering lossesRunning a single-screen cinema has become a loss-making proposition.

Kullu Zila Parishad chairperson Pankaj Parmar celebrated Diwali with her and installed a solar light adjacent to her abode.He said when he came to know about the plight of Bindro Devi, he went to her dwelling, which was approachable by a steep trek of 45 minutes. He said she was married to a person of Garhwal and her daughters were married. He added that she neither had land nor a house and was living alone in a cave. He added that panchayat officials had been advised to prepare documentation for providing her a two-biswa land for constructing a house.Parmar said he planned to illuminate Bindro’s house on Diwali, which also happened to be the ‘punyatithi’ of his father. He said with the help of villagers, he installed a solar light and celebrated Diwali with Bindro Devi.Though the government has launched various welfare schemes for poor, its representatives have not been able to fully provide these benefits to the deserving people. Bindro has been living a life of poverty for the past 35 years but she did not receive benefit of any welfare scheme by the government.Anni SDM Kuldeep Patiyal said there was possibly some land in the name of her father and he had ordered to conduct an inquiry into the matter.

06-11-2021||Our Correspondent||Lahauli hand-knit socks, gloves given Geographical Indication status||Kullu, November 5The indigenous hand-knitted socks and gloves of Lahaul and Spiti district have bagged the Geographical Indication (GI) tag. Save Lahaul-Spiti Society, a local NGO, has been granted the status of registered proprietor of the geographical indication “Lahauli Knitted Socks and Gloves” by the Himachal Pradesh Patent Information Centre, HP Council for Science, Technology & Environment (HIMCOSTE).The Lahauli socks and gloves are made from indigenous wool sheared from local sheep. A Lahauli pair of socks is knit in parts, using four double pointed needles. First the cuff is knit, second the leg, and at last the heel.The upper part of the foot is knit using eight colors into a traditional eye-catching pattern, locally called ‘dashi’, which comprises patterns composed by seven or eight types of motifs. Each ‘dashi’ is laid out in four or five rows in different colours.Once the front portion with ‘dashi’ is ready, the sole is built and the two are joined together up till the tip of the toe. The sock is then carefully sealed with ties or knots running inwards.Save Lahaul-Spiti Society president Prem Chand Katoch said the ‘dashi’ on the socks and gloves in Lahaul have localised cultural characteristics, making them different from elsewhere in the Himalayas. This uniqueness has to be preserved. The local names of motifs vary across Lahaul. Some examples of the names of motifs are Bumchang, Lari, Zildan, Kuru, Thingma and Kyog. He said the GI tag is definitely a promising and an encouraging start for our collective goals to preserve, protect and promote the traditional handicrafts of the Lahaul valley.Katoch said, “Written sources on the indigenous crafts of Lahaul such as weaving and knitting are scarce but our oral history is a rich repository of social and cultural importance of handicrafts.” He said written accounts, especially on knitting in Lahaul, began to surface with the arrival of Moravian Missionaries in 1856. The wives of the missionaries, notably Maria Heyde, set up the first organised knitting school in Keylong. The school offered local women a platform to refine their knitting skills, redesign and reinvent indigenous motifs and commercialise their products. This creative exchange of skills and knowledge played a major role in strengthening and sustaining the craft of knitting over generations, he added.Save Lahaul-Spiti Society vice-president Vikram Katoch said Lahauli women undoubtedly were the backbone of this craft. He said, “Thanks to their efforts, we have been able to sustain this craft till date. With the granting of the GI status to Lahauli socks and gloves registered as “Lahauli Knitted Socks and Gloves’’, Save Lahaul-Spiti Society aims to help Self Help Groups, Non Governmental Organisations, individual local enterprises and small-scale businesses in Lahaul to market their products better. The aim is to not only produce the highest quality products but also ensure optimum and fair prices to artisans of Lahaul and Spiti.”Made from local sheep wool||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/lahauli-hand-knit-socks-gloves-given-geographical-indication-status-334568

Moreover, the mobile phone numbers will be registered on the trekking app. These will also facilitate in rescue and search operations.The mapping of the major trekking routes will also help travel agents, guides and the trekkers to choose the journey they wish to undertake. With categorisation into red, orange and green, the treks will be planned according to the skills and physical endurance levels of the tourists, reducing chances of mishap in case of inclement weather conditions.It has been seen that often tourists are taken on trekking expeditions even when there is a warning of inclement weather conditions, eventually leading to mishaps and tourists getting stranded in snow and extreme cold weather. In such conditions, the government has to eventually step in to rescue the trekkers and often helicopter services have to be hired to expedite search and rescue.The state government has often come in for sharp criticism for not regulating adventure and trekking expeditions, resulting in travel agents planning treks even when there is adverse weather forecast.The Deputy Commissioner banned all trekking and mountaineering activities in Kinnaur on October 27. This was done as with the onset of winter, it is unsafe to undertake trekking and rescue operations in an emergency becomes difficult.  To identify arduous, average & easy treks||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/to-curb-mishaps-during-trekking-routes-to-be-mapped-classified-in-himachal-pradesh-334541

Though the tourist season took a beating in the last few days, bookings have once again gone up during the Diwali weekend.Devinder Verma, owner of two hotels at Chail, said, “At this weekend, luxury hotels saw 80-95 per cent occupancy in Chail and its surrounding areas, as high-end tourists from Punjab, Haryana and Delhi NCR chose to go to hills to escape the air pollution of the plains.”However, the budget-hotels did not attract many tourists and their occupancy was merely 40 to 50 per cent.The homestays spread across the hills around Kasauli are in demand. They were booked well in advance before Diwali as it gets difficult to find a place of choice later, says Girish, a Delhi resident, who has been heading to the hills since the last year.“I had gone to Uttarakhand last year. This year, I chose to spend the weekend in Kasauli with my family after Diwali. In Delhi, air pollution is at its worst after Diwali, and harmful for children and the elderly suffering from asthma or other lung diseases,” said Girish.Perched on an elevation of 2,250 m, Chail is particularly in demand by those wanting a quiet sojourn, away from the hustle and bustle of the cities. “Chail is an apt destination to spend a weekend in clean and green surroundings, in contrast to the pollution-ridden Punjab, where burning of stubble and Diwali celebrations trouble people,” quipped Balwinder from Patiala.“Occupancy was cent per cent in luxury hotels in Kasauli at this weekend and advance bookings were made by tourists from Delhi NCR,” said Rocky Chimni, Vice President, Kasauli Residents’ and Hoteliers’ Association.“The air quality in the hills offers a respite to people from the plains.
