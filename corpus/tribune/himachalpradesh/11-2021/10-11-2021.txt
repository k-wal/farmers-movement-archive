Despite the fact that the police was well versed with the situation, no action had been taken against the liquor and drug mafia, they alleged.They said because of the open sale of liquor and drugs, cases of domestic violence and lawlessness had gone up and there was unrest in many villages. Though the sale of liquor was prohibited at unlicensed shops, some shopkeepers were openly providing liquor to customers. The women urged the Kangra SP to conduct raids at these shops and arrest the culprits.Later, members of the local panchayat also joined the protesting women and submitted a joint memorandum to the SDM and DSP, Baijnath, demanding early action against the liquor mafia. The mafia had flourished in the area “with the blessing local leaders and police”, they rued.It may be recalled that last month, women of other villages of Baijnath had taken out a protest march against the rising trade of drugs and liquor in the area. They had claimed that the mafia was exploiting young children, school students, and unemployed youth by providing them cheap intoxicants.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/women-protest-illegal-sale-of-liquor-in-baijnath-336235

Unfortunately, it has not benefited the devotees visiting these shrines.Lack amenitiesThese temples get offerings in crores every year but much remains to be done to make the pilgrimage of millions seeking divine solace safer and more comfortable. At present, over 34 temples in the state are under the control of the government.Major shrines of northern India, including like Mata Chintpurni, Maa Brajeshwari, Jwalamukhi, Chamunda Mata, Baba Balak Nath Deot Sidh, Naina Devi, and an ancient Shiva temple are situated in Himachal.While taking over the management of these temples, the intention of the then Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh was to develop the state’s Shaktipeeths on the lines of Vaishno Devi and Tirupati Balaji. But even after 30 years, the Himachal Government is nowhere near its goal. Despite these temples having bank deposits in crores, the situation has moved from bad to worse.Most of these temples lack basic amenities like parking, medical facilities and sarais. Besides, the deteriorating law and order situation has also become a matter of concern. The recent brutal attack on devotees from Majitha (Amritsar) at Jwalamukhi Temple has brought a bad name to the state.Senior officials of the state government had also visited Vaishno Devi and Tirupati Balaji temples by spending lakhs of rupees but in vain.ML Sharma, a former civil servant who served as temple officer at various shrines for a long time, said the state government should set up a “Devasthan Board” on the pattern of Uttarakhand, bringing the temples under one banner. The board should be headed by a senior IAS officer and a master plan for the development of temples should be prepared. These places of worship should have an independent cadre and staff should be transferable. Temple funds should not be diverted for other purposes as being done today. It is the money of the devotees and should be utilised for their benefit alone, he added.Bijender Sharma, a resident of Jwalamukhi, said the government should implement the report of the BC Negi (former Chief Secretary) Committee, which was constituted on the directions the HP High Court to look into temple affairs. The committee had made important recommendations, including some pertaining to the utilisation of temple offerings.“The committee has also made very strong observations about vehicles purchased from temple funds being used by DCs, who are the temple commissioners, and SDMs. However, in the absence of political will, all remained confined to official files,” he asserted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/most-shrines-in-himachal-sans-facilities-for-devotees-336236

They were getting locally produced vegetables, like peas and cauliflower, at higher rates, while supply of some other vegetables was coming from distant parts of the country, which was the main reason for the high price.The supply from Punjab was expected to resume within the next 15 days and thereafter, prices of vegetables would reduce considerably, they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/veggie-prices-go-through-the-roof-common-man-worried-336237

The iron railing of the bridge has worn out at several points and the rickety structure is an invitation to accidents, given the high load it withstands everyday.The entrance to the bridge from the Subathu side is excessively worn out and the potholes have been filled with mud to keep the surface intact. A significant part of the railing has been broken and the authorities have failed to repair it.While the Public Works Department (PWD) has made some efforts to repair the Subathu-Kunihar road, the bridge has been left to wither from several years. Though the road is wide enough, this narrow bridge awaits strengthening and timely repair.“The condition of the road will worsen if it is not repaired immediately. Hundreds of heavy vehicles like trucks carrying cement ply on it daily, hence laxity can prove dear for commuters,” rues Jagat Ram, a truck driver.All repair and maintenance works of the PWD will be put on hold during rains, making the lives of commuters difficult.The Gambhar river side is also a tourist point that attracts visitors from far and wide.

With this, the total number of products from Himachal which have got the GI tag has risen to nine. This includes Lahaul’s knitted socks and gloves, Kullu shawl, Kangra tea, Chamba rumal, Kinnaur’s shawl, Kangra painting, ‘chulli oil’ and ‘kala zeera’.“The registration of Chamba ‘chappal’, under GI Act will prevent its unauthorised production as well as misuse of its name. No manufacturer can call a ‘chappal’ produced outside Chamba as ‘Chamba chappal’, as this will be under the legal provisions of the Act,” Sudesh Kumar Mokta, Member Secretary, HIMCOSTE, said.Mokta further said under the GI Act, unauthorised use and infringement of the registered GI by producers other than those from the region of origin can result in maximum of three-year imprisonment and a fine of maximum of Rs 2 lakh.Himachal Pradesh is the first state in the country to formulate a policy for the registration of products under GI Act in 2004. This has greatly helped in protecting the interest of the craftsmen. The HIMCOSTE has been holding workshops to keep these crafts alive and help the artisans by giving thema platform to showcase their products by way of exhibitions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/chamba-chappal-gets-geographical-indications-tag-336242

We can’t let that happen, so we have gone to court,” said Guleria.A primary school building in Mandi’s U-Block, the land for which was donated by Mandi’s royal family in 1930s, has been demolished to construct a multi-storey structure. The demolition of the school, which was a heritage building, has left many people upset, especially the alumni. “What has been done can’t be undone, but we will ensure that nothing except for a school building is constructed there,” said Guleria.He added, “We have learnt that the proposal is to open a school in the basement, and have commercial establishments above that.

The government was, however, weighing the political fallout of starting the construction at Dehra, part of Hamirpur parliamentary constituency and represented by Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur, and not at Dharamsala, part of the Kangra parliamentary constituency.Sources told The Tribune that the university administration was not starting construction at Dehra campus as the state government wanted that construction should begin simultaneously at Dehra and Dharamsala.Kangra Deputy Commissioner, when asked about the status of the land proposed for CUHP campus in Dehra, said an MoU would be signed between the university administration and the GSI soon for conducting a detailed study regarding the strata of the land proposed at Jadrangal. Once the MoU was signed, the GSI, after conducting a detailed study, would propose what kind of structures should be constructed over the Jadrangal land, he said.The Minister for Forests, Rakesh Pathania, said forest clearance for the land proposed at Jadrangal would be received very soon. The construction of the campus, both at Dehra and Dharamsala, would be started soon, he stated.The construction of the CUHP campus has already been delayed for about 11 years due to the fight over its location. Many senior faculty members of the university have left the institute due to lack of inadequate infrastructure. The University was running from three places — Dharamsala, Shahpur and Dehra — from temporary buildings.With the Assembly elections approaching next year, the CUHP campus is once again going to be an election issue. With the BJP government both in center and state, the party leaders would have a hard explaining to do over why the project, involving investment of about Rs 500 crore, was getting delayed inordinately.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/forest-nod-awaited-for-cuhp-campus-at-jadrangal-336259
