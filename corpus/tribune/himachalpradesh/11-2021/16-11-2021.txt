While Himachal produced 3.88 crore boxes in 2015, the final yield this time is likely to be around 3.5 crore boxes.Highest output of 5 cr boxes in 2010“Three crore boxes have already been marketed in and outside the state,” said Gyan Verma, Senior Marketing Officer, Horticulture Department. “We are expecting just 1-2 lakh boxes more from higher reaches of the state,” he said.With the HPMC and HIMFED procuring around 73,000 metric tonne through the Market Intervention Scheme (MIS), which translates into around 30 lakh boxes, the count went up to 3.3 crore. The addition of around 10-15 lakh boxes bought by private CA stores and home consumption would take the total to around 3.5 lakh.The state witnessed the highest-ever production in 2010, when over five crore boxes were produced. In the next decade, the state breached the 3 crore mark only thrice— in 2013, 2015, and 2019.However, even as the yield will be around 3.5 boxes this year, apple growers consider it a normal yield, not a bumper crop. “We produced over 5 crore boxes a decade back. Ever since, the plantation has increased substantially but we are still not touching the four-crore mark,” said Harish Chauhan, president of the Fruit, Vegetable and Flower Growers Association of the state.Verma believes that the overall apple business this year would be around Rs 5,000 crore. “Three crore boxes have been marketed. At an estimated average price of Rs 1,400-1,500 per box, we get somewhere around Rs 4,500 crore. And when we add the cost of apple bought by CA stores and through MIS, the overall figure should be around Rs 5,000 crore,” he stated.Had the untimely snow at the time of flowering, a spell of drought and then persistent hailstorm not damaged the crop and trees, the yield as well as the income would have been much higher. The record procurement of c-grade apples by HPMC and Himfed this season reflects the losses suffered by the growers owing to poor quality and size of the fruit this time.“There has been a loss of around Rs 700-800 crore because of untimely snow, drought and hailstorm. The Horticulture Department had estimated the loss of around Rs 300 crore due to snow at the flowering stage. It is really sad that growers have not received any compensation till date,” Chauhan added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-set-for-5-year-high-apple-yield-338655

Since practical training in the registered institutes is a mandatory part of their course, the denial to register students had hit their career prospects. They failed to secure jobs in the absence of registration by the council.The council had earlier refused to register the students, who had completed two-year diploma and four-year bachelor’s degree in pharmacy from the university, after it was found embroiled in a multi-crore fake degree racket last year.A case under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 120-B of the IPC was registered against the MBU management in February 2020 for cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy for the sale of fake degrees by its management. The case was in the court and the government had appointed an administrator to safeguard the interest of the students.The council’s denial had left about 300 students in limbo. Since practical training in the registered institutes is a mandatory part of their course, denial to register the students had hit their career prospects. They failed to secure jobs in the absence of registration by the council.To facilitate the students, administrator Rajiv Kumar had represented their case before the Secretary, education, in September.Rajiv said, “Following our representation, the Secretary, education, has directed the PCoHP to allow them practical training in various institutes after their registration. This has come as a big relief to the two batches of students, pursuing diploma and bachelor’s course in pharmacy.”He added that the regular study was under way in the university since its reopening in September last year through online mode and exams for various courses would begin soon. No fresh admissions have, however, been made.The Himachal Pradesh Private Educational Institutions Regulatory Commission had suggested lateral admission of first and second-year students pursuing various courses to other institutions to save their career. This, however, could not be done as various documents like marksheets, degrees, etc of the students have been seized by the special investigation team probing the fake degree case. In the absence of the documents, they were forced to continue their study here as they could not migrate to other institutes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/finally-relief-for-manav-bharti-university-pharmacy-students-338658

The focus of the Chief Minister remained on Mandi, particularly to his segment.Addressing newspersons here, Mankotia said whenever the BJP was voted to power, Kangra was always discriminated against in the matter of development and failed to get its due. He said it was the Congress government that accorded the status of second capital to Dharamsala, started winter sojourn in lower hills and constructed the Vidhan Sabha complex, opened Tanda medical college and Central University at Dharamsala.He said during the BJP regime, the Tanda college, the biggest medical institution of the lower areas, was in the state of neglect as most of the posts of superspecialist and specialist were lying vacant and important equipment like CT scan and MRI machines were out of order for the past many months, causing inconvenience to the public.He said though the BJP in its election manifesto had resolved to eliminate the mining and drug mafia, these had flourished more during the regime. He said the state was losing crores of rupees daily because of large-scale mining.He said the government spent crores of rupees on the Investors Meet at Dharamsala two years ago and claimed that MoUs worth over Rs 95,000 crore were signed, it failed to get any response and not even 30 per cent target was achieved.—OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/govt-biased-against-kangra-vijai-singh-mankotia-338663

The High Court has reiterated that henceforth the boards, corporations or other institutions of the state will not entertain, much less consider and decide, the recommendations of the employees associations or unions for non-consensual transfers of their employees in the state.The orderBoards and corporations will not entertain the recommendations of the associations or unions for non-consensual transfers of state employeesThe court passed the order on a petition challenging the order of the withdrawal of the petitioner’s posting as Assistant in-charge Driver Duty by the HRTC.A Division Bench comprising Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Satyen Vaidya observed that “this is yet another glaring example of employees’ unions/associations making recommendations and getting done non-consensual transfers of employees of the HRTC despite repeated orders of this court.The court was dealing with the question that whether the order of transfer can be sustained when the same has admittedly been carried out on the basis of the complaint made by one of the unions, namely the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS).The court observed that “we are appalled by the gross indiscipline existing in the HRTC where members of different employees’ associations or unions are acting as extra constitutional authorities and not only making but also getting effected recommendations for non-consensual transfers, especially, of their opponents”.The court rejected the petition stating that “the conduct of the petitioner himself has not been above board as he himself been pulling strings and involving various unions, including the Drivers and Conductors Union, as a shield to sub-serve his own purpose. Not only that, the petitioner had met with the president of the Mandi BJP with a request that he may be posted on drivers’ duty, which clearly goes to indicate that the petitioner has no faith in the judicial system”.The court observed “having resorted to extra constitutional methods for quashing the order of transfer, the courts have no room for litigants like the petitioner, who has no faith in the judiciary”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/no-transfers-to-be-done-at-behest-of-staff-unions-himachal-pradesh-high-court-338666

Shifting of 54 drivers and 52 conductors from Baijnath to Jogindernagar would multiply the problems of public.He said there was no justification in the shifting of the HRTC staff and buses from Baijnath to Jogindernagar. If the government was keen to have an HRTC depot at Jogindernagar, it should provide news buses and staff instead of shifting these from Baijnath. He said the Congress would launch an agitation against the decision of the government and people would come on streets.Trilok Suryabanshi, another Congress leader, said shifting of buses and staff was great injustice with the people of Baijnath.

The process would help prevent landslides, he said.The construction of the Ramshila-Manali road was completed 18 months ago, while 95 per cent of work on the Jia-Ramshila road is finished.Chauhan said dumping sites provided to the National Highways Authority of India were largely found vacant and it was found that its contractors had dumped the debris at many places along the Beas, ruining the ecology of the region.The DFO said despite several notices and fines worth lakhs of rupees, the National Highways Authority of India failed to take corrective action. He said due to repeated offences, an undertaking had been sought from the NHAI to revamp the damaged area.Abhishek Rai, an environmentalist, alleged construction contractors usually ignored the norms and caused irreparable damage to the environment. Strict and exemplary action should be taken against erring persons and firms, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-pradesh-notice-to-nhai-for-dumping-debris-along-beas-338460
