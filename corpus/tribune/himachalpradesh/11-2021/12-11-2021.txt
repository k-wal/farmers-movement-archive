They allege that the rates of sand and gravel have gone up considerably in the state, raising the construction cost of residential houses.Raghav Sharma, a resident of Una, says that in Himachal, sand is being sold at rates between Rs 21 and Rs 31 per cubic feet. “People constructing houses are being fleeced and the government should fix the prices of sand and gravel at least for the state residents,” he adds.Navneet, a government contractor, says that as the government has virtually stopped sand mining in the rivers, the construction material suppliers are fleecing them. The state Public Works Department has asked the contractors to submit M-forms to get their bills cleared. As there are not enough legal sand mines in the state, the mining material suppliers are not giving them M-forms. The government should adopt a policy to ensure easy availability of sand and gravel for developmental works, he adds.The Stone Crushers Association has also supported the demand for an objective policy on sand mining in the state. Dimple Thakur, president of the association of Una, says, “The Punjab Government has adopted a flexible policy for sand mining that will benefit the consumers and also increase the income of the government. In Himachal, there is no objective policy on mining. The rates of sand and gravel from legal mines are not fixed. Moreover, in the past one year, the government has not issued fresh leases for sand mining in rivulets, leading to a shortage of construction material and rise in their prices”.For the stone crusher owners, the government has not even allowed mechanical loading and unloading of finished and raw material. “We have requested the state government that like Punjab the stone crusher owners in Himahcal should also be allowed to use machines up to 80 Bhp power for mining at legal sites and loading of material. The government is yet to take a decision in this regard,” says Thakur.Director Industries Rakesh Prajapati says, “The state government does not fix the rates of sand and gravel and the prices are market driven. However, if a proposal comes up from people or the Stone Crushers Association, the government may consider it”.He says that the government is mulling over excluding brick-kilns from the definition of mining. The government will take a decision soon, he adds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-govt-urged-to-follow-punjabs-policy-fix-rates-of-sand-gravel-336970

Given a steep rise in the cases, the need to expand its purview has been felt since long, opine officials.An analysis of cyber crime in the last five years reveals that cyber crime frauds have risen from 524 in 2017 to 2,773 in 2021 while crimes pertaining to social media have risen from 221 in 2017 to 2,063 in 2021.The number of FIRs registered in the Southern, Central and Northern ranges as well as the Shimla police station has also registered n rise from 49 in 2017 to 127 this year. As many as 585 FIRs have been registered in the last five years in Shimla.“The opening of cyber crime police stations at the range-level will not only ease the burden of the police station in Shimla, but also make available specially trained cyber warriors for speedier investigation,” said Inspector General of Police (IGP), CID Crime, Atul Fulzale, who has taken up this issue with the government.He said even with one police station, Rs 83,88,831 had been refunded to complainants in the last five years where 4,399 cases of financial frauds, 3,168 cases pertaining to social media and 330 of sextortion had been reported till August 2021.Field officials in the districts, terming it a much-needed step, said handicaps like the delayed receipt of data pertaining to Facebook, Whatsapp usage of an accused as well as the failure to get the pinpointed location of an accused from most cellular companies often impede investigation. The first few hours of a crime are the most crucial.Neighbouring states have taken a lead in stepping up their preparedness like move to recruit experts and opening more police stations. Though a forensic-cum-training lab at Junga at Rs 1.48 crore is being set up by the State Forensic Science Lab, its work should be hastened.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/proposal-sent-for-more-cyber-crime-police-stations-in-himachal-336972

The agency has written to the Shimla Smart City Mission to chip in with financial assistance to reduce the initial investment on setting up solar plants, making it more viable for people.“There’s already a 40 per cent subsidy from the Centre on the solar plant and the state provides another Rs 12,000 subsidy. A 3kw solar plant costs 1.26 lakh. With these two subsidies, the beneficiary share reduces to Rs 63,000,” said Himurja CEO Rupali Thakur.“We are seeking an assistance of Rs 10,000 per kw from the Smart City Mission. If our proposal is approved, the beneficiary’s share for a 3kw plant will reduce further by Rs 30,000. He will just need to pay Rs 33,000 for the plant,” said Thakur.The agency has already carried out a survey of government accommodations and private buildings across the city to check the feasibility of installing solar plants.“As many as 296 government accommodations and 476 private buildings have been found suitable for installing solar plants,” said Thakur. The agency has already received the administrative approval for installation on government accommodations and the work is likely to start soon.Thakur feels if the Smart City Mission approves their proposal and contributes Rs 10,000 per kw for a 3kw plant, it will go a long way in encouraging people to opt for solar energy and making Shimla cleaner and greener.“The Centre’s subsidy for the plant in pre-Covid times was 70 per cent. The reduction to 40 per cent has made people a little circumspect. If we get the Smart City support, the enthusiasm among people will be back,” said Thakur.“Apart from reducing the carbon emission and making the city green, solar plants will save people a lot of money in their power bills,” said Thakur. To cut down the carbon emissions, Himurja is also in touch with the Transport Department.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himurja-looks-to-cover-most-shimla-rooftops-with-solar-plants-336981
