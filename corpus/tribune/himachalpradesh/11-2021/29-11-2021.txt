Most of the tourists were from Europe, Israel and South East Asian Buddhist countries. Their inflow has been reduced to naught since the outbreak of the pandemic. Many tourists, who had been staying here as disciples of the Dalai Lama or to study in Tibetan monasteries here, have also returned.Deepak Sharma, who runs a tourist booking company in Dharamsala, said, “We were hoping that foreign tourists would return to the region after international flights start. The announcement of the government that it would give free visa to first 5 lakh foreign tourists had also provided a ray of hope. However, the news of a new Covid strain has dampened the spirit.”Prem Kumar, a hotelier, said tourism in Dharamsala was unlikely to pick up till the Buddhist tourist circuit started functioning and foreign tourists started arriving. Despite having the best air connectivity in Himachal Pradesh, the region had failed to attract domestic tourists. The reason for that was high air fares and limited flights. Besides, the craze for the Rohtang tunnel was also attracting the domestic tourists.Sanjeev Gandhi, general secretary of the Smart City Dharamsala Hotel and Restaurant Association, said the government should give some push to the tourism industry. It should organise cultural fests, food fests and other activities to attract tourists. The industry stakeholders were reeling under huge losses.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/new-covid-strain-scare-dashes-dharamsala-hoteliers-hopes-343974

However, no steps have been taken by the government to implement the announcement,” said samiti convener Sanjay Chauhan.HPMC and Himfed procured around 74,000 tonne apple this year, the highest in the last 10 years. The cost of the apple amounts to around Rs 72 crore. Chauhan said the apple growers suffered huge losses due to inclement weather this year. Their losses were accentuated by non-remunerative price in Mandi, especially in August, and the hike in the cost of packaging material.“The government has not given any compensation for the losses the growers had suffered due to inclement weather. And if MIS payments are also not made in time, the growers, especially the small and marginal ones, who had to sell a large portion of their crop through the MIS, will sink deeper into financial distress,” said Chauhan.He said the government made the growers wait for several years for the MIS payment. “It’s exploitation of the farmers and if the government doesn’t make the pending payment immediately, we will launch an agitation,” Chauhan said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/pay-rs-72-cr-to-apple-growers-soon-samiti-343988
