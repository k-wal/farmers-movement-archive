Many leaders celebrated the victory with their supporters in different parts of the district.Sudhir Sharma, former minister, who had been inactive in Dharamsala after MC polls for a long time, today addressed his supporters. Sudhir organized a meeting of his workers and pointed out that the Congress win in bypolls was a harbinger of party’s victory in 2022 Assembly elections. He said that the BJP government in the state had failed to perform in the last four years and people of region were suffering. The people have punished the BJP in the bypolls, he said.Race for supremacy beginsSudhir would try to take over the mantle of Congress leadership in Kangra district after the demise of senior leader GS Bali. He, however, faces hurdles in his Assembly constituency Dharamsala. His rival group in the area, including former Mayor Davinder Jaggi and other local leaders, organised a separate event to celebrate the Congress’ victory in bypoll.HPCC general secretary Kewal Singh Pathania organized an event in Shahpur where sweets were distributed among party workers. He said the current BJP government had ignored Kangra district and many projects from the area had been shifted to other districts. The people Kangra district had given a befitting reply to the BJP for ignoring the district by ensuring defeat of the ruling party in Fatehpur bypoll, he said.Chander Kumar, former MP and senior Congress leader from Jawali, also congratulated the party workers in his area. Chander Kumar said that the defeat of BJP in all four bypolls in Himachal was not only the setback of the state government but also of the national president of party JP Nadda, who belongs to state. The people of the state have expressed their feelings against anti-poor, working class and middle class policies of the union government, he said.Victory in bypolls has buoyed the Congress leadership in Kangra district as the party was seeing the elections results as indication of what could happen in 2022 Assembly elections scheduled in November next. However, the victory has triggered a tussle for leadership within the Congress in various constituencies and at the district level. The Congress leaders are now trying to outdo each other. However, after Virbhadra Singh and GS Bali the party was still looking for a leader around which everyone can gather and work together for the party.On the other hand after the defeat in bypolls there was concern among the BJP leadership in the district. Most BJP leaders avoided media queries regarding the defeat of party and were fearing party high command action against state leadership.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bypoll-win-buoys-up-kangra-cong-leaders-334014

The state government has appointed administrators to run transport societies and this has become a cause of discontent among them. The rising fuel prices and declining work further added to their woes.The areas went with CongressSeveral areas, which had voted in favour of the BJP in the past, failed to support the party with the same enthusiasm. This was also attributed to the discontent against BJP candidate Rattan Pal, besides other factors like price rise and rising unemployment. Pal had failed to emerge as a mass leader.The merged areas of Nalagarh failed to give the BJP lead as the number of votes was reduced to less than 900. In the past, 2,500 votes had been polled in favour of the party from this belt, said political observers.The Congress secured a decisive lead of around 3,400 votes from the Darlaghat area. The fact that Congress candidate Sanjay Awasthy also hails from this belt, it helped him attain a significant share of the votes.The BJP failed to counter this lead from other areas, including Domehar, which was the home turf of Rattan Pal, and it cost the party dear.Rattan Pal secured 838 votes from his home turf though Awasthy also got 342 votes from this area. The BJP performed better in Kunihar and a few of its adjoining areas but it was no match for the Congress’ overall performance in this segment.Rural areas like Jaghoon, Patta, Saur, Uchagaon, Namhol went with the BJP.In several areas, both parties were neck and neck.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/discontent-among-truckers-cost-bjp-dear-334025

Efforts should be made to increase practicals in under graduate programmes. Also, post graduate courses would be restructured in a step-wise manner. Farm universities should structure one-year certificate courses leading to two-year diploma course, he stated.“Currently, admissions are not as per the need and these are not able to serve the purpose as many students are not going to the farm sector. There is need to frame guidelines for entrepreneurship for students,” Dr Pratap said.The chairman disclosed that the other key changes recommended in NEP indicated that the country would move towards multi-disciplinary universities. There would not be further division of universities and by 2035, universities with multiple campuses would merge.Prof HK Chaudhary, Vice-Chancellor of the host university, suggested widening the horizon of farm education by allowing freedom to choose subjects, multi-disciplinary approach and introducing farm education at school level. CSK university had moved fast to adopt and implement key recommendations of the NEP by increasing the intake of various UG and PG programmes, digitisation, smart classrooms and use of sophisticated new-age technology.Dr JP Sharma, Vice-Chancellor, SK University of Agricultural Science & Technology, Jammu, suggested tailor-made certificate and diploma courses based on the competence of students after completion of three-year degree programme.Dr JP Sharma, Director of Research, Dr Bikram Singh and Dr MS Bhadwal, deans from SKUAST, Jammu; Dr Anju Dhiman and Dr Kamal Sharma, both deans from Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Solan; took part in the event.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/experts-for-more-practicals-subject-choice-in-undergraduate-courses-334028

Kandwal and Toki barriers, the two main entry points from Punjab in Kangra district, have been functioning without weighing machines. A senior RTO officer admitted that both weighing machines had been non-functional for the past many months.Following the failure on the part of government agencies, the state is facing losses between Rs 6,000 cr and Rs 7,000 cr every year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/overloaded-trucks-damage-roads-334031

Eminent historians say that the fires are not only causing loss of life and property but also destroying rich cultural heritage and age-old ‘Kath-Kuni’ architecture of the area.“The structures can be rebuilt but the heritage cannot. The centuries-old architecture of Kath-Kuni, the religious beliefs of the villagers and the historical temples where scholars undertook researches cannot be restored,” they add.They say that Malana, known as the oldest form of democracy in the world, has lost the attraction for scholars due to the devastating fire that razed almost the entire village, including a centuries-old temple, in 2007.Villagers say that successive governments forget the promises made during elections or at the time of natural disasters. They understand that fire stations cannot be provided in all villages. Therefore, sub-stations should be developed in major valleys.Gaurav, a resident of Kullu, says that the government should formulate an action plan and hold awareness campaigns for villagers to deal with the issue as many of these villages are remote, hence inaccessible. Stacking of fodder and firewood, use of substandard electricity implements and increasing the sanctioned electricity load are various reasons for these mishaps, he adds.Workshops and camps can be organised to make the residents aware of the causes and the precautions that need to be taken. Disaster management teams comprising locals should be set up in villages. The government should also encourage NGOs to join hands with the administration for such awareness campaigns and save the age-old architecture and beliefs, besides the cultural heritage of the Kullu valley, he adds.Abhishek Rai, an environmentalist, says that lessons should be learnt from history and villagers should deviate from the conventional methods of stacking fodder and firewood. Water storage tanks should be built in villages that are inaccessible by road to control fires, he add.The fire incidents in the district increase with the onset of the winter, as people use various mediums to keep themselves warm. Many villages are not connected by road and thus the devastation caused by fire incidents is more due to inaccessibility.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/fires-reduce-rich-heritage-age-old-architecture-to-ashes-334032

I don’t see any possibility of change. The sympathy factor for the Congress and anti-incumbency against the government might have affected the BJP’s prospects,” said CM Thakur.The fact that the Congress got lead in nine of the 17 Assembly segments that form part of the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency indicates the growing resentment against the BJP in the state. In the last parliamentary polls in 2019, the Congress had failed to get lead even from a single segment.The Congress’ victory has come as a shot in the arm for the party. It was the first election that the party fought minus its stalwart Virbhadra Singh.
