The elderly and children face a harrowing time in crossing the road||Congested Sanjauli||— Devender, SanjauliEmission from vehicles a cause of worryTHERE is no check on high emission from vehicles, especially trucks and buses, which has become a cause for increase in pollution in Shimla. Though it is mandatory for all vehicles to have a pollution check certificate but in the absence of checking by the police, vehicle owners do not bother getting their vehicle checked for pollution.

Being dry weather, a major part of the debris which flowed down was dry earth,” informed an official.A private company engaged in four-laning the highway has stationed staff to deal with such eventualities. The traffic was restored within less than half an hour. As it is a busy highway, the suspension of traffic even for a few minutes causes big blockades as vehicles line up on both sides.Traffic was already put on hold on both sides of the road minutes before the landslide and this averted any mishap.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/landslide-near-kandaghat-342547

This was held by the HP High Court while quashing a transfer order issued on the recommendation of a state Cabinet minister.Justice Ajay Mohan Goel said, “Where an employee is to be posted is the prerogative of the employer. However, this prerogative has to be exercised in a prudent and rationale manner by the employer.”He said, “On the asking of a minister, who happens to be a member of the State Legislative Assembly from Dharampur, Mandi, the petitioner has been transferred. Why the transfer of the petitioner was requested is beyond the comprehension of the court. More so, when the state electricity board, of which the petitioner is an employee, was not with the minister concerned.Besides, the transfer order has been passed by the electricity board without any independent application of mind, simply on the basis of a communication received from the office of the CM, the HC said.It said, “The transfer order has been passed by the board in an arbitrary manner and the same is a result of colourable exercise of power and not on account of administrative exigency or in public interest.”The court passed this order last week on a petition filed by an employee of the State Electricity Board challenging the order issued on June 7, 2021, whereby he has been transferred to the office of Senior Executive Engineer, Electricity Division, HPSEBL, Dharampur, from the office of the Superintending Engineer (Design), Electrical System HPSEBL, Hamirpur.It was alleged that he has been transferred on the basis of the recommendatory note issued by a Cabinet minister which demonstrated that the transfer order is not on account of administrative exigency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/hp-high-court-quashes-transfer-ordered-at-behest-of-cabinet-minister-342528

The appointment of the petitioners is clearly in contravention of the rules. Therefore, the petitioners have no right to assail the appointment of the private respondents, who have been appointed strictly in accordance with the rules”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-pradesh-high-court-imposes-cost-for-filing-frivolous-plea-342525

He said Sandeep had already flown in the tandem flights eight times in Bir Billing, adding that he died because of negligence of the pilot who was inexperienced. He wondered how the tourism department had granted a licence to untrained pilots. He also expressed doubt over the quality and standard of the paraglider which was being used by the pilot at the time of the mishap.He said he had already written a letter to the CM with a request that the state should ban paragliding in Bir Billing so that lives of innocent tourists could be saved.Om Parkash said it was the first incident since paragliding was introduced in Bir Billing in 1990 that safety harness and body belts went loose in air killing a co-flier. He said many mishaps had taken place because of bad weather during solo flights but it never happened that a man lost his life because of loosening of his safety harness and multiple body belts.Efforts to contact Raj Kumar, father of Sandeep, went in vain as he was under shock and refused to talk.Questions raised||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/kin-of-deceased-seek-probe-into-paragliding-mishap-at-bir-billing-342521

Besides, every pilot had to adhere to the tariff fixed by the association or the Tourism Department.The association has also requested the Tourism Department that only those pilots who had been given licences for tandem flying by the Deputy Director Tourism, Dharamsala, should be allowed to fly at Billing because they are well versed with the difficult topography of the area, particularly the high mountains of Dhauladhars.

Residents of the Naddi area along with a large number of Tibetans gathered at the lake to save fish, which are on the verge of extinction.Vikas Sharma, a resident of Naddi area, said, “It is strange that the lake has dried up just after the monsoons. The lake was filled to the brim by September end but it dried up suddenly. Local residents noticed fish perishing in the dried-up lake and decided to rescue them. The fish caught from the lake will be released in other water bodies and rivulets of the area”.Naresh Kumar, another resident, said that the lake used to have water throughout the year. “However, a few years ago, Public Works Department (PWD) officials dug up the bed of the lake with JCB machines to deepen it and remove silt. Since then the lake has lost its capacity to retain water. It is sacred to local people and PWD officials should not have disturbed its bed,” he added.The mid-altitude lake located at a distance of about 11 km from Dharamsala in Tota Rani village, near Naddi, though is very small as compared to its namesake lake in Srinagar (Kashmir), it is a natural water body that is vital for the eco system of surrounding hills.This natural water body at a height of 1,775 metres from the sea level is surrounded by Deodar trees and is a tourist attraction. The locals consider it as sacred and there is a small Shiva temple located at its banks.However, continuous silting from adjoining mountains has reduced the depth of the lake. About half of the lake area is filled with silt and converted into a grassland.As per the revenue records, the area of the lake is about 1.22 hectares or 12,200 sq mts. However, due to silting, its area has reduced to half. The depth of the lake that was about 10 feet has also reduced. The local administration had in 2011 launched a massive operation with the help of locals, who contributed in the form of labour and machines, to resurrect the lake. Silt taken out was used to create a parking lot near the temple area. Since then the lake dries up rapidly.Sources say that geologists are of the opinion that aqueducts created at the base of the lake due to unscientific digging is leading to draining of water. The Kangra district administration had called geological experts to study the reasons as to why the lake was losing water but till date no solution to the problem had been found.A local festival is also organised at the lake in September. The local Gaddi community considers the lake as sacred and wants the government to protect it. Deputy Commissioner Nipun Jindal said that geological experts had been requested to propose solutions to the problem of the Dal Lake drying up.Lost capacity to retain water after it was dug upThe lake used to have water throughout the year.

He blamed a senior official posted in the Chief Minister’s office for his decision.He uploaded his resignation letter addressed to party president Suresh Kashyap on his social media account and cited victimisation for the past six months as the reason for his decision.Gupta is also three-term chairman of Baghat Urban Cooperative Bank as well as a former chairman of the local Municipal Council. He alleged that he had raised the issue of corruption in the bank with the government as well as the party on several occasions in the past six months but he got no support.He alleged that he was victimised for exposing corruption in the bank where the wife of a senior official posted in the Chief Minister’s office was a defaulter and the bank MD had financial dealings with them.“A committee was set up to probe various financial irregularities in the bank and as per its findings the MD , an AGM and a senior manager were suspended. They successfully exerted pressure on the state government as well as officials and their suspension orders were revoked within three days”.“What hurt me most was the fact that my nomination papers for the bank directors’ elections were rejected on a flimsy ground as the returning officer was forced to do so. I was rewarded for trying to stop corruption in the bank and trying to make recoveries from defaulters, who were often seen approaching officials in the state secretariat or the Cooperatives Department”.He said that people had reposed faith in the bank and such acts of alleged corruption would mar its image. “I have been with the bank for 25 years and remained its chairman for three terms but was meted out a shabby treatment by the government”.He is said to be close to former state president Rajeev Bindal. “I got no support from the government or the party organisation and was forced to knock the doors of court as many as six times in my own government,” he rued. He, however, said that he would always remain a BJP worker.‘Kashyap failed to address grievances’It is futile to remain the in-charge of Sirmaur district, which is the home turf of state president Suresh Kashyap, as he could not address the wrongs when conveyed to him. I have, however, abided by all responsibilities entrusted to me. — Pawan Gupta, member of BJP state executive committee||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/another-blow-to-bjp-sirmaur-in-charge-resigns-from-posts-342489

Reportedly, about a dozen non-performing chairman and vice chairmen of boards and corporation and vice president and general secretaries of the party are on the firing line. Major shuffling in the Cabinet is not ruled out, insiders in the party said adding that change in organizational set up in Mandi and Fatehpur is on the cards.Wrong selection of candidate in Jubbal-Kotkhai, internal sabotage in Fatehpur, sympathy factor, overconfidence and failure to involve family of Sukh Ram in Mandi, problems with attitude of party candidate in Arki and inability to strike caste and regional balance are perceived as the reasons reportedly cited for the washout in by-elections.The party propped up Chetan Bragta, son of former minister Narinder Bragta as candidate from Jubbal-Kotkhai, the seat vacated because of the death of his father and he had already started campaigning. But the party suddenly changed the candidate at the last minute and gave ticket to Neelam Saraik. The party leaders who were seeking support for Bragta were nonplussed. Chetan virtually hijacked the cadre and the official candidate was left high and dry.In Mandi Lok Sabha by-election, the failure of the BJP to actively involve family of former Minister Sukh Ram in the campaign cost the BJP dear and had about 70,000 ex-servicemen not supported Brig Khushal Singh Thakur, the situation would have been worse.In Fatehpur, denial of ticket to former Rajya Sabha MP, Kripal Parmar caused fissures in the party, resulting in defeat of party candidate. Parmar, who was vice-president of the state BJP, resigned from the post yesterday, implying that his inputs on the defeat would not be available.In Arki, the attitude of the candidate was cited as reason for defeat and another major cause was failure of the party to strike a balance between caste and region and effective strategy to counter the sympathy wave.State BJP in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna, co-incharge Sanjay Tandon, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur, state president Suresh Kashyap, former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal, organizational secretary Pawan Rana, MLA Rajiv Bindal and Rakesh Jamwal, former state president Satpal Singh Satti attended the meeting.Discussions were also held on Shimla Muncipal Corporation elections. Meeting of office bearers and state executive would be held on November 25 and 26 respectively.Commenting on the resignation of some BJP leaders, Khanna said that some resignations are taking round in social media only and the party has not received any resignation and these leaders have resigned only from the post and not from the party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bjp-deliberates-on-causes-for-himachal-byelection-debacle-342487
