Although because of the rising positivity, the state needs to conduct enhanced testing while maintaining the required RT-PCR share as it will aid in early identification of infection in the state,” Ahuja said.Andhra Pradesh, she pointed out, has shown a high quantum of weekly new cases over the past four weeks, and although the weekly positivity is less than 2.5 per cent, it has stayed stagnant for the past two weeks.The state has also witnessed a decline in tests conducted from 2,82,959 in the week of October 04-10 to 2,41,838 in the week of October 25-31, she said.“East Godavari district has been identified as a district of concern due to high quantum of cases and positivity over 2.5 per cent. The district had a high quantum of cases in the week ending October 31,” the officer highlighted.As far as Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, Ahuja stated that the union territory has shown an approximately 61 per cent increase in weekly new cases—1,354 the week of October 25-31 as against 843 cases in the week of October 18-24.Although the weekly positivity is less than one per cent, there has been a 67 per cent increase in positivity since the last two weeks—from 0.3 per cent in the week of October 18-24 to 0.5 per cent in the week of October 25-31.Ahuja said the UT has also witnessed a decline in tests conducted and underlined that because of the rising positivity, it needed to conduct enhanced testing.“One district of the state—Kathua—has been identified as a district of concern due to high quantum of cases and positivity over 2.5 per cent. The district had a high quantum of cases in the week ending October 31.”“Kathua has reported a positivity rate of more than five per cent in the week ending October 31 i.e., 8.13 per cent along with an increasing trend in the weekly positivity rate over a period of last three weeks,” the letter stated.“It has been observed that Covid-19 cases surge exponentially where basic public health strategy (Testing, Tracking, Treatment, Covid appropriate behaviour and Vaccination) is not followed rigorously,” Ahuja wrote.The officer also stressed on proper implementation of containment zones, increased focus on house-to-house search for active cases within these zones, strict and daily monitoring of cases under home isolation and their referral to hospitals, and strengthening contact-tracing of positive people and review of containment zones.Besides, there should be a detailed district-wise and facility-wise analysis of deaths including a review of fatalities that happen within 24 and 72 hours of hospitalisation to resolve problems related to late hospital admission and the need for monitoring treatment practices, the letter stated.It also underlined the importance of strict adherence to National Treatment Protocols, augmenting ICU, oxygen beds and ventilator capacity, and ramping up testing figures, while maintaining the share of RT-PCR tests, besides aiming for 100 per cent first vaccine dose coverage of the eligible population and increasing the pace of the second dose.As far as super spreader events and places are concerned, there should be strict surveillance and monitoring as per SOPs of the ministry and testing as per ICMR guidelines, besides, ensuring Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, the letter added.It emphasised on routine submission of RT-PCR positive samples from international travellers as well as those from the community for genomic analysis at the designated INSACDG network laboratory as per laid down protocols. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/centre-asks-himachal-andhra-pradesh-j-k-to-review-rise-in-covid-cases-positivity-rates-enhance-testing-333854

However, within three years, these have vanished from public places and today, there were no dustbins anywhere.The panchayat pradhans of Palampur, Sulah and Jaisinghpur say that the bins were given to them by MLAs and MPs for installation at public places.“But due to official bottlenecks, no responsibility of the panchayats or Block Development Officers (BDOs) was fixed for their upkeep and maintenance. Besides, there was no provision to empty these bins. Therefore, these turned into a health hazard. Since these were directly given by the MLAs and the MPs to panchayats, no entry was made in the stock registers of panchayats,” a pradhan says.Later, in the absence of proper upkeep, 90 per cent bins, along with their steel platforms, were stolen. The MLAs were aware of the problem, but no steps were taken to safeguard them. The matter was not even reported to the police, they say.Three BDOs of the region say that they had no role in the distribution or installation of these bins and there were no guidelines from the state government for their maintenance, repair or protection.The bins were the properties of the panchayats and they should have maintained it, they add.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/1-000-dustbins-installed-in-palampur-villages-missing-333668

Other senior leaders like Purshottam Guleria, who is in-charge of Shimla Lok Sabha, state general secretary Trilok Jamwal and Panchayati Raj Minister Virender Kanwar could do little to improve the chances of Rattan Pal.Even tactics like alluring panchayat pradhans to join the BJP days before the polls failed to garner their support as they could do little to improve the prospects of Rattan Pal.Facing opposition from within the party, Pal performed dismally as he did not secure a lead even in a single round out of the total 26 rounds. During the poll campaign, the BJP highlighted insignificant issues like presence of empty chairs in the Congress poll rallies. Its leaders failed to address issues like annoyance against Pal in the party cadres which cost it dear.The Congress, on the other hand, carried on a systematic campaign where its leaders preferred to maintain contact with the masses. Former Congress Committee president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu campaigned effectively in the last few days and helped to muster the support of the voters in several key areas.While a visible aggression and confidence was seen in the Congress campaign, the BJP’s campaign was marred by undercutting and lack of confidence though its leaders tried their best to win the favour of the voters.Rattan Pal failed to impress the voters due to his poor oratory skills. He was no match for Sanjay Awasthy who not only attacked the government for its failures but humbly sough a chance to represent them in the Assembly. Pal faced oppn from within partyFacing opposition from within the party, Pal performed dismally as he did not secure a lead even in a single round out of the total 26 rounds.

Congress candidate Bhawani Singh Pathania defeated his nearest rival Baldev Thakur of the BJP by a margin of 5,789 votes.Independent candidate and former BJP MP and five-time party MLA, Rajan Sushant dealt severe blow to prospects of ruling party in byelections as he got 12,927 votes.The winning Congress candidate got 24,449 votes whereas the BJP candidate managed 18,660 votes.Congress campaign in-charge for Fatehpur byelections Rajinder Rana said that the people of state and Fatehpur have given a clear mandate against price rise. The people have punished the BJP for causing unprecedented price rise in the country in petrol, diesel, LPG and edible oils. The overall increase in prices have severely hit the poor and middle class.Minister for Forest, Sports and Youth Affairs, Rakesh Pathania, when contacted, said the price rise was a major issue during the by-elections. “People were angry at price rise though we tried to explain to them the reasons for it”.When asked if infighting in the BJP was a reason for defeat of party, Pathania said that infighting in party was not a major issue. “Though defeat in by-elections was a setback, we would bounce back in 2022 Assembly elections,” said Rakesh.Viplove Thakur, senior Congress leader, said that the BJP government in the state paid the price for ignoring Kangra district in the last four years. Besides the price rise and issues of farmers of border areas, who failed to sell their paddy, led to defeat of the BJP. The result was a referendum on working on BJP government in the state.The BJP got lead in initial 10 rounds of counting. The areas in which BJP got initial lead of about 1,300 votes were the stronghold of the party. There areas were merged in Fatehpur Assembly constituency from Nurpur constituency in the last delimitation exercise. Thereafter, the Congress candidate got comfortable lead in all remaining 15 rounds of counting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/congs-bhawani-singh-pathania-secures-easy-win-in-fatehpur-333661

The stance adopted by the BJP’s central leadership against dynastic politics, denying ticket to Chetan at the last minute left the party high and dry.Congress candidate Rohit Thakur, a two-time legislator and grandson of former Chief Minister Ram Lal Thakur, won by 6,293 votes despite Chetan evoking major sympathy for having been denied the ticket within a fortnight of his father’s demise.Even though it appeared imminent that the Congress would benefit from the presence of a BJP rebel the performance of the saffron party was even below expectations. With Chetan having made a major dent into the BJP vote bank, Saraik, a three-time Zila Parishad member on whom the choice fell once the BJP took a principled decision against “dynastic politics”, polled only 2,644 votes.With the contest right from day one being between the Congress and the Independent, the Congress managed well to counter the twin sympathy factor for Chetan, who lost his father and was denied the ticket, by raking up the sentiment of BJP being anti-apple growers.With several issues concerning apple growers remaining unresolved, the growers gave vent to their ire by supporting Rohit. Adverse remarks by Horticulture Minister Mahender Singh on apple marketing were also amplified by the Congress during its campaign.Factors like poor governance and anti-incumbency with barely one year left for the 2022 polls too seemed to have swayed the votes in favour of Congress. Rohit records impressive win||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/apple-lobby-spoils-bjp-chances-in-jubbal-kotkhai-333659

Independent Jeet Ram polled 547 votes while 1,626 votes were polled for NOTA, which was 2.69 per cent of the votes polled.Awasthy secured the lead right from the first round and it continued till the 26th round while Rattan Pal failed to put up an impressive fight.Awasthy began on a winning note and secured a lead of 735 in the first round and it increased consistently to 943, 1,364,1,942 and 2,239 in the second, third, fourth and fifth rounds.His lead registered an upwards trend till the eleventh round and saw a marginal decline in the 13th, 14th and 15th rounds, but again gained in subsequent rounds till 18th round. Though his lead declined in the last eight rounds, it failed to impact his winning spree as he had consolidated his votes in the earlier rounds.The BJP’s defeat has come as a major embarrassment to its senior leaders, who had begun their campaign before the Congress had put its house in order.Awasthy had been assiduously working amid the masses since a decade and had managed to garner the support of a large section of the youth and elders. He is the lone candidate, hailing from a non-political background, who has won the byelection. He had lost the 2012 poll by a narrow margin of 2,075 votes, but consistently worked hard.Since the electoral fight saw a direct battle between the BJP and the Congress, the polarisation on the basis of Rajput and Brahmin votes was also registered. While the rebellion by Congress failed to have any impact, undercutting by BJP rebels proved dear to the party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/arki-goes-congress-way-sanjay-awasthy-gets-50-pc-votes-333656

This amply reflects their disillusionment with all political parties. There were 12,626 NOTA votes out of a total 7,30,145 valid votes polled in Mandi parliamentary bypoll.The fairly huge number of NOTA votes is also an indication that people are looking for some other political option and it is here that the AAP could find fertile ground in the next Assembly elections in 2022.Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur while stating that the victory margin of 7,490 in Mandi was very thin and not worth a celebration, also admitted that had NOTA votes been cast differently, the results could have changed.

The BJP was confident of winning the seat but the result came much below the expectations of the party. Mandi is the home district of Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur.In a total of 17 Assembly segments falling under the Mandi parliamentary constituency, the BJP has 13 MLAs, Congress three and one is Independent. Hence, the hopes of the Chief Minister were high from the constituency and he expected the BJP MLAs to provide a substantial lead of votes to the BJP candidate.Data accessed by The Tribune revealed that the BJP failed to get good lead even from its strongholds like Nachan, Sundernagar, Sarkaghat, Banjar and Manali.The firebrand leader of the party, Jal Shakti Minister Mahender Singh Thakur district could not prove his political mettle. He had campaigned extensively in the constituency. Similarly, two other BJP ministers failed to galvanise voters in the party’s favour. Education Minister Govind Singh Thakur could not provide lead from his home constituency Manali.However, Congress candidate Pratibha Singh proved her dominance in the Congress strongholds like Rampur, Kinnaur, Anni, Kullu, Lahaul-Spiti and Bharmour, where she got a considerable lead.Fares poorly in strongholdCong exploited price riseCong made price rise a big issue but we cannot overlook the fact that it is not a state-specific issue, but a global phenomenon.

In Mandi, former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh’s wife Pratibha Singh, who had also represented the seat in 2004 and 2013, defeated BJP’s Brigadier Khushal Thakur (retd), a Kargil war hero, in a keenly contested election.Bypoll results: 3 LS, 29 Assembly seatsBJP+ 14; Cong 8; Trinamool 4; YSR Cong 1, INLD 1; others 4Lok Sabha: Mandi Cong | Dadra and Nagar Haveli Shiv Sena | Khandwa (Madhya Pradesh) BJPAssembly: Assam (5) BJP 3, ally UPPL 2 | WB (4) TMC 4 | HP (3) Cong 3 | MP (3) BJP 2, Cong 1 | Meghalaya (3) NPP 2, UDP 1 | Bihar (2) JD(U) 2 | Karnataka (2) BJP 1, Cong 1 | Rajasthan (2) Cong 2 | Maharashtra (1) Cong 1 | Telangana (1) BJP 1 | Andhra (1) YSRCP 1 | Mizoram (1) Mizo National Front 1 | Haryana (1) INLD 1Pratibha polled 3,69,565 votes (49.14 per cent) while Khushal got 3,62,075 (48.14 per cent). The victory margin of 7,490 was lesser than 12,626 votes that went to NOTA. In 2019, BJP’s Ram Swaroop Sharma, whose demise in February necessitated the bypoll, had won the seat by a record margin of 3.98 lakh votes. The Congress secured lead in nine of the 17 Assembly segments (part of Mandi Lok Sabha seat), including Manali, Banjar, Anni, Kullu, Bharmour, Kinnaur, Lahaul & Spiti and Nachan. The highest lead of 19,253 votes was from Rampur, Pratibha’s native place.The poll debacle is being seen as a setback for CM Jai Ram Thakur, whose constituency Seraj too is part of the Mandi parliamentary segment. The BJP got the highest lead of 19,903 votes from Seraj. The drubbing in all the four seats could make the going tough for CM Thakur as his detractors could raise the demand for change in leadership.Viewed as semifinals ahead of the Assembly elections next year, the Congress won despite facing a crunch of resources. Poll analysts claimed price rise and unemployment tilted the scales in favour of the Congress, though the sympathy factor too worked in favour of Pratibha, whose husband and six-time CM Virbhadra Singh had passed away on July 8.They said infighting and rebel factor too damaged the BJP’s prospects, especially in Jubbal-Kotkhai (Shimla district) where Chetan Bragta (23,662 votes), son of former minister Narinder Bragta, contested as an Independent and relegated BJP nominee Neelam Seraik (2,644 votes), who lost her deposit, to the third position. Rohit Thakur (29,955 votes), grandson of former CM Ram Lal Thakur, of the Congress won by a margin of 6,293 votes.In Fatehpur (Kangra), Bhawani Pathania (24,449) defeated BJP’s Baldev Thakur (18,660). In Arki (Solan), Sanjay Awasthy (30,798) of the Congress defeated his BJP rival Rattan Pal (27,579) by 3,219 votes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/shock-defeat-for-bjp-in-himachal-pradesh-congress-wins-all-four-seats-inld-retains-ellenabad-333536

Speaking to the media, he said the BJP would analyse the reasons for the 0-4 defeat so that it was better geared for the Assembly polls next year.Will IntrospectWill ponder over the results.
