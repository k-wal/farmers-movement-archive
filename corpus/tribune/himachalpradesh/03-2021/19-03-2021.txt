The BRO has already started the restoration work on several points to restore the Manali-Leh highway for traffic but because of the Atal Tunnel no restoration work has begun for the Rohtang Pass.The 38 Border Road Task Force (BRTF) Commander Colonel Uma Shankar said that now the Lahaul valley is connected with the country throughout the year after the opening of the Atal Tunnel.He said that at present the BRO has put all its strength in restoring the strategically important Manali-Leh road. He added that if the weather remains favourable than the Manali-Leh highway will be restored in a record time by mid-April or even earlier.The snow removal work for Rohtang Pass will be started after restoration of the Manali-Leh highway.The beneficiaries associated with the tourism industry said that the Rohtang Pass was a major attraction among the tourists. It is the backbone of the tourism industry in Manali. They apprehend that the tourists will not be able to enjoy the snow at the Rohtang Pass if it is restored late. At present, the vehicles were being allowed till Gulaba but there was no snow there due to scanty snowfall this winter season. They have demanded that the road restoration work be started for the Rohtang Pass so that it does not lose its charm.Gupt Ram, president, Him Anchal Taxi Operators Union, Manali, said that snow clearance work on the Manali-Rohtang road should be started soon and it should be opened as tourists will not be able to enjoy the snow if the Rohtang Pass is restored late. Non-restoration of the Pass or its delayed opening will have an adverse impact upon the tourism industry.He demanded that the tourism department should preserve the existing tourist attractions along the route and develop more tourism spots to boost the economy of the region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/tourists-wait-to-visit-rohtang-gets-longer-227131

The inquiry revealed that the company had started commercial production from May 19, 2005, from Sandholi village in Baddi. In 2007, they decided to expand their production by creating a unit for ‘5 Star’ and ‘Gems’ as Unit-II on land acquired from M/s Barmalt in Baddi to avail tax exemptions for additional 10 years.According to the FIR, the company decided to expand the production capacity in its existing unit rather than setting up a separate unit and availed exemption from May 19, 2005, which was the date of commercial production of its first unit. The company applied for amalgamation of its two units before the director of industries on January 22, 2007 and this merger was permitted on March 7, 2008.They, however, informed the assistant commissioner of Central Excise, Shimla Division, that their new factory had commenced commercial production and they would avail Excise Duty exemption from June 29, 2009.The company’s unit-II did not fulfil the laid conditions for availing area-specific tax exemptions. In order to avail the exemption, the factory should have been incorporated before the cut-off date of March 31, 2010, but it had applied for a factory licence on March 29, 2010 and it was issued on July 28, 2010.The factory officials connived with the officials of central excise to prove that unit-II was eligible for tax exemptions where various rules were also flouted.The matter was also investigated by the Director General of Central Excise Intelligence who rejected the factory’s claim and imposed a penalty of Rs 241 crore for wrongful claim of excise benefits.Those booked by the CBI include the then superintendent, Central Excise (CE), Baddi, Nirmal Singh, the then inspector CE, Jaspreet Kaur, Manager, Human Resource (HR) Bhawna Dogra, the then assistant manager (HR) Subhash Sharma, Finance Manager Varun Ramanan, the then Factory Manager Sanjay Karup, the then Vice-President (Finance and Compliance) Vikram Arora, the then Director (Finance) Rajesh Garg, the then Director (supply chain) Jaiboy Phillips, two consultants Sumit Sharma and Deepak Chandel as well as the company.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/fir-against-cadburys-baddi-unit-officials-others-for-fraud-227132

However, the Bill was passed in his absence as he was away to Jogindernagar to attend the cremation of Mandi MP Ram Swaroop Sharma.In his absence, Urban Development and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Bhardwaj tried to reason out by stating that this amendment was just a one-time arrangement. However a dissatisfied Opposition including both Congress and the CPM staged a walk out in protest against the passing of the Bill.“We have been compelled to make this amendment as the previous Congress regime (2012-17) violated the loan limit and in 2019-20 the collection from GST has been low on account of Covid pandemic,” stated Bhardwaj. He assured the house that the passing of the Bill will not raise the loan limit from the present three per cent to five per cent.“Our government has brought about this Bill to cover up for the FRBM violation by the previous Congress regime which did not take any effort to correct their mistake of violating the loan limit,” said an agitated Bhardwaj. He shot back at the BJP by stating that even in the neighbouring state of Punjab, where Congress is in power, an amendment has been made to the FRBM Act to enhance the loan raising limit for the year 2019-20.The CPM legislator Rakesh Singha, in his stiff opposition to the Bill, said if there had been a drop in the GST collections due to Covid the Centre should come to the rescue of the state. “Raising loans is just not the solution as this will put the state under huge debt trap and loan liabilities, which the government will try to pass on to the public by imposing taxes,” he said.CLP leader Mukesh Agnihotri said the Congress cannot be party to a decision which will push the state towards a total state of bankruptcy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/opposition-walks-out-over-fiscal-mgmt-bill-227141

The sample of a dead crow found in Theog, around 30 km from here, has tested positive for the H5N8 strain of bird flu.“Two samples were sent for testing on March 10. One has tested positive,” said Dr Sunil Chauhan, Deputy Director, Animal Husbandry Department. “It’s the first case of bird flu in Shimla district,” he said.Dr Chauhan, however, said there was no need for any alarm as it appears to be a sporadic case. “We had sent the sample for testing on March 10. Now, more than a week has elapsed since the death of this bird. But there has been no report of any other death of a wild bird or poultry,” said Dr Chauhan.“Had the disease spread, many more birds would have died by now. It’s appears to be a sporadic case. It is very difficult to understand because the bird flu scare is over in the entire country,” he said.Nevertheless, the area has been put under surveillance to keep an eye on both wild birds and poultry. “More sampling will be done in case more deaths of birds are reported from the region. We are on alert,” he said.The department has turned its attention towards poultry, too, because poultry, if infected, poses greater danger to humans than wild birds. “We have activated our teams to keep an eye on poultry in the area,” he said.Dr Chauhan is quite hopeful that poultry has not contracted the infection. “Thankfully, at this time, the number of poultry in this area is very low, maybe just in 100s. We distribute poultry in April and May and it gets consumed in winters,” he said.Incidentally, random reports of dead crows have been coming in from Theog’s surrounding areas, especially from Bhaj panchayat, for some time. These crows were buried without testing because as per the standard procedure, testing is done only when more than five birds are found dead together at one place.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/crows-sample-ve-for-bird-flu-in-theog-227143
