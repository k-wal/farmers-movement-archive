Many areas are getting water for just about an hour a day. In the Ramnagar area, people are not getting enough water for use in washrooms. If the situation continues, how will the IPH Department provide water in the summers? It's a sorry state of affairs that despite being declared as a Smart City, residents are not getting enough water for their daily needs. — Suresh Kumar, DharamsalaWHAT OUR READERS SAYIs a civic issue bothering you?Are you agitated over the lack of concern?

Known by the name of “Thakurdwara Bathu”, the temple remains submerged in the Pong reservoir for over eight months in a year.The temple is estimated to have been built in 8 AD by the Hindu Shahi dynasty. The complex consists of a central Shiva shrine and over 15 smaller ones.Since the land on which these temples are built falls under the Pong dam reservoir, the government had awarded a compensation for building a new shrine at Bainan Attarian, where idols were shifted after the construction of the dam. However, the temple structure was never relocated. The ancient structure has been abandoned both by the state government and those managing the shrine.Needs relocationMalvika Pathania, state president of INTACH, said there was an urgent need to relocate the ancient temple to a safer location and appoint a new caretaker under the “Own a heritage” initiative of the Central Government.“The ancient temple is slowly crumbling to pieces due to the government’s apathy and neglect. There is no agency to oversee its protection and corporates are eying the structure,” she alleged.Malvika said that these days the crumbling temple structure was being used for the shooting of music and commercial videos. “People often climb atop the weakened structures, leading to further damage,” she said.Malvika added that she had written to the Deputy Commissioner, Kangra, to issue orders banning the shooting of commercial videos on the temple complex.“I have urged the government to declare the Bathu ki Ladi temples as a protected heritage site. INTACH would also submit a project to the government for its restoration,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/1-200-yr-old-temple-a-victim-of-govt-apathy-229030

23-03-2021||Rajiv Mahajan||‘Low-cost’ housing technique developed by Dhameta man||Nurpur, March 22Shubham Sohal, an entrepreneur of Dhameta in Fatehpur of Kangra district, claims to have developed a technology for the construction of low-cost houses. He was working as an interior designer in Hyderabad but came back to his native place during the lockdown. He then did some research in low-cost housing construction.He said as per his technology, Glass Fiber Reinforced Gypsum (GFRG) interlocking panels and rice husk bricks are used in the construction with a roof made of prefabricated galvanised iron sheets. These bricks are eco-friendly and more cost-effective than red clay bricks. Gypsum is a waste byproduct of the fertiliser industry. “A house with 200 square feet area of one room and with 300 square feet area of two rooms can be built by spending Rs 2 and 3 lakh. The GFRG panels are 65 per cent cheaper than red bricks. Apart from this, 90-per cent saving of cement and 35-per cent saving of labour cost can be achieved,” he claimed. He said buildings of up to eight to 10 storeys could be designed using the load-bearing system, without the need for beams and columns which would ultimately reduce the use of cement, sand, steel and water.Enquiries made by The Tribune reveal that under the PM Awas Yojna and the CM Awas Yojna, a houseless beneficiary gets Rs 1.30 lakh as an aid for the construction of a house. It is not possible to build even a single-room house with this assistance and usually a beneficiary after spending this amount on construction leaves the work midway for want of money.Sohal said he was interested in carrying out his research work of low cost housing in collaboration with the government so that existing house construction cost could further be reduced keeping in view the interest and demand of the beneficiaries of the Awas Yojnas. He said if low-cost housing technology was promoted by the government, the poor beneficiaries could get their houses ready with the available funds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/low-cost-housing-technique-developed-by-dhameta-man-229038
