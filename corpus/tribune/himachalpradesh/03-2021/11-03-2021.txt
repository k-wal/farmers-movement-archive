11-03-2021||Abhinav VashishtKULLU||Rohtang ropeway construction work to commence from April||The government has given clearance for setting up a seven-km long ropeway from Kothi near Manali to Rohtang Pass.Amitabh Sharma, Managing Director (MD), Manali Ropeways Pvt Ltd, executing the Rohtang ropeway project said that construction work will commence from April 1. He said the budget of the project was approximately Rs 540 crore.To be completed in four yearsThe MD said that the project would be completed within four years in three phases. The ropeway from Kothi to Gulaba will be 1.2-km long, the stretch from Gulaba to Marhi will be 2.8-km long, while the third phase from Marhi to Rohtang will be 3.1-km long. He said there would be four stations at Kothi, Gulaba, Marhi and Rohtang.He said that the 7.1-km long ride will take 35 minutes (approximately) to cover the distance from from Kothi to Rohtang. He said that around 1,300 trees were falling in the periphery of the project and the government has given approval to axe 550 of them.The tourists will be able to visit the 13,058-feet high Rohtang Pass, a world famous tourist destination, throughout the year after the completion of the ropeway. The Rohtang Pass remains covered with snow for over seven months from November to June.Tourists enjoy different adventure activities at the snow-laden Pass. Local residents earn their livelihood by organizing various tourist-related activities there. The tourists also throng Gulaba, Marhi and Rohtang Pass to capture a glimpse of snow.It takes around two hours by car to cover the 50-km distance from Manali to Rohtang. The tourists have to face hassles while travelling due to frequent traffic jams during the peak tourist season in summer.As the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had capped the number of vehicles visiting Rohtang Pass to 1,200 per day for tourism purposes a large number of tourists visiting Manali were deprived of an opportunity to venture further to the scenic Rohtang Pass. After the completion of the ropeway, the visitors to Manali will be able to visit the Rohtang throughout the year.The masses associated with the tourism industry said that construction of the Rohtang ropeway will give boost to tourism business throughout the year.

It was a good proposal and the Municipal Corporation approved it,” said MC Commissioner Ashish Kohli.The ICLEI, an NGO supported by the Mayors of various cities across the globe, was formed in early 1990s with an objective to make interventions in matters related to climate change and sustainable development in urban areas.“The project has two parts — calculating carbon emission by freight vehicles carrying goods in the city, and formulating a plan for the smooth transport of goods,” said Vandana Thakur, Project Officer.“We are almost done with our primary surveys in which we spoke to various stakeholders in the urban freight sectors such as wholesalers, retailers, porters, drivers of the freight vehicles, etc. We will have our reports by the end of this month, and then we will move onto the next stage,” he added.The action plan, the Project Officer said, would focus on making the movement of the freight vehicles and the transport of goods as smooth as possible. “We will make suggestions on making the movement smoother, upgrading infrastructure, and exploring options such as introducing e-vehicles for less carbon emissions and sustainable development,” said Vandana.In India, besides Shimla, the survey is happening in Panjim and Kochi, too. “Being a hilly city, Shimla presents unique challenges as far as this project is concerned. Unlike the two other cities, the freight movement here is through road alone. So, here the survey becomes even more important,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/survey-underway-in-shimla-to-reduce-carbon-emission-223551

As a result, farmers and orchardists were not getting remunerative prices for their produce,” said Morcha’s convener Harish Chauhan.“Besides, the assistance given to farmers in the form of subsidies on seeds, pesticides and equipment was being reduced. All this has posed a serious problem to people earning their livelihood through agriculture and horticulture.”The Morcha decided to hold protests in support of its demands on March 15 on block and sub-division level and sent a memorandum to the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/growers-seek-special-status-for-apple-223552

11-03-2021||Shimla||Marketing board mulls flower mandi||Himachal could soon have a flower mandi of its own. Flower growers raised a demand for a local mandi in their recent meeting with the State Agricultural Marketing Board, and the latter sees a lot of merit and potential in their appeal. “It’s a very genuine demand and if all goes well, we could start our own flower markets in Parwanoo and Una,” said state Agricultural Marketing Board managing director (MD) Naresh Thakur. “We will shortly have a meeting with the buyers to check if they would be willing to set up shops within the state,” he said.Currently, flower growers from across the state have to transport and sell their produce at the famous Gazipur Flower Mandi in Delhi. Flowers are sent in buses and vehicles transporting vegetables as arranging separate vehicles is not cost-effective. Due to the lack of proper transport facilities, a significant part of the produce gets wasted before reaching the mandi. “Also, as the mandi is far away, growers cannot accompany their produce every time. As a result, there is no transparency in prices we get. If we have our own mandis, all these issues will be addressed,” said Ram Gopal, a flower grower from Jubbarhatti near Shimla. “Also, exotic vegetables like broccoli, red and yellow capsicums, etc, should also be sold in these mandis.”What gives the Marketing Board MD the confidence to establish a viable local flower market is the fact that the state is the largest producer of varieties likes carnation, lilium, marigold etc and the quality, too, is top-notch.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/marketing-board-mulls-flower-mandi-223555

11-03-2021||Shimla||Dhawala embarrasses own govt in Assembly||Ruling BJP faced heat from its own party legislator Ramesh Dhawala as he expressed displeasure at the disinterest being taken by the bureaucracy in implementing government schemes.Participating in the debate on the budget proposals for the year 2021-22 in the Vidhan Sabha today, the Jwalamukhi MLA demanded that the bureaucracy should be made accountable. “There is an urgent need to downsize the bureaucracy and cut down on wasteful expenditure, considering the grim financial health of the state,” he remarked.Too many officers, not enough staffHe went to the extent of stating that though no corruption cases have been reported during this regime so far he will not hesitate to expose if any such case takes places.Dhawala, who has in the past, expressed his resentment on being ignored in the organisational matters in his constituency suggested that the government had become top heavy with too many officers at the top while there wasn’t enough staff at the lower rung to render services. Citing, the example of Himachal Roadways Transport Corporation, he said there were 100 general managers but not enough conductors in buses.“I will not take pension for my wife as I feel that the new announcement by the Chief Minister of giving Rs 1,000 social security pension to women between 65 and 69 years should have been confined to only to poor women,” he stated while putting a question mark on his own government’s scheme.The bureaucracy seemed to be the prime target today as Harshwardhan Chauhan also questioned the efficiency of the bureaucracy. “There is need to bring about a change in the mindset of the bureaucracy which seems to be very negative in its approach,” he stated.He also suggested to cut down wasteful expenditure being made on purchase of vehicles. Chauhan also demanded that the government must fix minimum wages so that the exploitation of workers in the private sector could be ended.Participating in the debate, Ram Lal Thakur expressed concern over felling of green khair trees all over the state. “How can we expect the youth from the state to excel as good sportsperson when a large number of posts of coaches are lying vacant,” he said.Vikramaditya Singh said very shortly there will be a repeat of the Uttarakhand political storm even in Himachal. “The government has not acceded to the demand of the government employees and it is a record that a government which faces the wrath of employees is bound to lose,” he said. He said the government must make announcements keeping in mind its financial situation.Narender Thakur and Subhash Thakur also participated in the debate and lauded the schemes in the budget.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/dhawala-embarrasses-own-govt-in-assembly-223565
