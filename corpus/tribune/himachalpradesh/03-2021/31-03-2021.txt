These people have been protesting, demanding fair compensation of their lands being acquired by the NHAI. Kangra district Congress president and former local MLA Ajay Mahajan, after convening a meeting with party office-bearers and frontal organisation units, told mediapersons here today that the party would resort to ‘satyagraha’ with the affected families after the Municipal Corporation elections in support of their demand.He said the affected people, under the banner of Four Lane Sangarsh Samiti and Four Lane Lok Body, had been struggling for the past three years for justice and had met local MLA and Forest Minister Rakesh Pathania several times. He accused the minister of misleading the people, alleging that he had given them only hollow assurances. “The minister met the affected people a month ago and announced to quit the Cabinet if fair compensation was not accorded to them. He also assured good news within four days, but so far the government has made no announcement,” he said.The Congress leader alleged that in Mandi district, during the construction of the Nerchowk-Manali National Highway project, the affected people were given compensation many times more than the assessed circle rates by the local Competent Authority for Land Acquisition (CALA). “But in Nurpur, CALA has not only violated the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act-2013, but also finalised basic compensation awards by reducing 40 per cent of the circle rates announced by the Kangra Deputy Commissioner three years ago,” he alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/cong-backs-people-hit-by-pathankot-mandi-nh-4-laning-232277

He asserted that the government had in-principle agreed to reduce the width of the road in view of the larger public interest.Arbitrator appointedPathania said he had raised their demand of fair compensation for their lands with Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur, who also had taken a lenient view on the issue. “The government has also agreed in-principle on ‘One project one compensation rate’ and I will not compromise on it. I will contest my next election after addressing the issue,” he said.The minister said the government had deployed the Divisional Commissioner, Kangra, as an arbitrator, who would start functioning after April 7 and the fourlane affected people could file their appeals for fair compensation before him. Lashing out at the Congress leaders of the area for politicising the issue, Pathania said the NHAI had finalised the alignment of the Pathankot-Mandi fourlane project during the previous Virbhadra Singh regime. “Had then local MLA Ajay Mahajan intervened, people of Nurpur could have been saved from displacement,” he said. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/govt-to-reduce-road-width-says-rakesh-pathania-232296

The NGO alleged that the Beas and its tributaries were being polluted as the authorities concerned had turned a blind eye to the issue.Abhishek, president of the NGO, alleged that despite strict guidelines by the NGT and the Green Bench of the Himachal High Court (HC), untreated municipal solid waste (MSW) and sewage was being dumped directly into the Beas and its tributaries.He said waste from the municipal drains of Kullu and Bhuntar towns was being dumped into the Beas and its tributaries. He said the High Court in 2012 had directed that municipal authorities should make arrangements for proper disposal of garbage. It had directed municipal councils of Kullu and Manali and the nagar panchayat of Bhuntar to levy heavy penalty on those found dumping waste in public areas or polluting the environment.He alleged that while the door-to-door garbage collection scheme was implemented in the town areas of the district, the drains remained clogged in many places. He further alleged that waste material from municipal drains at Akhara Bazar, Sarwari and Lanka Baker region of the Kullu town was being dumped into the water body without treatment.He lamented that the authorities concerned were not putting in sincere efforts to protect the Beas from pollution. He said that he had raised the issue with Kullu DC, Principal Secretary Urban Development and the Chief Minister many times but no steps had been taken to implement the court orders and to protect the Beas. He added that no challan had been issued in the past three years for dumping garbage on the banks of river and its tributaries.He said even contractors of the National Highways Authority of India had dumped the debris directly into the Beas. The government should take steps to conserve the rivers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/untreated-waste-polluting-beas-river-its-tributaries-232320

Thakur was here to campaign for the BJP candidates in the Dharamsala Municipal Corporation elections.The District Magistrate, in his orders issued on March 26, said, “All social, cultural, entertainment, religious, political and other congregations in the Dharamsala MC and Palampur in Kangra district are prohibited. Though gatherings in marriages, funerals and during the election process are allowed, these are subject to strict adherence to the conditions mentioned in the orders of March 22, restricting the maximum limit for a gathering to 50 persons”.Hundreds of BJP workers participated in programmes here. Asked why action was not being taken against the organisers of the functions of the Chief Minister for violating the orders, DC Rakesh Prajapati said the matter would be inquired into if a complaint was received.Swaroop Kumar, a local resident, said the number of Covid cases in the district had increased in the past about a week. “The administration has stopped almost every economic activity in the area. People are not being allowed to hold functions. The hotel and tourism industries are suffering due to the new restrictions imposed by the district administration. All this is being done in the name of controlling the pandemic. However, when it comes to implementing the rules on political leaders, the authorities turn a blind eye towards norm violations in political meetings and gatherings,” he added.Dr Rajesh Sharma, media convener of the Congress for the Dharamsala MC elections, alleged in a press note issued here that the Chief Minister and ministers were roaming among people and organising political meetings. If the government was not serious about implementing the SOPs for the pandemic, it should not harass common people also. He added that policemen were raiding shops and business establishments in the district and imposing fines on people but the ruling party politicians violating the rules were going scot-free, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/covid-norms-defied-at-cm-jai-ram-thakurs-events-in-dharamsala-232327
