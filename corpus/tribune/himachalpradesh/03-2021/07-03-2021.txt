Representatives of various political parties are also a part of the GST council, and if all are willing to bring the fuel prices under the purview of the GST, a decision can be taken in the council.”In response of the unsavoury Vidhan Sabha episode where Congress MLAs misbehaved with the Governor, Thakur said: “Their behaviour has besmirched the image of the state, as well as of the Congress, before the nation. The Congress is bereft of leadership and issues. They indulge in such unruly behaviour as they have been left with no issue to corner the BJP government. The Congress is unnerved by the developmental works being executed by the state government and the Centre.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/fuel-hike-issue-can-be-discussed-in-gst-council-if-states-willing-anurag-thakur-221954

He added it is a desperate attempt by the CM to present old wine in a new bottle to impress people of the state.The CLP leader accused the BJP regime of financial mismanagement, which, he alleged, had resulted in negative growth. “The CM is concealing the loan position and if he claims financial prudence has been exercised, he must give an assurance in House that no new loans will be raised,” he demanded.Former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh said it was a directionless budget which was completely silent on price rise and unemployment, with no efforts to pull the state out of the grim financial situation. “There is total dependence on central schemes and no steps are being taken for the revival of economy in view of the pandemic,” he said. He added that the people of the state were totally disappointed with the Budget.Former Congress president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu alleged that the CM had only tried to sell dreams to the people while failing to formulate a policy to tackle unemployment. “The Budget is silent on creating jobs for 12 lakh educated jobless youth,” he said.

The activists who gathered in the Depot Bazaar area this morning marched to Kachehri Bazaar carrying cutouts of LPG cylinders. Youth Congress state president Nigam Bhandari led the protest.  While addressing the activists, he alleged that the BJP government at the Centre and in Himachal had burdened people with unprecedented taxes. The prices of petrol and diesel are at their peak despite the fact that there is no rise in international prices of crude oil, he said. The BJP government has given a waiver to big corporates by reducing the corporate tax but is burdening the common man by levying taxes on petrol and diesel, he said. Meanwhile HPCC state president Kuldeep Rathore, who was also present in Dharamsala today, attacked Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur. He said the previous two CMs of the BJP were known for their work. Shanta Kumar is known for the work he had done to provide clean drinking water in rural areas and Prem Kumar Dhumal is known for the work he had done for constructing roads, he said. However, no development has taken place in the state in the tenure of the present CM, he alleged. Rathore said the Congress would win all Corporation elections and the party was united. The people of the state would punish the BJP government at the Centre and the state for the price rise, he said. While people are reeling under an economic crisis due to the pandemic, the government is levying taxes on the common man, he alleged. The high prices of petrol and diesel have hit prices of essential commodities and poor people were finding it difficult to make their both ends meet, Rathore said. Former minister Sudhir Sharma, who accompanied Rathore, said the Congress was united and would win the Corporation elections in Dharamsala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/youth-cong-protests-price-rise-221719
