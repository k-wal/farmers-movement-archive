They play differently when the ‘raj tilak’ is being done and once the ceremony is over, they play differently for the cremation, to mark the solemn occasion.Preparations are being made for the ‘raj tilak’ (coronation ceremony) at Padam Palace in Rampur to make 31-year-old Vikramaditya the titular head of the erstwhile princely state of Bushahr before Virbhadra’s cremation. The throne will get its new Raja, as per the traditions still being followed in most erstwhile princely states of India. It will be a symbolic ritual to take forward the family legacy.Virbhadra was appointed the titular head of the state in 1947 even though India had attained independence. He became the 122nd king of Bushahr at the age of 13 after the demise of his father Raja Padam Singh.Prior to shifting their base to Sarahan, the seat of the Bushahr estate was at Kamroo in the Sangla valley of Kinnaur where the ancient fort of the family still stands. Even now most of the religious ceremonies and rituals of the family are performed at the fort at Kamru.Virbhadra’s body was brought to his Padam Palace at Rampur this evening. Emotional scenes were witnessed as the entire town received their “Raja Sahib” with slogans like “Dekho-dekho kaun aya, sher aya - sher aya” and “Raja Sahib, amar rahe”.Meanwhile, people turned out in large numbers to get a last glimpse of their beloved leader and pay their respect for the one last time. People, including a large number of women, lined up along the road at Theog, Kumarsain, Narkanda and Luhri to offer floral tributes to the departed leader.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/vikramadityas-raj-tilak-before-rajas-cremation-281014

The associations contended that the high freight was rendering their business uneconomical.Though an agreement for the reduction of the freight was also reached in August 2019, the union withdrew it a year later. This formed the basis of filing the petition before the court.The court advised the district administration to resolve the issue. A breakthrough was finally achieved after a series of discussions held under the chairmanship of the Deputy Commissioner, Solan, on June 14.“It has been decided to adopt the per km per tonne regime for various industrial sectors to bring transparency in freight. An additional discount of 5 per cent on voluminous goods and another 5 per cent on industries manufacturing apple cartons transported to fruit growing areas has also been agreed upon,” said Harish Aggarwal, convener, Transport Committee, BBNIA.The proportionate freight on the enhanced load will be charged at 50 per cent instead of 100 per cent charged earlier. The fuel price rise since November 2020 will be factored in while arriving at the new rates.“It is for the first time that a destination-wise fuel price-linked rate list based on the diesel price of June 14, as prevalent in Baddi, will be put in public domain. The high court will monitor its implementation and all parties have agreed to implement it from July 9. We have appealed to the member industries to give the maximum business to the local truckers,” said Sanjay Khurana, president, BBNIA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bbn-truckers-industry-freight-issue-resolved-281017

It entails an expenditure of Rs26 lakh per month. — Rakesh Prajapati, DC, KangraBills worth Rs 10 lakh have been issued to the residents, which also include old bills, said an official. In the absence of adequate income, theMC authorities have no choice but to charge for garbage collection from the residents.Free garbage collection was a key promise of the Congress in the MC polls held in April. There are about 10,000 households in 17 wards, which were supposed to get this benefit. Only commercial establishments were supposed to be charged as per the promise. A household has to pay Rs 50 per month, while a commercial establishment is supposed to pay Rs 100 for door-to-door garbage collection.Bills have now been issued to the residents for this facility by the Solan MC authorities, much to their surprise. “As garbage collection is a massive job in 17 wards, as many as 160 persons are engaged in the job, apart from 78 regular employees of the corporation. It entails an expenditure of Rs 26 lakh per month, and includes door-to-door collection of wet garbage twice a week, and dry waste once a week. The waste is transported to a Salogra-based disposal facility, where it is segregated into biodegradable and non-biodegradable garbage in 11 vehicles.At least three trips are made to transport 20 tonnes of waste generated daily,” said MC Commissioner LR Verma.The degradable garbage is used for making compost and the non-degradable waste comprising plastics is sent to cement manufacturing units in Darlaghat for use as fuel. Transporting garbage to cement units involves additional expenditure.With improper treatment of garbage at the dumping site in Salogra, residents living in its vicinity are also up in arms against the risk caused to the environment. Karan Singh, a resident, said, “The legacy waste is being dug up using a bulldozer, exposing them to germs and viruses at a time when the pandemic is looming large. Residents are forced to breathe the horrible suffocating stench emanating from the site.”The problem has remained unresolved since the past several years.When asked to comment on the issue, Punam Grover, Mayor, Solan MC said: “We have not devised any plan as yet for free door-to-door collection of garbage for the households at Solan. As limited staff was available in view of the pandemic earlier, such an arrangement could not be worked out. But now that more staff was available we will devise a plan for proper disposal of garbage in the MC area soon.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/congress-free-waste-collection-promise-goes-for-a-toss-in-solan-281020

The villagers complained that even earlier, the construction of the bridge was going on at a snail’s pace for the past two years, but the contractor has now suspended the construction work completely.The proposed bridge would benefit the residents of over one dozen villages of Jaisinghpur constituency.A visit to the spot revealed that frame structure of the bridge had been laid but there was no headway on the construction of approaches to the bridge. The contractor has also withdrawn his machinery from the site.The villagers said the contractor had left the construction work half way and no work was going on for the past one month. They said in the absence of a bridge they had to cover a distance of 12 km to reach their villages via Andretta. If the bridge was made operational, the distance would reduce by 10 km.Their agricultural lands were situated beyond the bridge and they had to cross the Aswa river daily to reach their fields and the adjoining health centre. During the monsoon it was not possible to cross this river. The villagers had also approached the PWD officials, but in vain.The plan to construct this bridge was mooted in 2006, but in the absence of funds the project remained confined to files. After a hue and cry by the villagers, Jaisinghpur BJP MLA Ravinder Dhiman managed funds from the state government and the construction of the bridge was taken up.The MLA said the matter was already in his notice and he had directed the PWD to resume the construction work immediately and also impose a penalty on the erring contractor. He assured the villagers that the bridge would be completed in the next three months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/villagers-of-panchrukhi-tehsil-protest-as-bridge-construction-work-over-awa-river-suspended-281021

Several parts of the district have experienced rains below average, adversely affecting the paddy crop.In Malan, Nagrota Bagwan, Mehanja, Paror and Sulaha areas of Palampur, farmers are worried about the withering of the crop in the absence of sufficient irrigation. The water in local rivers, too, is not sufficient in the absence of rains and less snowfall this year. Rivers like the Neugal, Awa, Baner and Binwa, which are major sources of water for local irrigation channels of Palampur, Baijnath and Nagrota Bagwan, are dry this year.Sanjay Thakur, Executive Engineer, Jal Shakti Department, says the department was making all efforts to make all local irrigational channels functional. As these had become defunct many years ago water could not reach the tail-end fields.“The possibility of Kangra valley being affected by drought seems real as the region has not received adequate rainfall. Scientists working under the HP Agriculture University are worried that if the dry spell continues for one more week, the situation will worsen. They say climate changes are one of the major reasons for deficient rains in hills for the past five years. We will have to change the cropping pattern in the state to meet the present challenges being faced by farmers,” they asserted, while interacting with The Tribune.However, Agriculture Department officials say there is no immediate threat to the standing crops, except paddy. Agriculture experts expect better rainfall after July 15, which can save the crops from further damage.On the other hand, the paddy crop in some areas is said to have suffered up to 40 per cent damage. The crop is healthy only where it was transplanted early, and that too, in irrigated areas, while the situation is bad in rain-fed areas.Farmers of Nagrota Bagwan, Sulha, Baijnath, Palampur — which are considered the rice bowls of state — are worried over the prevailing dry weather conditions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/dry-spell-hits-paddy-crop-in-lower-areas-of-kangra-district-281024

Before its release on April 14, 2017, the film received the Best Feature Film Award at the Borrego Springs Film Festival held in California, USA, and was screened at many other festivals.Four years later, coming out with his second film, Googly Gumm Hai, the director says, “When I made Saanjh, the idea came through the song, Puchhe Amma Meri, which I had written and later developed into an entire script for the feature film. With it, I wanted to talk about how our culture is heading towards Saanjh (dusk).”Shot in the Lake Glacier, Dharamshala, with minimum usage of VFX, it has all the elements of a commercial film -a story, a romantic location, twist and turns of a thriller, and songs in the voice of none other than Mohit Chauhan. He adds, “I have received good reviews from the audience but didn’t get the time to promote the film. The platform Shemaroo Me suddenly picked it up for a release and we could only announce the trailer release a day before.”Clear takeBeing a Himachali, does he think that the state has opportunities for those who wish to pursue a career in film-making or acting? “While there is a lot more one can explore in film-making in Mumbai, for actors, there’s availability of small roles in movies that are being shot in Himachal. In any case, as described through my earlier film, youngsters are happy finding opportunities in bigger cities.

10-07-2021||Shimla||WFH seems to have become ‘work from Himachal', tourists must follow Covid rules: Police chief||Work from home, a factor of life in the Covid pandemic, seems to have become "work from Himachal Pradesh" with thousands of people pouring into the hill state to escape the confines of their homes and the heat, says Himachal Pradesh Director General of Police Sanjay Kundu.While the state's economy is seeing a welcome uptick, the crowds, not just in popular destinations like Shimla and Manali but also in lesser-known towns such as Naggar and Jibhi, are a cause of concern, he said, calling for Covid appropriate behaviour from tourists.The tourist surge has added another layer of responsibility for the police force, which has put up checkpoints at various entry and exit points into towns to ensure that Covid norms are being followed."With the prolonged work from home (WFH) culture being adopted by many companies and multinationals, we are seeing that it has almost turned out to be work from Himachal Pradesh," Kundu told PTI.It is good for the economy of the state, he said. “But at the same time, we have to remain vigilant that people are following guidelines including wearing of masks and maintaining social distance," he added."We are geared to welcome everyone into Himachal Pradesh, but please follow all the guidelines," the 1989 batch IPS officer said, concerned about the spread of Covid in the state.Since the pandemic last year – India went into lockdown in March last year and opened up gradually—law enforcement authorities have collected over Rs 5 crore in fines from tourists and others for violating COVID norms.As images of serpentine queues of cars waiting to enter Shimla and throngs of people in Manali make national headlines, Kundu said the Atal Tunnel at Rohtang Pass has been the most frequented tourist spot in this month with 47,000 vehicles passing through.The highest number was on July 4 when 7,384 vehicles passed through the tunnel to Lahul valley. The nine-kilometre tunnel was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October last year.After the need for a mandatory e-pass and an RTPCR test was waived by the government on June 14, about 18,500 vehicles per day have been entering the state, he said."Around Rs 40 lakh fine has been collected from visitors in the last two weeks for violating the norms set for preventing spread of pandemic in the state," he said.There have been some ugly scenes when tourists have misbehaved with police officers after being fined."We welcome everyone in Himachal Pradesh who follows the rules. The fines are more advisory in nature and it is for the people to adopt Covid appropriate behaviour for their own safety," Kundu added.Apart from known tourist spots like Manali, Kasauli, Shimla, Dalhousie and Dharamshala, people have booked homestays in lesser-known places such as Malana, Naggar, Narkanda, Jibhi, Bir Bling and Dharamkot, the police chief said."The state government has allowed people to open up for tourists and, therefore, many places have been registered under the home stay plan. So, people from other parts of the country have made bookings for months together and are working from there," he said.On Thursday, the state reported 128 fresh cases. There are 1,307 active cases with 3,486 deaths, according to Union Health Ministry figures on Friday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/wfh-seems-to-have-become-work-from-himachal-tourists-must-follow-covid-rules-police-chief-280562
