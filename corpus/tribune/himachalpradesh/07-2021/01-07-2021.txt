In the first phase, a maternal and child care centre will be constructed, followed by a trauma centre and a 200-bed hospital in the next two phases.Around 79 bighas of land on the Kather bypass was selected for the hospital after former Health and Family Welfare Minister Vipin Parmar inspected the site in August 2018. The process to transfer land by seeking NOCs from various departments had then begun and it took several months to be completed.Rs 10 crore approved for first phaseThe case was then sent to the Revenue Department, which raised some objections and the process was finally completed in August 2019.The construction of the new hospital has become necessary as the existing building of the Regional Hospital is facing a space crunch and is unable to handle the increasing patient influx from Solan and Sirmaur districts.The lack of space has also stalled the implementation of several important Central health programmes, including the setting up of an early intervention centre for the detection of deformities and deficiencies aimed at improving the survival rate, besides a maternal and child care centre for which funds had been received years ago.The much-needed trauma centre has also failed to come up due to the paucity of space in the hospital.Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr Rajan Uppal, says, “The new hospital will be constructed in three phases. A maternal and child care centre and a trauma centre will be constructed in the first two phases while a 200-bed hospital will be set up in the final phase.

Thakur said to promote natural farming in the state, the government was implementing the Prakritik Kheti Khushhal Kisan Yojana. He said that this would not only boost the yield of the crops but also reduce farming inputs. He said that Subhash Palekar Natural Farming was emerging as favourite for agricultural practices to reduce farmers’ direct cost while boosting the yield and farm health through the use of non-synthetic inputs sourced locally. He said 9.61 lakh farmers of the state were being encouraged to adopt natural farming so that Himachal could become a natural farming state of the country. As many as 1.28 lakh farmers have already been trained in natural farming and were motivating others to adopt the same. The CM said NITI Aayog had also appreciated the steps taken by the state government for promoting natural farming and added that during the first budget presented by the state government in 2018, a provision of Rs 25 crore had been made to promote natural farming.  The CM said the land holdings in the state were limited and most of the farmers fall under small and marginal categories. Natural farming not only gave a better yield but also fetched a good price to farmers. He said that the government was also endeavoring to evolve a mechanism for the certification of natural products so that they could fetch better prices. Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog, Dr Rajiv Kumar said that NITI Aayog would provide all possible help to the state to promote natural farming. Padamshri Subhash Palekar virtually detailed various benefits of natural farming over chemical and organic farming. —TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/efforts-on-to-make-himachal-natural-farming-state-276406
