The wildlife wing of the Forest Department has sought a detailed report on the road widening work. “We have sought a report and if there’s any violation, action will be taken as per the rules,” said Archana Sharma, Principal Chief Conservator of Forest.The sources allege that the JCB machine was used in the core area of the sanctuary. “The place is an internationally recognised Ramsar site and no activity that disturbs the fragile nature of the area should be carried out”.Hardev Negi, DFO (Wildlife), Kaza, said that a kucha road from Manali to Chandratal exists. “The PWD gets an annual budget for the maintenance of the road and the department repairs it every year,” he added.“The road had become inconvenient for light motor vehicles and commuters had been requesting us to widen it. So, the PWD removed these bottlenecks to facilitate people,” he said.Negi said that the road was widened to facilitate the movement of local people to the place by bus. “Taxis and other vehicles plying on the route charge a lot of money from locals,” he added. Those objecting to the widening of the road say that the ‘carrying capacity’ of the area will be adversely affected. “Around 50,000 people visit the area from June to September. Instead of restricting the flow of tourists into the area, they are allowing more people, posing a threat to its biodiversity,” the sources say. ‘JCB MACHINE USED IN WILDLIFE SANCTUARY’Sources in the Forest Department allege that the road was widened using a JCB machinery in violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002.

They had staged a protest march in front of Education Minister Govind Singh Thakur on Thursday.With the resumption of the online permit facility, tourists planning to visit the Rohtang Pass will be able to avail of the permit from any part of the country. This will directly affect the business of taxi operators in Kullu and Manali because, as per the National Green Tribunal order only 1,200 tourist vehicles per day are allowed to visit Rohtang.The Taxi Operators Union, Manali, has urged the state government to allow the Rohtang permit only offline. Puran Chand Thakur, president of the Him Aanchal Taxi Operators Union, says, “Due to the pandemic, the taxi operators of Manali as well as in other parts of the state are suffering. The pandemic has hit the tourism industry badly, directly affecting our livelihood”.“The Rohtang Pass is a famous tourist destination, which is visited by a large number of tourists every year during the summer. As a result, the demand for taxi service to the Rohtang Pass increases considerably.

The state has around 19 lakh registered vehicles, including nine lakh two-wheelers. As the prices of most of the electric vehicles are high, the government is keen to provide some subsidy or incentive but this may not be possible due to severe financial constraints it is facing.“There are several concessions such as road tax and permit exemption for all battery-operated e-vehicles. Based on the suggestions from various stakeholders, we will initially target the nine lakh two-wheeler segment, as this, too, will go a long way in reducing emission levels and make it low-cost running,” said Anupam Kashyap, Director, Transport.To begin with, it is being contemplated to have zero or low emission zones in Shimla, Baddi, Dharamsala where only electric vehicles, cycles and walking will be permitted. “The other step will be to prioritise tourist spots, eco-sensitive areas and reserved forests for electric vehicles so that people consider the option of having such vehicles, including taxis,” said Kashyap.It is being recommended that the urban development agencies in each city identify these zones along with the timings and regulations. During consultations for the drafting of the Electric Vehicle Policy, it was suggested that rather than having charging stations, which would require huge open spaces, charging points could be made available at wayside amenities such as hotels, restaurants and dhabas.Himachal is amongst the first states in the country to run battery-operated electric vehicles following the National Green Tribunal (NGT) rap over high vehicular emissions causing environmental damage in the ecologically-fragile Rohtang area and its glaciers. Some private individuals are running electric auto-rickshaws in border areas such as Baddi, Nalagarh and Paonta Sahib, as they are cost efficient with low running cost and practically require no maintenance.At present, the government is running 75 electric buses (50 in Shimla and 25 on the 50 km Manali-Rohtang route), as per the NGT directives. Besides, the Himachal Roadways Transport Corporation (HRTC) is operating 50 electric taxis in various urban centre in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-to-promote-e-vehicles-create-zero-emission-zones-277959

There is a complete ban on mining and quarrying in the state rivers, streams and specified zones, but illegal mining is going on as usual, and the mafia has fixed its own rates for the material.At present, most of the building material is being imported from Pathankot, Hoshiarpur, Damtal, Nurpur and Gurdaspur. As there is no mechanism at the government level to check the prices of building material being sold by local crushers or imported from Punjab, local residents are forced to pay exorbitant prices for sand, stone, grit and ‘’bajri’’. This has also adversely affected the housing industry in the region.A number of persons in Palampur, Bir, Baijnath, Nagrota Bagwan and Paprola, who are in the business of constructing residential houses or commercial buildings, say that earlier they got 300 cubic feet of sand for Rs 11,000 and now it is available for Rs 16,000. Similarly, 300 cubic feet of grit is available for Rs 17,000 while earlier it was available for Rs 10,000.As there is a complete ban on all mining activities in the state, the cost of one tractor-trailer load of boulders has also gone up to Rs 4,000 though it is still not easily available. Earlier, the same quantity was selling for Rs 1,400, they add.Though the BJP had in its manifesto promised to frame a new mining policy so that the rates of mined material come down, in the past three years, the prices of building materials had almost doubled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/building-material-prices-shoot-up-in-kangra-277953

Cumulative rain is less by 17 per cent in Himachal Pradesh, 12 per cent in Punjab, and 8 per cent in Haryana.According to data compiled by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the hill state of Himachal received 96.1 mm rain from June 1 to July 3 against the normal of 115.5 mm for this period.The agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana received  54.3 mm and 52.2 mm rain, respectively for the aforementioned period as compared to the normal of 62 mm and 56.5 mm for these two states.The monsoon, which had arrived over northwest India about 15 days ahead of its normal date of onset, was surplus by 14 per cent in the region during the month of June. IMD data shows that the region had received 85.7 mm rain against the normal of 75.3 mm last month.Though monsoon had made good progress in its early phase, it later weakened. It has covered most of the country except parts of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, and IMD expects it will continue to elude the region for a few days more, although some areas in north India experienced light rains and storms over the past 24 hours.This has been attributed to the impact mid-latitude westerly winds and the absence of formation of low-pressure system over North Bay of Bengal as well as an unfavourable Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), which is a major fluctuation in tropical weather due to an eastward-moving pulse of cloud and rainfall near the equator that typically recurs every 30 to 60 days.The IMD has said that spatial distribution suggests that below normal to normal rainfall is likely over many areas of northwest India during the month of July. Dry westerly and southwesterly winds from Pakistan to northwest India at lower levels can also bring in short spells of heatwave conditions over some parts of Haryana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/after-surplus-rains-in-early-stages-monsoon-over-punjab-haryana-himachal-slips-into-the-red-277740
