The students rue that the college fees is to be paid by us when we receive scholarship amount but unfortunately, the department of Education, HP Government, has not released the money due to which we have been subjected to financial hardships and stress. We have not been paid for scholarships for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 on the pretext that the payment of scholarships is under a CBI inquiry.

14-07-2021||Pratibha Chauhan||Mandi, Arki bypoll: Cong may leave it to Virbhadra’s wife||Tribune News ServiceShimla, July 13The Congress high command is likely to take a call on the selection of party candidates for the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency and the Arki Assembly seat, held by Virbhadra Singh, in consultation with his family members, once the final rituals are over on July 18-19.With bypoll to the Mandi Lok Sabha and three Assembly segments of Arki, Jubbal-Kotkhai and Fatehpur due in some time, both parties are weighing their options.Represented Mandi twiceSources said the Congress high command would first ask Virbhadra Singh’s wife Pratibha Singh if she would like to contest from Arki, the seat held by her husband till his death.The possibility of Pratibha or Vikramaditya contesting from Mandi seems bleak but the former CM’s wife could be keen to fight from Arki. Though Virbhadra belonged to Rampur, owing to his stature and political clout, he could win from anywhere in the state, something not easy for anyone, including his family members.However, with no tall leader, both in the Congress or the BJP, being there in Arki, Pratibha could ride high on the sympathy factor. Virbhadra had won the seat by 6,051 votes in the 2017 polls, which was much less than his margin of 19,033 from Shimla (Rural) in 2012.Virbhadra represented the Rohru seat five times (1990, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2007) Jubbal-Kotkhai twice (1983 and 1985) and Shimla Rural in 2012. He had shifted to Arki from Shimla (Rural) to accommodate his son Vikramaditya Singh, who was making his electoral debut.Since Pratibha had remained an MP from Mandi on two occasions in 2004 and 2013, the high command could consider her candidature provided she is willing to jump into the fray. Infact, in 2013, she had defeated Jai Ram Thakur from the Mandi parliamentary seat. Now, it remains to be seen whether she will be keen on contesting from Mandi as it will be an arduous task, considering that the CM’s reputation will be at stake as Mandi is his turf.Moreover, the BJP and the CM will leave no stone unturned to ensure that the BJP retains the Mandi seat which fell vacant after the death of its MP Ram Swaroop in March. Even BJP national chief JP Nadda will not want that the BJP loses even one of the four bypolls as Himachal is his home state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/mandi-arki-bypoll-cong-may-leave-it-to-virbhadras-wife-282924

14-07-2021||Chandigarh||Widespread rain in Punjab, Himachal may fill up to 90 pc of Bhakra and Pong dams||Delayed monsoons over the region and poor snow cover in the upper regions notwithstanding, major dams in the region that had almost bottomed out, are expected to fill up to about 90 per cent of their storage capacity.Widespread rain in many parts of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh over the past two days has come as a relief as it has improved the storage level at Bhakra and Pong dams, though the situation at the moment is still not comfortable.The unexpected cloudburst near Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh on Monday brought in about three lakh cusecs of water into the Pong Dam’s reservoir.“Till this flood event, the storage at Pong was down to just 5 per cent of its total capacity,” Sanjay Srivastava, Chairman, Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), said.Following the massive inflow, the storage at Pong, which lies on the Beas in Himachal, went up to 11 per cent.This is still below normal as the average storage at this time of the year is 24 per cent.At Bhakra, which lies on the Sutlej, the storage at present is 18 per cent as compared to the average of 34 per cent for this time of the year. It had gone down to 8 per cent during the summer.While Pong is primarily rain-fed, inflows into Bhakra are primarily dependent on snow-melt.Last year the monsoon, as well as winter rains and snow in the dams’ catchment areas, were deficient. Unusual rains and cloudy weather over the mountains during early summer had also reduced snow-melt.“Despite poor inflows and low storage during the summer, we were able to meet the water requirements of our member states for irrigation and drinking,” Srivastava said.“We were releasing up to 42,000 cusecs of water during the sowing season,” he added. BBMB had earlier cautioned states about the low water levels and advised them to draw water judiciously.Last year, the reservoir at Bhakra had filled up to 85 per cent of its total capacity, even though rains and snow had been below normal.This year, its monsoon goes as per the weather department’s forecast, BBMB officials expect the storage deficiency to cover up and the dam to fill up to 90 per cent of its capacity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/widespread-rain-in-punjab-himachal-may-fill-up-to-90-pc-of-bhakra-and-pong-dams-282576
