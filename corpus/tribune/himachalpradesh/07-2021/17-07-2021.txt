||Ponds transform lives of Sirmaur’s marginal farmers||Tribune News Service Solan, July 16 The creation of ponds in various villages of Rajgarh block in Sirmaur district has proved a boon to farmers as assured irrigation has led to a manifold increase in their farm income. An initiative was taken by Block Development Officer (BDO) Arvind Singh Guleria to create individual ponds for farmers to conserve water. “Besides the economic impact, the move was aimed at environmental conservation and farmers from the below poverty line and the Scheduled Caste community have been extended this benefit,” says Guleria. Fifty such farm ponds have been created under the campaign while 100 farmers have applied to the BDO. Sandeep Kumar, a farmer of Chogtaali village having a family of eight, owns six bighas from which he barely earned Rs 60,000 annually. “The meagre farm income was far too inadequate to make both ends meet. Since the fate of crops is dependent on rain, the yield was much less,” says Kumar. The creation of a pond, however, has brought about a sea change in his life, as the same land now fetches an annual income of Rs 3 lakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/ponds-transform-lives-of-sirmaurs-marginal-farmers-284230
