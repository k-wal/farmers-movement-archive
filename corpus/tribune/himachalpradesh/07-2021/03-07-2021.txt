This will help the department to get rid of the problem of frequent disruptions in drinking water supply due to the rise in the water level and siltation in the resources during the monsoons.Bhanu Pratap Singh, Assistant Engineer, Jal Shakti Department, Subdivision-I, Mandi, said that the main source of the scheme was the trench weir constructed to supply water from the Uhal river. Due to the rising water level during the rainy season, the supply was disrupted frequently.“For a scientific solution to the problem, the department has adopted a new technology based on sensors and that is totally automatic. With its use, the gates of the trench weir will be closed without human assistance when the water level rises. The gates will automatically open when the water level decreases. This will help get rid of the problem of siltation in the chamber,” he said. He said the department had successfully tested this sensor-based system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/scheme-upgraded-mandi-to-get-regular-water-supply-277526

The Municipal Corporation has sent notices to to the owners to vacate these at the earliest to ensure there is no loss of life in case these buildings collapse.“The notices have been sent after these buildings, spread across the main city and merged areas, were assessed as unsafe by our committee,” said Deputy Mayor Shailender Chauhan. The committee that assesses the safety status of these buildings comprises the MC’s Architect and Planner, JE and patwaris.Chauhan said these buildings were over 100 to 150 years old and were in a dilapidated condition. “These need to be vacated so that there’s no loss of life,” he said.Normally, building owners themselves send an application to the MC to declare their buildings unsafe. Many applications though are sent as a result of a feud between the landlord and his tenants.“The owner sometimes sends an application for declaring the building unsafe to evict the tenant. However, our committee goes to the site, checks the status of the building and then decides whether it’s safe or not,” said Chauhan.Notices are sent throughout the year, but the number goes up during the rainy season.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/13-buildings-declared-unsafe-in-shimla-notices-issued-277534

PCC president Kuldeep Rathore addressed the meeting.Ticket contenders Nishwar Singh, Chetan Chambiyal and Raghav Pathania were annoyed over the party neglecting old workers for the ticket. They were peeved at Bhawani Pathania, son of late MLA Sujan Singh Pathania, staking his claim to the ticket. They opposed his claim while interacting with mediapersons at Fatehpur late Wednesday evening.The trio appealed to the party leadership not to ignore dedicated workers while deciding the candidate. They said that the party should give the ticket to anyone of them. They lamented that Bhawani Pathania, who had never worked for the party, was staking his claim to the ticket but the people of the area would not accept any parachute candidate.The three leaders also met Fatehpur byelection in-charge GS Bali and expressed their anguish over the development.Nishwar Singh said that the organisers of the meeting did not invite them and the party flag was seen there. “Only ‘Jai Bhawani’ stickers were displayed at the meeting. The old and dedicated workers of the party were sidelined and not informed about Kuldeep Rathore’s meeting. It was a managed show of strength rather than a party workers’ meeting,” he said.Meanwhile, Rathore said that the party would give the ticket for the byelections only to winnable candidates.
