The alternate route worked out through Vikas Nagar in Uttarakhand will entail a daily tax of Rs 2,400 in Uttarakhand. Being narrow, the link roads could not withstand much traffic and a jam had occurred last evening too.”He added, “Since it will not be viable to operate the buses under such circumstances, the administration has been requested to talk to the Uttarakhand government and allow exemption in this tax.”Som Sharma, another local from Kamrau, opined that in order to ease the vehicular movement a request can be made to the Uttarakhand government to allow passage of smaller vehicles through a bridge on Chibru hydel dam project.Given the limited load bearing capacity of this bridge, iron railings have been erected at the bridge’s entry to dissuade vehicles from using it and this forced the residents to take a longer detour.The opening of the bridge can, however, risk the bridge as heavy goods laden trucks can also use it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/operations-of-36-buses-affected-due-to-closure-of-the-paonta-sahib-shillai-national-highway-707-291001

31-07-2021||Shimla||Shimla MC raises rent by 20%, shopkeepers relieved||The Shimla MC today decided in its monthly House to raise the rent of the shops by 20 per cent.The MC had brought in a per square feet method to determine the rent of its shops in 2018. The shopkeepers, who had taken these shops on rent decades back and were paying Rs 300 toRs 500 per month, refused to pay the rent determined through per square feet method, as it had raised the rent significantly. Compared to it, the 20 per cent hike was a minimal rise, as the rent they were paying was low.The MC, for the last three years, had not been able to recover rent from many shopkeepers. Following the discussions between the stakeholders to rationalise rent, the MC proposed to scrap the per square feet method and raise the rent by 20 per cent, which they had been paying in 2018. “Also, we have decided to fix the minimum rent of shops at Rs 500, and charge occupation charges from the shopkeepers who have covered extra area,” said MC Commissioner Ashish Kohli.Inderjit Singh, Beopar Mandal president, called it a relief to the traders. However, a councillor asked, “A shopkeeper paying Rs 500 will now pay Rs 600.

The MC authorities have failed to construct an entry gate and complete minor works on the land to be exchanged at the Kather Bypass providing entry to the cantonment authorities from the Kalka-Shimla highway.The existing gate, which leads to the local cantonment at the old bus stand, is to be acquired to pave the way for a multi-level parking project.The non-completion of the gate and other related works has put on hold key multi-level parking project at the old bus stand which was also to cover the defence land after the exchange. A parking facility for 156 vehicles was to be constructed on three floors. Since the exchange of land has failed to take place, the project was hanging fire for years.Hanging fire for yearsA contract was signed to complete the construction of a gate and related works last year. Targeted to be completed in six months, the work was yet to be executed even after lapse of a year.“Two notices have been served on the contractor to complete the work. He has promised to complete it within a month as 80 per cent work had been completed. He had earlier cited shortage of labour in view of the pandemic as the cause of delay,” informed Commissioner, Solan, MC, LR Verma.“A detailed project report to construct a multi-level parking would be constructed after the exchange of land and it would then be sent for funding to the state government,’’ informed Verma.Creating more parking areas was pressing necessity of Solan as commuters were forced to park their vehicles along the roads. This often led to police issuing challans. The residents resented that successive governments have failed to expand parking areas despite multifold increase in the number of vehicles in the town.Deputy Commissioner, Solan, Kritika Kulhari, said she had recently inspected the ongoing work underway at Kather Bypass and issued directions to the MC staff to expedite the work. Once it is completed, modalities of exchange of land would be undertaken to pave way for the work on the parking project.All political parties have promised to address this key issue of concern to the residents but have conveniently forgotten once the polls are over. The outgoing municipal committee held by the BJP kept harping on this issue but nothing happened on the ground. All eyes were now focused on the recently upgraded municipal corporation and it is expected that the project would finally see the light of the day.The issue was also taken up recently by the Beopar Mandal with the Urban Development Minister. Beopar Mandal president Mukesh Gupta said the minister assured that he would look into this long-pending demand of the Solan residents as there was an urgent need to ensure early exchange of land to pave way for this parking project.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/no-land-exchange-yet-solan-parking-project-faces-delay-290810

There has been speculation of factionalism and one-upmanship plaguing the Congress ahead of the four by-polls.A five-page letter, addressed to the AICC chief, has brought to fore the bickering within the state Congress, especially after the demise of former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh.Though the letter has 55 signatories, including 15 office-bearers of the Mandi Congress unit, its authenticity is uncertain.Targets RathoreThe timing of the letter too is interesting as almost all the senior leaders, including Congress MLAs, have been making rounds of New Delhi to meet the high command and senior AICC leaders.Interestingly, the letter has cited the drawbacks of Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) president Kuldeep Rathore. It also mentions names of 11 senior leaders who could be given the reins in place of the present party chief.The main issues against Rathore is his inexperience in electoral politics and his inability to take everyone along to emerge as a credible face under whose leadership the party can go to the 2022 Assembly poll.The letter not only mentions names of 11 senior leaders like Kaul Singh Thakur (Mandi), Asha Kumari (Chamba), Ram Lal Thakur (Bilaspur), GS Bali (Kangra), Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, Mukesh Agnihotri (Una), Harshwardhan Chauhan (Sirmour), Pratibha Singh (Shimla), Sudhir Sharma (Kangra), Rajinder Rana (Hamirpur) and Viplove Thakur (Kangra) but also gives a brief profile of each.The letter cites both the strengths and weaknesses of all the 11 potential replacement to Rathore, except in the case of Ram Lal Thakur, who has been projected as the tallest and most dynamic leader with no shortcomings, which comes as a surprise to most.The Congress, which is the main opposition party, seems to be in a disarray with clamour amongst some leaders to lay claim on Virbhadra’s political legacy.Virbhadra’s son Vikramaditya has claimed that nobody can lay claim to it, including him, as it has to be earned and not inherited.The Congress, in the meantime, is awaiting the decision of Virbhadra’s family regarding their decision to contest or stay out from the by-polls for Mandi Lok Sabha and Arki Assembly segment.Vikramaditya Singh asserted that presently there is no leader in the Congress who has reach in every corner of the state. Hence, the decision to decide their leader must be left to the MLAs in case the Congress wins the next Assembly polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/anonymous-letter-to-sonia-gandhi-hints-at-bickering-within-himachal-congress-290802

The highway was closed to vehicular traffic after the massive landslides.Several vehicles had stopped just few metres away from the affected spot in Kali Dhank, where the road caved in first along the valley side followed by crumbling of the hill, taking water pipes and electricity poles along.In a video which went viral, a group of villagers present near the spot ran helter-skelter as the hill started crumbling. They also warned motorists to stay away from the site.Incidentally, the NH-707 between Paonta Sahib and Hatkoti in Shimla district is being widened by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. No work, however, was underway at the affected sites. Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Paonta Sahib, Vivek Mahajan visited the spot while the road-widening project director and staff of revenue and electricity department assessed the damage. “Excavation work had also been carried out in the valley area for limestone mining two years ago.

Of the 400 samples, 243 had tested positive for Covid. In case of health workers, antibodies were found in 62 of the 99 samples (62.6 per cent).“Due to virus mutation, the possibility of achieving herd immunity is not very high,” said Amitabh Awasthy, Secretary, Health and Family Welfare. He said although antibodies were found in 62 per cent people, the likelihood of attaining herd immunity was not very strong due to the prevalence of various mutants.Chief Secretary Anil Khachi said preparations were on to ensure that in the case of a third wave, the state was well equipped to tackle the situation. “Within a month, we will have 28 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants to meet oxygen requirement. This will help cover most of the 100-bedded health institutions at places like Rampur, Theog, Nurpur and Paonta Sahib,” he said.An official said, “The influx of a large number of persons from Nepal to work as labourers in apple orchards makes us vulnerable as the Covid situation is quite grim.” Shimla and Kullu also have a huge tourist influx, which aggravates concerns. Sudden spike in Mandi district hints the dormant virus is getting activated again.2.27L pregnant women given first jab: GovtOver 2.27 lakh pregnant women have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine under the ongoing national inoculation drive, the Health Ministry said on Friday.
