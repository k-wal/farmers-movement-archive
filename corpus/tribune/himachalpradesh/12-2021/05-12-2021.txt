05-12-2021||Shimla||Managing livestock waste in Himachal reduces expensive farm inputs||Amid the widespread shortage of fertilisers in the ongoing planting season in several states largely owing to spiking international prices, farmers in Himachal Pradesh are using homemade alternatives for cultivation that are not only safer for the environment but are also boosting their incomes by reducing their dependence on chemicals.State government records say 146,438 farmers, including 14,000 apple growers, in the hill state are doing natural farming either partially or fully, over 8,268 hectares.This means they are not rushing to the market to plant the winter crops—not hampering their planting season like in neighbouring states Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh where farmers are currently facing a severe shortage of fertilisers.Middle-aged vegetable grower Raman Saini, a progressive farmer from Haroli in Una district adjoining Punjab, is one of many to benefit from an alternative method of cultivation that saves the soil from deterioration, boosts his bottom line and importantly without sacrificing much food production.Earlier, he struggled to market the vegetables—a fact he attributes to overuse of chemical pesticides to control diseases and pests. Even the soil fertility was deteriorating."I am so relaxed since I shifted to natural farming three years back. I don't have to run for fertilisers in the market. My land is more fertile and I don't have any health hazards with the farm inputs I make at home with the natural farming technique," an upbeat Saini told IANS.He grows crops with natural farming technique on 25 bighas and takes three crops in a year.Earlier, he used to spend Rs 45,000 on fertilisers (55 bags of chemical fertilizer, including 25 of urea) and around Rs 1.5 lakh on insecticides, herbicides and fungicides in a year.After shunning chemicals, he said, "Now I am saving all this money as I make everything with desi cow's urine, dung and some locally resourced inputs. I don't have to worry about the shortage of chemical fertilisers in the market. The other farmers should also understand that dependence on the market is not good for agriculture to progress." He produces chemical-free cabbages, cauliflowers, mustard, wheat, maize, potatoes and peas. "The cost of cultivation on my land has come down drastically. And see, I have not yet sown onions, but the buyers have already booked the harvest. What do I need?" he added.It is estimated that nitrogen discharge accounts for a third of agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions. By good management of livestock manure, farmers can retain those valuable nutrients and limit nitrogen pollution.Recounting a similar experience, grower Anil Biswan whose 30-bigha apple orchard is located at a higher altitude in Chirgaon in Shimla district, said earlier he used to buy 25-26 bags of chemical fertilisers annually with an expenditure of Rs 35,000."Now I don't need any fertilizer. The health of the soil and plants has improved with the inputs I prepare myself from indigenous cow's urine and dung. Now I am producing healthy and delicious apples." He is also growing multiple crops, including peas, potatoes, rajmash, etc., along with the apples.Apple growers need NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) 12:32:16 in winter for the post-harvest management of orchards.What makes the farmers in Himachal Pradesh opt for the natural way of farming?The reason: the non-chemical, low-cost, and climate-resilient natural farming technique that has been promoted by the Himachal Pradesh government under the Prakritik Kheti Khushhal Kisan Yojana (PK3Y) since 2018.Farm experts told IANS that the scheme is empowering the farmers to use home-brewed alternatives with zero dependence on the external market.Under the Prakritik Kheti Khushhal Kisan Yojana, the technique is based on the farm inputs that are prepared at home with dung and urine of a 'desi' cow, 'besan', jaggery and some locally resourced leaves.This technique has also helped them go for multiple crops on one field simultaneously, which not only ensures income in continuity, but also fulfils the nutrient requirements of crops on the same field, Prakritik Kheti Khushhal Kisan Yojana Executive Director Rajeshwar Singh Chandel explained to IANS.Even a large number of women farmers and women farmer groups are pro-actively practicing and spreading the word for natural farming techniques.Ajay Rattan, a farmer settled in the low hills of Ghumarwin block in Bilaspur district, told IANS, "I am happy now. My agriculture is no longer dependent on chemical fertilisers." He shifted to natural farming three and a half years back and grows peas, ginger, capsicum, wheat, maize, gram, sugarcane, soyabean, moong and taro root.Now he gets customers at his doorstep and a better price for the produce.The redesigning of agriculture with natural farming technique has made farming a lucrative venture for the farmers by reducing the cultivation cost drastically and will gradually cut down on the consumption of chemical fertilisers in agriculture.About 80 per cent of the total cultivated area in the state is rain-fed. Rice, wheat and maize are important cereal crops of the state. Groundnut, soyabean and sunflower in kharif and rapeseed or mustard and toria in the rabi season are important oilseed crops.As per the Economic Survey 2020-21, the fertilizer consumption in 1985-86 in Himachal Pradesh was 23,664 tonnes, which increased to 61,778 metric tonnes in 2019-20.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/managing-livestock-waste-in-himachal-reduces-expensive-farm-inputs-346505

The state achieved the feat today when the number of doses administered crossed the 53,77,820 mark, which is the population of 18-plus people in the state as per the government records. Incidentally, Himachal was the first state to vaccinate the targeted population with the first dose, too, by August-end.“Vaccinating the eligible population with both doses is a big achievement. Doing it before any other state makes the achievement even more special,” said NHM Director Hemraj Bairwa. “The Prime Minister held a vaccine ‘samvad’ with the state on September 6 after Himachal had vaccinated the eligible population with the first dose. We have administered the second dose in a record time of three months,” said Bairwa.The other achievement was that Kinnaur became the first district in the country to administer both doses to the eligible population in mid-October. This, too, was a special accomplishment, given the topography and inclement weather in the district.Bairwa said the vaccination drive would continue at the same pace and whosoever left out and the new entrants in the eligible population category, too, would be vaccinated. “Despite large-scale vaccination, we still need to stay vigilant.

However, no FIR had been registered against the raiding police team.A police party comprising 40 policemen from Doda district of J&K conducted a raid at Jalari village located on the border of Chamba in early hours yesterday. The J&K police were looking for a girl, who had allegedly eloped with her lover belonging to Jalari village. The raid was conducted on the orders of the J&K High Court.The J&K Police informed the local police about the raid but did not wait for them to accompany the team to the village. The sudden arrival of the J&K Police team in early morning hours in the village created panic among the villagers, who resisted the raid, leading to a clash with the raiding party. The J&K police officials fired tear gas shells on the villagers and also lathi-charged them, injuring some of them. However, the local police brought the situation under control.The SP said the J&K Police could not find the girl, who had reportedly gone missing. The J&K Police erred in conducting the raid without the local police, leading to a clash with villagers.Jalori residents are demanding the registration of a case against the J&K policemen for using force and tear gas shells against the villagers.

Yesterday, the police headquarters had advised the constables to refrain from making comments on social media.Social media was flooded with posts of the family members (parents, wives and children) of the constables belonging to the 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019 batches, holding placards seeking justice. Comments such as “Jai Ram sarkar hosh mein aayo, police jawano ko mat satayo” (Wake up Jai Ram government, don’t torture police jawans) and “Ab baat tankhah ki nahi hai CM sahib, Baat ab humare bachoon ke maan ki hai” (now the issue is not of salary, Mr Chief Minister but it is a matter of dignity of our children) have been posted on social media and are getting a good response.“My son is a Covid warrior. He was on duty during Covid breakout, checking vehicles and passes on the road. He stayed away from us and was exposed to the threat of Covid. However, he still ensured the safety of people but this is how the government has rewarded him. The government should understand that they are not 5,700 constables but 5,700 families (20,000 to 25,000 voters),” stated the father of a constable.The families rue that the government is meting out a step-motherly treatment to the constables. The state has reduced the period for regularisation of the services of contractual employees from three to two years but is not willing to reduce the period for granting the higher pay scale of Rs 10,300+Rs 3,200 from eight years to two years.The constables stopped taking meals in the police mess on November 24 and had even approached the Chief Minister but got no assurance that their grievances would be redressed.The constables appointed in 2013 in the pay scale of Rs 5,910+Rs 1,900 were given the Rs 10,300+Rs 3,200 pay scale after two years but the period was increased to eight years for the constables recruited in 2015 and thereafter, which is discriminatory and unjustified.The state government had assured them that steps would be taken after the Covid threat subsides and the 15 Finance Commission recommendations were implemented, said the wife of a constable.

It said that the compliance report should be submitted to the court on January 5, 2022.While passing the order, the court said, “The police acted as monocratic and unmindful of its legal obligations. The conduct of the police depicts the sordid, despotic and nepotic functioning of those, who in most brazen, blatant and contemptuous manner, have flouted and defied the mandate of law. The material on record suggests clearly that the conduct of the police was not bona fide.
