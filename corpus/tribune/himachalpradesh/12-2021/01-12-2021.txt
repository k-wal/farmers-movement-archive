The social bodies will also approach the State Human Rights Commission to highlight the issue.The social bodies said many homeless people in Palampur, Baijnath, Paprola, and Kangra towns had been forced to spend nights in the open these days. They regretted that the local authorities had turned a blind eye to this issue.KB Ralhan, co-convener, People’s Voice, while addressing mediapersons here today, said the Deputy Commissioner, Kangra, should direct the SDMs and the heads of the municipal bodies to see that nobody was forced to spend the night in the open, especially during winters in Palampur. He also released pictures of the needy sleeping in the open.He said the DC should also raise the issue before the state government to release funds for providing night shelter to the homeless who slept on the roadside.“The state and the Union Government have launched various schemes to provide shelter to the homeless, and lakhs of rupees have been released to the Municipal Councils for construction of shelters. These were constructed in many towns, but no persons were accommodated there.

Her son Sarabjit, a daily wager, took her to Tanda medical college last week. The doctors suggested immediate angioplasty because of the blockade in her coronary arteries. They asked him to deposit Rs 2 lakh for the procedure. However, Sarabjit was unable to pay the huge amount, therefore the doctors did not operate on his mother.Though the state government time and again claims that it is extending free medical treatment to the poor, but it seems the benefits of government schemes are only on the paper and yet to reach the needy and poor.A Tribune team today called on Padmawati at her native village, five km from Palampur, where she is living in a small mud house along with her son. She was suffering from a cardiac problem for the past few months.Doctors at the Palampur Civil Hospital referred her to the TMC, where she remained admitted for a few days. But the doctors discharged her without the necessary procedure because they were unable to deposit Rs 2 lakh, she rued.Padmawati is still on oxygen. Parminder Bhatia, president of a local organisation, provided her with an oxygen concentrator.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/no-funds-cardiac-patient-left-in-lurch-344930
01-12-2021||Lalit Mohan||Bills not cleared, contractors threaten to stop work||Tribune News ServiceDharamsala, November 30The contractors of PWD have threatened to stop work alleging that the government was not clearing their bills. The contractors are alleging that the government has recently passed a directive that their bills would not be cleared till they submit M-form for the construction material used in their works. The M-form is a document issued by the mining department of the respective area to illustrate that the construction material such as sand and gravel was taken from the approved site.Navneet Thakur, president of Kangra Chamba Contractor Association, said that they purchased sand and gravel from stone crusher owners. “These stone crusher owners give us bill and charge GST for the material purchased. However, the stone crusher owners are giving us the M-forms issued by the mining department. The PWD has stopped the payments of contractors citing government direction that the M-form was required to be attached along with the bills of contractors. Contractors are being made scapegoat in the case”, he said.If the government wants to check illegal mining they should check illegal mining by stone crusher owners or lease holders not harass the contractors, he said, adding that the contractors would be forced to stop work in case their dues were not cleared by the department for want of M-forms.“We are under pressure from the department to complete works on time. No stone crusher owner was ready to give us M-forms. By involving the contractors in getting M-forms, the government is shifting its responsibility of checking illegal mining on the contractors”, he said.Chief Engineer PWD Dharamsala Zone, NP Singh, said the condition of making payments only after submission of M-forms was imposed on the direction of High Court. Presently, payments were being given to only those contractors who are submitting M-forms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bills-not-cleared-contractors-threaten-to-stop-work-344929

Earlier, the Forest Department had imposed a penalty on the NHAI for muck dumping on its land, but it could not deter the construction companies to avoid the practice.Akash Vashishta, an environmentalist, said, “I saw massive hill blasting, tunnelling and consequent muck dumping into the Beas from Mandi to Kullu and further to Manali for almost 100-km stretch. The river space has shrunk.”Naveen Mishra, project director of the NHAI, said, “The companies had been directed to dump the muck in its area.
