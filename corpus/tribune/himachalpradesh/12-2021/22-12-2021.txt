The pace of procurement has been a little slow as the major chunk of the procurement has to come through Make-in-India initiative,” said an official. “Also, some hi-tech equipment had to come from abroad. Because of Covid, this too was delayed,” he said.IGMC to benefitThe IGMC doesn't have required infrastructure for super-speciality departments. Surgeries have to be put on hold as operation theatres are not readily available. Once these departments are shifted, greater infrastructure will be at disposal. — OfficialHe said the order worth Rs 35 crore for equipment has already been placed and equipment worth Rs 10 crore have arrived. “Overall, equipment worth Rs 60 crore will be ordered for the hospital. Recently, the approval for 256-slice high-end CT scan machine has also been given,” said the official.All super-specialty departments of Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital will be shifted to this hospital once it becomes functional.“This will be an excellent facility for the people.

I have had detailed talks with him regarding the pending projects in Himachal and he has assured of all possible help,” said Thakur.“The PM has a special affinity with Himachal and its people and as such he will come here again in the next four months for the inauguration of AIIMS at Bilaspur,” said Thakur.Despite the setback in the bypolls, the CM said his government would break the jinx of no party being able to repeat its government. “These four years have been dedicated to serving the people and as we enter the election year, we hope to work with the renewed energy so that we are able to come back to power,” said the CM.The BJP is keen to reverse its poll prospects. “I am satisfied with the performance of my ministers but there is always scope for improvement,” said he when asked about a possible Cabinet reshuffle, in the backdrop of the defeat in the bypolls.There has been speculation about a major overhaul in the Cabinet as well as in the party organisation. However, he chose to tread a cautious path and said the decision would be taken by the high command.Aware of the speculation about a change in the state leadership after the bypoll defeat, Thakur said irrespective of such conjectures each time he visited Delhi, the fact was that he had remained in the saddle.Thakur said despite the unusual circumstances, arising out of the pandemic, his regime had ensured that the wheels of development did not stop. “Though there are several achievements, I feel that bridging the regional divide and putting an end to the culture of political vendetta has been very satisfying,” he said.The CM said the Congress registered victory on the basis of sympathy votes which would not happen in the Assembly elections. “People of Himachal are very emotional and get swayed by such appeals but this will not happen every time,” he said. Thakur also said the defeat in the bypolls was a timely alert for the BJP which would help the party overcome shortcomings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bjp-banks-on-modi-charisma-to-woo-voters-in-assembly-poll-353069

Provisional degrees would be given to the genuine students after the verification of documents. There are about 50,000 students whose documents would be checked for authenticity.

They had said their certificates and degrees were not being verified and authenticated due to the ongoing probe into the fake degree case.They rued that whenever a candidate applies for a job or for higher education, his educational background and documents are verified by the employer or the institution, but the pass-outs of Manav Bharti University are facing problems as their verification is being denied by the university.During investigations, the SIT had detected 36,000 fake degrees from hard disks and the number is expected to increase. Preliminary investigations had pointed out that each degree was sold for Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh. The SIT had also detected properties worth Rs 440 crore, out of which properties valuing Rs 194.74 crore were linked with proceeds of crime and attached.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/fake-degree-scam-provisional-degrees-to-be-given-to-genuine-manav-bharti-university-students-353071
