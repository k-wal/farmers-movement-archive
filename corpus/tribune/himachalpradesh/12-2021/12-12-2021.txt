12-12-2021||Shimla||Abolish caste-based reservation, says Shanta Kumar after Himachal Govt sets up General Category Commission||Veteran BJP leader and former Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Shanta Kumar has said caste-based reservation should be fully abolished in government jobs.In a Facebook post on Sunday morning, Shanta Kumar said the time has come for reservation based on family income after fully abolishing the caste-based quota system.Reacting to the setting up of the General Category Commission (Samanya Varg Aayog) in Himachal Pradesh on Friday, he said the government had to yield immediately to the demand of the protesters in Dharamshala for setting up the Commission.The demonstration in Dharamshala in support of setting up the Commission for general category communities was historic and unprecedented in Himachal Pradesh, he added.About 80 per cent people of the country are fed up of caste-based reservation, he claimed.Justifying his demand of abolishing the caste-based quota, the veteran BJP leader claimed the poor among the reserved castes have not been able to get full benefit of reservation for a long time.The rich among the reserved categories have enjoyed the benefit of reservation, he said, adding that the demand to exclude the creamy layer from the reservation has been raised several times.The leaders of the reserved categories in many political parties fall under the creamy layer, he claimed.Shanta Kumar further said the Supreme Court has also issued directions to exclude creamy layer from reservation but the category of people are taking the benefit of reservation even today.The former chief minister also said India ranks 117 among 130 countries listed according to the recent Global Hunger Index report.It has been stated in the report that 19.40 crore people in India go to sleep on an empty stomach. As per an estimate, 12 crore people among them are from the reserved categories, he said, adding that it indicated that the rich among the reserved categories secured benefits of reservation.India is celebrating its 75th year of independence, while on the other hand over 19 crore poor people still sleep on empty stomach, the BJP leader pointed out.

Many hotels owners have been forced to sell their properties because of the heavy bank liabilities.The cell met here today, under Parveen Sharma, Chairman of HIMUDA. He said the tourism industry played a significant role in the economy of the state, providing direct and indirect employment to over 10 lakh people and contributing over seven per cent to the state’s GDP.None seriousNone in the government is serious about our problems. We are not demanding any favour from the government but only fighting for our rights. In other sectors, the state government has granted liberal assistance but in the case of the tourism industry, none has come forward to help. — Ravinder Sharma, Resort ownerHowever, he admitted that it had failed to get a special package or financial support from the state and the Centre.Sharma assured the hoteliers that he would take up the issue with Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur. The state government was well versed with the situation and soon it would announce relief for the hotel industry, he maintained.Various stakeholders said the Rs 20 lakh crore package, released by the Prime Minister after the lockdown, had not extended any help to the state’s tourism industry.The stakeholders could not even get benefit on account of bank interest and electricity bill wavier for the lockdown period, when the industry was totally shut.Ravinder Sharma, owner of a resort, said the state government had not implemented its commitments to the industry in the past too, and these had remained confined to files.Despite Himachal being a major tourism hub, the government had failed to come out with a new tourism policy. States like Maharashtra had already accorded the status of an industry to tourism but the Himachal Government had failed to do so, despite the repeated requests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/bjp-tourism-cell-for-package-to-hotels-349317

Hundreds of employees gathered at the Dari ground to show strength and press for the implementation of the old pension scheme.Taking lessons from the Swaran Morcha protest yesterday that caused embarrassment to the administration, the police did not allow protesters beyond the Dari ground, which was located about 6 km from the Assembly complex. A large police contingent was deployed to prevent them from proceeding towards the complex.Govt’s take on their demandPanel for NPS holdersLeaders of employee unions said the new pension scheme did not provide security to government employees, who retire after serving the government for decades. The employees, who are due to retire under the new pension scheme, would be paid a paltry amount whereas their predecessors were getting handsome pension.The new pension scheme was implemented from 2004. Under the scheme, the employees are paid pension as per their contribution to the provident fund, which comes just about a few thousand rupees whereas under the old pension scheme, the employees were paid as per their last pay drawn.There are about 90,000 government employees in Himachal, covered under the new pension scheme. The government has stated that the old pension scheme cannot be implemented as it has been discontinued by the Centre as well as other states. The government maintained that if the old pension scheme was implemented in the state, it would put a financial burden of Rs 2,000 crore on the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/protesting-staff-show-strength-349311

Congress MLA from Kinnaur Jagat Singh Negi and CLP leader Mukesh Agnihotri got up from their chairs and demanded that a discussion be allowed on the adjournment motion.Cong’s decisionThe Congress is responsible for discrepancies in cops’ pay scales.

The BJP members also got up from their seats and started raising slogans and some said that cases of treason should be registered against Congress MLAs. This led to heated exchanges between Congress MLA Bhawani Singh Pathania and BJP MLAs.The Congress MLAs then moved to the well of the House and raised slogans before staging a walkout.Outside the House, Agnihotri alleged that the ruling party was running away from discussion over all matters. The fact the constables were protesting and had even reached the residence of the CM was a matter of concern and should have been discussed. After family members of constables showed placards to BJP national president JP Nadda in Bilaspur, cases were registered against them.“We are demanding that the government should discuss the issue which was disallowed by the Speaker due to which they walked out,” he said.Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Suresh Bhardwaj termed the walkout unfortunate. Minister for Forest Rakesh Pathania alleged that the Congress was responsible for discrepancies in pay scales of constables.

12-12-2021||Ambika Sharma||Tracing Himachal’s illegal drug trade||EVERY third drug in the Indian domestic market is manufactured in Himachal Pradesh, and the state’s pharmaceutical industry is pegged at Rs8,000 crore. Of the 625 manufacturers in the pharma hubs, 139 have been given licences to produce pharma-opioids/psychotropic substances, listed in the schedule of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.In the absence of any nationwide survey to gauge an estimate of genuine users of these narcotic and psychotropic drugs, meant for therapeutic purposes, the pharmaceutical companies continue to upscale manufacturing to cater to the ever-increasing demand for recreational purposes. This illegal diversion for the nefarious use of a sizeable chunk of pharma-opioids has besmirched the image of Himachal’s pharma hubs, which prided themselves in manufacturing Covid vaccines and medicines in recent months.The latest case of a Baddi-based wholesale trader, Zannet Pharmaceuticals, indulging in illegal sale amounting to Rs100 crore of narcotic drugs like Nitrazapem, Codeine and Etizolam through fake bills and firms has exposed the chinks in the open-ended licensing policy. That the trader’s wholesale drug licence had been cancelled in Punjab in 2018-19 and the Rajasthan drug control administration did not bother to provide details regarding the firm to the local authorities expose glaring loopholes in the system.Several such cases have also surfaced in Paonta Sahib and Kala Amb in Sirmaur district, facilitating the illegal entry into the market of pharma opioids like Tramadol in Punjab and other states, with sales running into crores. There are 14 NDPS drugs which are manufactured for therapeutic use, of which three — Alprazolam, Codeine and Tramadol — are widely misused for recreational purposes and by addicts, as per the seizure pattern of the police.Licence loopholesInstead of devising a stringent licensing system that ensures restricted and controlled production, the open-ended system results in units manufacturing tablets coming out with scheduled NDPS drugs as well. The absence of effective inter-state and inter-departmental coordination further fuels sales, as departments like State Taxes and Excise and Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence have little or no coordination with the Drug Control Authority (DCA).The DCA did wake up after the anomalies came to fore during cases unearthed recently in Baddi, Kala Amb and Paonta Sahib.“Standard operating procedures have been devised where a manufacturing unit is supposed to file monthly returns of narcotic substances consumed and balance stocks, as well as details of drugs manufactured and sold before the State Drugs Controller,” says Navneet Marwaha, the State Drugs Controller. It has also been made mandatory to provide information to the Drugs Inspector and the Superintendent of Police of the district about the drugs dispatched from a unit, and the destination. About 25 units have surrendered their NDPS licences following this intervention.The moot question, however, remains whether these measures are enough, considering the high level of penetration in North India, where drug abuse is higher than the national average. As per a recent survey conducted by the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, AIIMS-Delhi, as against the national average of 0.7 per cent, the use of opioids is 2.8 per cent in Punjab, 2.5 in Haryana, 2 per cent in Delhi and 1.7 per cent in Himachal Pradesh.Vinod Gupta, a manufacturer with 42 years of experience in the field, says only “thorough scrutiny of returns by officials by randomly tracking the backward and forward linkages can help track nefarious elements”, who, he adds, tarnish the image of manufacturers. “There is an overwhelming demand for such NDPS drugs, but given the stringency to provide various details, I’ve restricted manufacturing from about 10 to three,” he adds.Way forwardExperts say there is no alternative to a more rigid licensing system, under which manufacturers and traders who face cancellation of licence in one state for violating the Drugs and Cosmetics Act should not be permitted to operate in other states as well.Sharing his concerns over the nefarious trade, Rajesh Gupta, president of the Himachal Drug Manufacturers Association, says, “Restrictions should be enforced at retail shops, too, with only a select few chemists in a given area being permitted to sell such drugs. This will help check malpractices.”He points out that several manufacturers who have limited staff and infrastructure to maintain records and follow requisite procedures are now surrendering their licences after the state DCA has stepped up regulatory checks.Another area of concern is the lack of inter-departmental and inter-state coordination. The Department of State Taxes and Excise (DSTE) is the administering department for NDPS Act in Himachal. It issues ‘MD 6’ licence for manufacturers and traders dealing in NDPS and psychotropic substances. The staff of the DSTE, however, failed to detect fake bills through which the trade proliferated for more than two years by Zannet Pharmaceuticals at Baddi.Himachal DGP Sanjay Kundu claims strict enforcement of drug laws, particularly concerning the misuse of pharma-opioids by pharmaceutical companies. “They are now on our radar. Financial investigation under the NDPS Act for attachment of illegally acquired properties is being undertaken. The inputs are shared with the Enforcement Directorate to investigate money laundering,” he says.“We are focusing on the big fish and undertaking robust investigations and effective trial management. Tracing the backward and forward linkages by involving senior officials in search and seizure operations is lending a knockout punch to the criminals,” he adds.DGP Kundu says Register Number 29 has been introduced at all police stations to profile criminals involved in narcotics and psychotropic substances crimes.Key drug seizuresOn May 29-30 this year, in a joint operation with the Punjab Police, the HP Police seized over 30 lakh intoxicant tablets, including 12.4 lakh Tramadol capsules, 7.7 lakh Tramadol tablets and 9.9 lakh Alprax tablets worth Rs15 crore, from Unique Formulations, Paonta Sahib. Its marketing company, PB Pharmaceuticals, New Delhi, was non-existent. The police also recovered 745 kg of raw material for Tramadol worth Rs3 crore.In 2019, Apple Field Pharma Company, Paonta Sahib, was shut on directions of the HP Police State Narcotics Cell for an unaccounted stock of 47,000 Tramadol tablets and 10,000 Codeine-based cough syrup bottles. Investigations revealed that the proprietors/shareholders of Unique Formulations and Apple Field Pharma were the same.On May 31, Orison Pharma International, Kala Amb, was found manufacturing tablets containing Tramadol which were sold to a marketing company, PP Pharma in Ahmedabad, without any agreement in violation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. During inspection, 30 lakh Tramadol tablets and 226 kg of raw material were seized.On information from Interpol in Benin (Africa), an FIR was registered against Laborate Pharmaceuticals, Paonta Sahib, for alleged illegal export of 1.75-crore Tramadol tablets worth around Rs5 crore (approximately Rs100 crore in the illegal market) to Chad.Clearly, the magnitude of the illegal trade presents a huge challenge. HOW IT ALL BEGANIt was the 2003 Central industrial package which gave a major push to the pharma investment in Himachal, by givingexemption in Central excise duty, income-tax holiday and subsidy on capital investment. This earned the industrial hub ofBaddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh the sobriquet of being the pharma hub of Asia.
