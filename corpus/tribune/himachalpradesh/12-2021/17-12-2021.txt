Initial investigations show that the tractor belongs to Kulhal area of Uttarakhand lying adjacent to the Himachal border on the other side of the Yamuna river.The mining mafia usually strikes in the wee hours and flees towards Uttarakhand where the quarry material fetches high returns.“Since Yamuna river forms the border between Himachal and Uttarakhand, it becomes very difficult for the police to apprehend the miscreants due to riverine flow at places. Apart from this, three more tractors found at the valley area of Yamuna river have been apprehended. Officials of the mining department have been requested to demarcate and mark the land leased for mining and government land so that the person involved in illegal mining could be booked under the relevant law,” informed DSP Bahadur.The labourers, tractor drivers and more than 10 tractor-trailers, however, fled towards Uttarakhand through the river as soon as the police descended on the spot, added the DSP.Directions has been given to SHO Paonta Sahib to maintain surveillance in the area to check illegal mining which was posing a threat to Yamuna river, its bridge as well as its riverbed. The area is being monitored using drone surveillance which will continue in future too, said Bahadur.This is the second FIR since last evening against illegal mining mafia. One FIR was lodged yesterday against two tractors involved in illegal mining at Rampurghat valley forest area in a joint raid conducted by the police and forest staff.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/3-more-tractor-trailers-impounded-in-paonta-sahib-351252

Not only essential equipment like X-ray and CT scan machines are out of order, but also the hospital’s fire-fighting preparations are nearly non-existent.“No action has been taken for fire safety and the nodal officer is clueless about fire safety aspects,” observed Kiran Bhadana, ADC, Shimla, in the fire audit report. Bhadana is the chairperson of the fire audit committee.According to the report, inflammable oxygen cylinders have been kept on the hospital premises without proper arrangements and there’s no periodic inspection of electrical installations by qualified engineers. Besides, there’s no automatic or manual fire detection alarm and no evacuation plan in case of emergency.People sufferingThe X-ray machine has been out of order for more than six months, the CT scan is also non-functional. People are suffering because of the laxity of the hospital. —Trilok Bhaluni, A zila parishad member“It is the only hospital among all Covid-designated medical facilities in the district that has many things lacking on the fire safety front,” said Bhadana during the Shimla Zila Parishad meeting today. The hospital’s X-ray machine is lying defunct for many months now. “The X-ray machine has been out of order for more than six months now; the CT scan is also non-functional. People are suffering because of the laxity of the hospital,” said Trilok Bhaluni, a Zila Parishad member from Rampur.There’s no shortage of finances with the hospital. The medical superintendent informed the Zila Parishad that the hospital’s Rogi Kalyan Samiti had around Rs 10 lakh available with it. “Despite having the money, you could not fix the X-ray machine. It’s really a sorry state of affairs,” said Bhadana.
