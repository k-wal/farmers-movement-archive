These events could not be held last year due to Covid. — Pankaj Prabhakar, Shimla Ice skating clubA clear sky with minimum temperature staying below 4°C to 5°C was a prerequisite for ice skating, said Bhuvnesh Banga, secretary, Shimla Ice Skating Club.The area of the skating rink, which is equal to the size of five tennis courts (58 m X 30 m), has shrunk temporarily by almost 10 per cent as a lift from Lakkar Bazar to Mall Road under the Shimla Smart City Mission is being built at the club entrance.Also, a corner of the rink had become excessively moist due to seepage caused by blockade of the drain due to construction activity. But the matter has been resolved.Notably, 2020 was the centenary year of the club but there were no celebrations and even the regular features like gymkhana and carnival had to be skipped due to Covid.The history of the club dates back to 1920, when tennis courts were converted into a natural ice skating rink by Irish military official Blessington.

The written response declined the allegations levelled by Leader of the Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri during a press conference here yesterday.What press note saysAgnihotri had alleged that taxis were misused for anonymous reasons and bills amounting to about Rs 1.25 crore were paid. Further, huge public funds were accounted for in the names of people qurantined in hotels though the facility was meant only for overseas returnees, who had to pay for it. He had also alleged that the administration was now in a ‘cover up’ mode and the records were being straightened.In a press note issued by the District Public Relations Department here today, a government spokesman for the Una district administration clarified that taxis were used by police, health and revenue officials, who were frontline workers in containing the pandemic, and also for distributing relief or sanitising containment zones, besides transporting patients to hospitals.The press note stated that quotations were not required for taxis as the district administration had already approved the hiring charges in 2016 and that the controlling officers in the districts were the competent authorities to hire taxis. Moreover, there was public fear during the initial stage of the pandemic and therefore quick decisions had to be taken on the basis of the prevailing circumstances.On Agnihotri’s allegation that Rs 41 lakh was paid as waiting charges of taxis, the press note clarified that these vehicles were stationed at inter-state barriers, public places and containment zones for monitoring purpose but the practice was discontinued in November 2020.It clarified that a TDS of Rs 1.24 lakh was to be deducted from the taxi hiring charges and deposited with the Income Tax Department, but was not done due to a clerical error. The administration has initiated the process to recover the TDS amount from taxi operators. The operators, who do not cooperate, would be blacklisted, it read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/una-admn-rejects-agnihotris-charge-of-covid-fund-misuse-348515

The petitioner has abused the process of law and, therefore, made himself liable for payment of costs”.The court passed the order on a writ petition filed by Sham Sharma, a resident of Jakhdhar village in Dadasiba tehsil of Kangra district, seeking an ambulance road facility to his house on the ground that he is a locomotor impaired person having up to 80 per cent disability.Perusing the record, the court dismissed the petition and observed, “The thrust of the petitioner for filing the petition is to seek an ambulance road facility. However, if the disability certificate is seen, it will be noticed that no doubt the petitioner suffers disability to the extent of 80 per cent, that too locomotor impaired, but this disability, being permanent in nature, is on account of his amputation of the hand above elbow, which, by no stretch of imagination, can cause any impediment or difficulty to the petitioner to reach his house as he has been doing for the past 60 years”.The court observed that “the petition is clearly mischievous as the petitioner during his entire service career did not file a petition knowing fully well that it would be an abuse of the process of law and would invite disciplinary proceedings or other proceedings against him. But that does not give a licence to a person, who has retired from service, that, too, a teacher, to approach this court with such a frivolous petition without there being any legal or other right.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/man-fined-30k-for-law-process-misuse-348513

The government has turned a blind eye to the demands of its employees, including the implementation of the pay commission. It was only after the BJP lost the byelections that a committee to listen to the grievances of the employees was formed”.He said that the BJP government in the state had lost the moral right to rule. “The BJP lost all four byelections, including the Mandi parliamentary constituency where it tried to play the regional card because Mandi is the home district of Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur. The government has lost the faith of the people of state and hence it should resign,” he added.Agnihotri said that the Congress would support the state employees, who were planning to organise a rally for the restoration of the old pension scheme. “It is sad that the policemen of the state are being forced to strike work. The state government should regularise the services of constables but instead it was trying to harass them,” he added.Meanwhile, the BJP MLAs have also formulated a strategy to counter the Congress’ aggression with aggression.Sources said that the BJP legislators would also attack the Congress over the issues of the old pension scheme. They were likely to highlight the fact that the decision to discontinue the old pension scheme was taken by the previous Congress government led by Virbhadra Singh.
