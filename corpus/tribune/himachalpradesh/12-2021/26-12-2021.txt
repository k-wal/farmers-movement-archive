Tourists want to have the experience of staying in an igloo. It is the first igloo in the valley which has been set up for commercial use.”Package at Rs9,000 for two“Due to the lack of snow, we could not develop more igloos for the stay of tourists at Teling, which we are promoting as an ‘igloo village’. As soon as there is fresh snowfall in this region, we will develop more igloos,” he said.“The package of stay for two persons in this igloo is Rs 9,000. For a single person, it is Rs 4,500 for a night stay. In this package, we are providing breakfast, dinner, tea, coffee and noodles along with bonfire,” said Virender.Inspired by the concept of staying in snow houses in foreign countries, eight youths of the district had first built an igloo at Shashin village under Sissu panchayat in 2017.Since the area was inaccessible because of the closure of Rohtang in winters, the concept could not succeed.“Now, after the opening of the Atal Tunnel on the Manali-Leh highway, there is a vast potential of igloo tourism during winter in the Lahaul valley,” he said.Tourists are thronging the Lahaul valley beyond Sissu after the district administration has lifted the restrictions imposed on the movement of tourists in the region.DC Neeraj Kumar said there would be no restrictions on tourists entering the Lahaul valley who have bookings local hotels and homestays. All types of tourist vehicles, except two wheelers, are allowed to enter the Lahaul valley between 10 am and 3 pm.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/igloo-tourism-gains-pace-in-lahaul-354530

Nehria, however, reached the venue along with his supporters. Shashwat Kapoor, son of Kishan Kapoor, addressed the gathering.The fact that Nehria was not allowed to address the gathering peeved his supporters. Some of them took to social media alleging that the function was organised to politically launch Kapoor’s son.Nehria said he came to know that a function was being held by the BJP workers of the Dharamsala block. “Though I was not invited, I thought that it was my duty to attend it as the event was organised by the MP,” he said.When asked if he was not allowed to address the gathering, Nehria said nobody asked him to address it.Kapoor said he celebrated the birth anniversary of Vajpayee every year. This year many party workers, who were feeling ignored, requested to join the event.When asked if the programme was organised to launch his son, he said his son did not need any launching. If he was capable, he would make his way into politics.“Even I worked my way in politics from the ground level and my son shall also do the same,” Kapoor said. When asked on why the BJP MLA was not allowed to address the event, Kapoor said since the function was organised with a different motive, he was not scheduled to address it.Since Nehria was elected MLA, the supporters of Kapoor are feeling let down.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/not-invited-yet-bjp-legislator-attends-mps-event-at-dharamsala-354533
