It is he who is credited with creating this much-needed facility for the people of Himachal who had to otherwise take the ailing all the way to Delhi or Chandigarh. Nadda had granted an AIIMS for the hill state while he was the Union Health Minister. This contribution of Nadda will certainly be remembered by the people of Himachal.||Himachal Diary: Proud moment for Nadda||Fence sitters on edgeWho would go where is keeping many political leaders on edge in Kangra these days. Many fence sitters within the Congress and the BJP in Kangra are in touch with leaders of both the parties. They are not raising issues of people fearing that this may annoy the ruling party or opposition leaders and mar their chances of joining the party or getting party tickets in the 2022 elections. Fence sitters in both parties in the state are awaiting for political changes in the state to decide their future course of action.Going extra mile to keep them happyMost bureaucrats go the extra mile to keep top politicians in good humour. Even an apparently inconsequential font size to be used for the names of political bosses on cards and other places become a matter of serious concern and deliberations, especially when a few top politicians are attending a function together. With the Chief Minister, BJP president JP Nadda and two Union Ministers coming for the AIIMS inauguration at Bilaspur, some officials were seen sweating over the font size to be used for the names of the bigwigs.Dreams of winning electionsPlaying down the victory of the opposition Congress in four by-elections held recently, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur has attributed the victory to sympathy wave and chided the Congress not to dream about winning the Assembly elections as sympathy wave would vanish by that time. But Congress leaders are not taking it seriously and a senior Congress leader taking jibe at the chief minister said”When BJP can dream of winning assembly polls after losing four by-election, why Congress can’t stage a comeback even after sweeping the by-elections”.Investors’ dilemmaStaff of a significant department in Baddi industrial belt is busy distributing marriage cards of a politician’s son among the investors.

One of them pertains to Baddi-III registered since August 29, 2019, against Zannet Pharma for proprietorship business. Another GSTin is registered in Haryana and four in Punjab and all are active as per information secured from State Taxes and Excise officials.The fact that the State Narcotics Crime Control Unit has detected fake billing in Rs 100 crore transaction, it has caused loss of revenue. The STED is yet to wake up to check tax evasion in the case though it has a flying squad at Baddi headed by a senior official.Commissioner, STED, Yunus, said, “I’ve directed the field staff to coordinate with the officials of the drug control administration and examine all facts, including revenue loss to the exchequer and other violations, and whether he is a registered trader having a GSTin issued to him by the department.”The DCA has stepped up its drive against such traders as probability of more such traders can’t be ruled out.“More than 150 such firms manufacture drugs falling under the NDPS as well as Drugs and Cosmetics Act in the Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh (BBN) industrial area and their premises are routinely inspected,” said State Drugs Controller Navneet Marwaha||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/six-gstins-issued-against-mobile-no-of-baddi-trader-346783

Water is available only during the monsoons. After the monsoon months, the fall dries up as the IPH Department and Army authorities pick up water from the source of the waterfall.Bhagsu waterfall, Dal Lake dry upSimilarly, the Dal Lake, another major tourist spot, has dried up due to unscientific removal of silt from its base. Now the lake dries up just after monsoons and then looks like a mud pool.As per the information collected by The Tribune, about 12 lakh litres of water was being lifted daily for various water supply schemes of the Army and the IPH Department from the stream feeding the Bhagsu waterfall. This leaves almost nothing in the stream to create a waterfall. The quantity of water being lifted has increased over the past decade, adversely affecting its flow.Sarvan Thakur, executive engineer, IPH Department, Dharamsala, said the Army authorities pick water from the stream feeding the Bhagsu waterfall through two six-inch pipes. “We have also laid four pipes through which water is sourced from the same stream. Recently, to cope up with the shortage of water, we added two more two-inch pipes to pick water,” he added.Sanjeev Gandhi, general secretary of the Smart City Dharamsala Hotel and Restaurant Association, said the hoteliers had requested the district administration to lift water from the area below the waterfall and not from its source. The drying up of the waterfall has spoiled the natural landscape of the area, he rued.Satish Sharma, a local environmentalist, said the drying up of the waterfall and the Dal Lake is an illustration of the poor management of precious natural resources. It is a sad state of affairs that tourist spots are losing their sheen due to unscientific approach in their handling, he added.Kangra Deputy Commissioner Nipun Jindal said a committee had been formed to restore the Dal Lake to its previous glory. A meeting would be held with the Army and IPH authorities to maintain some flow in the Bhagsu waterfall, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/dsala-losing-tourist-hotspots-to-unscientific-approach-346770

It shows that any target can be achieved if there is strong resolve and willpower. — Mansukh Mandaviya, Union health ministerNadda said a sum of Rs 2,000 crore is required for meeting the monthly expenditure of an institute like AIIMS. “Today is a historic occasion as Himachal has become the first state in the country to have undertaken cent percent vaccination of its 53.77 lakh population,” he said.Nadda said Himachal Pradesh has become a frontrunner state in every field like education, health and social services sector despite being a small state despite having severe geographical constraints. He credited former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and current PM Narendra Modi for making dream projects like Kol Dam and Rohtang Atal Tunnel become a reality.Nadda said that Himachal Pradesh has got a Rs 500-crore satellite centre of the PGI, Chandigarh, at Una.Speaking on the occasion Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said Himachal had set an example before the entire nation in becoming the first state to administer both the first and second doses to its entire eligible population. “Himachal has set up an example before the country that despite geographical constraints like snow and mountains, the target can be achieved if there is strong resolve and will power,” he remarked. He added that he will cite the example of Himachal whenever he will go anywhere in the country.Mandaviya said India never had the dearth of brain power or manpower but is for the country to become a force to reckon with internationally. “From producing 30,000 Remedesvir injection per month to one crore a month, India has come a long way under Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.Addressing the gathering, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said for Himachal it was not easy to achieve the target of vaccinating its entire population with double dose due to constraints like difficult topography, couple with myths and beliefs against Covid vaccine. “We had to use chopper service to reach remote Bhara Bhangal in Kangra while we sought the approval of the local deity in the ancient village of Malana in Kullu to administer vaccine to the people,” he said.Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur said Himachal’s dream of having an AIIMS could become a reality only due to PM Modi and JP Nadda who as Health Minister sanctioned it for his home state. “The AIIMS will have 750 beds, ICUs and several operation theatres spread over 250 acres,” said Thakur.He lauded the health and front line workers for vaccinating its entire population and with zero wastage.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/cm-to-dedicate-bilaspur-aiims-to-people-by-june-says-nadda-346759
