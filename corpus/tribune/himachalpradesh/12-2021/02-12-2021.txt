Often our lives depend upon close and critical readings of China’s official jargon. This website delves into implicit assumptions, unconscious biases, fear and projections of the official Chinese mind and offers keys to deeper understanding,” said Tsering Tomo, director of the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy.“China takes itself so seriously, which is a bit comical,” noted Tsering Dorje, the principal researcher and writer of “Decoding CPP”.“There is a deep history implanted in China’s claim to be an exemplary civilisation. We know the backstory well and navigate our place in the world by unpacking these slogans,” she added.For instance, take the phrase “untrustworthy persons”. There are at least ten phrases that hide behind this seemingly benign term and many of them lead to compulsory incarceration in a re-education centre to instill a change of identity.One description of an “untrustworthy person” is “persons with no official religious duties who possess religious knowledge”. In Xinjiang especially, such people require compulsory re-education.At the launch of the “a sure guide to the indeterminate vagueness of key phrases in constant official use” were Tibetologist Vijay Kranti and former diplomat Deepak Vohra.“If you find yourself dealing with representatives of China’s party-state, you will find in this handbook the fine print that frames Chinese meanings and images,” pointed out Dorje.Vohra expressed satisfaction that the country’s thinkers, diplomats and academics had come out of the “Mira Sinha Bhattacharjee syndrome”, referring to the former diplomat who quit IFS because of a then rule that required women officers to quit on marriage. She then set up the Department of Chinese Studies in Delhi University as well as the China Study Group.Nevertheless, Vohra said she “poisoned the minds of two generations of Indian policy makers, thinkers, diplomats and journalists”.Kranti felt satisfaction that the Indian government had got out of the phobia of not annoying China. He regretted that in the past, the animus displayed towards Pakistan was not there in the Indian approach to China.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/our-lives-depending-on-unpacking-decoding-ccps-slogans-tibetan-researchers-345483

If any Army man loses life, he gets martyr’s status but in the case of death of a paramilitary jawan, he is deprived of this status,” he said.

The TMC is the second biggest medical institution in the state, which caters to the needs of patients of six districts.   The CT scan machine has already been non-functional for the past 11 months, affecting teaching and research work.

Sources said the government had not initiated any step for the repair of the  machine, despite several complaints lodged by  doctors,   patients and their attendants.  Meanwhile, the TMC has also not made any alternative arrangements to deal with the situation. Taking advantage of it, private centres have enhanced the rates and are  fleecing the poor patients.   In the TMC, the CT scan and MRI tests are conducted for Rs2,200 and Rs5,000 while in private radiology centres, patients are forced to pay Rs5,000 and Rs8,500 per test.

They will also have to submit bonafide and income certificates and self-attested declaration on not owning land or house.Jindal said as per the government’s policy, landless Himachal residents could be allotted two biswas of land in urban areas and three biswas in rural belts.As reported in these columns earlier, over 300 oustees have been without land after their houses got submerged in the dam lake about 55 years ago. Mostly labourers, they have been residing on the common land of villages along the Beas. As they didn’t have land in their names, they weren’t given any compensation after their houses got submerged.These people moved uphill in their own villages and settled on common land.In the 1970s, the Himachal Pradesh Government converted all village common land into forestland and the oustees became encroachers on forestland.

A large number of posts have appeared in social media supporting the demand of the constables, who are feeling let down after Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur announced to reduce the period of regularisation of the services of contractual employees from three years to two years and also the service regularisation period of daily wage workers by one year but the demands of the police constables have not been met.“We are a disciplined force and cannot form a union and hence are suffering. How can we show our resentment and fight against injustice done to us?” says a constable.Around 5,700 affected constables are feeling aggrieved by the decision of the government to extend the period of the constables for the grant of Rs 10,300+Rs 3,200 pay scale from two to eight years and their repeated pleas to grant the pay scales as per the 2013 policy have gone unheeded.The constables appointed in 2013 in the pay scale of Rs 5,910+Rs 1,900 are given the Rs 10,300+Rs 3,200 pay scale after two years but this period was increased to eight years for those recruited in 2015 and thereafter, which is discriminatory and unjustified.The Police Department has also pleaded the case of constables for the grant of Rs 10,300+Rs 3,200 pay scale to the constables recruited after January 2015 after two years on a par with the constables recruited before the notification of January 14, 2015.The IGP (Headquarters), in a letter to the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) on July 8, 2020, submitted that the pay scale and grade pay of clerks and constables were identical and they were placed in the scale of Rs 5,910-Rs 20,200+Rs 1,900 but clerks were being given the pay scale of Rs 10,300-Rs 34,800+Rs 3,200 after two years. However, in the case of constables, the period has been increased from two years to eight years after January 2015.The duties of policemen are different from other employees and they work 24x7, many a time under adverse working conditions.

As much as Rs 1,000 crore was announced for each park.The decision aimed at reducing dependence on China as nearly 65 per cent APIs are imported from China alone. Covid-induced disruptions in the supply chain had severally hit the pharma industry. This compelled the Union government to strengthen its domestic bulk drug production.The scheme for promotion of bulk drug park is expected to result in incremental production of bulk drugs worth about Rs 46,400 crore. Though it was applicable for five years, nearly two years have been lost in approving the three parks.The bulk drug parks require a hi-end pollution mitigation common effluent plant to deal with pollution, besides setting up of manufacturing units.Sources in the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare say, “The Department of Pharmaceuticals have received 12 or 13 proposals and three of them will be approved soon. Since the land proposed for the bulk drug in Una district is considered insufficient, there is bleak chances of the park being allotted to Himachal”.The Chief Minister as well as the Industries Minister have been pursuing the state’s case for securing a park.Himachal Pradesh has submitted a competitive proposal for securing one park. The government has set aside 1,400 acres of barren land at Polian Beet, Tibbian, Maluwal and Kutherbeet villages in the Haroli segment of Una district for the project.There are 700 pharma formulation units in Himachal. The annual consumption of APIs ranges from Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 28,000 crore. The state accounts for one-third of the country’s medicines with 15 US Food and Drug Administration-approved units and 180 approved by the World Health Organisation are manufacturing medicines here.Pharma exports from Himachal accounts for 7 per cent to 8 per cent of the country’s export share and stood at Rs 5,400 crore in 2018-19.13 proposals received||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/chances-of-himachal-pradesh-getting-bulk-drug-park-remote-345244
