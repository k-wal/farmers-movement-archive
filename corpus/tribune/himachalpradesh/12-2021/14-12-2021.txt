The funds secured under the PPP mode also helped in the renovation of the cyber lab facilitating setting up of a CCTV footage analysis lab and geotagging of CCTVs versus crime which helped in effectively solving crimes.”Key initiatives like geotagging of CCTVs on Google My Maps and surveillance through vehicle-mounted cameras were introduced for the first time in this area to step up surveillance in this crime-torn industrial belt.In a bid to ensure that the CCTVs functioned uninterrupted, an in-house wing for 24x7 was setup by the Baddi police. CCTVs’ database management and dedicated footage analysis helped the police recover stolen property worth Rs 3.84 crore.The project was also reviewed by senior officials, including DGP, Additional Director General of Police, State CID Crime, Inspector General of Police, South range, Himanshu Mishra, and the then SP Rohit Malpani, who played a key role in its implementation. Suggestions were also sought from the industry representatives to enhance its effectiveness.The initiative led to a sizeable decline in property offences like theft and burglary and recovery of stolen property.A study on the impact of CCTV surveillance on crime in the BBN area also revealed how the crime scene had transformed following the installation of CCTV cameras in 2019. As many as 1,306 CCTV cameras were installed by the police during this period.“A decrease of 37 per cent was registered in 2020 in the theft and burglary cases vis-à-vis 2018. While the decrease was 19 per cent in 2019, the recovery percentage, which stood at a mere 21.84 per cent in 2018, increased to 73.67 per cent in 2019 and 77.1 per cent in 2020. A majority of it was owing to the presence of CCTV cameras,” said Rohit Malpani, SP, State Cyber Crime, who had implemented the project during his tenure at Baddi.As many as 88 cases of theft and burglaries were registered in 2017. This number rose to 126 in 2018 and dipped partially to 103 in 2019 and to a mere 79 in 2020. The number of unsolved cases which stood at 49 in 2017, 71 in 2018 declined to 36 in 2019 and 34 in 2020.A majority of these offences were registered in Nalagarh residential area which is flanked by a network of CCTV cameras.The Nalagarh police station (PS) had the highest average crime per lakh population figure of 59.8 per cent in 2019-2020.Cameras were found most effective in solving cattle and mobile theft cases and burglary-related offences with 100 per cent success rate, followed by offences related to cash and jewellery theft that accounted for 83 per cent success. As many as 74 per cent of the vehicle theft cases and 64 per cent of industrial material theft cases were solved with the help of CCTV cameras.Out of the 112 cases settled in 2019 and 2020, 81 were solved with the help of CCTV cameras. Out of the total recovery of Rs 2.72 crore made in two years, the lion’s share of Rs 2.41 crore was recovered with the help of these cameras. Select policemen were trained to handle CCTV cameras in a specially set up control room.The percentage of crime hotspots also declined from 79 per cent in 2018 to 55 per cent in 2020 in Baddi and Nalagarh though the Nalagarh rural area bordering Ropar district of Punjab developed as a new hotspot in 2019.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-pradesh-police-bag-silver-award-in-e-governance-350342
