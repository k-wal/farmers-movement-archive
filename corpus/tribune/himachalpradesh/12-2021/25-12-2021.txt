The project would generate 386 Million units of electricity per annum which will generate annual revenue of about Rs 120 crore to the state, a spokesperson of the state government said here today.The Prime Minister would lay the foundation stone of Shri Renuka ji Dam project, a national project conceived as a storage project of Rs 6,700 crore on Giri river in Sirmaur. The project would generate 200 Million units of energy in a surface power house with 40 MW installed capacity which would be utilised by the state.The live storage of the dam would be 498 Million Cubic Metres, which would fulfill about 40 per cent of the drinking water requirement of Delhi.Modi would lay the foundation stone of 66 MW Dhaulasidh Hydro Electric Project, which would be constructed with an expenditure of Rs 688 crore. The project is located on river Beas in Hamirpur and Kangra districts.He would also lay the foundation stone of 210 MW Luhri Hydro Electric Project stage-I to be completed with an expenditure of Rs 1811 crore, a joint venture between Government of India and Government of Himachal Pradesh. The project is located on Sutlej in Shimla and Kullu districts.The power generated from these projects would help in providing grid stability and improving the power supply position, besides adding valuable renewable energy to the grid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/pm-modi-to-dedicate-lay-stones-of-projects-of-rs-11-281-crore-in-himachal-on-december-27-354373

The phenomena of decline in the total area under glaciers could adversely impact power generation.The latest data compiled by the State Centre on Climate Change in the HP Council for Science, Technology and Environment has revealed that the total area under glaciers is shrinking. It is the Beas basin which has experienced the maximum decline of 14.33 per cent in the total area under glaciers between 2001 and 2018 followed by 8.87 per cent in the Chandra basin.“Data compiled from satellite imagery of the major river basins in Himachal clearly indicates that there is a continuous retreading trend in the total area under glaciers betwten 2001 and 2018,” revealed Dr SS Randhawa, Principal Scientific Officer, State Centre on Climate Change. He added that there was also a decline in the area under snow in Himachal Pradesh over the last few years.The hydro-power sector remains one of the main revenue generating sectors in Himachal as the state has a potential of 27,000 MW in the five major river basins. The phenomena of decline in the total area under glaciers could adversely impact power generation as the highest generation takes place in the summers when there is accelerated melting due to high temperatures.In order to minimise the scope of error, the data compilation included very minute examination of the reduction in area under glaciers in the Spiti, Baspa and Pin basins. A comparison of the satellite images taken in 2001, 2006, 2016 and 2018 was undertaken to arrive at the overall decline in sq kms.Based on a 2019 study, the Satluj basin has the highest 562 lakes, Chenab basin 242 lakes, Beas basin 93 lakes and Ravi basin 37 lakes. The previous year studies had already indicated the phenomena of increase in the number of glacial lakes which could pose a potential threat to the downstream areas, inhabited by population all along the rivers.The most worrisome area remains the Karcham and Nathpa region in the Satluj river basin in Kinnaur district. There has been considerable concern over this aspect especially against the backdrop of the catastrophe in Chamoli in Uttarakhand. Some of the largest hydro-power projectrs including the 1500 MW Nathpa Jhakri, 1000 MW Karcham Wangtoo and 300 MW Baspa projects are located in the Baspa-Satluj basin, which is considered to be most vulnerable.The council has undertaken detailed study of the Geepang Lake in Lahaul Spiti district to identify the potential locations which could be susceptible to damage in case the lake bursts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/decline-in-area-under-glaciers-in-5-river-basins-354192

Hoteliers in the region are blaming the police for the “poor” traffic management.Parking pangsAshwani Bamba, president of the Upper Dharamsala Hotel and Restaurant Association, said, “Yesterday evening, there was no cop managing the traffic on the main square of Mcleodganj, resulting in a traffic jam for over an hour. We have requested police officials to deploy adequate number of cops for traffic management in Mcleodganj area.”Sources say the police are resorting to allowing only one-side traffic at a time in Mcleodganj, but this is not working as more traffic jams are being witnessed. Hoteliers say allowing only one side of traffic at a time is not a solution. “No parking should be ensured along the road. Encroachments by shopkeepers on narrow roads should be removed,” they say.Parking by locals along Dharamkot road is the key reason for traffic woes. The scene is no different on the Bhagsu road. Residents also want no entry for buses and mini buses on the Mcleodganj road. They say heavy vehicles should be allowed only till Dharamsala and tourists should take up further journey in small vehicles.There was a proposal to create a multilevel parking near the Dalai Lama temple under the Smart City scheme. However, the work is yet to start. A multilevel parking plan was there for Bhagsunag, but the land on which it was to be constructed turned out to be forest land on revenue papers. There is no standing tree on the land. It has been concretised for parking for long.

The system was being developed by district administration Kangra and geological experts of IIT Mandi. Deputy Commissioner Kangra, Nipun Jindal, while talking to The Tribune, said that Dharamsala and Kangra regions were badly affected by the landslides. Over the years, human and tectonic activities have contributed to an increase in slope failures in the Himalayan region because of the expansion of human settlement on very fragile and highly fractured bedrock overlain by thick alluvial cover.Suffered huge damageDharamsala and Kangra had experienced many damaging landslides and rock falls which have damaged roads, houses and communication network since 1968, he said.He further said that a landslide occurred in 2013 near Tirah Line locality of Dharamsala cantonment area, district and damaged more than 25 houses completely. This landslide occurred after continuous heavy to very heavy rainfall for four days.Another Landslide at Boh village in 2021 claimed 10 human lives. Factors involved in the slide were steep slope, continuous infiltration of water soak pits (sewage system) located up slopes, continuous heavy to very heavy rainfall and toe erosion by local drainage. In this regard a landslide monitoring and early warning system will helpful to save human lives and properties, he said.Jindal said that the main goal of this proposal is development and evaluation of a low-cost Landslide Monitoring Solution. In the first phase, the project would include identification of 10 most vulnerable landslide sites in the district. Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) and Learning Management Systems (LMS) that would be developed locally would be installed at the selected sites.The Learning Management Systems would then be tested on the selected sites. The project would involve development of thresholding and machine learning algorithms for monitoring landslides and predicting probability of landslide occurrence ahead of time. The evaluation of developed algorithms on Learning Management Systems and dissemination of information among different stake holders via alerts would be the next generation of the project, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/kangra-district-to-have-landslip-warning-system-354204

The phenomena of decline in the total area under glaciers could adversely impact power generation.The latest data compiled by the State Centre on Climate Change in the HP Council for Science, Technology and Environment has revealed that the total area under glaciers is shrinking. It is the Beas basin which has experienced the maximum decline of 14.33 per cent in the total area under glaciers between 2001 and 2018 followed by 8.87 per cent in the Chandra basin.“Data compiled from satellite imagery of the major river basins in Himachal clearly indicates that there is a continuous retreading trend in the total area under glaciers betwten 2001 and 2018,” revealed Dr SS Randhawa, Principal Scientific Officer, State Centre on Climate Change. He added that there was also a decline in the area under snow in Himachal Pradesh over the last few years.The hydro-power sector remains one of the main revenue generating sectors in Himachal as the state has a potential of 27,000 MW in the five major river basins. The phenomena of decline in the total area under glaciers could adversely impact power generation as the highest generation takes place in the summers when there is accelerated melting due to high temperatures.In order to minimise the scope of error, the data compilation included very minute examination of the reduction in area under glaciers in the Spiti, Baspa and Pin basins. A comparison of the satellite images taken in 2001, 2006, 2016 and 2018 was undertaken to arrive at the overall decline in sq kms.Based on a 2019 study, the Satluj basin has the highest 562 lakes, Chenab basin 242 lakes, Beas basin 93 lakes and Ravi basin 37 lakes. The previous year studies had already indicated the phenomena of increase in the number of glacial lakes which could pose a potential threat to the downstream areas, inhabited by population all along the rivers.The most worrisome area remains the Karcham and Nathpa region in the Satluj river basin in Kinnaur district. There has been considerable concern over this aspect especially against the backdrop of the catastrophe in Chamoli in Uttarakhand. Some of the largest hydro-power projectrs including the 1500 MW Nathpa Jhakri, 1000 MW Karcham Wangtoo and 300 MW Baspa projects are located in the Baspa-Satluj basin, which is considered to be most vulnerable.The council has undertaken detailed study of the Geepang Lake in Lahaul Spiti district to identify the potential locations which could be susceptible to damage in case the lake bursts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/decline-in-area-under-glaciers-in-5-river-basins-354192
