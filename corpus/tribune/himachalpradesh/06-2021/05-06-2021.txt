Why public money is sought to be wasted is a matter of concern both for people and this court. No government or authority for that matter has the right to say that it will indulge in wasteful expenditure and any attempt to fritter away state resources can definitely be checked by this court, as it is not powerless to prevent such waste and squandering of public funds, as and when questioned”.The court said, “The government and the authorities concerned are only trustees of public funds and, therefore, have an obligation to ensure that the funds are spent in a proper manner and no amount is wasted or frittered away”.The court directed the BSNL to file an affidavit on or before the next date and listed the matter for further hearing on June 22. Looking at the nature of relief, the court impleaded the BSNL through its Chairman-cum-Managing Director (CMD) as a party in the case. Besides, the court also impleaded Airtel, Reliance JIO Infocomm, Vodafone and Idea as parties.The court directed all service providers to ensure that all telecommunication towers were fully operational and functional and file a compliance report in this regard on or before the next date of hearing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/why-pushing-for-outdated-4g-equipment-himachal-pradesh-high-court-asks-bsnl-263671

They should be made aware about the drugs (dose, frequency and timing of intake etc.), infection control practices, modalities and frequency of monitoring.As a result, the condition of a Covid patient starts deteriorating without regular treatment. The State Clinical Team in its death audit of Covid patients discovered that the fear of a long quarantine also prevents people from getting a test done. “All these factors put together result in delayed presentation of Covid patients at the health care facilities,” said a health official.It has been recommended that all Covid patients under home isolation and more so those having comorbidities should remain under medical supervision so as to enable early identification of the red flag signs. This will help the patient in seeking timely safe referral to higher health facility which will help bring down mortality.Based on the findings of the data audit, henceforth comorbid patients shall be admitted to dedicated Covid care centre (controlled comorbidities) and dedicated Covid health centre (uncontrolled comorbidities) with intense monitoring and early recognition of a dip in oxygen saturation and/or breathing problems.“To avoid exposure of comorbid patients during their routine hospital visits, it is advised that the comorbid and aged population should use the services of tele-consultation through e-sanjeevani OPD,” said Nipun Jindal, Director, NHM. If such patients come to hospitals they should be prescribed medicines for underlying comorbidities for at least three months.The medical experts have concluded that all comorbid Covid patients, who insist on home isolation, should monitor their medical parameters frequently.Directions have been issued to address the delayed presentation of Covid patients to the health care facilities.
