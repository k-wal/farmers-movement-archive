Around 500 garbage collectors and supervisors have threatened to stop work and put in their papers.“We will not collect garbage from tomorrow (Thursday). The Municipal Corporation has been forcing us to recover the pending garbage bills. When we objected to it, some officials misbehaved with us,” said Jaswant Singh, president of the Saheb Karamchari Union.Mayor owes Rs1 lakh as fee, alleges unionSaheb Karamchari Union president Jaswant Singh has alleged that Mayor Satya Kaundal owes around Rs 1 lakh as garbage fee to the MC. “If top officials of the MC don’t pay, how can you expect the common man to pay?” he questioned. The Mayor, on the other hand, said the charge was “false and malicious”. “If my tenants have not paid their garbage fee, how am I responsible for that?” said the Mayor. “It was their duty to issue notices to my tenants if they were not paying the fee. Why did they not send a notice to them and cut their water and electricity connection?” the Mayor questioned.MC joint commissioner Ajit Bhardwaj said only 15,000 out of 65,000 households had been paying garbage fee. The rest have not been paying it for one or the other reason from many months, he said. “As a result, the pending amount has risen to over Rs 10 crore. When all our attempts failed to recover the pending amount, we asked the karamchari union to collect it from people but they are objecting to it,” said Bhardwaj. “The salary and other expenses of saheb workers are met by the money we collect as garbage fee. So it is of utmost importance that we collect the outstanding dues,” Bhardwaj said.He said the MC had introduced online payment of bills sometime back. “People can pay over the counter and at Lok Mitra Kendras too. However, as the outstanding amount has risen so much, we need to collect it door to door immediately. Supervisors were appointed specifically for this purpose,” said Bhardwaj.The Saheb Karamchari Union, however, doesn’t want to collect the pending bill amounts. “If we start collecting door to door, people who are paying online will also stop doing so. Ever since the online mode of payment started, our per-month collection has risen to around Rs 1 crore from around Rs 50 lakh. If we go back to the offline mode, we fear that the overall collection will reduce and the MC will struggle to pay even our salaries,” said Jaswant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/threat-to-stop-door-to-door-garbage-collection-in-shimla-262541

The fear of banks declaring loan accounts as NPAs is haunting those who had taken loans to meet their expenses.A large number of hotels in Shimla, Dharamsala and Manali are on sale as owners are under huge debts. The situation is so bad that many taxi owners, who had taken vehicles on loans, are desperately looking for buyers to dispose these of. With no income for the second consecutive season, they are unable to pay their EMIs and the banks have started issuing them notices.“Since only 25 per cent of the summer season remains, we urge the Chief Minister to lift the restrictions, especially the condition of an e-pass and negative RT-PCR report, to enter the state, so that tourists can visit without hassles,” said Mohinder Seth, president of the Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association.Stakeholders are facing financial hardships, firstly because their working capital has exhausted and, secondly, the tourism has come to a grinding halt since March 2021.The hoteliers explain that the RBI has brought the emergency credit line guarantee scheme 3.0 to provide relief to tourism, hospitality and travel sectors but most stakeholders could not take the benefit of the scheme due to its stringent conditions.“The biggest hurdle in the scheme is that the cut-off date of the outstanding balance of loan is taken as on February 29, 2020, along with the condition that the account should not have default of more than 60 days as on February 2020, which is unreasonable,” says Seth.He explains that a majority of tourism units were compelled to take fresh loans to meet their expenses because no help had been extended to the industry by the government since last year.“The RBI needs to make amendments by extending the cut-off date to March 31, 2021, and to relax the condition of a number of days of default of EMIs,” he demands.All those associated with the tourism industry are now pleading thatsince the graph of Covid cases has flattened, the time is appropriate for lifting restrictions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-tourism-industry-under-debt-wants-curbs-lifted-262552

Over 1,350 persons have signed the online petition asking the government to promote cycling as a mode of transport during the pandemic.“The World Health Organisation has recommended the use of cycling as an activity and as a mode of transport to fight the pandemic. Cities across the world are putting efforts to promote the concept and such a model can be very useful for towns like Shimla,” said an active cyclist Ashish, who took the initiative.The public transport has not been started yet in the curfew and cycling promotes social and physical distancing, improves physical health and immunity and makes covering long distances easy as compared to walking, he said.“In 2012, the Shimla Municipal Corporation had given a proposal to give allowance and incentive to people commuting to office on bicycles, create infrastructure and deploy bicycle officer for monitoring and the then Chief Minister PK Dhumal had liked the idea but then the government changed,” said former Deputy Mayor of SMC Tikender Panwar.The Covid-19 restrictions have rendered people without any access to public transport that poses a risk of transmission and cycling is the best option as far as economics is concerned, said another cyclist Akshit Gaur.The petition was started on change.org and it has been shared more than 550 times and received over 4,470 views. Cycling enthusiasts have shot a letter to the Mayor of the Shimla MC and the CM’s office.The letter states, “We, as collective citizens of Shimla including elected representatives, non-profit organisations, entrepreneurs, business and members of cycling associations urge the administration to promote cycling as the preferred mode of transport in Shimla as even cities like New York, London, Paris are giving a thrust to using cycles as a mode of transport.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/online-petition-to-promote-cycling-262558

Despite this, the owners have not vacated them and their possession could not be granted to the National Highways Authority of India,” informed SDM Solan, Ajay Yadav.The high court has also ordered disconnection of water and electricity supplies to such premises while deciding a writ petition in November 2020 and in March 2021 on this issue, informed Yadav.The officials of Jal Shakti Vibhag and HP State Electricity Board Limited have been directed to file an action taken report before the SDM after disconnecting the power and water supply at the earliest.Several such buildings continued to be in use by the owners though some had been partially dismantled and had become vulnerable. They are located all over the highway from Parwanoo to Chambaghat at Datyar, Koti, Gahi, Mangoti, Sanwara, Mando Matkanda, Dharampur Bathol, Dhar-ki-Bher, Sihari Chamara, Kheel Jashli, Himmatpur Dabli, Badhaoni, Khali, Bara, Barog, Anji, Rabaun, Saproon, Kathed and Basal Patti villages.The maximum of 18 such buildings were located at Basal Patti, six in Kathed, 10 in Saproon, three in Rabaun, four in Anji, five in Dharampur, among other places. The owners of these buildings continued to use these buildings as these areas were hub of commercial activities and renting these buildings fetched them monetary returns.The SDM said that a meeting would be held with the officials of the National Highways Authority of India tomorrow to plan the demolition campaign which will begin from Chambaghat. Out of the about 350 structures which were acquired from Parwanoo-Chambaghat on the NH-05, about 250 have been demolished.Since about 95 per cent of the four-laning work from Parwanoo to Chambaghat has been completed, the NHAI has been demanding possession of all 75 buildings. They are supposed to be demolished as they have become vulnerable owing to the widening of the road and endanger lives.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/power-supply-to-buildings-along-parwanoo-nh-to-be-cut-262581

The committee had found that the VCs of eight private universities were ineligible for the post and were later removed.“I have been informed that after removing ineligible VCs, some universities created the posts of Pro-Chancellor and made them officiating Vice-Chancellors, which is not valid,” said Major Gen Atul Kaushik (retd), Chairman of the HPPIERC. He added that recoveries would be sought if private universities had made invalid appointments.“The commission has been lenient due to the ongoing Covid pandemic but the officiating VCs cannot continue beyond three months. Of the eight universities only three – Arni University, Baddi University and Chitkara University — have appointed VCs. We have asked the universities to appoint VCs and submit the details regarding their biodata, educational qualifications, and experience with the process of appointment by June 30,” he told The Tribune.“When directions were issued to remove ineligible VCs, the university managements designated them as Pro-Chancellors or gave them other appointments. Now, these persons are again acting as Officiating Vice-Chancellors. Therefore, strict action is needed against these institutions, as they have bluffed the UGC as well as the HPPERC,” said RTI activist Rohit Bhagwat.The universities had also been told to pay salaries to the staff and non-compliance of the orders would call for legal action, Kaushik cautioned. Complaints about private colleges not paying salaries to their staff had been received and all private educational institutions would be directed to pay salaries to the staff, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/pro-chancellor-cant-work-as-vc-educational-panel-262610

The need of the hour is to provide adequate bandwidth, network-attached storage and routers, etc to facilitate the conduct of educational courses, conferences, court proceedings, etc on virtual platform.”During the course of hearing, it was informed to the court that the Union Ministry of Home Affairs had issued a communication to state governments on September 7, 2020, informing that Bharat Net was a project to create network to connect all gram panchayats (GPs) by broadband. The project aimed to provide affordable broadband services to citizens and institutions in rural and remote areas in partnership with states and the private sector towards realisation of the vision of Digital India.It was also mentioned in the communication that the Bharat Net project was being implemented by the Government of India for providing the high-speed broadband connectivity to all GPs.

Former local MLA and Kangra district Congress president Ajay Mahajan, who is the son of late Sat Mahajan, accompanied these water tankers and facilitated distribution of water among the villagers through activists of the local Block Congress Committee. On this occasion, he accused the government of being apathetic in addressing the piped water problem being faced in the panchayat, which had forced residents to consume “contaminated” water of an open well. He alleged people of the whole Nurpur Assembly constituency were facing water scarcity but the Jal Shakti Department seemed to be dormant about addressing the problem.He alleged that the state government had shelved a number of drinking water and lift irrigation schemes sanctioned during the previous Virbhadra Singh regime. “It is surprising that the state government and local MLA, who is also a minister, are silent over the burgeoning water crisis in the area. The government has also banned installation of new hand pumps and no repair or maintenance of existing defunct hand pumps is being undertaken in the state,” he lamented.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/nurpur-ex-mlas-trust-comes-to-aid-of-villagers-facing-water-crisis-262614
