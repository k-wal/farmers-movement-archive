||SPCB slammed for inaction on water pollution in Baddi||Tribune News Service Solan, June 28 Violations of water pollution are continuing in Baddi and mere stay of order of closure and assessment of compensation for the past violations does not justify inaction for further violations.  Coming down heavily on the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) for lack of action on violators of water pollution, the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal made this observation on June 23 in a case pertaining to pollution in Balad river on account of leakage from the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP).  “Merely keeping an eye on units discharging more than 200 kilo litres per day (KLD) effluents is not enough and violations by those discharging less than 200 KLD effluents is no less serious or less harmful for the environment and public health,” observed the Tribunal. A four-member joint committee comprising a representative of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Central Pollution Control Board, SPCB and District Magistrate has been directed to file a status report of compliance after inspecting the erring units.  The NGT has expressed serious concern over the fact that the four textile units of Baddi are still not meeting the water pollution norms and the fixed dissolved solids (FDS) released by them were beyond the prescribed limits.  These units - Auro Textile, Auro Textile unit-II, Auro Dyeing of Vardhman Textile and Winsome Textile - were yet to install advance treatment systems for treating the FDS which was a category-IV effluent comprising concentrated dyes.  The pipeline carrying these effluents was found non-functional and choked as they carried concentrated effluents from these units to the CETP for treatment. Not only this, a major portion of this effluent got mixed with category 1 effluent and could not be treated appropriately in the plant.  Further, as per an interim report submitted by the SPCB on May 6, the level of fixed dissolved solids (FDS) in the CETP was found to be 2364 mg/litre which was not within the prescribed limits. This was, however, reduced in two subsequent samplings thus showing improvement. The SPCB had identified 16 industries having effluent generation of more than 200 KLD. In the latest sampling conducted on May 21, three such industries -Proctor & Gamble Home Products, Torrent Pharmaceutical and Abbott Healthcare - were, however, were found having effluents above the prescribed limits for which they were issued notices by the SPCB on June 16. The samples of other units were found within the prescribed limits.  The NGT has directed the SPCB to take remedial action to enforce environmental rule of law.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/spcb-slammed-for-inaction-on-water-pollution-in-baddi-275364

A large number of Congress workers gathered in front of the Gandhi Bhawan and started the protest march. Potraying unity, senior party leaders Kaul Singh Thakur, Rangeela Ram Rao, Prakash Chaudhari and Sohan Lal shared a common stage to vent out their ire at the BJP. The Congress leaders said that during the BJP regime in the state and at the Centre, the prices of essential commodities have increased manifold, making the life of common people difficult.  Rathore said that “Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur-led state government has failed on all fronts. During the BJP regime in the state, inflation has touched new heights, affecting the life of common people badly. Petrol and diesel prices and cooking gas are now beyond the reach of common people. Survival for poor people is getting tough”. He said that the Chief Minister was keen to conduct byelections to two Vidhan Sabha seats and  one Lok Sabha seat in Himachal despite the threat of the expected third wave of the pandemic.  He said that due to poor preparations of the state government to control the spread of the pandemic, a large number of people lost their lives due to the second wave. Now, despite the threat of the third wave the government seemed reluctant to ensure advance preparations to ensure the safety of common people. Rathore said that the Jal Shakti Minister was violating the Covid norms frequently.

According to an estimate, 2.57 lakh vehicles have entered the state within a fortnight.Even as locals fumed with the usual traffic congestion, hoteliers couldn’t have been more happy with an average of over 18,000 vehicles entering the state daily. With the hospitality sector taking a severe beating in the last 15 months, most hotels, guest houses and homestays are witnessing high occupancy, much to their delight.According to the police, while 1.31 lakh vehicles entered Himachal between June 13 and June 20, the number remained almost same at 1.25 lakh between June 20 and June 27. The sudden surge of visitors was witnessed as the government has lifted the condition of getting the mandatory RT PCR report and later the e-registration on the cowin portal.“Much to our relief, the tourism sector seems to be looking up as we are getting very good occupancy. On weekends, most properties are full to capacity,” said Sanjay Sood, a local hotelier.Echoing similar sentiments, Anil Walia, who owns a resort in Mashobra, said suddenly the state had come alive with tourists arriving from every nook and corner of the country, knocking at the doors of every hotel, guest house and homestay, be it Shimla, Manali, Dharamsala, Kinnaur, Lahaul Spiti or Dalhousie.The beleaguered hotel industry had virtually been pushed to the brink with most gasping for survival. Having remained closed for more than a year, most feel that looking towards the government for financial help was futile. “We have to learn to run the business by the new normal, where a guest feels safe and secure amid Covid times as maintaining high levels of hygiene and cleanliness become priority number one ,” admitted a hotelier.With the new concept of “work from the hills” catching up, many professionals are re-locating to the quaint villages in places like a remote Manali village or a hut in Dharamkot in McLeodganj. It is the rural populace which is benefiting as these professionals only want a serene setting in the laps of nature, eating the local food with no fancy cuisine, gadgets or rooms.No curbs now||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/hotels-in-himachal-abuzz-with-tourists-locals-fume-275381
