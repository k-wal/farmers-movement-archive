Additional police teams have been deputed to check such incidents. The team entrusted with patrolling the area and the investigating officer deputed at night failed to attend to the resident’s complaint on time. They have been suspended.

Siltation, weed infestation, faulty flushing mechanism, indiscriminate grazing and subsequent soil erosion have contributed to the problem.Being a major tourist attraction, Khajjiar lake near Dalhousie attracts tourists from across the country and abroad. However, the very existence of the lake has been threatened due to silt and weeds which had not only resulted in its shrinking but it has become shallow.“Our endeavour is to restore the lost glory of the Khajjiar lake by removing the slit and weeds while ensuring there is no ecological damage to the lake,” asserts Archana Sharma, Principal Chief Conservator Forest (PCCF), Wildlife. She visited the lake site at Khajjiar yesterday to oversee the work being undertaken at the site.The WII, in its report, advised taking up the restoration work in stages involving de-siltation, de-weeding, reducing influx of nutrient and floating debris, maintenance of water level, management of the meadow and comprehensive ecological assessment to frame management plan.“The fact that most of the de-silting has to be done manually and not through machines makes the task even more arduous. We cannot undertake scrapping as the lake has natural undulations that provide habitat complexity,” explained Sharma.The forest officials engaged in the work point out that the disposal of the dredge material in an environment friendly manner is being undertaken painstakingly so as to ensure that there is no damage to the lake.The WII has recommended that the de-weeding be carried out before the onset of monsoon and after the migratory season for the wetland birds. It has also been recommended that a fine iron screen be installed at strategic locations in the inlet points of the lake to prevent flow of organic degradable material from the surrounding area.With a sizeable number of locals being dependent on tourism for their livelihood, the taking up of the restoration work has brought cheers to the villagers. They feel that minus the lake, Khajjiar would lose its charm and with no other alternative livelihood, they would face economic crisis. Khajjiar Lake is wetland of national importance situated in the Khajjiar- Kalatop Wildlife Sanctuary and is popularly referred to as Mini Switzerland. It is inhabited by several fish species and 77 bird species.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/desiltation-of-khajjiar-lake-begins-271765

Owing to its proximity to the plains, Kasauli is the most preferred hill station among the tourists who usually spend a day strolling on the famous Mall Road and return back refreshed.No rush on weekdaysIt is strange that when the tourists visit Kasauli at the weekends we are unable to open shops and when we opened the units during the weekdays there were fewer tourists. A traderRajiv Kumar, a Chandigarh resident, said, “My family was looking forward for this weekend trip to Kasauli but the closed markets have left us disappointed. Taking a break from the hustle and bustle of cities, Kasauli provides a pleasant respite but with the markets closed the usual charm was missing.”The tourists, who were seen strolling on the Mall Road, found little to munch. The children and elderly were particularly inconvenienced as tourists had to go to hotels in and around the town for lunch. Tourists also missed the much-savoured street food of this quaint hill town which is served by various shops on the Mall Road.With shops selling souvenirs too being closed, the tourists were deprived of the opportunity to shop for the locally made gifts.In view of the pandemic, some hotels were particularly careful in not allowing walk in guests for lunch further disappointing the visitors. “Though 10 to 15 walk-in guests usually turn up for lunch during the weekends we stopped it in view of the pandemic and only in-house guests were given lunch,” informed manager of a hotel.Even traders in Kasauli who were keenly awaiting the tourists are disappointed. Aman Gupta, a trader said, “It is strange that when the tourists visit Kasauli at the weekends we are unable to open our shops and when we open our shops in the weekdays there were fewer tourists. The state government should consider opening the shops during the weekends, may be for a limited duration, as business has suffered a lot since April.”Police staff was specially deputed to man traffic at Garkhal junction where five roads converge. Being the key road connecting Kasauli, little traffic was visible after lunch time because tourists preferred to head back in the afternoon as the markets wore a deserted look.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/shut-markets-greet-tourists-in-himachals-kasauli-271764

In the lockdown and lack of business, many such joint owners had vacated the premises.Ashwani Bamba, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Dharamsala, said most tourists preferred homestays on the outskirts of towns. Since most homestays do not offer food, many tourists were seen looking for food as the markets were still closed on weekends.As tourists thronged many areas today, locals alleged that the social distancing or wearing of masks was ignored.Sanjeev Gandhi, a hotelier, said a large number of tourists did not wear masks.

The hospital, along with the zonal hospital, Dharamsala, was denotified as dedicated Covid hospital, a couple of days back.Apart from treating non-Covid patients, facilities such as issuance of disability certificates, medical/fitness certificates, etc, will also resume. All these services were shifted to Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, when the hospital was notified as Covid centre on April 18.Arrangements for third waveEven as the hospital is shifting its focus on non-Covid patients, it is making parallel preparations for the anticipated third waveWith the wave likely to affect children more, the hospital has prepared a proposal to set up five ventilator-supported ICU beds and 20 oxygen-supported ICU beds“All Covid patients have been discharged. The hospital has been sanitised and we are all set to resume the OPD services from tomorrow,” said DDU MS Dr Ravinder Mokta. For the record, as many as 677 Covid patients were admitted to the hospital after April 18, he said. “We had a recovery rate of around 94 per cent, with 37 deaths,” said Dr Mokta.In normal times, the hospital witnesses a footfall of 1,200 to 1,500 patients every day from Shimla, Kinnaur and Solan. “The hospital, especially the ortho department, sees a lot of patients. The resumption of the OPD facility will be a relief to all patients this hospital caters to,” said Inderjeet Singh, councillor of the area.Even as the hospital is shifting its focus on non-Covid patients, it is making parallel preparations for the anticipated third wave. With the wave likely to affect children more, the hospital has prepared a proposal to set up five ventilator-supported ICU beds and 20 oxygen-supported ICU beds. “We have already submitted the demand of ventilators for children,” said Dr Mokta.Also, discussions to enhance the capacity of the oxygen plant set up at the hospital are on. “The current capacity of the PSA plant is 300 litres per minute. The discussions are on to enhance it,” said Dr Mokta. The enhancement in capacity would reduce the dependence of the hospital on cylinders to a large extent. “Also, a CT-scan machine is being set up on PPP mode at the hospital,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/relief-as-ddu-hospital-opd-resumes-today-in-shimla-271761
