Also there is no move by Colombo to green-light an Indo-Japanese port project that New Delhi wants to project as a modest Indian answer to the Chinese-built Hamabantota port.A December 30 virtual meeting of the joint working group on fisheries did not lead to a breakthrough in the release of 36 Tamil fishermen held by Sri Lanka.Jaishankar is scheduled to hold discussions with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena.Interestingly, Sri Lanka, like many of India’s SAARC colleagues, has avoided getting caught in making a binary choice between New Delhi and Beijing. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit to Colombo failed to get Sri Lanka interested in the Quad’s concept of the Indo-Pacific. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had told Pompeo publicly that his country “will maintain a neutral stand in foreign policy and will not get entangled in struggles between power blocs”.As an alternative, India is pursuing a trilateral neighbourhood maritime domain awareness project with Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India revived this UPA-era format with NSA Ajit Doval traveling to Sri Lanka in November last year for a trilateral meeting on maritime security and exchange of information.Besides taking up the release of Tamil fishermen arrested last month during the visit, Jaishankar he would be exploring the prospects of the $ 500 million India-Japan East Container Terminal (ECT) development project at Colombo Port.South Block has been interacting with the Rajapaksas through frequent high level exchanges besides posting Gopal Bagley from the Prime Minister’s Office as the Indian High Commissioner in February last year. At a webinar in October last year, Bagley had underlined the importance of the Colombo port project by suggesting that getting it off the ground could be the best way to deepen the India-Sri Lanka ties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankars-sri-lanka-visit-to-give-impetus-to-bilateral-ties-193627
04-01-2021||New Delhi||Experts question govt's claim of Covaxin efficacy against new coronavirus strains||Some healthcare experts Monday questioned the government's assertion that Bharat Biotech's COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin can target mutated coronavirus strains and maybe used as a "backup", as they asked for the scientific basis for the claim and for the vaccine's safety and efficacy.The country's drugs regulator Sunday granted emergency use approval to Oxford-AstraZeneca's Covishield and also to indigenously developed Covaxin even though not enough data on the latter's efficacy and safety was available, which triggered a debate. Noted virologist Shahid Jameel said he does believe that eventually Covaxin would turn out to be safe and show more than 70 per cent efficacy."I say this based on the platform, which is widely used and Bharat Biotech's own track record of successfully making inactivated viral vaccines," he said. He also said his concerns are based on the processes adopted for approving the vaccine and also on the utterances of people in responsible positions. "If approval requires both safety and efficacy data for a representative population, phase 2 safety and immunogenicity do not fulfill that criteria," he said. "That is why we conduct a phase 3. It is the closest you get to a population. Where is that data? Vaccines are not drugs. They are given to healthy people. They are prevention not a treatment. Both safety and efficacy is required," he said.He also questioned what approval for a "backup" meant."Does this mean that if needed, a vaccine of unproven efficacy would be used?" He said the biggest concern is that "sidestepping" processes and poor/complex communication will fuel vaccine hesitancy in India. "There is already evidence of that on account of fast tracked development timescales. Our country has one of the finest immunisation programmes. It will also undermine the global value of India's vaccine industry, which is first rate by any measure," he said.Indian Council of Medical Research Director General Dr Balram Bhargava had Sunday said Covaxin is based on an inactivated whole virus, having potential to target mutated coronavirus strains including the UK-variant, and it was a major reason for giving it a conditional nod.He, however, had also said no clear data regarding the efficacy of the vaccine is available so far."The data generated so far demonstrates a strong immune response (both antibody as well as T cell) and in-vitro viral neutralisation. The ongoing clinical trial is the largest trial on 25,800 subjects, in which 23,000 volunteers have already been enrolled including subjects with comorbid conditions, and the vaccine has demonstrated safety till date," Bhargava has said. All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria Monday said Bharat Biotech's vaccine has been given approval only in emergency situations as a backup."If there is a surge in cases then we may need larger doses of vaccine then we may go with Bharat Biotech's vaccine. The Bharat Biotech vaccine is more of a backup," he said. He also rejected claims of fast-tracking the process."None of the clinical trials was fast tracked in terms of safety and efficacy. Fast tracking was done in taking regulatory approval which generally takes a long time while going from one phase to the other," he said.All India Drugs Action Network (AIDAN) also questioned the claim that Covaxin can work better against the UK strain of the virus which is more transmissible."It is not clear if there is any scientific basis to claim that Covaxin will be effective in the context of infection by mutant strains when its efficacy has not been established and is currently unknown against any strain of the virus," the AIDAN said. "The claim being propagated that the whole virion inactivated vaccine is likely to be effective against mutations of the virus is not being supported by any efficacy from the trial because no data has been generated as yet in the Phase 3 trial," AIDAN said in a statement. A political battle has also ensued over approval to Covaxin.Some Congress leaders, including Anand Sharma, Shashi Tharoor and Jairam Ramesh, on Sunday raised serious concerns over the green signal to the, saying it is "premature" and can prove dangerous.The BJP, in response, hit out at the Congress with party president J P Nadda alleging that whenever India achieves something commendable the opposition party comes up with “wild theories” to “ridicule” the accomplishments. ---  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-question-govts-claim-of-covaxin-efficacy-against-new-coronavirus-strains-193625

04-01-2021||New Delhi||SC verdict on pleas against Central Vista Project on Tuesday||The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce its verdict on a batch of pleas, which have questioned several aspects including the environmental clearance granted to ambitious Central Vista Project, on Tuesday. The Central Vista revamp, announced in September 2019, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is to be constructed by August 2022, when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024 under the project against which various pleas have been filed.A Bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna will pronounce the verdict on the batch of pleas on which it had reserved its verdict on November 5, last year.On December 7, last year the top court had allowed the Centre to proceed with the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Central Vista Project on December 10 after the government assured it that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court decides the pending pleas on the issue.Centre had told the Bench that there would be only foundation stone-laying ceremony, and no construction, demolition or felling of trees would be done for the project as of now.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone on December 10, last year, for the new Parliament building and the construction is expected to be completed by 2022 at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had said on December 5, last year.The apex court had earlier said that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the Central Vista Project would be "at their own risk".It had made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.On November 5, the apex court had reserved its verdict on a batch of pleas which have raised questions over the Centre's ambitious Central Vista Project, which covers 3 km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi.The Centre had earlier argued in the top court that the project would "save money" which was paid as rent for housing Central government ministries in the national capital.It had submitted that the decision to have a new Parliament building had not been taken in haste and no law or norms had been violated in any manner for the project.The Centre had also said there was no arbitrariness or favouritism in selecting consultant for the project and the argument that the government could have adopted a better process could not be a ground to scrap the project.Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the project to redevelop the Central Vista.The top court is hearing several pleas on the issue, including the one filed by activist Rajeev Suri, against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the nod to change of land use.The pleas have also challenged the grant of a no-objection certificate by the Central Vista Committee (CVC) and also the environmental clearances for the construction of a new Parliament House building.One of the pleas was filed against a Delhi High Court order which had said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista Project.The Division Bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its Single Judge Bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.The stay order of the High Court on the Single Judge Bench's February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.The petitioners before the High Court had opposed the Central Vista Project on the ground that it involved a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building new Parliament and government offices.

04-01-2021||Jaipur||Over 170 more birds found dead in Rajasthan||Over 170 new bird deaths were reported in Rajasthan on Monday, amid an outbreak of bird flu in some parts of the country, officials said.According to the Animal Husbandry department, over 425 deaths of crows, herons and other birds have been reported in the state so far.In Jhalawar, carcass samples sent to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) have confirmed bird flu recently, whereas the death report of birds in other districts is yet to come, they said.“Deaths of over 425 birds, mostly crows, have been reported in parts of the state so far. Bird flu has been confirmed only in Jhalawar. Report of other deaths is yet to come,” the department said.An expert, however, said birds are apparently dying due to cold.Microbiologist and former professor at Rajasthan University of Veterinary Sciences, Dr A K Kataria said that evaluation of death pattern is important in epidemiology and it suggests that deaths have occurred due to “cold shock”.He said though he has not seen the test reports, but pattern of deaths suggest the birds died due to “cold shock as avian influenza has clear symptoms”.Dr Kataria said most of the deaths have been reported in crows and not in poultry birds so far.According to the Animal Husbandry department, 80 deaths were reported in Bikaner on Sunday, 42 in Sawai Madhopur, 12 in Kota, 12 in Baran, 8 each in Pali and Jaipur, six in Dausa, five in Jodhpur and two in Jhalawar.The deaths have been reported in 15 districts of the state. On Saturday, the department officials had said 252 such deaths were reported.In recent days, a bird flu alert has been sounded in Rajasthan, where over 250 crows were found dead in half a dozen districts. Bird flu cases were also confirmed in dead crows in Indore in Madhya Pradesh.An outbreak of bird flu has been reported from some parts of Kottayam and Alappuzha districts in Kerala, prompting authorities to order the culling of ducks, hens, etc in one kilometre radius of the affected areas.Bird flu is a highly infectious and severe respiratory disease in birds caused by the H5N1 influenza virus, which can occasionally infect humans as well.Himachal Pradesh became the fourth state to report cases of the dreaded avian influenza in recent days after migratory birds found dead at Pong Dam Lake in Kangra district tested positive for bird flu.Around 1,800 migratory birds, most of them bar-headed geese, have been found dead in the lake sanctuary so far. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-170-more-birds-found-dead-in-rajasthan-193621
04-01-2021||---||Either you withdraw or we will stay it: SC to Centre on confiscation of animals||New Delhi, January 4Terming the 2017 Rules allowing confiscation of animals of traders/transporters during trial in cases under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act as contrary to the law, the Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to either withdraw or amend them, else it will stay their operation.“Animals are a source of livelihood. We are not talking about pet dogs and cats. People live on the basis of their animals. You can't confiscate them and keep them before the man is convicted. You either withdraw it or we will stay it,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told Additional Solicitor General Jayant K Sud who represented the Centre.The Bench was hearing a petition filed by Buffalo Traders Welfare Association challenging the validity of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Care and Maintenance of Case Property Animals) Rules, 2017 framed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The rules allowed the authorities to seize vehicles used in cattle transportation and send the animals to gaushalas or cow shelters.“We are trying to tell you that the section is very clear that only the person who is convicted can lose the animal. You either amend the rule or we will stay it. We cannot have a situation where the rule is running contrary to the express provision of the Act,” the Bench said as Sud sought to defend the rules, saying they were notified in view of atrocities being committed on animals.The Bench, which has already issued notice to the Centre, posted the matter for further hearing on January 11 after Sud sought time to seek instructions.The petitioners contended they were being forcibly deprived of their cattle which were sent to ‘gaushalas’ under the impugned rules.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/either-you-withdraw-or-we-will-stay-it-sc-to-centre-on-confiscation-of-animals-193617
04-01-2021||Hyderabad||Bharat Biotech hits outs at critics, says carried out ‘200 per cent honest’ trials of corona vaccine||Amid questions raised by industry experts and opposition parties on the emergency approval to its coronavirus vaccine without publication of efficacy data, Bharat Biotech’s chairman on Monday hit out at critics saying his firm had carried out “200 per cent honest clinical trials”.At a media conference, Krishna Ella said his firm has a track record of producing safe and efficacious vaccines and was transparent with all data.“We are not just conducting clinical trials in India. We have done clinical trials in more than 12 countries including the UK,” he said.“Many people are just gossiping everything in a different direction to just backlash on Indian companies, that is not right for us. We don’t deserve that.”Covaxin addresses an unmet medical need and has generated excellent safety data with robust immune response to multiple viral proteins that persist, he said.Ella said his company had carried out “200 per cent honest clinical trials”.“Give me one week’s time, I will give you confirmed data,” he said.Bharat Biotech has manufactured 16 vaccines, he said. “Don’t accuse us of inexperience. We are a global company.”        Without naming Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla, who had termed vaccines other than that of Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca as “just like water”, Ella said, “We do 200 per cent honest clinical trials and yet we receive backlash. If I am wrong, tell me. Some companies have branded me like water.”          He also said the Bharat Biotech vaccine is not inferior to that developed by Pfizer.Ella said it was wrong to say Bharat Biotech was not transparent with data and went on to cite the number of publications by the company in comparison with industry peers.“People should have the patience to read and see how many articles we have published,” he said.“We are the only company that has got such extensive experience and publication (in peer reviewed journals).”               The approval by the Indian drug regulator to Covaxin without revealing its efficacy results has been questioned by industry experts and opposition Congress.“Don’t accuse us of inexperience... we are not just an Indian company, we are truly a global company,” Ella said, adding Covaxin Phase-3 efficacy data will be available by March.No interim analysis of efficacy in Phase 3 has been done so far, he said.Defending the decision to award Covaxin emergency approval, he said the emergency use authorisation was based on 2019 rules of the Government of India and went on to state that even the US grants emergency authorisation to a company with good immunisation data.Bharat Biotech was the first to identify the Zika virus and the first to file global patents for the Zika and Chikungunya vaccines, he said.“It is not correct to say that we are not transparent with data... we don’t deserve the backlash.”                He further said the company has already produced 20 million doses of Covaxin and is aiming to achieve 700 million doses capacity in four facilities—three in Hyderabad and one in Bengaluru by 2021. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bharat-biotech-hits-outs-at-critics-says-carried-out-200-per-cent-honest-trials-of-corona-vaccine-193616
04-01-2021||Kolkata||Planning Commission like body to be formed in Bengal to honour Netaji: Mamata||Hitting out at the BJP-led central government for abolishing the Planning Commission conceptualised by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday said that her government would come up with a similar body to take ahead the national hero’s ideas and vision.She urged Nobel laureate economists Amartya Sen and Abhijit Banerjee and Bose’s grandnephew Sugata Bose, a historian, to advise the state government on this.“Netaji’s Planning Commission has been dissolved by the central government. They have named it (the new body which replaced the institution) Niti Aayog or Niti Niyog, I do not know. Earlier, I used to go for meetings of the Planning Commission which sought suggestions from each state. Now we cannot share our views,” Banerjee said.The Planning Commission, a government institution which formulated India’s Five-Year Plans besides performing other functions, was set up in March 1950. The Narendra Modi government disbanded it in 2014 and formed Niti Aayog.“So, let’s take some initiative. We will start Bengal Planning Commission to take Netaji’s vision to the world level,” Banerjee said at the state secretariat.“I will request Amartya Sen, Abhijit Banerjee, Sugata Bose to advise us on this,” she said and demanded that Netaji’s birthday on January 23 be declared a national holiday.She was talking to reporters after a meeting of a committee set up by her government to plan year-long celebrations to mark the occasion of the great freedom fighter’s 125th birth anniversary from this January 23.Abhijit Banerjee and other members of the committee attended the virtual meeting.The day will be celebrated as “Desh Nayak Divas” in West Bengal, Banerjee said adding that a “Jai Hind Monument” will soon be erected in Rajarhat area near Kolkata.The slogan ‘Jai Hind’ was popularised by Netaji.The chief minister also proposed to form a National Cadet Corps (NCC) like organisation in state-run schools and colleges and name it ‘Jai Hind Bahini’.“If there is the NCC, why cannot we have a Jai Hind Bahini in every school and college? We should have a short film or a documentary on Netaji which schoolchildren can watch. A CD of songs related to Netaji will be brought out,” she said.Banerjee also said that the state government will set up a “national university” which will be named after Netaji.“There are several universities named after Netaji. We will set up a national university without taking help from anybody. The West Bengal government will do it. This university will have links to world class universities like Havard, Cambridge and Oxford,” she said.The chief minister said that a rally from Shyambazar in north Kolkata to Red Road in the central part of the city will be organised on January 23.The CM also stressed on her demand that the Centre declassify the files which might lead to the unravelling of Netajis disappearance.“We have already declassified (some files). We are demanding that the Centre declassify all files related to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose,” she said after the meeting.Besides economist Abhijit Banerjee, eminent personalities such as painter Suvaprasanna, theatre personality Rudra Prasad Sengupta, author Sirsendhu Mukherjee, actor and danseuse Mamata Shankar took part at the meeting and shared their views. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/planning-commission-like-body-to-be-formed-in-bengal-to-honour-netaji-mamata-193614
04-01-2021||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad crematorium collapse: 3 officials arrested||Three civic officials were arrested on Monday over the collapse of a crematorium roof that claimed 24 lives here as tension spiralled in the area with the families of the victims blocking the Delhi-Meerut highway by placing two bodies on the road to press for their demand for higher compensation.They lifted the blockade and agreed to cremate the bodies after hours of protest as officials agreed for Rs 10 lakh compensation and a government job for each victim's family, said Iraj Raja, Superintendent of Police (Rural).He said that Muradnagar Nagar Palika Executive Officer Niharika Singh, Junior Engineer Chandra Pal and Supervisor Ashish were arrested this morning as they were involved in the tendering process for building the structure that collapsed on Sunday, killing 24 people and injuring 17 others.Police teams are also conducting raids at possible hideouts of contractor Ajay Tyagi to arrest him, said Raja.Officials said construction work for the shelter at the crematorium, estimated to cost around Rs 55 crore, was started two months back and it was opened for public nearly 15 days ago.The road blockade near the Muradnagar Police Station led to a massive traffic jam with hundreds of vehicles getting piled up during the morning rush hour.The protesters were insisting District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey be called for a talk with them so that they can register their demands, including Rs 20 lakh compensation for each of the grieving families and a government job for one of their members.The DM, Senior Superintendent of Police Kalanidhi Naithani and other senior officials later reached the protest site and spoke to the protesters over their demands, officials said.Urban Development Minister and Ghaziabad district in-charge Suresh Khanna also visited here and met the family members of the victims, the DM told PTI.He said a proposal on Rs 10 lakh compensation and a government job in each family has been forwarded to the government and the administration would also arrange free education for the children of the deceased till they become adults.On the funerals of the 24 bodies, he said 11 were cremated at the Ukhlarsi village cremation ground and the rest at their native places. Their family members have taken away the bodies, he said.Officials also said the government had agreed to provide relief to the injured after assessing their level of handicap.Twenty-four people, most of them attending a funeral, were killed and 17 others injured when the roof of a shelter at a cremation ground in Muradnagar here collapsed on Sunday.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had on Sunday announced Rs 2 lakh as financial relief for the families of each man killed.Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu lashed out at the Yogi Adityanath government over the incident, saying it was a "living example of organised corruption" in the state.In a statement issued here, he said the roof collapse showed "sub-standard material" was being used in construction works, and alleged government officials and contractors were putting the lives of people in danger for earning themselves "commission".He claimed the local people had complained about the quality of work in Muradnagar crematorium, but their pleas were ignored.He demanded the government should pay Rs 25 lakh compensation to those killed, and Rs 10 lakh, and proper treatment, to those injured.

They (Home and Bengaluru Civic Body) need more time. The government was trying to help these 75 returnees, they need to understand this," he explained.Answering to a question, the minister said that of these 75 returnees, three returnees had submitted addresses of their country of origin while remaining 72 returnees had given their overseas cell number. As a result the authorities are finding it difficult to locate them, he said."We have approached immigration authorities and they too have given details whatever we had sought. But most of these details furnished by these missing passengers are incomplete. We cannot term this as immigration authorities' mistake, but our people are working hard to track all of those missing," he said.The minister claimed that only 10 were infected with a new variant virus so far in the state."It is not big number given the number of people who disembarked in the last one month," he said.Sudhakar further said that so far 34 UK returnees and 14 of their primary or secondary contacts were found to be positive for Covid-19."Among these 48 cases, the new strain of virus is found only in 10," he said."All of them are undergoing treatment and are without any serious health condition. They will recover soon," he said in response to a question."Their swab samples have been sent to the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences for carrying out genome sequencing and 10 among them were confirmed to be infected by the new variant of the virus," he explained.Notably, a total of 5,068 passengers returned to the state from England between November 25 and December 31."Of these 5,068 passengers, 4,238 passengers landed in Bengaluru from December 9 to 31, and among those landed 810 are from other states," the minister had stated on Friday.

04-01-2021||New Delhi||Instant loan app fraud cases under ED scanner||The ED has brought under its scanner the alleged fraud cases of instant loan sanction through mobile applications, reported recently from Telangana and Tamil Nadu, as part of its money-laundering probe in an online betting scam pegged at over Rs 1,100 crore, official sources said on Monday.At least five people, including a software engineer, have reportedly ended their lives in Telangana after they were harassed to pay back these loans given in alleged violations of regulatory guidelines to gullible and needy victims facing economic hardships.The Telangana police have filed at least 50 cases in this connection and arrested 29 people, including three Chinese nationals, till now.The Chennai police also arrested two Chinese nationals and as many Indians recently after a complainant informed the cops that he was subjected to agony, abuse, threats and harassment by the online loan app firms over repayment with a high rate of interest.Official sources said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has “enlarged” its investigation to probe these FIRs and complaints filed by the two state police departments.It has been probing a case of online betting scam, allegedly being run with the connivance of some Chinese nationals, pegged at over Rs 1,100 crore.The online betting case dates to August last year when the central probe agency conducted multiple raids across the country at the registered offices of some companies, their directors and chartered accountants, who were stated to be involved in illegally running online betting apps on websites, which are hosted from outside India and operated by Chinese nationals.The ED case was based on a Telangana police FIR that was filed against Dokypay Technology Private Limited, Linkyun Technolgy Private Limited and others. The police in the southern state had also arrested three people, including a Chinese national, in this connection.The three were later arrested by the ED too under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The ED said these companies moved funds worth crores of rupees across the shores by using the “lax regulatory” mechanism of online wallets and that is where the money-laundering angle came up.The ED will now probe the instant loan app case together with the online betting case as both have a more or less similar modus operandi of duping people and moving voluminous funds to foreign shores, including China, through illegal remittances and “hawala” transactions, officials said.According to the Telangana police, the lending companies, through instant loan apps, offered loans to individuals, levied huge interest and processing charges, among others, and resorted to systematic abusing, harassing and threatening of the defaulters through call centres.The Telangana police also said it received several complaints that these firms allegedly obtained sensitive data such as contacts, photos from the mobile phones of customers and used it to defame or blackmail them to get the loans repaid.A statement from the Hyderabad police had said a preliminary investigation into these financial transactions revealed that about 1.4 crore transactions worth nearly Rs 21,000 crore had taken place so far.

04-01-2021||New Delhi||#MeToo: Ramani called me predator without any basis, Akbar tells court||Former Union minister MJ Akbar on Monday told a court here that journalist Priya Ramani called him ‘media’s biggest sexual predator’ without any investigation or basis.                                        Akbar made the submission through senior advocate Geeta Luthra during the final hearing in a criminal defamation complaint filed by him against Ramani for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct 20 years back.Ramani had made allegation of sexual misconduct against Akbar in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018.Luthra referred to Ramani’s tweet which accused Akbar of being media’s biggest sexual predator.“If we look at what has been said, a conclusion is drawn that this is a predator. On what basis? All these averments (in the article) are based without any investigation or basis,” she submitted before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar.She further read Ramani’s “premature tweet” on Akbar’s resignation.                  “This had further tweets. In my (Akbar) cross examination I asked if this was not correct. He resigned later is wholly immaterial. This shows malafide, maliciousness.“This is trial outside the court. Due process is in a court of law. One cannot become law onto oneself. This (the tweet) was incorrect,” she said.The senior advocate further accused Ramani of not telling the truth before the court.“I asked did you issue any corrigendum. She said yes. I said show. She said I would show on the next date. This was not necessary. She knew she had not issued any corrigendum.“She says her defence is truth but she knows it is not the truth. Only in cross examination she says it was not the truth. It shows her credibility as a witness,” Luthra said.She further said, “Can people repeat something incorrect? Repeating of lies by 10 persons doesn’t become the truth. Being a journalist, she could have independently verified. This is how responsible journalism works.”                “A blatantly false, incorrect statement was made to court and a blatantly false defence was taken,” she said.The court will further resume the hearing on January 7.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani in October 15, 2018.He resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/metoo-ramani-called-me-predator-without-any-basis-akbar-tells-court-193584

And, 500-600 centres will be set up in the first phase, for which work is underway in full swing, officials said.India’s drugs regulator has approved Oxford COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute, and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country.“We are all ready with our preparations, from storage to logistics, and on Saturday, a dry run was conducted at three sites to assess the preparedness for the vaccination roll-out. Vaccination can begin as soon as the vaccine arrives in Delhi, which we expect in a few days,” Jain said on Sunday.As part of the first phase, about three lakh healthcare workers and nearly six lakh frontline workers will get the vaccine.The city government has announced that the vaccine will be provided to people in Delhi free-of-cost.While the COVID-19 situation seems significantly under control, several people arriving here from the UK and being detected with the new strain of the coronavirus, has caused a bit of concern, but authorities said they were totally alert.Delhi recorded 424 fresh COVID-19 cases, the lowest in over seven months, and 14 new fatalities on Sunday, even as the positivity rate slipped to 0.62 per cent. The infection tally in the city stood at over 6.26 lakh and death toll rose to 10,585.The minister has said the Delhi government has so far made preparations to vaccinate one lakh people in a day. Social distancing will be maintained, and people will be admitted to the centres in batches of 10, he added.The Delhi government is fully prepared to receive, store and administer COVID-19 vaccine to 51 lakh priority category persons in the city in the first phase of vaccination, the minister had earlier said.These include healthcare workers, who will be the first to receive, followed by frontline workers, people aged above 50 and those below 50 years but with co-morbidities, he added.Vaccination centres will either be hospitals or facilities linked to hospitals.Emergency rooms will be set up at the centres, and those getting the vaccine dose will be kept there under observation for half an hour, to see if there is any side effect.“A monitoring station has been created at a vaccination centre and any side effects, like headache, body pain will be immediately looked into, and hospital linkage anyway is there,” Jain said.On the storage facility preparations at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH), sources said, 90 freezers have arrived and nearly half of those have been installed, adding cold chain equipment have also been set up.“The facility being set up at RGSSH can store vaccine in a temperature range of 2-8 degree Celsius.... But, as of now, we have not received any information, as to which vaccine will be sent here,” a source told PTI.RGSSH, recently made a partially COVID-19 facility, has 650 beds and played a significant role in the combat against the pandemic in 2020.There will be two cold chain equipment for storage. The ground and first floors of the utility block, measuring about 4,700 sq ft, will be used for the storage facility on the hospital premises.“Officials of Delhi State Health Mission are monitoring the setting up of the storage facility on a daily basis,” the source said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-vaccination-in-delhi-over-500-centres-in-ph-1-facility-being-set-up-for-2-8-deg-c-storage-193583

04-01-2021||New Delhi||Covid vaccine to cost Rs 219-292 per shot to govt; at double that rate in pvt market: Serum||Coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford will cost USD 3-4 per shot (Rs 219-292) to the government and will be priced at double that rate in private market ones such sales open up, said the CEO of its Indian manufacturer on Monday.Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has a licence to produce the shot and has already manufactured close to 50 million doses.Its CEO Adar Poonawalla told PTI that the company will start selling the Covishield to the Indian government and GAVI countries in the first stage, followed by the private market.Indian drug regulator on Sunday approved Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for restricted emergency use in the country.“We want the vaccine to be affordable and accessible to all. The government of India will receive it at a far more affordable price of USD 3-4, since they will be buying in a larger volume,” he said.Poonawalla, who had taken a huge gamble once the pandemic began to unfold by overhauling Serum’s assembly line and “sacrificing” products that were to be destined for Europe and America in anticipation of a COVID-19 vaccine, said the priority supplies will go to India and the GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization) nations.Only after meeting their requirements, “the private market will open up where the pricing would be USD 6-8 per done,” he said.Serum will have 100 million doses in a month, and will possibly double it by April.The government has indicated that it may need 300 million doses before July 2021, with frontline health workers and the elderly given priority.Poonawalla said Serum was in touch with the government for the vaccine’s procurement.“Initially, we will supply 50 million doses and we will get more confirmations over the course of the next few days,” he added.After the regulator’s nod, Serum expects formalities to be completed in the next 7 to 10 days for the rollout to begin.When asked if the SII has been barred by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) not to export the vaccine till vulnerable populations in India are protected, Poonawalla said: “We will start exporting the vaccine post the government’s approval and talks are going on”.“Our priority list will see us cater to the Indian market first, then the COVAX countries. Optimistically, by March-April we should have permissions in place,” he added.When asked if the company was negotiating bilateral agreements with other countries too for the vaccine, Poonawalla said: “We have bilateral partnerships with nations like Bangladesh, Myanmar, Morocco, etc”.On the efficacy of Covishield, he noted that the company has proven in its trials that it has a 100 per cent efficacy on hospitalisation, implying that there were zero hospitalisations found in the people who took the vaccine globally.“The efficacy results of the vaccine are quite high if it is administered in 2-doses within a gap of 2 – 3months,” Poonawalla said.

Prizes or scholarships offered by such firms should not be accepted by educational institutions or students," the Directorate of Education (DoE) said in a letter to school principals.The letter by the DoE comes following the guidelines issued by the Health Ministry to avoid any collaboration with a tobacco industry led foundation in the larger interest of public health."Even as the government has prohibited electronic-cigarettes and similar devices through 'The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes (Production, Manufacture, Import, Export, Transport, Sale, Distribution, Storage and Advertisement) Act, 2019", the tobacco industry and manufacturers have changed their strategy, the city government has claimed. "Now, in the garb of Foundation for Smoke Free World (FSFW) and though Conrad Foundation, Philip Morris International (PMI) is trying to promote its products as harm reduction devices. It is also pertinent to mention that Philip Morris interim through its sponsored Foundation — A Smoke Free World and grantee 'Conrad Challenge', has been trying to influence school children. Conrad Challenge has announced two new competitions in the most recent round of 2020-21," it added.The DoE has advised schools to remain vigilant against such attempts to target young children and protect them from exposure to tobacco use.

04-01-2021||New Delhi||I-T dept questions Robert Vadra in benami assets case probe||The Income Tax department on Monday questioned Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in connection with its probe against him under the benami assets law, official sources said.Vadra, 52, said the action was aimed to “digress” from the “real issues” concerning the country like the farmers’ agitation.Sources said Vadra was asked to join the investigation at the tax authority’s office in the national capital but as he cited COVID-19 restrictions, a team of officials visited his official premises in Delhi’s Sukhdev Vihar area.He was questioned for about eight hours and his statement was recorded as part of the proceedings related to the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, they said.Sources added that the questioning was linked to the purchase of some land parcels by a firm linked to Vadra in Rajasthan’s border town of Bikaner in which another central probe agency, the Enforcement Directorate, had filed a money laundering case in 2015.The ED has questioned Vadra in this case in the past and had attached assets worth Rs 4.62 crore of his firm Ms Sky Light Hospitality (P) Ltd (now LLP) in 2019. Sources said the ED shared case documents of this probe along with that of possession of some alleged undisclosed assets abroad with the tax department for action under the anti-benami law that is enforced in the country by the latter.“Everyone knows it is (political vendetta). Whenever Priyanka (his wife Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) moves out for helping farmers...and other issues then whom will they (probe agencies) come to?” Vadra said to reporters after the tax department team left.“They will come to Robert Vadra. I don’t want to go into political issues but they (government) are digressing from real issues...like the farmers issue,” he said.Vadra said he had “nothing to hide and worry about” and that the truth will prevail.“Whatever questions or notices they have sent, we have answered those. They (probe agencies) are most welcome and I am ready to answer,” he said.When reporters asked him if the latest questioning pertains to proceedings under the anti-benami law, he said “it was general and nothing related to that (benami).”Vadra also told reporters that the latest queries of tax officials revolved around his activities over the last 5-7 years.The I-T department has also been probing Vadra on charges of alleged possession of some undisclosed assets in the UK.The ED too is investigating these charges, under the anti-money laundering law, against the businessman.The ED has accused Vadra of money laundering in the purchase of a London-based property at 12, Bryanston Square worth 1.9 million GBP (British pounds), which is allegedly owned by him and this transaction involves the role of absconding defence consultant Sanjay Bhandari.             Bhandari has never joined the I-T or ED probe in this case and is stated to be based abroad. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-t-dept-questions-robert-vadra-in%C2%A0benami-assets-case-probe-193567
04-01-2021||New Delhi||True test of 'nationalism' today: Cong ahead of govt-farmers talk||Ahead of the next round of talks between the Centre and the agitating farmers, the Congress Monday said it would be a "true test of nationalism”, and warned no government can face the wrath of farmers "who believe they are being deceived".The government will hold the seventh round of talks with the agitating farmers and their leaders at Vigyan Bhawan later in the day.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Twitter, "Today is the true test of ‘Nationalism'. Will Modi Government act in ‘National Interest' or ‘Crony Corporate Interest'."  सर्दी की भीषण बारिश मेंटेंट की टपकती छत के नीचेजो बैठे हैं सिकुड़-ठिठुर करवो निडर किसान अपने ही हैं, ग़ैर नहींसरकार की क्रूरता के दृश्यों मेंअब कुछ और देखने को शेष नहीं#KisanNahiToDeshNahi pic.twitter.com/DzWsLXygVf  The Congress has been demanding the repeal of the three farm laws whose enactment has triggered a massive protest by farmers.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said those sitting under the dripping tents in the winter rains "are our own fearless farmers and not strangers". There is nothing more left to be seen as far as the government's "brutality" on farmers is concerned, he alleged, as he shared some pictures of agitating farmers braving the winter chill while protesting at Delhi's borders.  Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said around 60 farmers have lost their lives in the course of the agitation due to the "government's arrogance". सरकार एक तरफ तो किसानों को बातचीत के लिए बुलाती है दूसरी तरफ इस कड़कड़ाती ठंड में उन पर आंसू गैस के गोले बरसा रही है। इसी अड़ियल और क्रूर व्यवहार की वजह से अब तक लगभग 60 किसानों की जान जा चुकी है।किसान कैसे विश्वास करे इस क्रूर सरकार पर? pic.twitter.com/j4QEq2tyin  Sharing a video of the tear gas shells being hurled at them, she asked how the farmers can trust this government."On one hand, the government is calling farmers for talks and on the other it is hurling tar gas shells at them in this chilling winter cold. Around 60 farmers have lost their lives due to this arrogant and cruel behaviour of the government. How can farmers trust this cruel government?" She asked in a tweet in Hindi.Congress leader P Chidambaram cited the words of noted poet Saint Tiruvalluvar who, the Congress leader noted, wrote about 2,000 years ago that "if farmers fold their hands, even a person who has renounced life cannot survive"."How true it is today. No government can face the wrath of farmers who believe they are being deceived," he said on Twitter.

04-01-2021||Mumbai||Malegaon blast case: BJP MP Pragya Thakur appears in court||BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur, an accused in the Malegaon blast case of 2008, appeared before a special NIA court here on Monday.Thakur remained in the box reserved for accused persons at the back of the courtroom along with four other co-accused in the case, which is being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).On December 19, 2020, Special Judge P R Sitre had given "last chance" to Thakur to appear before the court.He had expressed displeasure over her failure to appear before the court twice last month.Earlier, in 2019, the court had said the seven accused persons in the case, all of whom are out on bail, should appear before it at least once a week.On Monday, Thakur and four other accused - Lt Col Prasad Purohit, Sameer Kulkarni, Ramesh Upadhyay and Sudhakar Chaturvedi - appeared before the court.The two other accused - Ajay Rahirkar and Sudhakar Dwivedi - were absent.One witness was also present in the court, but his cross-examination could not be done as the advocate for accused Dwivedi was not available.The court posted the trial for hearing on Tuesday.After the regular functioning of the court resumed in November last year, following the easing of the coronavirus- induced restrictions, the court had directed all the seven accused in the case to remain present before it on December 3.However, most of the accused, including Thakur, skipped the court that day, citing the pandemic situation.The court then asked them to appear before it on December 19.Thakur again did not appear that day and her lawyer told the court that she was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi for treatment.The court then directed Thakur to appear before it on January 4 and said this was the last chance given to her.Thakur, who is the BJP MP from Bhopal, had last appeared before the court in June 2019 after it ordered the seven accused to remain present once a week.However, she had sought exemption from appearance on various occasions since then.The trial in the case came to a halt in March last year following the lockdown imposed across the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Last month, the special NIA court resumed the trial.So far, around 140 witnesses out of the total 400 have been examined.On September 29, 2008, six people were killed and over 100 others injured when an explosive device strapped on a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon, a town about 200 km from Mumbai in north Maharashtra.The court framed terror charges against Purohit, Thakur and five other accused in October 2018.The accused in the case have been charged under Sections 16 (committing the terrorist act) and 18 (conspiring to commit terrorist act) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).They have also been charged under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy), 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 153 (a) (promoting enmity between two religious groups), and relevant provisions of the Explosive Substances Act. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/malegaon-blast-case-bjp-mp-pragya-thakur-appears-in-court-193557
04-01-2021||Patna||Schools, colleges reopen in Bihar after over 9 months||All educational institutions in Bihar, including schools, colleges and coaching centres, reopened on Monday after a gap of over nine months.Physical classes were held for students of standards 9-12 in schools and final year students in colleges. The institutions were closed since March 14 due to the COVID-19 outbreak.Wearing of masks, use of hand sanitiser and maintenance of physical distancing have been made mandatory at the educational institutions. Schools have been asked to operate at half the strength to ensure social distancing in classes.Attendance, however, remained thin as many parents were apprehensive of sending their wards to the educational institutions till they were vaccinated.Many students, on the other hand, were enthusiastic about the development."I am happy that schools have reopened as students were getting badly affected. Most of the children studying in government schools do not have laptops to carry out online studies. Our syllabus is lagging and we will work hard to cover it," a class 9 student of Patna's Miller High School said.Another class 11 student said that though COVID-19 fears loom large, studies are equally important and cannot be missed while assuring that safety protocols will be maintained.Teachers too seemed happy to be able to take physical classes again."It is good that we are getting an opportunity to teach students in physical classrooms. All these months we used to come to schools but did not have teaching work," an educator of Miller High School said.The attendance of class 11 and 12 students is lesser than that of class 9 and 10 pupils, he said.Students have to bring consent letters from their guardians to be able to attend the classes, another teacher said.Many guardians, however, fear that their children might get infected with COVID-19 if they are sent to schools without being vaccinated."We will not send our children to schools till they are vaccinated for COVID-19. We cannot take risks despite the precautionary measures being taken by the state government," Rajiv Singh, a resident of Jethiyan village in Gaya district said.Dharmendra Kumar, a resident of Khijarsarai village in the same district, echoed the demand.The decision to reopen the educational institutions was taken during a Crisis Management Group meeting on December 18 last year.Education Department Principal Secretary Sanjay Kumar had said that students will be permitted to enter the educational institutions only if they wear masks.Authorities of the educational institutions will keep a tab on students to check whether they have any COVID symptoms and medical examination of pupils will be conducted in government schools on a random basis, he said.Two masks each will be distributed among school children and physical classes for students of standards 9-12 will be held at half the strength to ensure social distancing, the official said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/schools-colleges-reopen-in-bihar-after-over-9-months-193556

An aerostat is an unpowered helium-filled balloon tethered at a certain height above the ground and equipped with surveillance and communication equipment. It can remain deployed for a number of days at a stretch, scan a wide swath of area and is particularly effective for detecting low-flying or surface objects, making it a cost-effective alternative to aircraft in peace time.The Air Force has had operational and maintenance issues with its aerostats, with the Comptroller and Auditor General in the past taking the IAF to task over the deployment and manner of handling of aerostats.It was as far back as 1996 that the IAF projected the requirement of six aerostat systems to provide gap-free low-level surveillance coverage over large areas. The procurement of aerostats was also part of a series of recommendations to streamline border management and enhance surveillance capabilities in the aftermath of the 1999 Kargil conflict.In 2015, the IAF again drew up plans to procure eight aerostats. There have also been attempts to design and develop aerostats locally.The equipment being sought to be indigenised by the IAF includes both the airborne segment that detects, intercepts and monitors electronic and communication signals as well as the ground-based segment that is meant for command and control of the airborne platform, analyse and process data, record and disseminate information.According to senior officers, aerostats are viable means for low-level surveillance in the air as well as maritime domains and a number of such systems are required. With the increasing use of drones for border surveillance as well as smuggling, the constant surveillance cover provided by aerostats would be effective in countering such threats. The Army is also working towards the employment of mini aerostats to keep an eye on mountain passes and remote tracks.The development of indigenous surveillance equipment would also be an added advantage for current and future projects to develop aerostats systems indigenously, besides having spin-offs in other allied areas, officers said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-mulls-indigenising-surveillance-equipment-for-its-imported-aerostats-193551
04-01-2021||New Delhi||Enough stockpile of COVID-19 vaccine for inoculation of priority groups in first phase: VK Paul||India has enough stockpile of the COVID-19 vaccine for inoculation of priority groups, including healthcare workers and frontline workers, in the first phase, Niti Aayog member V K Paul said on Monday.Paul, who is also the Chairman of National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) further said the government will soon announce its plans for purchase and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine.“Our first phase (of vaccination) comprises priority groups with high risk of mortality and our healthcare and frontline workers. For them, we believe, we have enough (COVID-19 vaccine) stockpile,” he told PTI in an interview.India’s drug regulator DCGI on Sunday approved the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute, and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for a massive inoculation drive.Paul noted that “three to four months from now, there will be other vaccines and the stockpile will be even bigger. And more acceleration can be brought about in the vaccination programme”.Asked when the government will announce its plans for purchase and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine, he said, “this will follow. Now the essential has taken place, all these steps will be taken”.Asked what would be the single biggest challenge in mass vaccination for COVID-19, Paul noted that the biggest challenge encompassed the huge mobilisation that was required for such an effort.“Well, the single most important challenge for mass vaccination on such a scale is mobilising beneficiaries on the appointed day and to conduct sessions in smooth, systemic protocols, ensuring COVID-19 appropriate precautions, I think is the single biggest challenge,” he observed.According to Paul, the purpose of vaccination is a staggered ambition and can be seen as hierarchical.“Ultimately, we would like vaccination to stop, stall and extinguish the pandemic, that is the ultimate purpose,” he said adding that for that to be achieved, a herd immunity of about 70 per cent had to be created either through vaccination or by adding those people who have undergone natural infection.Paul pointed out that for normal life to go on, there should be enough vaccinated people, so that the country’s industry, schools, transportation, judicial system and Parliamentary activity go on.“Even though the virus may be there, the pandemic may not have finished but enough of economic and social life could go on,” he emphasised.Replying to a question that India does not have experience in adult vaccination, the Niti Aayog member noted that countries face new challenges and then they respond on the basis of their intrinsic capability.“We have tremendous experience of running immunisation programs. We have experience of running affairs such as national elections, which happen over a short period of time across the country,” he said.“So those experiences and those SOP will come handy and build on that India’s ingenuity, India’s innovation and India’s experience will make it possible for us to mount a successful vaccination programme, even though it is unprecedented,” he added.Referring to the Health Ministry’s recently issued ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Operational Guidelines’, Paul said: “God forbid, if you have any comorbidity, then you will get a vaccine in the first phase of the vaccination programme. Otherwise, you will get after these high priority groups have been covered.”India’s drug regulator DCGI on Sunday approved the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute, and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country.The approval by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) was given on the basis of recommendations submitted by a COVID-19 subject expert committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).“After adequate examination, CDSCO has decided to accept the recommendations of the Expert Committee and accordingly, vaccines of M/s Serum and M/s Bharat Biotech are being approved for restricted use in emergency situations,” DCGI Dr V G Somani had said.This paves the way for the rollout of at least two vaccines in India in the coming days.The Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has tied up with AstraZeneca to manufacture Covishield.Covaxin has been indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Also, the authority granted Cadila Healthcare the permission to conduct the Phase III clinical trial of its vaccine candidate in India, Somani had said.

Its retail unit which sells food grains and staples, fruits and vegetables and items of daily use through its stores, "does not purchase any food grains directly from farmers," the statement said."It has never entered into long-term procurement contracts to gain an unfair advantage over farmers or sought that its suppliers buy from farmers at less than remunerative prices, nor will it ever do so," it added.

04-01-2021||Kolkata||Doctors’ body proposes museum in memory of Covid warrior doctors||West Bengal Doctors Forum (WBDF), an umbrella organisation of doctors which has been making significant interventions relating to the ongoing Covid crisis, has decided to set up a Covid Memorial Museum dedicated to doctors who died after contracting the dreaded virus from patients.Talking to the TNS, Dr Rajiv Pandey, a senior WBDF office-bearer, said that the proposal for setting up of a museum in the memory of the doctors who sacrificed their lives while fighting the pandemic had been already passed in the executive committee meeting of WBDF.“The outbreak of Spanish Flu was somewhat similar to the Covid Pandemic. The Spanish Flu had hit humanity back in 1914 and took a huge toll but most of us are not even aware of it,” Pandey lamented.“We do not want people to forget the fight put up by doctors to arrest the spread of the pandemic and give relief to patients by putting their own lives at risk. The fight is still on”, Pandey added.Pandey, who is a member of the interim committee of WBDF which looks after the day to day work of the organisation, said that as many as 90 doctors died in West Bengal till date after contracting Covid in the line of duty.The WBDF member said that the exhibits that would be showcased in the proposed museum would include PPE, face shield and various other tools used by doctors to treat Covid patients. The museum would also feature pictures of the martyred doctors and write-ups on them. The story of the research regarding the development of a vaccine for Covid would also feature in the proposed museum, Pandey disclosed.“The objective behind the museum project is to ensure that the future generations are aware of the fearless fight by the frontline workers against the deadly pandemic”, Pandey said.WBDF would approach the state government for land in Kolkata or its neighbourhood for the proposed museum. Funds needed for the project would be raised by crowdfunding, Pandey informed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doctors-body-proposes-museum-in-memory-of-covid-warrior-doctors-193514

04-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police ask people to take alternative routes in view of farmers' protest||Routes connecting Delhi to Ghaziabad and Noida via Ghazipur and Chilla borders remained partially closed on Monday due to the farmers' protest against the Centre's agricultural reforms, the traffic police said.They advised commuters to take alternative routes for coming to Delhi via Anand Vihar, DND, Bhopra and Loni borders.Farmers from different states have been camping at various border points of Delhi for 40 days now to demand the repeal of the three farm laws enacted in September and a legal backing for the minimum support price (MSP).The farmers had a difficult morning on Sunday as overnight rains left their tents waterlogged, firewood and blankets soaked, and intensified the cold. However, the farmers have said the weather will not dampen their spirit and they will continue the protest till their demands are met.Since the farmers arrived at the national capital's borders in late November, the Delhi Traffic Police has been posting alerts on its official Twitter handle to inform commuters about road closures across the city.In a series of tweets on Monday, the traffic police said Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli and Mangesh borders are closed for traffic movement."Please take alternate route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK Road & NH-44," it said."The Chilla and Ghazipur borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests. Please take alternate route for coming to Delhi via Anand Vihar, DND,  Bhopra & Loni Borders," it said.The traffic police said Tikri and Dhansa borders are also closed for traffic movement."Jhatikara Border is open only for LMV (Cars/Light Motor Vehicles), two wheelers and pedestrian movement," it said in another tweet.According to the traffic police, people travelling to Haryana can take the routes via Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders.After five rounds of inconclusive talks, the government and 40 farmer unions reached some common ground during the sixth round of negotiations on December 30 to resolve protesting farmers' concerns over rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning.However, the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP.The seventh round of talks between the government and farmer unions is scheduled to be held later on Monday.

04-01-2021||Vibha Sharma||Govt's meeting with farmer groups inconclusive; next round on Jan 8||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 4The first meeting of 2021 (otherwise the seventh round) between 40 unions and Central ministers ended without any outcome on the key issues — repealing of the three Farm Acts and a law on the MSP.Farmers spoke only about repealing the three Acts. “We told the government there is no other alternative. The Government said they will consult further and get back. The next meeting is on January 8. The pressure is on the government. It (farmers’ agitation) is now a peoples’ movement,” said Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of BKU (Dhakaunda), after the meeting. With the government also firm on its stance regarding the three laws, unions will now meet tomorrow to decide the next steps. “They (Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash) kept saying the same thing over and over again — how good the laws are, how they will benefit farmers, etc. One thing is certain, we are not going home till the time the laws are repealed,” BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said. The meeting started with paying ‘shradhanjali’ to farmers who lost lives during the agitation.Tomar said the government is sensitive about farmers’ issues and offered clause-wise discussion on the three Acts. “The meeting was held in good atmosphere but farmers remained adamant on their demands and we could not arrive at any conclusion,” he said, though adding that the “issue will be resolved soon”. Also read: SC treats Panjab University students' letter on 'excesses against farmers' as PILBKU trains women in driving tractors to lead January 26 farmers' processionDharmendra hopes farmers get justice today“The date of the next meeting was decided with consensus,” Tomar said in response to accusations about farmers’ “lack of trust” in the government and its own “lack of interest” in resolving the issue. “It is an important issue involving the entire country, the government has to decide keeping in mind farmers across. The laws have been made keeping in mind their best interests,” he said.Also read: Ahead of meet, Sonia seeks repeal of lawsReliance says it has nothing to do with farm lawsDelhi Police ask people to take alternative routes in view of farmers' protestEven while the government is keeping alive the communication channels with farmers, after today’s meeting it is more or less clear that it has ceded all it intends to make them end the agitation. So far, the government has relented on the proposed Power Act and the Ordinance on stubble pollution, say sources, adding that “this is about all it is willing to backtrack”. With farmers threatening to escalate agitation, making it more intense and battle lines drawn so tightly, it seems both sides are depending upon the Supreme Court to provide them some elbow room to come out of the situation. “Given the kind of support the agitation has received from common people, the matter has moved out of the hands of union leaders for a resolution on a middle path now,” say observers.The government has also shown “visible toning down on agitators and the agitation” and also offered a “joint committee on MSP”, which unions rejected, sticking to their demand for a legal framework to ensure minimum support price.Today the talks were held up for quite some time during which Tomar and Goyal held a separate meeting while Som Prakash tried to “reason out” with group of union’ leaders. It is not just the three laws, farmers have also junked Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim of implementing recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission and are demanding a guaranteed MSP on 23 crops so that they can “diversify” from paddy and wheat.  As they draw elaborate plans for the month on Lohri, January 23—Netaji Subhas Chander Bose’s birth anniversary—and January 26, it is clear farmers are in no hurry to move from the Delhi borders despite prevailing adverse weather conditions.Also read: Withdraw dung dump FIR or will block roads: BKU (Rajewal) Farmers, cops clash near BJP event||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govts-meeting-with-farmer-groups-inconclusive-next-round-on-jan-8-193493

At present, fresh law graduates are being allowed to sit for the Judicial Service Examinations without having any practical experience at the Bar. It said the BCI, along with all state Bar councils, was strongly in favour of minimum three-year experience as an advocate to be prescribed for being considered eligible to appear in a judicial service exam.“Judicial officers not having practical experience at the Bar are mostly found to be incapable and inept in handling matters. Most of such officers are found to be impolite and impractical in their behaviour with members of the Bar and litigants,” Srimanto Sen, BCI secretary, said in a press release issued on January 2.The council said inexperience at the Bar was one of the primary and major reasons for the delay in the disposal of cases in the subordinate judiciary. “Trained and experienced judicial officers can comprehend and dispose of matters at a much faster pace, thereby leading to efficient administration of justice,” it said. The requirement of three-year experience at the Bar had been done away with by the SC in March 2002. The BCI said it would file an application before the apex court to seek the modification of that order.The statement came in the wake of a petition moved before the Supreme Court.The Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission had invited applications in a notification in December for the appointment of civil judges (junior division) in the AP State Judicial Services for advocates having a minimum experience of three years. A plea has already been filed before the SC against the Andhra Pradesh notification, in which the petitioner has challenged it on the grounds that the requirement of three year experience at the Bar was illegal and unwarranted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bci-wants-three-year-practice-must-for-aspiring-judicial-officers-193169

As China is a member of both NDB and ADB, Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Company Limited was permitted to compete and it won the tender for the construction of a 5.6-km underground stretch, from New Ashok Nagar to Sahibabad. The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), which awarded the tender to the lowest bid among five competitors, suggested the ADB’s procurement guidelines for lending do not permit discrimination with member countries in bidding.The Shanghai-based NDB has five members with equal membership of five countries and China is a prominent member. As the NDB has also extended a $241-million loan for the Mumbai metro project, Chinese companies are expected to participate in the tendering process.The latest tender was a closely fought affair. The Chinese company’s quote was a few crores less than that of the Turkish company Gulermak.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-firm-bags-rapid-rail-contract-193173

Harmeet Singh Kadian said: “We will only focus on the repeal of farm laws and MSP during our meeting with the Centre on Monday.” In a statement, the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee said the success of Monday’s talks would depend entirely on the repeal of three farm laws.Sonia Gandhi, CongressShun arrogance: Sonia GandhiOver 50 farmers have lost their lives. This is an arrogant govt. Leave alone people, it cannot even heal the suffering of the ‘annadatas’. Union leader Onkar Singh urged the Centre to discard obduracy and repeal the “black” laws. Jangveer Singh Chauhan observed that the protest had been peaceful for the past 37-38 days but some political leaders were trying to provoke the farmers. He also said they had sent a letter on sugarcane rates to the Punjab Government but had yet to receive a response. “We will decide whether or not to hold a tractor march on Republic Day after tomorrow’s meeting,” Kadian said.

04-01-2021||Aditi Tandon||DCGI nod to two Covid vaccines||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 3The national regulator on Sunday approved two made in India Covid-19 vaccines setting the stage for the world’s largest inoculation drive as the government aims to vaccinate 30 crore vulnerable people by July.In what Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a “decisive turning point to strengthen a spirited fight”, Drugs Controller General VG Somani announced permissions for restricted use in emergency situations to AstraZeneca/Oxford University/Serum Institute of India’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech-ICMR’s Covaxin. While Covaxin is a wholly indigenous shot, Covishield has been manufactured in India.On road to self-reliance: ModiIt will make every Indian proud that the two vaccines that have been given emergency use approval are made in India! This shows the eagerness of our scientific community to fulfil the dream of self-reliant India. PMCovishield will only be available through the government to start with and not privately. Covaxin will only be used in extreme emergencies to handle mutation-related infections. Anyone receiving Covaxin will be treated like a participant in a clinical trial and monitored as such.Amid criticism of the nod to Covaxin, which is yet to show efficacy through phase 3 human trials, the regulator said both approved shots were 110 per cent safe. “Covaxin phase 1 and 2 trial results show it is safe and provides a robust immune response,” said Somani.The SII’s Covishield, with 70.42 per cent efficacy in phase 3 trials abroad and comparable safety data at home, will be the lead candidate of India’s vaccination plan, whereas Covaxin will work as a back-up plan, experts said. VK Paul, Chairman, Covid vaccine taskforce, said Covaxin worked against multiple viral proteins and could serve well in case of a sudden surge due to mutations. “While all other available vaccines target the virus spike protein, Covaxin targets multiple proteins and will be our special guarantee against mutations which can impact the efficacy of other vaccines in future,” Paul said.The SII hailed the approval saying it was ready with 50 million doses. On conditions for Covishield use, SII CEO Adar Poonawala said, “We cannot export the vaccine or sell it in the private market until the government has procured enough stocks to vaccinate the vulnerable.”BJP, Cong spar over safety of CovaxinThe BJP and Congress on Sunday clashed over the safety of Covaxin. After Congress leaders Anand Sharma, Jairam Ramesh and Shashi Tharoor said Covaxin had not completed the phase 3 human trials, BJP ministers hit back, calling the critics cynics.A Milestone, says Bharat BiotechBharat Biotech on Sunday said the approval of Covaxin for emergency use was a giant leap for innovation and novel product development in India. Chief of ICMR, collaborators in Covaxin, Balram Bhargava said it was a red letter day for Indian science.Govt aims to vaccinate 30 cr people by JulyAbout the vaccinesPoonawala added that SII would roll out stocks soon as a purchase agreement with the GOI is signed.“Only three Covid vaccines in the world have shown efficacy Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna. The rest are safe as water,” Poonawala added.The SII will supply Covishield to the government for Rs 200 per dose. Market cost — when private sales are permitted — would be Rs 1,000 per shot, Poonawala said. Covid national taskforce member Randeep Guleria said a third vaccine could also be available soon as Zydus Cadila received DCGI’s nod today for phase 3 trials of its DNA vaccine candidate.The SII says it can ramp up production to 100 million doses a month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dcgi-nod-to-two-covid-vaccines-193218
04-01-2021||Ajay Banerjee||Forces oppose mapping by private firms||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 3Citing security reasons, the armed forces have opposed a proposal of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) seeking to permit geospatial mapping of border and coastal areas by private entities.At present, all areas up to a distance of 25 km from the land borders or from the coastline require special permission for terrain mapping.Security concernsGoogle Maps, app-based taxi services, food or shopping portals, location services, etc. are among other applications that need mapping data. Service providers in coastal cities need permission from the MoD. Similar is the case with land borders in Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan, etc. The proposal through the MoD is to “review the policy on geospatial and geophysical systems” and seeks to allow private entities to freely map the areas falling within the “no-go” zone. It also seeks permission to map the terrain underwater within 12 nautical miles from the coast. The only exception would be the pin-pointed areas that the forces want excluded. At a meeting on December 31, the armed forces opposed doing away with special permission, or allowing un-restricted mapping in “no-go” zones or mapping of underwater terrain, sources said. The armed forces want no change in the process, except minimising the time for okaying or rejecting such permissions.The MoD proposal is that in areas where smartphones are permitted and where delivery via shopping portals is allowed should be opened for mapping by private entities. A committee of the Niti Aayog, having representatives from all security agencies, had suggested against allowing mapping by private entities.Software and equipment used in geo-spatial mapping comes from abroad and data of terrain (called elevation mapping) is vital for long-range missiles to travel and hit with precision. This could be compromised, the armed forces have suggested. The US or the European countries that have done such detailed mapping have the equipment to counter its misuse, but India does not have such technology. The Surveyor General, under the Ministry of Science and Technology, maps the terrain for the forces and has achieved an accuracy that allows precision.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/forces-oppose-mapping-by-private-firms-193219

The number of members in the council of ministers in MP cannot exceed 35.During their brief oath-taking ceremony held at Raj Bhawan, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Protem Speaker Rameshwar Sharma and several ministers of the state Cabinet were present.A public relations officer of Raj Bhawan on Sunday said the resignations of two other ministers — Imarti Devi and Girraj Dandotia — who lost the November 3 Assembly bypolls, had been accepted a few days ago.Silawat and Rajput had been inducted into the Cabinet in April last year during its first expansion. However, they had to step down in October as they were not members of the state legislature because the Covid pandemic delayed the bypolls.There is a provision that a non-MLA, who was inducted in the Cabinet, should get elected to the state Assembly within six months.The second expansion of Chouhan’s Cabinet took place on July 2 last year with the induction of 28 ministers, including over 10 loyalists of Jyotiraditya Scindia. The first expansion was held on April 21 last year, wherein five ministers, including Silawat and Rajput, were inducted. — PTIThird expansion since March||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-scindia-loyalists-back-as-ministers-in-mp-cabinet-193266

04-01-2021||New Delhi||Ahead of meet, Sonia Gandhi seeks repeal of laws||Ahead of the seventh round of talks between the Centre and the agitating farm unions to break a prolonged impasse over three agriculture related laws, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday demanded that the legislations be repealed.In a statement here, Sonia blamed the Centre for arrogance and said its policy of tiring out farmers and pushing them over would not work.Sonia Gandhi, Congress ChiefDrop obstinacyThe Centre should stop being obstinate and drunk on power and immediately rescind three black laws. This is rajdharma and an apt tribute to farmers who have died.“There is still time, the Centre should stop being obstinate and drunk on power and immediately rescind three black laws unconditionally to break the deadlock and assuage farmers who are dying in the winter and rain. This is ‘rajdharma’ and an apt tribute to farmers who have died,” said Sonia, maintaining democracy meant accommodation of diverse interests.“Along with the people of India, I am deeply disturbed at the plight of the ‘annadatas’ who have been agitating for 39 days on Delhi borders in harsh cold and rain. Due to government apathy, over 50 farmers have lost their lives…some have died by suicide. But neither the heartless government relented, nor the PM or any other minister uttered a word of consolation. This is the most arrogant government the country has seen since Independence. Leave alone people, it cannot even heal the suffering of the ‘annadatas’,” said Sonia, asserting corporate interest was getting the better of the Centre.The government, for its part, said it was hopeful of a positive outcome. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-meet-sonia-gandhi-seeks-repeal-of-laws-193268
04-01-2021||---||Congress leaders raise concern over nod to Covaxin, BJP hits back||New Delhi, January 3The BJP and the Congress clashed over the safety of Covaxin, country’s first indigenous Covid shot, approved by the Drugs Controller General of India on Sunday.After Congress leaders Anand Sharma, Jairam Ramesh and Shashi Tharoor raised questions over the approval to Covaxin, which has not completed phase 3 human trials critical to showing efficacy, BJP ministers hit back, calling the critics in the House cynics.Sharma, Ramesh and Tharoor questioned the government dispensing with mandatory protocols and verification of the phase 3 data in respect of Covaxin and demanded answers, which many independent experts did too. Congress’ chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala, however, hailed the scientists and the vaccine approval.Anand Sharma, chairman, parliamentary panel on Home which studied pandemic management, said the grant of authorisation to the vaccines needed to be taken up carefully as no country had dispensed with the mandatory phase 3 trials and verification of data.“Approval is premature and can be dangerous. Dr Harsh Vardhan should please clarify. Its use should be avoided till full trials are over. India can start with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the meantime,” said Tharoor. Jairam Ramesh said Bharat Biotech was a first-rate enterprise, but it was puzzling that internationally accepted protocols relating to the phase 3 trials were being modified for Covaxin.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan should clarify, Ramesh said, provoking Vardhan into a backlash.“Disgraceful for anyone to politicise such a critical issue. Shashi Tharoor, Jairam Ramesh and Akhilesh Yadav, don’t try to discredit well laid-out, science-backed protocol followed for approving the Covid vaccines. Wake up,” said Vardhan. Union Minister Hardeep Puri also hit back, saying, “Our in-house cynics Mr Jairam, Tharoor and Akhilesh are behaving true to form. They first questioned the valour of our soldiers and are now unhappy that the two vaccines to get DCGI nod are made in India. Clearly, they are on a quest for permanent political marginalisation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-leaders-raise-concern-over-nod-to-covaxin-bjp-hits-back-193269
