03-06-2020||New Delhi||Scientists identify distinct trait in coronavirus in India||Scientists at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad have identified a distinct trait in the coronavirus found in the people infected in the country, mostly in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Telangana.They have named this unique cluster of virus population as ‘Clade A3i’ found in 41 per cent of the genome sequenced in India.The researchers sequenced 64 genomes.“Here is a fresh preprint on genome analysis of SARS-CoV2 spread in India. The results show a distinct cluster of virus population, uncharacterised thus far, which is prevalent in India - called the Clade A3i,” the CCMB tweeted.“This cluster seems to have originated from an outbreak in February 2020, and spread through India. This comprises 41 per cent of all SARS-CoV2 genomes from Indian samples, and 3.5 of global genomes submitted into public domain,” it said.The CCMB is a laboratory under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).Epidemiological assessments suggest that the common ancestor emerged in February and possibly resulted in an outbreak followed by a countrywide spread, as evidenced by the low divergence of the genomes from across the country, the paper stated.Rakesh Mishra, the director of CCMB and co-author of the paper, said most of the samples from Telangana and Tamil Nadu were similar to ‘Clade A3i’.Most of the samples are from the early days when the outbreak started in India, Mishra said.  There were little similarities in the samples found in Delhi, but none in samples from Maharashtra and Gujarat, he said.The trait is also similar to the ones detected in Singapore and the Philippines, Mishra added.      He also said that genome sequencing of more samples will be done in the coming days that will help in knowing more on the subject.The paper is yet to be peer-reviewed, Mishra said, but added that the development will help in understanding the virus better.“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study characterising the distinct and predominant cluster of SARS-CoV-2 in India,” the paper stated.

Supehia rejected the temporary bail application of Asaram.Putting forward the application for Asaram, who is in judicial custody and lodged in Jodhpur jail in Rajasthan, advocate Mita Panchal sought temporary bail citing the present global pandemic and the High Court and the Supreme Court's orders with regard to the Covid-19 situation.Asaram's Counsel had also submitted that he is suffering from various ailments and he is an old man of 84 years of age. Some of the inmates of Jodhpur jail had contracted the Coronavirus and there was every possibility that Asaram might also get infected, the plea said.Opposing the bail, Assistant Public Prosecutor (APP) said that the accused, had also sought regular bail and the apex court had rejected his application. Further, the Rajasthan Jail authorities were taking ample precautions against Covid-19 situation.The High Court, in its order, observed that Asaram was involved in very serious offences under the section 376 (2)(c), 377, 354, 357, 342, 346, 506(2) and 120 (B) of the IPC. Further, his regular bail was also not granted by the apex court. Asaram's case also did not fall under any of the categories mentioned in the guidelines issued by the High Powered Committee for Covid-19 pandemic.Rejecting the bail application, the court also noted that the applicant had made an averment that Asaram had a large following in India as well as abroad. The high court observed that looking at that, if he was released on bail, thousands of his followers might congregate in large numbers and thereby aggravate the distressing situation of Covid-19.

See Shivraj ji, former minister and presently BJP MLA from Rewa is unable to trust your government, then he has to take help from actor @SonuSood for the migrant laborers trapped in Mumbai,” former MP Congress chief Arun Yadav tweeted.Referring to the state government’s promise to bring back every migrant worker, MP Congress spokesperson Narendra Saluja said that Shukla had been a minister for many years in Chouhan-led governments, so he knows the reality of the CM’s announcements.“That is why he sought the help of actor Sonu Sood, not from Shivraj ji, to bring back the stranded workers in Mumbai,” he said.Shukla countered that the Centre and the state government has brought lakhs of migrant workers back, but “Congressmen are hiding in their houses”.MP BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said that about six lakh migrants have been brought back by the state government, in which Shukla also played a big role as a member of the BJP’s task force on the issue.

India is already called Bharat in the Constitution,” a Bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told petitioner’s counsel Ashwin Vaish.Vaish argued that ‘India’ was derived from Greek word ‘Indica’ and it the name didn’t originate in the country. Renaming it to Bharat will help the country get over its colonial past, he said on behalf of petitioner Namaha.Seventy years after the Constitution of India came into force, a PIL in the Supreme Court wants ‘India’ to be replaced with ‘Bharat’ or ‘Hindustan’ as the name of the country, saying it will “instill a sense of pride in our own nationality”. However, the Bench wasn’t impressed. The petition should be treated by the government as representation from the petitioner, it said.At present, Article 1 of the Constitution states, “India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.”However, in another case, the top court asked the Centre and Maharashtra Government to respond to a PIL filed by retired labour court judge VP Patil seeking to rename Bombay High Court to Maharashtra High Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-pil-that-wanted-india-replaced-with-bharat-93985

Winching is done by sending down a specialised cable that is harnessed to the survivor on the ground, who is then winched up to the copter.It all began on May 7 when an IAF Mi17V5 crashed in north Sikkim at a height of 17,000 feet where even the mid-May temperature hovers below the freezing level. All six on board, including the two pilots, miraculously survived. There was no option of a rescue as the weather was bad. Early on May 8, the ALH flown by Wing Commander Ajay Chauhan took off. Accompanying him were two Cheetah helicopters of the Army Aviation. The area had received fresh snow in the night and there were chances of reduced vision during the operation. The Cheetah, a single-engine copter, can carry less load than a twin-engined ALH. The two Cheetahs landed at a nearby place and evacuated four of the survivors. Two survivors still remained on the ground and had to be moved out immediately as there were chances of fresh snow. The ALH pilot analysed that the 2.5-tonne copter could not land at the site due to the soft snow and winching was the only option left. Displaying rare courage, the pilot carried out the operation was successfully.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-rare-act-indian-air-force-pilot-winches-up-survivors-at-17-000-ft-in-sikkim-93974

But in India, the Central Government refuses to learn from this experience," said Yechury."In contrast, the Central Government has now virtually left the Indian people to fend for themselves," he added.The party said like the way the lockdown was unplanned, the exit from it mirrored the same ham-handed approach.The lockdown neither helped to curb the spread of the pandemic, nor did the government used the break to beef up health logistics, claimed the party.It opined that the lockdown related relief measures, including enhancement of MSP for certain food grains were inadequate.Taking a neutral stand regarding India-China standoff at the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh and Sikkim, the CPI(M) expressed the hope that it would be resolved through talks between the two countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpim-calls-for-a-national-protest-on-june-16-93972

03-06-2020||New Delhi||256 Shramik Special trains cancelled by states: Railways||As the operation of Shramik Special trains move towards culmination, Railways’ data showed that of the 4,040 trains run till Sunday, 256 were cancelled by state governments, with Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh being the top defaulters.Maharashtra cancelled 105 trains since May 1, and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has been very vocal about the trains the state demanded but did not use.Gujarat, from where the maximum number of trains originated, defaulted on 47 occasions, followed by Karnataka (38) and Uttar Pradesh (30), the data showed.Officials indicated that most trains were cancelled due to a lack of coordination between the originating and the terminating state.“We cannot run the trains without proper protocol. There were cases where the originating states did not provide us the list of passengers ready to board the trains so it had to be cancelled. The cancellations were primarily due to the lack of coordination between the two states,” an official said.The Ministry of Home Affairs amended the protocol for Shramik trains in mid-May, removing the need for consent from terminating states for these services. This cut out the possibility of any state not accepting the trains.Gujarat, which cancelled the maximum trains after Maharashtra, also ran the maximum 1,026 migrant special trains, ferrying more than 15 lakh migrant workers to their home states.At least 77 per cent of the total 15.18 lakh migrant workers were sent to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and remaining to West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir, officials said.The Maharashtra government facilitated the movement of 802 trains, second only to Gujarat, with 423 trains bound for Uttar Pradesh and 193 for Bihar.Of the 227 trains originating from Karnataka, 70 went to Bihar and 57 to UP.Of the 294 trains originating from UP, 138 ran within the state while 129 went to Bihar.Other states that cancelled the Shramik trains included Delhi (7), Telangana (9), Andhra Pradesh (6), Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu (4 each), Rajasthan (2) and Goa, Haryana, Kerala and Uttarakhand (1 each).As on Wednesday, the Railways has run 4,197 Shramik trains.While 81 trains are in transit, 4,116 have reached their destinations. Only 10 more Shramik trains are in the pipeline.The Shramik trains are being operated primarily on the request of states that want to send migrant workers, stranded due to the coronavirus lockdown, home.While the Railways is bearing 85 per cent of the total cost of running each train, the rest is being borne by states in the form of fares.The lockdown has had a devastating impact on the economy as well as on the livelihoods of lakhs of migrant workers. The plight of migrant workers, who had started walking from several urban centres to their villages hundreds of kilometres away, had grabbed headlines for almost two months.Many of them were killed in road accidents. In one incident, a number of migrant labourers were run over by a train after they fell asleep on the tracks due to exhaustion.The Railways also said that nearly 80 per cent of ‘Shramik Special’ trains were destined for various destinations in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Officials said there were requests for 321 more trains according to the demands sent by states by May 30.The Railways will run them in a staggered manner depending on the requirement of the states, officials said.

03-06-2020||New Delhi||Govt approves renaming Kolkata Port Trust as Syama Prasad Mookerjee Trust||The government on Wednesday gave the approval to rename Kolkata Port as Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port.Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the 150th-anniversary programme of Kolkata Port Trust in January had announced rechristening it after Jan Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee.The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its approval to rename Kolkata Port as Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port, a release said.“The Board of Trustees of Kolkata Port Trust in its meeting held on February 25, 2020, passed a resolution to rename Kolkata Port as Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port, Kolkata considering his multifaceted genius as an eminent jurist, academician, thinker and leader of the masses,” Ministry of Shipping said in the release.The Kolkata Port is the first major port as well as the only riverine port of the country. It came to be governed by a Trust on October 17, 1870, on appointment of the Commissioners for Improvement of the Port of Calcutta as per Act V of 1870.“Kolkata Port has traversed 150 years and in this journey, it has been India’s gateway to trade, commerce and economic development. It has also been a witness to India’s struggle for independence, World Wars I & II and socio-cultural changes taking place in the country, especially in Eastern India,” the release said.Generally, major ports in India are named after the city or the town in which they are situated. Some ports, however, in special cases or in due consideration of contribution made by eminent leaders have been re-named after great national leaders in the past.“Nhava Sheva Port Trust was renamed as Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust by the Government in the year 1989. The Tuticorin Port Trust was renamed as V.O. Chidambaranar Port Trust in the year 2011 and the Ennore Port Limited has been re-named as Kamarajar Port Limited in the honour of Shri K Kamarajar, eminent freedom fighter and former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,” the statement said.In 2017 Kandla Port was re-named as Deendayal Port.Modi in January had said: “I announce that the Kolkata Port Trust will now be known as Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port. He was the father of industrialisation in India, a man who made sacrifices for one nation and one Constitution.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-approves-renaming-kolkata-port-trust-as-syama-prasad-mookerjee-trust-93968

During post mortem, the doctors found 51 sharp and blunt injuries on Ankit’s body,” the charge sheet said.The charge sheet was filed under various sections of the IPC for the offences including murder (302), kidnapping (365), rioting (147 and 148), promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race etc. (153-A), criminal conspiracy (120-B) and destruction of evidence (201).Ten persons, including Tahir Hussain, were arrested in this case.“Investigation has revealed that there was a deep rooted conspiracy behind the riot and murder of Ankit Sharma, who was a familiar face in the area. He was specifically targeted by a mob led by Tahir Hussain, a politician of Aam Aadmi Party and sitting councillor in EDMC, Delhi.“It has been found that Tahir Hussain is the main person who had been instigating the mob, both on February 24 and 25, in the Chand Bagh area,” the charge sheet said.It added that during the investigation, “the blood stained knife used to stab Ankit Sharma and the blood stained clothes of the killer (with Ankit’s blood) were recovered. Another knife used in the crime was also recovered. Tahir Hussain’s licensed pistol was seized in a separate case”.Charge sheet against him, in another riot case of February 24 was filed on Tuesday by the Crime Branch.“An accused Haseen alias Salman was instrumental in the murder of Ankit. He is the person who had assaulted him with knife. During his interrogation, he revealed that he had heard about the killing of a 4-year-old Muslim Boy by a Hindu, he became angry and took a knife and along with his accomplices, Sameer, Kasim, Sabir and others came to Chand Bagh Pulia on February 25,” the police said.   The charge sheet said that “Salman further disclosed that he had stabbed Ankit Sharma a number of times with knife which he was carrying. His accomplices also stabbed with knife and hit him with dandas (sticks) and after killing him, threw his dead body in the nala”.During police custody remand, the weapon of offence, i.e., blood stained knife and the blood stained clothes of the accused worn at the time of incident were recovered at his instance from his house, it said.The recovered knife and the clothes of the accused have been sent to FSL, Rohini for comparison with the blood of the deceased and the report is still awaited, it said.“Accused Tahir Hussain was leading the mob from his house and also from the Masjid near Chand Bagh Pulia on February 24 and 25 and gave it a communal colour.“He provoked and instigated the Muslims against Hindus saying that Hindu people have killed a number of Muslims and has set fire in their shops at Sherpur Chowk and let no Hindu go scot free. On his provocation/ instigation, the Muslims turned violent and volatile on February 24 and 25 and started burning the shops and pelting stones and petrol bombs on Hindus people and also targeted their houses.                 “The uncontrolled mob turned into rioters and in the process of rioting turned caught hold of Ankit Sharma and dragged him to Chand Bagh Pauli and caused his death by inflicting injuries using sharp blunt objects and threw his dead body in a nulla (sewage drain),” it said.During the course of investigation, a person wearing red colour shirt is visible in the video footage along with 2 other persons and they are throwing the body of Ankit Sharma in the drain near Chand Bagh Pulia, it said.       “Though the faces of the persons throwing the body of Ankit Sharma in the nala are not clear and visible in the footage, which had been captured about 300 metres away from Chand Bagh Pulia by one Neeraj Kasana. “It is important to mention here that one red colour shirt had been recovered from the accused Haseen at his instance which he had worn at the time of incident. Further, the accused Haseen had disclosed that he along with his associates and others had thrown the body of Ankit Sharma in the drain after killing him.“All these circumstances shows that the accused Haseen alias Salman is the same person who is appearing in the footage with red colour shirt in the nala near Chand Bagh Pulia, Main Karawal Nagar Road, Delhi at the time of dumping the body of Ankit Sharma,” the final report said.

03-06-2020||Hyderabad||Telangana opposes Electricity Amendment Bill, says against spirit of federalism||Telangana has strongly objected to the proposed Electricity Amendment Bill, 2020, saying it was against the spirit of federal polity since it seeks to snatch away powers of the state on various counts.In a letter Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the former said that the draft Bill would have an adverse impact directly on the management of state electricity utilities.Telangana Chief Minister listed out the various objectionable provisions, including the authority to appoint State Electricity Regulatory Commission by a selection committee constituted by the union government, making National Load Dispatch Centre (NLDC) all powerful with regard to power scheduling, allowing open access and Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of subsidy to beneficiaries, among others.The state has reacted to the Centre’s correspondence seeking the opinion of state government on the proposed law. The chief minister said the proposed bill takes away certain powers of the State government like the provision to appoint State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC). The Bill proposes the selection be done by a committee constituted by the Centre.“We strongly oppose such tendencies where the Government of India or the Parliament enact laws which have a direct and major influence on the functioning of the State government, just because a particular subject is in the concurrent list,” KCR said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-opposes-electricity-amendment-bill-says-against-spirit-of-federalism-93960

03-06-2020||New Delhi||Cabinet approves amendment to Essential Commodities Act||The union cabinet approved amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, on Wednesday, less than a month after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the central government’s intention to take such a measure.The cabinet also approved ‘The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020’ and ‘The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020' to empower farmers to engage with processors, aggregators, wholesalers, large retailers and exporters."The APMC Act of the states will remain. The Ordinance is separate from the model APMC Act. It does not touch the market of the States. All States are on board. Punjab and Haryana are big producers of food grain and this law will bring a major change in their lives,” said Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who announced the decisions, said.Tomar also said that the government had no plans to end the MSP regime as apprehended by farmers of Punjab and Haryana and that government will continue to buy on the support price“The Narendra Modi government has always worked for the benefit of farmers. The three decisions will bring landmark changes in the agriculture sector. They will go a long way in helping India’s farmers while also transforming the sector,” Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said. “It is a historic day today. While the country got Independence in 1947, farmers are getting their freedom today. There will be mandis and APMC Act but farmers will be free to trade outside without any State’ tax or legal binding. These are visionary steps towards transformation of agriculture and raising farmers’ income,” Tomar said.Explaining about the decisions Tomar said though India has become surplus in most agri-commodities, farmers have been unable to get better prices due to lack of investment in cold storage, processing and export as the entrepreneurial spirit gets dampened due to hanging sword of Essential Commodities Act.“Farmers suffer huge losses when there are bumper harvests of perishable commodities. With adequate processing facilities, much of this wastage can be reduced.This will remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference.“The freedom to produce, hold, move, distribute and supply will lead to harnessing of economies of scale and attract private sector/foreign direct investment into agriculture sector. It will help drive up investment in cold storages and modernisation of food supply chain.“The government, while liberalising the regulatory environment, has also ensured that interests of consumers are safeguarded.  It has been provided in the amendment that in situations such as war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamity, such agricultural foodstuff can be regulated.“However, the installed capacity of a value chain participant and the export demand of an exporter will remain exempted from such stock limit imposition so as to ensure that investments in agriculture are not discouraged.“The amendment announced will help both farmers and consumers while bringing in price stability.  It will also prevent wastage of agri-produce that happens due to lack of storage facilities, said the government,” he said.Regarding the ‘Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance,  Tomar said it was meant to create “selling space” outside the APMC markets and "not replace APMC acts of the States". “There are restrictions for farmers in selling agri-produce outside the notified APMC market yards. The farmers are also restricted to sell the produce only to registered licensees of the state governments. Further, Barriers exist in free flow of agriculture produce between various states owing to the prevalence of various APMC legislations enacted by the state governments, he said.“The ordinance will create an ecosystem where the farmers and traders will enjoy freedom of choice of sale and purchase of agri-produce. It will also promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade and commerce outside the physical premises of markets notified under State Agricultural Produce Marketing legislations. This is a historic-step in unlocking the vastly regulated agriculture markets in the country.  “It will open more choices for the farmer, reduce marketing costs for the farmers and help them in getting better prices. It will also help farmers of regions with surplus produce to get better prices and consumers of regions with shortages, lower prices. The ordinance also proposes an electronic trading in transaction platform for ensuring a seamless trade electronically, “Tomar said.These proposals were part of the Rs 20 lakh crore economic package announced to help those affected due to the lockdown clamped to fight the spread of COVID-19 disease.In a series of announcements she made last month, Sitharaman had said her government would amend the act to deregulate cereals, edible oil, oil seeds, onions and potatoes. She also said stock limits will be subject to the installed capacity and this facility will also be extended exporters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-approves-amendment-to-essential-commodities-act-93950
03-06-2020||Lucknow||UP Doctor tests coronavirus positive, 'frontline warriors' worry||Following the revised central guidelines for the so-called “frontline warriors’ a Hapur doctor,  posted at an L1 level COVID-19 facility at a Community Health Centre in the district was forced to go home to his family after a 14-day-long duty.Even before he could reach home the result of his COVID-19 test mandatory taken on the 12th day of the 14-day-long duty came out to be positive.He returned to the hospital and was kept in its isolation ward for 14 days until he tested negative on Wednesday.It was just sheer luck that he had not reached home exposing his entire family including his elderly parents, wife, and children to the deadly disease.The change in the central guidelines exposing the doctors and other health professionals to COVID-19 is causing simmering unrest among the doctors of the Uttar Pradesh Provincial Medical Services (UPPMS) running the state’s  L1, L2 and L3 hospitals attending to the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the state.Under the previous guideline, all doctors, nurses, technicians, and sanitation workers in the Covid-19 wards had to work 14 days in a row and remain in quarantine for the next 14 days to ensure that they did not take the infection back home.During the passive quarantine period, the off-duty doctors, nurses, technicians, and sanitation workers in the Covid-19 wards were put up in hotels for a 14 days before they returned to duty to ensure that they did not take the infection back home.During this ‘passive quarantine period’ depending on if they were serving in class A, B or C class city, the doctors were entitled to an allocation of Rs 1500, Rs 1200 and Rs 1000 per day for their stay and a uniform amount of Rs 500 for their food.They were not paid in cash instead; the district administration was in charge of making arrangements.However, the May 15 revised guideline of the union health ministry on the management of manpower in hospitals laid down that there was no need for quarantine of healthcare workers after COVID-19 duty unless there had been a breach in the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or any other form of high-risk exposure.Doing away with the passive quarantine period is putting the doctors, other healthcare professionals, and their families at huge risk.According to reliable sources, the Uttar Pradesh Provincial Medical Services Association is sending a memorandum to the Principal Secretary Health demanding that the doctors who go off duty should be allowed to stay in the hospital until the result of their mandatory COVID-19 test comes negative.According to a UPPMS office bearer, the central guidelines have suggested that the states may modify the guidelines according to the ground reality.“The situation in Uttar Pradesh cannot be compared to other states. We are the most populous state in the country. The UPPMS has barely eleven thousand doctors serving a population of approximately 23 crores. In times of a pandemic, the doctors are working in a high-risk situation round the clock. A number of beds can be increased rapidly but not the number of doctors. Exposing the already skeleton staff to the infection will further derail the already skewed patient-doctor ratio”, said a doctor demanding the immediate restoration of the passive quarantine system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-doctor-tests-coronavirus-positive-frontline-warriors-worry-93939

My parents were divorced when I was two years old, so I had a stepmother. I was tortured a lot.

03-06-2020||---||Amid joy and sorrow, Maharashtra tribal girl weds week after dad's suicide||Yavatmal, June 3Hundreds of people in two small villages trooped out to celebrate the wedding of a tribal couple—girl Payal Atram and boy Akash Kulsange—amid tears of joy and sorrow, courtesy an NGO, on Wednesday morning.For, exactly a week ago on May 27, the girl's distraught father had committed suicide - 24 hours before his daughter's planned marriage on May 28.A week later, people from the girl's village Sakhara-Dhoki marched in a 'baraat' (wedding procession) to the boy's hamlet Gondwakadi, all in their traditional finery to bless the young couple and joyfully partook of the feast that followed—with full social distancing.Barely a week ago, the scene was different with a pall of gloom over both villages—23-year old Payal's Sakhara-Dhoki with a population of 900 and 27-year-old Akash's Gondwakadi with 425 people—and a question mark over the wedding scheduled two days later.As both families felt it would be prudent to postpone the marriage, an NGO Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS) heard about it and inquired into the matter."It was a farm distress incident. The father, Maroti Atram, was unable to raise even the bare minimum money for Payal's marriage due to the lockdowns and resorted to the extreme step," said  VJAS President Kishore Tiwari.Though the shocked and embarrassed family kept mum, locals revealed privately that the family could barely manage a meal a day, and the situation was compounded after the successive lockdowns, jeopardizing the nuptials after the betrothal on March 29.The VJAS and Tiwari, along with his wife Smita, decided to help with the marriage and passed the word to other like-minded philanthropists in the region."In barely three days, we were overwhelmed with offerings in cash and kind and performed the marriage ceremony with full tribal rituals today, with over 750 people enjoying the simple, traditional wedding feast," Tiwari told IANS from the venue.At the insistence of the girl's family, Kishore and Smita Tiwari consented to perform the  'kanyadaan' ceremony amidst a huge round of applause and 'akshata' or showering of auspicious coloured rice grains on the couple.Later the invitees grabbed an eyeful of the goodies presented to the couple by VJAS and other unknown well-wishers—a bed with mattresses, a sofa set, two steel cupboards, a fridge, a kitchen cabinet, a TV set, an air cooler, full kitchen utensils, a gas stove, a sewing machine—and for the boy a brand new, glittering D'Signer wristwatch!"That D'Signer is from a donor, preferring anonymity, who was grieved to learn of the tragedy in the girl's family. Many others from all over the world gifted other presents," said Nagpur-based social activist Khushroo Poacha, whose work in feeding lakhs of people during the lockdowns was personally lauded by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. IANS had reported this on April 6-7.Local police officials Ramkrishna Mahale and Arif Shaikh, along with government officials Suresh Kavale, Sandeep Makode, Sanjay Madavi, Gopal Sherkhane, Padmakar Madavi, Shubham Fale, turned up to bless the couple."Barely a week ago, the two villages were in mourning, but today everyone is celebrating the joyous occasion, inspiring and making it a memorable day for us all," Shaikh told IANS.

03-06-2020||Vijay Mohan||IAF indigenising Russian night vision goggles for use in helicopters||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 3The Indian Air Force (IAF) is indigenising Russian night vision goggles that are used by pilots flying the Mi-17 medium lift helicopter. IAF’s No. 3 Base Repair Depot here, that is responsible for the maintenance and overhaul of Russian-origin helicopters, has been tasked to execute the project.“The design and development of the NL-93 night vision goggle (NVG) variant will be done in collaboration with the Indian industry, for which the public and the private sector is being approached,” an officer said. “NVG is categorised as a critical equipment and it has to be compatible with the Mi-17’s cockpit and operating parameters,” he added.NVG is a helmet-mounted electro-optical device based on image intensifier technology that allows images to be produced in levels of light approaching total darkness.  NVGs  can intensify ambient light to over a thousand times and can function effectively in minimal  moonlight  conditions or even starlight.By increasing the air crew’s situational awareness due to improved visibility in the dark, NVGs enhance manoeuvrability and navigation, thereby facilitating better air-to-ground tactics and thereby enhancing mission effectiveness.The  essential  features  of  NVG  vision include monochromatic image in a field of view reduced to a cone of 40 deg with diminished visualacuity  as  compared  to  daytime  vision. Consequently, pilots have to continually turn their heads to see to the sides.The use of NVGs, however, also has medical and physiological implications. It adds to the weight of the helmet, causing increased stress on the neck and spine. Given the device’s limited field of view of about 40 degrees, the pilots have to constantly rotate their heads for wider arc of vision. Air crew are also required to undergo brief training capsules on the use of NVGs.The IAF began using NVGs in helicopters in 2002 for operation flying such as special heli-borne operations, troop deployment, search and rescue and communication. It carried out its first NVG-assisted rescue in 2007, when it evacuated two injured soldiers, one of them with a serious head injury, in the north-east.According to IAF sources, once the indigenous NVG for the Mi-17 is certified for use, it would be adapted for other helicopters in the IAF’s inventory such as the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited-developed Dhruv and Rudra as well as the upcoming Light Combat Helicopter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-indigenising-russian-night-vision-goggles-for-use-in-helicopters-93917

Several rickshaw pullers have returned to their native place in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, but all those staying here are now, working in vegetable markets to come to terms with the circumstances,” said a rickshaw puller, MakuLal from Bihar.Amarpal of Aligarh said that he resides in a rented room and has taken a rickshaw on rent at Rs 30 per day hence he has to earn at least Rs 120 per day under all circumstances to bear the daily expenses.“Before the COVID, I used to earn Rs 250 to Rs 300 per day, but the earning has reduced to Rs 120 to Rs 130 per day and that too when I am transporting vegetables and fruits,” he added.Ramsher of Gonda (UP) said, he had been pulling a rickshaw in the city for past two decades but it was for the first time when he was ferrying vegetables and fruits in the rickshaw instead of passengers.“I manage to earn Rs 120 per day by doing two rounds of transporting the vegetables from market to the shop/ house of the person concerned,” he added.Krishan Lal, who rents out rickshaws informed there are, at present, more than 250 rickshaws in the district whereas a considerable number of migrants who used to pull rickshaw had returned to their native place fearing the crisis of livelihood.“Since passengers are not available due to lockdown so all are working in vegetable markets,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-effect-rickshaw-pullers-in-rohtak-ferry-veggies-in-place-of-passengers-93902

While temperatures in Bay of Bengal were between 30-33°C prior to Amphan, SST over Arabian Sea were recorded 30-32°C prior to Nisarga, Koll saysNilofar in 2014 was the first extremely severe cyclone to be recorded in the Arabian Sea in the post-monsoon season.In the following year, two storms of the same category (Chapala and Megh) came one after the other in the same season.In 2019, there were Kyarr and Maha. Kyarr was, in fact, the first super cyclone to be recorded in the Arabian Sea in the post-monsoon season.Experts say climate change is increasing damage caused by cyclones like Nisarga and Amphan in several ways. Higher SST make cyclones more powerful and increase rainfall during the storm. They increase sea levels, thus increasing the distance inland storm surges reach.It is the densely populated coastal cities like Mumbai and Kolkata which will face the brunt due to unplanned urban development and destruction of mangroves that act as buffer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-cyclones-in-fortnight-point-towards-increase-in-pre-monsoon-cyclonic-activity-93868

At least two makeshift Covid-19 care centres in Mumbai’s low-lying areas have been shut down and patients moved elsewhere after disaster management officials warned of severe flooding. “We have moved patients from the 1,000-bed hospital at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) to the NSCI Sports Complex at Worli. Patients from the 200-bed hospital near Dharavi too have been relocated as these areas could get flooded,” a state government official said. “As per Chief Minister’s directions, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is taking utmost care to protect Covid facility created at BKC. It can sustain wind velocity of 80-100 kmph only,” the MMRDA, which set up the facility, said in a post on Twitter. According to the agency 150 patients were admitted at the facility. The MMRDA added that it was putting up sand bags to strengthen the pillars of the facility. Besides, electricity, AC and oxygen facility will be turned off during the cyclone to prevent fire, according to the agency.

Yet there is the persisting perception that intentions have not translated into concrete action.Appreciating the good intentions at the heart of the G20 action plan, the letter sought several concrete measures. These include debt relief for 76 countries until the end of 2021, IMF support for a dozen emerging markets who will face debt servicing problems and $2.5 trillion level of support to all nations.“The G20 has demonstrated that it can bring people together around a common set of actions. What it decides next will have a direct bearing on the future of the world economy,” said a letter penned by 250 academics, social workers, Nobel laureates and former Presidents.It asked the G20 to pay special attention to the collateral damage due to the lockdown on the poorest and middle-income economies.They urged G20s to replenish a $7.4 billion fund for immunising 30 crore children over the next five years to ensure that while the world fights Covid-19, the resurgence of other infectious diseases must be prevented.They also sought universally and freely availability of vaccines. In the first stage of the crisis, the emphasis was on provision of liquidity, employment protection and emergency investments in health.

Truenat kits are currently used to detect drug-resistant tuberculosis. Close to 800 of these are available in India and each can test 32 to 48 samples in a four-way structure with capacity to return results in minutes.“Earlier, Truenat platform had only been validated for Covid screening. The machines are available in each district and at primary health level,” ICMR expert Nivedita Gupta said.The daily caseload rose by 8,170 new infections to touch 1,98,705, as per the Health Ministry’s 10 am update. By tonight, the caseload had crossed the two lakh mark.“If you compare 14 nations with population equal to India’s, you will find that their cases are 22.5 per cent more than us and deaths are 55.2 times more than India’s,” Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cases-touch-2l-now-tb-machines-for-tests-93661

As many as 55 lakh businesspersons returned to their jobs in May. June is likely to generate more jobs. However, most of the initial improvement will be in poor-quality jobs.The sole segment that did not see any increase in jobs was that of salaried employees. The number declined from 6.84 crore in April to 6.83 crore in May, as compared to 8.6 crore in 2019-20.“Salaried jobs are relatively difficult to get. And, salaried jobs lost during a lockdown are far more difficult to recover. These are also the better jobs. The continued loss of good quality jobs is, therefore, worrisome,” the CMIE noted.The partial lifting of lockdown has so far restored informal jobs of the self-employed. “Salaried jobs will increase in a meaningful sense only when investment increases. That’s a distant dream,” said an analyst.Though the job market saw an improvement over the April situation, when around 12.2 crore persons were unemployed, the figures for May show that over 10 crore are still without job. The employment market in April was 28.2 crore, which has risen to 30.3 crore in May. The figure was 40.4 crore in 2019-20.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jobs-grew-in-may-but-salaried-ones-elusive-93706

China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbours rather than resolve conflicts according to international law,” said Congressman Eliot Engel, who is also the Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Not too long ago, Engel was critical of the CAA and the NRC as well as the lockdown in Kashmir.“Countries must abide by the same set of rules so that we don’t live in a world where ‘might makes right’. I strongly urge China to respect norms and use diplomacy and existing mechanisms to resolve its border questions with India,’’ added the statement by Engel.Pompeo, speaking on China on second consecutive day, said its actions had been part of behaviour of ruling Communist Party in the recent past.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bipartisan-us-support-for-india-93708

PTIIn an attempt to ease tension in two disputed areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, the Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps of the Indian Army is scheduled to meet his Chinese equivalent at Chushul-Moldo on June 6.Chushul-Moldo is one of the two designated meeting points in Ladakh.‘Large number of Chinese present’A large number of Chinese (troops) are present in the disputed area (along the LAC) and our troops are also holding ground. — Rajnath Singh, Defence MinisterSources in the Army said the two top commanders were slated to meet on June 6 to chalk out a way to move out troops from the two spots—around “Finger-4” in the north of Pangong Tso and Gogra.The groundwork for the top commanders’ meeting was laid out when the Major General heading the 3 Division of the Army met his Chinese counterpart today.Existing tension is in two disputed areas along the LAC where both sides have varying perceptions about it.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh today told a news channel that a “large number of Chinese are present in the disputed area and our troops are also holding ground”.As per the existing framework of LAC management between India and China, troops of either side do not hold ground in disputed areas of the LAC. They come for patrol and return. The positioning of tanks and artillery there makes the matter serious this time. Troops have also clashed there, at least once.As regards the Galwan valley, the third spot of tension at the confluence of Shyok and Galwan rivers, India has conveyed to China that its troops were in areas that were never disputed.The alignment of LAC is accepted as per the China Claim Line of 1956. Indian troops used to patrol up to an accepted point in the Galwan valley, but this time Chinese troops tried to stop them 5 km short of that point. Indian troops are forward located and the aim is to hold ground in Galwan valley and also north of Pangong Tso.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-commanders-meet-93709
