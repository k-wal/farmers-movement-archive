The approval by the House of Representatives does not mean the amendment process has been completed.At the same time, Nepal has made it clear that the issue will not be allowed to become a dispute with Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali firm that the resolution will only be through dialogue. “We are for starting dialogue soon. The problem will be resolved through diplomacy. We are not trying other alternatives. It is not necessary to make either,” he said at the House of Representatives (HoR) meeting.He said Kali river is the border between Nepal and India. “There is no reason to not accept Kali river as the border. We will hold dialogue on the basis of historic facts. We will have our rights on our land.”Nepal has already issued a new map including Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipu Lekh.India has refused to be drawn into Nepal’s proposal for a meeting between Foreign Secretaries under the overhang of the resolution, but highly placed sources have expressed the hope that the situation can be turned around provided it is “handled well from here”.While the Nepali Congress came on board last week after a green signal from its Central Working Committee, the die was cast for a unanimous vote after the Madheshis also joined in.Speaking in the House of Representatives, leaders of Janata Samajwadi Party, formed after the unification of Rastriya Janata Party and Socialist Party Nepal, announced their support to the Amendment Bill in national interest.  The main opposition party, Nepali Congress, Gagan Thapa set the tone by thanking the government for issuing the map and going a step further by seeking the removal of an Indian Army post at Kalapani.There have been feelers from New Delhi to Baluwatar to explore some existing modalities such as the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group on resolving the outstanding issues. There is also a proposal for a field survey to demarcate Kalapani which is in a limbo.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-mps-unanimously-approve-new-map-96783

The idea is to utilise the maximum capacity available to enable such virtual participation, feasibility of enabling participation of members as per the Rules of Business of both the Houses, other technical issues etc.The Secretaries General reported the outcomes of assessment of seating capacity in the Chambers of both the Houses, the Central Hall of Parliament and the Plenary Hall of Vigyan Bhawan.The top officials said while the Rajya Sabha Chamber can accommodate about 60 members as per the norms of social distancing, the Lok Sabha Chamber and the Central Hall has space for a little over 100 members.They further said that even if the members were to be accommodated in the galleries, the total seating capacity would be much less than required, if all members were to be accommodated. Even the Plenary Hall of the Vigyan Bhawan would not be adequate to accommodate all the 543 members of the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha has 245 members.The officials further informed that the presiding officers of certain other limitations if the Central Hall and Vigyan Bhawan were to be used for the session like non-availability of air-conditioning facility during the day in the Central Hall and simultaneous interpretation service etc.Another option discussed was to enable attendance in the Chambers of both the Houses of only those many members who can be accommodated as per the social distancing norm by drawing up lists of such members whose participation in various items of business is required on a daily basis.Regarding virtual meetings of the parliamentary committees, it was explained that any change in the rules to hold such meetings required a motion to be carried in both the Houses of Parliament.On June 3, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home headed by Anand Sharma had to cancel a scheduled meeting after request for virtual session was turned down as some members expressed inability to attend in person due to quarantine rules in states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/virtual-participation-limited-attendance-of-mps-on-mind-as-parliament-explores-options-to-hold-monsoon-session-96737

The IAF is inducting a total of seven ARPITs as of now, according to a statement.It can be used in both, helicopters as well as fixed-wing aircraft.It has been developed as a lightweight isolation system from aviation certified material.It has a transparent and durable perspex chamber for enhanced patient visibility, which is larger, higher, and wider than the existing models in use.The isolation system caters to a suitable number of air exchanges, integration of medical monitoring instruments, and ventilation to an intubated patient.In addition, it generates a high and constant negative pressure within the isolation chamber to mitigate the risk of infection to aircrew, ground crew, and health care workers involved in air transportation.The ARPIT utilises High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) H-13 class filters and supports invasive ventilation using a transport ventilator.The design integrates life support and monitoring instruments like defibrillator with the multi-para monitor, pulse oximeter, Infusion pumps, etc, and long arm gloves for health care professionals and power pack with high endurance.Design requirements have been evolved and are based on the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers, and Centre for Disease Control, USA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-air-force-inducts-indigenous-airborne-rescue-pod-for-critical-and-covid-19-patients-96736

It was the first such case in my entire professional life," he said."The baby was in dire need of oxygenated blood as well as corrective surgeries, so we contacted hospitals in Mumbai," he said.Rohit's parents had taken him to the Sangli civil hospital after he became seriously ill, but the surgery which he needed could not be performed there."The only option we had was to shift the baby to Mumbai in the midst of coronavirus pandemic," said Dr Magdum.The officials in the Sangli district collector's office arranged ambulance transport for the baby patient.When asked how the family raised the funds for the treatment, Magdum said, "Most of the cost was covered under the Union government's Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram."As we had no facility here for conducting open-heart surgery, we recommended that the baby be taken to NH SRCC Children's hospital in Mumbai," he said.The hospital in Mumbai, which is run by a charitable trust, agreed to bear some of the cost of the surgery.Before leaving for Mumbai, 380 km away, Rohit had to undergo a coronavirus test and get ascertained that he was not carrying the infection.During the journey, the doctors had to ensure that he was supplied with oxygen all the time."We equipped six ambulances with oxygen supply equipment, and they transported the patient from Sangli to Mumbai (in relay) which took over ten hours," Dr Magdum said.After undergoing the surgery in the third week of May, the baby and his parents stayed at the hospital for a few days before returning to their village.

There might be 5.5 lakh cases by July 31 and Delhi would need 80,000 beds," Sisodia said.Based on doubling rate, 5.5 lakh cases are expected to be reported in Delhi by July 31, he said.He said that people living in Delhi also need beds during COVID-19 pandemic and in view of this, the Delhi Cabinet had recently taken the decision to reserve state-run and private hospitals for Delhiites.In the meeting, nobody had an answer on availability of sufficient numbers of beds if COVID-19 cases continue to increase in the coming days in the national capital, Sisodia said."Who will take responsibility if there are no beds? If people are coming from all over the country, beds available in Delhi will be occupied within eight or 10 days."As the L-G has refused to reconsider his decision, we will try to serve the people of country and Delhi as well. We will also try to expand medical facilities," he added.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said the source of infection is "not known" in nearly half of the fresh cases being reported.Interacting with reporters, he also said that the Kejriwal government is making all preparations to handle the huge rush of patients estimated by June-end."Epidemiologically, community transmission is third stage of the infection... In Delhi, of the new cases being reported, in nearly half of the cases, the source of infection is not known," he said.On Monday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the L-G's order on hospitals had created a major problem and challenge for Delhiites.The chief minister had said that providing treatment to people coming from all over the country was a big challenge during COVID-19 pandemic.The Delhi government would try to make arrangements to provide treatment to all those coming from outside the national capital, Kejriwal had said.Delhi recorded 1,007 fresh coronavirus cases taking the COVID-19 tally in the city to over 29,000, and the death toll due to the disease mounted to 874.Sixty-two COVID-19 patients died in Delhi from May 30 to June 6, and 27 of these fatalities occurred on June 5.

09-06-2020||New Delhi||Happier than when I got Michelin star: Vikas Khanna on conducting 'world's largest food drive'||It was a spam email seeking donation for an old age home that directed New-York-based chef Vikas Khanna's attention to the plight of lakhs of migrant workers stuck across India without food and shelter.He realised how the lockdown was affecting them adversely and decided to help. In a couple of days with help from social media, he managed to create a network of general stores and truck drivers to source and distribute food — cooked as well as dry ration — to those in need.The Michelin star chef, over the last two and a half months, with support from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Mumbai-based communication firm Maximus Collabs, has distributed over nine million meals across 125 cities including Varanasi, Bengaluru, Mangalore, Kolkata and Mumbai.Khanna's next food drive — 'Barkat' — in Delhi-NCR on Wednesday, is set to be the largest in the world, with the distribution of two million meals in a single day.This drive, however, will particularly be directed at vulnerable communities like the differently-abled, transgenders, and sex-workers."I am humbled to work on an event tirelessly that supports people with disabilities, transgenders, sex-workers, AIDS patients, orphanages, old-age homes and leprosy centres."We will also be reaching out to abandoned parents' homes. I am unable to comprehend how people can abandon their parents," the chef said.As part of the initiative, over 10,000 bags, containing ration worth 200 meals each, will be distributed across different parts of Delhi-NCR by the NDRF.While activists like Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, Aryan Pasha, as well as the AIDS Healthcare Foundation have identified over 4,500 transgenders, sex workers, and AIDS patients in need, institutions like The Earth Saviour (old age home), Arya Orphanage, and Amar Jyoti Charitable Home (disability centre) will help the drive reach other vulnerable communities."This entire operation has made me feel happier than the time I received the Michelin star. Compared to this satisfaction, the Michelin star is nothing," he said.It wasn't, however, a smooth ride till here.A little while into the first phase of food distribution, Khanna said a ration delivery truck in Bengaluru took off without any contact, and in another incident a shop owner took double the money and blocked the chef."That broke me," he said.But, all it took was a quick call to his mother in Amritsar, for him to recover and get back on track."I was at my wit's end when I called my mother, who is in Amritsar. And she said, 'You are my 'fauji' (soldier) beta. I haven't raised you to give up."You owe it to the people to carry on and remember that you are not doing anyone any favour. Stand up for the nation, it's your duty'," he said, adding that he and his team have been working relentlessly since then.Khanna also collaborated with the CRPF and NDRF in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh respectively to distribute packets of cooked food (5 poori sabji, achaar, 2 bananas and a water bottle) on the Shramik trains.The world renowned chef, however, added that a food drive of such a large scale was possible only because of the overwhelming support he received from corporates as well as individuals, who helped turn his one man initiative into a community driven endeavour.Among corporates who contributed towards the drive were India Gate Food, Patanjali, Jivana Salt, and Daawat rice."Over time through social media, more and more hands joined in and we planned upon the world's largest food drive."The magnitude of solidarity being expressed by people from all over the country has been crazy. Rations are coming in from Coonoor, Kutch, Indore, Mumbai and more," he said.

We had asked the people of Bengal to join hands with PM for the benefit of the state. They accepted the appeal and gave 18 out of 42 seats,” he said, urging people to give one opportunity to the BJP to make it a ‘Sonar Bangla’ again. “You have tried the Communists and Trinamool, now give one opportunity to BJP,” he told people in the state. Shah also attacked the Congress for doing vote bank politics and trying to stall the Citizenship Act for “narrow political gains" and “minority appeasement”.Accusing Mamata of the same, he said: “I saw the face of Mamata Banerjee that day (when CAA was cleared). I want to ask her how have the poor refugees from Bangladesh harmed you?"“You are objecting against the CAA. When the ballot boxes are opened you will see that people have made you a political ‘sharnarthi’ (refugee). Your objections against CAA will cost you dear,” Shah said.“She alleges the BJP is trying to unsettle her in Bengal. I want to tell her don’t worry people of Bengal will soon do that,” he said, accusing her of trying to stall migrant labourers of returning home.“You called ‘shramik express’ ‘corona express’. Let me tell you the same corona express will take you out of the state. Poor migrants will never forget your insults and insensitivities,” he said, launching an attack against Banerjee for turning ‘Sonar Bangla’ into a poor state with corruption and mismanagement.    “Can violence be a way to stop change? Is violence against BJP cadres, is it democracy? Let me tell you the more you spread ‘hinsa ka keechad’, the better ‘kamal’ will bloom,” he added.  The Home Minister said the BJP was not there for politics or expand the footprint of the party but to make the state “a sonar, sanskritik Bangla”.“It is time for change,” he said.Praising PM for giving the country exemplary leadership during the corona crisis, he also credited party president JP Nadda for giving the party a good way to contact people via virtual rallies. “Whenever the history of Indian politics is written there will be a chapter on virtual rallies,” he said.  BJP leaders said the rally kicked off a political change in this state. In Bihar, 70,000 LED TV sets were put up across the state. The ‘samvaad’ will definitely bring good results for people of Bengal,” they said.“What BJP can afford, we cannot," West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said when asked if she planned a similar virtual rally on July 21, the day Trinamool holds its annual mega rally to observe "Martyrs' Day".On Monday, Shah today told cadres in Odisha, a state governed by non-NDA Biju Janata Dal, to make it a 'garh', a bastion of the BJP.Becoming the first party off the blocks amid the Covid-19 crisis to give wings to its political activities and ambitions with virtual rallies, the BJP and the Centre have received criticism over the plight and sufferings of migrants following Prime Minister Modi's four-hour notice for the countrywide lockdown and delay in evacuation of migrant workers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-launches-scathing-attack-against-mamata-banerjee-96699

09-06-2020||Mumbai||Actor Sonu Sood stopped from meeting migrants at Mumbai’s Bandra Terminus||Actor Sonu Sood, who has been arranging transport for migrant workers stranded in Mumbai and has faced criticism from the Shiv Sena for "enacting a political script written by BJP", was stopped outside the Bandra Terminus here by police from meeting labourers.A Mumbai Police official said the actor was stopped by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) when he reached the station on Monday night to meet some labourers, and added that they had not received any complaint so far in this connection.The migrant labourers were supposed to take the Shramik Special train from Bandra Terminus to Uttar Pradesh.Nirmal Nagar police station's senior inspector Shashikant Bhandare said, "The actor was stopped by the RPF, not by us. He wanted to meet labourers who were going to their native place. We have not received any complaint."Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday wondered whether the BJP propped up Sood to "offer help" to migrant workers from north India stranded in Maharashtra amidst the lockdown, with the political motive to show the Uddhav Thackeray government in poor light.In his weekly column 'Rokhthok' in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', Raut questioned the sudden rise of "Mahatma" Sood on the social scene of Maharashtra during the lockdown.Raut also referred to a "sting operation" against Sood ahead of the 2019 general election, saying he had agreed to promote the BJP-led government at various platforms through his official social media accounts.However, later that day, Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had lauded Sood's initiative to arrange buses for stranded migrant workers.The actor met Thackeray at the latter's residence 'Matoshree' in suburban Bandra on Sunday night.On Monday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh backed Sood for his work for stranded migrant workers, and questioned the Maharashtra government's criticism of the actor.

Rahul Gandhi questioned in a tweet.His remarks came a day after Rajnath took a jibe at the Congress after Rahul raised questions over the issue of border dispute with China."Haath me dard ho to dawa kije, haath hi jab dard ho to kya kije (You apply medicine to the hand when it pains, but what to do when the hand itself is the cause of pain)," Rajnath said in tweet in reply to the Congress leader.The Defence Minister made the reference in relation to the Congress' election symbol of hand.The war of words between the Congress and the BJP intensified on Monday after Rahul took a jibe at Shah after he claimed that India is the only country after the US and Israel to protect its borders.The Congress leader took a jibe at Shah, saying "everyone knows the reality of the borders"."Everyone knows the reality of the borders, but 'Shah-yad' (maybe) it's a good idea to keep oneself happy," Rahul tweeted in Hindi.Addressing a public rally in Bihar on Sunday via video-conference, Shah said: "India's defence policy has gained global acceptance. And India is next to the US and Israel in protecting its borders."On June 3, Rahul had questioned the central government over a military stand-off with China in Ladakh. He had tweeted: "Can the government of India please confirm that no Chinese soldiers have entered India?"

09-06-2020||Washington||Defacement of Mahatma Gandhi's statue was a 'disgrace': Trump||The defacement of Mahatma Gandhi's statue by unidentified miscreants was a "disgrace”, US President Donald Trump has said, days after it was vandalised with graffiti and spray painting during the nationwide protests against the custodial killing of African-American George Floyd.The statue, which is across the road from the Indian Embassy, was vandalised on the intervening night of June 2 and 3, prompting the Indian embassy to register a complaint with the local law-enforcement agencies.The incident happened during the week of nationwide protests against the custodial killing of Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.“It was a disgrace,” Trump made the brief comment at the White House on Monday when asked about the incident.The Indian Embassy here has taken up the matter with the US Department of State for early investigation into the matter, as also with the Metropolitan Police and National Park Service.It is working with the US Department of State, Metropolitan Police and National Park Service for expeditious restoration of the statue at the park.The US president and First Lady Melania Trump, during their visit to India in February, had spent considerable time at the Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had personally given them a tour of the historic place.“The First Lady and I have just had a pleasure of visiting Mahatma Gandhi's Ashram, a few miles from here, where he launched the famous Salt March,” Trump had said during his address at the Namaste Trump rally at the Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad on February 24. A day later, Trump and the first lady also laid a wreath at Rajghat in New Delhi.Pictures of Trump and the first lady with Gandhi's spinning wheel during their visit to the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad are seen hanging on the walls of the White House.Last week, top US lawmakers and the Trump Campaign condemned the vandalisation of the statue."Very disappointing,” tweeted Kimberly Guilfoyle, advisor to Donald J Trump for President Inc. and National Chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committees.North Carolina Senator Tom Tillis said, "It's disgraceful to see the defacing of the Gandhi statue" in Washington DC.“Gandhi was a pioneer of peaceful protesting, demonstrating the great change it can bring. Rioting, looting and vandalising do not bring us together, he said.Senator Marco Rubio said, “More evidence that violent radicals and run-of-the-mill crazies have hijacked legitimate protests to create anarchy or for their own purposes.”Protests against the custodial killing of Floyd turned violent in the US and prestigious monuments were damaged. In Washington DC, protestors burnt a historic church and damaged monuments like the Lincoln Memorial.US Ambassador to India Ken Juster apologised for the incident."So sorry to see the desecration of the Gandhi statue in Wash, DC. Please accept our sincere apologies,” he said.“Appalled as well by the horrific death of George Floyd and the awful violence and vandalism. We stand against prejudice & discrimination of any type. We will recover and be better," he said in a tweet last week.One of the few statues of a foreign leader on a federal land in Washington DC, the statue of Gandhi was dedicated by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the presence of the then US president Bill Clinton on September 16, 2000, during his state visit to the US.

The ties could have taken a turn for the worse had Nepal approached the International Court of Justice or the UN which was the stage of a slanging match between India and Nepalese delegations over an “economic blockade” in 2015.There were existing modalities such as the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group on resolving the outstanding issues which was convened by the Foreign Secretaries of both countries and has been pending official airing for two years.Besides, there was also a pending proposal for a field survey to demarcate Kalapani for which a joint boundary committee was to be set up. “There are no dead-ends with Nepal. It is a question of how we handle it from here,’’ said a source.The border dispute came to the fore last month when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh digitally inaugurated a link road to Mansarovar Yatra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/take-alternative-steps-to-defuse-border-dispute-india-tells-nepal-96571

The MGNREGA should be used to help people of India.Sonia Gandhi, Congress PresidentAlso Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in an article, stated that this was not about BJP versus Congress. “The MGNREGA should be used to help people of India,” she said.While demanding enhanced outlays under the programme, Singhvi said, “The PM should just bear in mind the good the scheme can do.”“Covid-19 has demonstrated the unmatched value of people-centric schemes, like MGNREGA, with a humbled government being constrained to commit an additional Rs 40,000 crore. In May 2020 alone, 2.19 crore households demanded work through it, the highest for the month in eight years,” Singhvi said.He also recalled “PM Modi saying in 2014 that MGNREGA was a living monument of the INC’s failures.”“Today, the PM must live with that short-sighted assessment as MGNREGA has come to the nation’s aid in combatting growing poverty,” the Congress said, adding that as of March 31, 2020, over 12 crore people had benefitted from the programme.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scale-up-mgnrega-congress-urges-pm-96580

The idea is to shoot less. Basically, I am treating this period as an off season as we hardly get time in India between the international and domestic tournaments,” Angad told The Tribune on Monday. “So this forced break is a blessing in disguise. And I am taking it slowly, shooting only 100 shells at a time. I also have a dry-mounting simulator at home where I spend a lot of time too,” the skeet shooter added.As far as training of rifle and pistol shooters, such as Swapnil Kusale, Tejaswini Sawant and Rahi Sarnobat — who use 25m sports pistol — is concerned, it is due to start later this week at the Kolhapur range.La Liga steps into virtual world ahead of returnNew Delhi: The La Liga on Sunday announced that it would use virtual images and audio of fans’ cheers to counter the eerie silence of the stadiums, as seen in other leagues, for its television broadcasts when it kicks back into action on June 11.

Traditionally, it is the parents, brothers or sisters who “pip” the cadets — which is the pinning of the two stars of a Lieutenant on each shoulder — to formally make them commissioned officers.“This time, the piping will be done by instructors, officers and their wives,” Lt Col Amit Dagar, IMA’s public relations officer, said.To compensate, the Army has made elaborate arrangements for a live telecast of the event on some TV channels and also on social media in the same manner as is being done for the Republic Day Parade and the Army Day Parade. Special accounts have been opened on popular social media platforms and these are being widely circulated.The POP for the spring term is scheduled to be held at Dehradun on June 13 and the Chief of the Army Staff, General Manoj Mukund Naravane, is expected to be the reviewing officer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-a-first-no-parents-at-ima-passing-out-parade-96606
