The rally by Indians in Taipei and their thanking Taiwan for combating the pandemic holds a deep significance in global politics.The event also had Independence-minded Taiwan government’s indirect blessings. It nudged companies into sponsoring the rally and the chief local bureaucrat attended the opening ceremony.  The event’s main organiser, 38-year-old Manoj Kriplani, reportedly said the motor rally was attended and supported by various Indian community groups in Taiwan.Under Chinese pressure, India, along with most countries of the world, did not give diplomatic recognition to Taiwan. And any such move irks Beijing.Also, there is a clash of views on the question of health.China managed to eject Taiwan from its observer status at the WHO’s annual meeting. It is today vigorously resisting a demand by 60 countries to seek its re-inclusion after it emerged that Taiwan was among the first to raise the flag on the epidemic in Wuhan but was ignored because of its pariah status.  One of the participants was a 40-year resident of Taiwan, Harkishin Chablani, president of the Indian’s Association of Taipei, who said the event was also dedicated to thanking the country’s health workers.Another participant, Rajan Khera, president of the Indian Cultural Committee of Taipei, said Taiwan deserved to be thanked because the country did not just help its citizens but people all over the world who need help.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/while-sino-indian-tensions-persist-indians-praise-taiwan-98723

13-06-2020||Vibha Sharma||Even if BJP is trying to do a Madhya Pradesh or a Karnataka, Rajasthan may not come as easy to it||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 13Despite “rumours” that Rajasthan Deputy CM Sachin Pilot “met” BJP top brass in Delhi, the general consensus among political observers appears to be that even if the saffron party is trying to do a Madhya Pradesh or a Karnataka in Rajasthan, the desert state may not come as easy to it.For one the Congress Chief Minister in Rajasthan, Ashok Gehlot, is a “seasoned and shrewd” politician.  He has been a student leader, the state party president, MLA, Lok Sabha MP, Union Minister and is the CM for the third time in the state. “Gehlot is someone who has seen it all unlike Kamal Nath in Madhya Pradesh whose area of influence was limited to Chhindwara,” observers say. Besides, unlike Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot holds important positions. He is the Deputy CM and also the president of the state Congress. Also, the gap between the BJP and the Congress is bigger in Rajasthan and the state unit is “not as divided” as it was in Madhya Pradesh with at least four different camps operating in it. The saffron party has challenged Chief Minister Gehlot to prove the allegations that it is trying to “destablise his government and is indulging in poaching” ahead of the Rajya Sabha poll, blaming all his trouble on “internal differences” in the party. The observers say signs of “Operation Lotus” are “all there” and “if not now, it may be a matter of some more months before Rajasthan is in the news again”. But it seems the current situation may be limited to Rajya Sabha elections. Interestingly, it is BJP’s former ally Shiv Sena which has sounded a “warning” for the Congress.Hitting out at BJP for trying to destabilise the Rajasthan government during the pandemic, Shiv Sena in its mouthpiece Saamana also questioned if the Deputy Chief Minister met the BJP bigwigs in Delhi. “There are also rumours that Sachin Pilot met BJP bigwigs in Delhi, it may be wrong, but this is like warning bell for the Congress camp,” Saamana was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, Pilot yesterday asserted that MLAs of the ruling coalition were all united and would ensure a comfortable victory for the two Congress candidates in upcoming Rajya Sabha polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/even-if-bjp-is-trying-to-do-a-madhya-pradesh-or-a-karnataka-rajasthan-may-not-come-as-easy-to-it-98704

13-06-2020||New Delhi||Health Ministry okays remdesivir under emergency use authorisation, HCQ for early course of COVID-19||The Union Health Ministry has recommended the use of anti-viral drug remdesivir under emergency use authorisation, off-label application of immunomodulator tocilizumab and convalescent plasma therapy for treating COVID-19 patients in a moderate stage of criticality.Backtracking from its earlier stance, the ministry in its revised ‘Clinical Management Protocols for COVID-19’, released on Saturday, said anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) should be used in the early course of the disease to achieve any meaningful effect and should be avoided in severe cases.In the new set of protocols, the ministry has removed its earlier recommendation of using hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin in severe cases and requiring ICU management.Hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV2 and was shown to be clinically beneficial in several small single-centre studies though, with significant limitations, it stated.“Nonetheless, several large observational studies with severe methodologic limitations have shown no effect on mortality or other clinically meaningful outcomes. As such, the evidence base behind its use remains limited as with other drugs and should only be used after shared decision making with the patients while awaiting the results of ongoing studies,” the revised document stated.“As is the case with other anti-virals, this drug should be used as early in the disease course as possible to achieve any meaningful effects and should be avoided in patients with severe disease,” it read.An ECG should ideally be done before prescribing the drug to measure QTc interval, to assess some of the electrical properties of the heart, and avoid hydroxychloroquine if QTc is greater than 500 ms, it said.

India has been maintaining that these three areas belong to it.“We have a very strong relationship with Nepal. We have geographical, cultural, historical, religious linkages. We have very strong people-to-people connect. Our relation with them has always been strong and will remain strong in the future,” Gen Naravane said.He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the passing out parade of the Indian Military Academy.The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory.In the midst of the row, Gen Naravane had said that there were reasons to believe that Nepal objected to the road at the behest of “someone else”, in an apparent reference to a possible role by China in the matter. The comments triggered an angry reaction from Nepal.Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories.After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply and cautioned the country that such “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory -- India as part of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district.Nepalese Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to “reclaim” them from India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-chief-naravane-talks-about-friendly-ties-with-nepal-ahead-of-vote-on-new-map-98673

The tally has reached 36,000 and more than 1,200 people have died due to the virus in the national capital.“Home Minister, Shri @AmitShah and Health Minister, @drharshvardhan to hold meeting with @LtGovDelhi, CM Delhi & members of SDMA to review situation in the capital regarding COVID-19 tomorrow, 14th June at 11 am. Director AIIMS and other senior officers would also be present,” Shah’s office tweeted.Also read: PM Modi reviews COVID-19 situation, India’s responseThe number of coronavirus cases in Delhi is the third highest in the country after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.There has been criticism from different quarters over the handling of COVID-19 cases in the capital with complaints of non-availability of beds in hospitals for patients and difficulty in getting the tests done in laboratories.The Supreme Court on Friday lashed out at the city government, terming as “horrific” the state of affairs in Delhi hospitals with bodies being stacked next to COVID-19 patients.After the SC’s observation, the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government said it accepts with utmost respect and sincerity the apex court’s remarks and pointed out that it was trying its best to set up better infrastructure and provide quality healthcare to all COVID-19 patients in the city.Baijal has also formed a six-member panel to formulate a COVID management plan and suggest ways to ramp up medical infrastructure in the capital.This comes close on the heels of Baijal’s recent assertions on hospital beds and testing, and overturning of two Delhi government orders—reserving hospital beds only for residents of Delhi and testing of only symptomatic patients.The members on Baijal’s advisory committee are DG ICMR Professor Balram Bhargava, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria, National Disaster Management Authority members Krishna Vatsa, Kamal Kishore and others.India surpassed the three lakh-mark in coronavirus cases on Saturday with the worst daily spike of 11,458 infections, while the death toll too climbed to 8,884 with 386 new fatalities, the Union health ministry said.It has now become the fourth worst-hit nation by the pandemic with a case load of 3,08,993, according to coronavirus statistics website Worldometer.However, the health ministry has said that the doubling time of coronavirus cases has improved to 17.4 days from 15.4 days. And its data updated at 8 am on Saturday showed active cases at 1,45,779 and those who have recovered at 1,54,329; one patient has migrated.“Thus, around 49.9 per cent patients have recovered so far,” a ministry official said.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-to-hold-meeting-with-delhi-lg-cm-on-covid-19-situation-in-capital-98670
13-06-2020||New Delhi||ICMR expands coronavirus symptoms list; includes loss of taste and smell, muscle pain, diarrhoea||With COVID-19 cases crossing the 3 lakh mark on Monday, India expanded the list of symptoms which people should watch out for in order to report the infection.Based on evidence from other countries, the Ministry of Health today included muscle pain, mucous formation in throat, clogged nasal cavity, sore throat, diarrhoea and loss of taste and smell as new COVID symptoms apart from the previous three signs of fever, short breath and cough.Symptom check Common symptoms Other SymptomsClogged nasal cavityThe government’s clinical protocol on COVID19 released today says loss of smell (anosmia) or loss of taste (ageusia) preceding the onset of respiratory symptoms could be one of the signs of the disease.People over 60 and those with non-communicable diseases----diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic lung disease, cerebro-vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, immune-suppression and cancer---are among the high risk category, said the Ministry.Current disease data from the Ministry shows non-specific and varied symptoms in people. A study on 15,366 COVID patients recently showed the presence of fever in 27%, cough (21%), sore throat (10%), breathlessness (8%), Weakness (7%), running nose (3%) and other symptoms 24%.The Ministry said current available evidence for COVID-19 suggests that the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) has a zoonotic source closely related to bat-origin SARS-like coronavirus and the persons infected by the novel coronavirus are the main source of infection through close contact mainly respiratory droplets released when the infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.These droplets may land on surfaces, where the virus remains viable and infection occur if a person touches an infected surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.“The median incubation period is 5.1 days (range 2–14 days). As per the current evidence, the period of infectivity starts 2 days prior to onset of symptoms and lasts up to 8 days,” protocols say adding that the role of asymptomatic people in transmitting the virus remains under probe.The Ministry also admits that while most patients with COVID-19 predominantly have a respiratory tract infection associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, some can progress to aSevere Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, multi-organ failure, including acute kidney injury and cardiac injury.The government has defined a suspected case as a patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath), and a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset; or a patient with any acute respiratory illness and having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset; or a patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath and requiring hospitalisation).The government said on Friday that anti-viral drug Remdisivir (under trial in other countries) can be used in emergencies in patients with moderate disease (those on oxygen) but not in those with renal complication, pregnant and lactating women and children under 12.Convalescent plasma has been allowed in patients with moderate disease who are not improving (oxygen requirement is progressively increasing) despite use of steroids.Tocilizumab medicine can be considered in patients with moderate disease with progressively increasing oxygen requirements and in mechanically ventilated patients not improving despite use of steroids, the protocols say adding that those on Tocilizumab should be reviewed for secondary infections. This medicine should not be given to people with TB.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/icmr-expands-coronavirus-symptoms-list-includes-loss-of-taste-and-smell-muscle-pain-diarrhoea-98665

13-06-2020||---||Nepal has included Indian territory in new map: MEA||New Delhi, June 13Nepal’s House of Representatives on Saturday unanimously passed a Constitutional amendment revising the map in the Coat of Arms to include three areas of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura that India later in the evening asserted were part of its territory.While the political momentum behind the changes in map was unstoppable for Baluwatar, both sides made attempts to ensure that the killing of an Indian by Nepal Police did not add to the differences. Nepal released an Indian arrested on serious charges of attempting to snatch weapons from the police while India said the firing as having occurred “deep inside Nepal territory”.The die for a change in the Constitution was cast about 10 days back when Nepal’s Lower House unanimously approved a resolution to change the map on its coat of arms.The Ministry of External Affairs here accused Nepal of violating “our current understanding” to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues. “We have already made our position clear on this matter. This artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable. It is also a part of Indian territory,” said the MEA official spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.Nepal’s map change was in response to two Indian moves over eight months. First in early November, India released a new political map. Its basic aim was to reflect the new reality of erstwhile state of J&K divided into two union territories but netizens it also included Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura. India handled that dissonance by promising dialogue.On May 8, the controversy was re-stoked when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a road from Dharchula in Uttarakhand to the controversial spot of Lipulekh.This set in motion a political process that has led to changes in Nepal’s political map and while Nepal’s PM and Foreign Ministry publicly asked India to hold a dialogue, especially at the level of Foreign Secretaries, it was on Saturday that the MEA seemed to suggest that it had made an offer for talks.The amendment in the lower house hung in balance as the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) was 10 seats short of the needed two-thirds majority. But Madheshi parties, who were asked to display their nationalist credentials, and the Nepali Congress came on board, making the passing of the resolution a fait accompli. The Bill will now go to the Upper House where NCP holds 50 of the 59 elected seats.Sad day: Cong on Nepal moveCommenting on the Nepal Parliament’s unanimous passage of the Bill to redraw the country’s political map, Congress media chairman Randeep Surjewala tweeted, “This is a sad day in the long standing Indo-Nepal relationship! Tragic that self professed “strong leadership” of BJP remains in ostrich like denial, when it comes to protecting “National Interest”. Delusional TV warfare can’t substitute the absence of mature political leadership."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-has-included-indian-territory-in-new-map-mea-98662

Several locals and representatives of the government were also present, the report said.Giving details about the incident at Sitamarhi district, 134 kms from Patna, Kumar Rajesh Chandra, Director General of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), a force looking after the 1,751 km India-Nepal frontier, said in New Delhi on Friday that the incident took place around 8:40 AM "deep inside Nepalese territory".According to Indian officials, as per preliminary reports obtained from locals, there were protests after the APF troops objected to the presence of Indians in their area in violation of the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nepal has announced a lockdown in the area till June 14.The bordering districts on both sides of the border maintain contacts and in the absence of any fence, people move around to meet their family members, they said.The objection raised by the APF resulted in a heated argument and it is alleged that the Indian people called other villagers and indulged in stone-pelting on the Nepalese APF at Narayanpur area of Parsa Rural Municipality in Sarlahi district in southern Nepal.APF Additional Inspector General of Police Narayan Babu Thapa told PTI in Kathmandu that "they even snatched weapons from one of our security men. After firing ten rounds of bullets in the air, our personnel had to open fire for self-defence in which one person was killed and two others were injured”.The incident occurred some 75 metres inside the Nepalese territory from the no-man's land, he added.The incident took place in the midst of a raging boundary row between the two countries, with India sternly asking Nepal not to resort to any "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims after Kathmandu released a new political map laying claim over Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura.New Delhi maintains that these are part of India's Uttarakhand State while Kathmandu, in its recent map, had shown them as part of Western Nepal.India had published its new map of the border region in November, after it divided Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh into two union territories. The map had incorporated these areas of Uttarakhand, the territories disputed with Nepal, within India's borders.

13-06-2020||New Delhi||Govt burdening common man with high taxes on petrol, diesel: Congress||The Congress on Saturday accused the BJP-led government of burdening the common man with high taxes on petrol and diesel and earning Rs 2.5 lakh-crore since March 5.Congress leader Kapil Sibal said while international crude oil prices have fallen and are at the lowest level in 15 years, yet petrol and diesel prices are skyrocketing and common people continue to suffer under the Modi dispensation.He said instead of passing the benefit of lower crude prices to consumers, petrol and diesel prices were hiked for the seventh straight day on June 13.“The government has earned as much as Rs 44,000 crore in the last six days due to hike in petrol, diesel prices. Since March 5, the government has earned as much as Rs 2.5 lakh crore by way of increasing petrol, diesel prices.“If the government had even the slightest feelings for the common man, instead of benefitting the companies and the government, the prime minister would have helped the common man with reduced fuel prices,” Sibal said at an online press conference.According to a report by Care Ratings, he said the hike effectively meant that the Central Government is collecting around 270 per cent taxes on the base price of petrol and 256 per cent in case of diesel.The former union minister said petrol was selling at Rs 71.41 in Delhi on May 1, 2014, when international crude oil prices were USD 106.85, while on June 12, 2020, the price of petrol was Rs 75.16 when the crude oil was at USD 38.He said central excise and VAT cumulatively account for 69 per cent of tax on fuel in India which is higher than anywhere else in the world. He said the tax of fuel in the US was 19 per cent, Japan 47 per cent, the UK 62 per cent, France 63 per cent and Germany 65 per cent.

13-06-2020||Mumbai||COVID-19 pandemic showed equal opportunity remains distant dream: Bombay HC||Concerned over the rising number of COVID-19 cases in India and the recent migrant crisis, the Bombay High Court has said that the pandemic has revealed that despite our constitutional guarantees, a society that provides equal opportunities to all remains a “distant dream”.A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice A A Sayed also said that going by the current situation of the economy and health care, “one can hardly think of a fair society in the near future”.It said that the COVID-19 crisis and the lockdown have hit the Indian economy and shown how “pitiable” the condition of migrant workers in the country was.The bench passed a verdict on Friday evening over a bunch of Public Interest Litigations (PILs) filed by several individuals and institutions seeking various reliefs for COVID and non-COVID patients, and frontline workers in Maharashtra.While issuing a slew of directions, the bench directed the Maharashtra government to consider increasing its health care budget and expenditure.It also said that the state must give priority to emergencies while admitting patients.“The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that despite our constitutional guarantees, a society that provides equal opportunities to all remains a distant dream,” the HC said.“The pandemic and the resultant lockdown have destabilised the Indian economy, while wrecking the ‘haves’ and the ‘have nots’ alike...It has shown how pitiable the conditions of migrant workers in India are...And as things stand now, one can hardly think of a fair and just society any time in the near future,” it said.However, it was now time to learn a good lesson and prioritise strengthening the state’s healthcare system, it said.The pleas filed through senior counsels Gayatri Singh, Mihir Desai, and advocate Ankit Kulkarni, had sought adequate testing, PPEs for frontline workers, mobile health clinics, beds, health infrastructure, and a helpline for COVID and non-COVID patients.In its verdict, the high court directed the state government to continue testing and screening for coronavirus aggressively, to develop a “wholesome strategy” for dealing with positive patients of all classes, and to make available to the public real-time information on availability of beds, doctors, etc for both COVID and non COVID patients.The court further said that though unavailability of beds was no excuse for refusing admission to patients, efforts shall be made to first admit those patients who “genuinely deserve treatment and care in hospitals in preference to others who out of fear may seek admission but can wait”.

In the last 10-15 days alone more than 15 terrorists have been killed there, “Naravane told reporters on the sidelines of the IMA’s passing out parade which he addressed as the reviewing officer.“All this has been because of the close cooperation and coordination between all the security forces operating in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.He said a majority of the recent anti-terrorist operations were based on information provided by locals which is an indication that they are fed up with militancy and want normalcy to return to the Valley.          “Most operations have been carried out on the basis of information provided by locals which goes to show they are also absolutely fed up with militancy and terrorism and want that the situation should return to normal,” Naravane said.

13-06-2020||New Delhi||Community transmission of COVID-19 on in many parts of India, ICMR survey not reflective of current reality: Experts||Amid a massive spurt in coronavirus cases in India, experts on Saturday came down hard on the ICMR for its sero-survey findings to assert that there was no community transmission of COVID-19, saying it was not reflective of the current situation and the government was showing "obstinacy" in accepting the truth.Emphasising that community transmission was on in many parts of the country, the experts asked the government to admit it so that people don't get complacent.The assertion by experts from the field of virology, public health and medicine came after Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director General Balram Bhargava at a media briefing on Thursday said that India is definitely not in the community transmission stage of COVID-19 spread while releasing the findings of the survey.India's first sero-survey to monitor the trend of coronavirus infection transmission found that 0.73 per cent of the 26,400 people surveyed from about 65 districts were exposed to coronavirus.AIIMS former director Dr M C Mishra said there is no doubt that there has been community transmission in several parts of the country."With the mass exodus and the country unlocking, it has become more rapid and the disease has reached areas where there were no cases. It is high time the government comes to fore and acknowledges it so that people become more alert and do not become complacent," Mishra told PTI.Talking about the ICMR sero-survey, he said the sample size of around 26,400 people is quite inadequate to capture the scale of the spread of the infection, especially keeping in mind the large population and the diversity of the country.Leading virologist Shahid Jameel said India reached the community transmission stage a long time ago.  "It's just that the health authorities are not admitting it. Even ICMR's own study of SARI (severe acute respiratory illness) showed that about 40 per cent of those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 did not have any history of overseas travel or contact to a known case. If this is not community transmission, what is," said Jameel.CEO of Wellcome Trust/Department of Biotechnology's India Alliance and best known for his extensive research in Hepatitis E virus and HIV, Jameel said an important point to consider is the sensitivity and specificity of the test that ICMR has not revealed, and even a one percent change would make a big difference in the results in areas of low prevalence.Noted lung surgeon Dr Arvind Kumar said that even if the ICMR argument is accepted, it cannot be denied that community transmission is happening in places like Delhi, Ahmedabad and Mumbai."India is a vast country and every state is experiencing the virus differently and peaking at different times," said Kumar, who works at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here."The antibodies take two weeks to develop so the survey is reflective of April. In April, we were in the best possible state. Based on a study representing the April situation, saying that we are not in community transmission is a wrong statement," he told PTI.Chairman of one of the empowered groups set up to deal with the pandemic and NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul had said the results of the survey indicate the situation of the country around April 30 as the study was conducted mostly around third week of May and antibodies against an infection take around 15 days to develop.While the sero-survey to estimate the fraction of population infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the general population has been completed, the survey in containment zones of hotspot cities is ongoing.India's COVID-19 tally breached the three-lakh mark on Saturday with a record single-day spike of 11,458 infections, while the death toll rose to 8,884 with 386 new fatalities, the Union Health Ministry said. With a COVID-19 caseload of 3,08,993, India is now the fourth worst-hit nation by the pandemic.The ICMR is doing a study of containment areas and that study will throw up much higher numbers that are likely to fall in the criteria of community transmission, Paul added.                        Dr Ravi Shekhar Jha, Head of the Department, Pulmonology, Fortis Escorts Faridabad, said he strongly feels that community transmission has occurred.         "The government has stopped contact tracing. Earlier the government was doing rigorous contact tracing, but in the last 7-10 days no government, in Delhi or anywhere, is doing it. They know community transmission is happening, but are not accepting it," Jha told PTI.On sero-survey, he said it has been done in places where there were not many cases and it should have been carried out in Dharawi or Delhi.           If these surveys are not done in proper places then there is no point in doing it, he said."It (survey) is definitely not reflective of the current situation. In the end of April we were in a reasonably good position anyways," he said.Dr Vikas Bajpai, assistant professor, Centre for Social Medicine and Community health at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, said if the government has decided that "obstinacy and blindness to truth" is going to be a matter of policy for it in fighting against this COVID-19 pandemic then it is pointless to try and make them see reason. "Community transmission is a stage when you are not able to track down the source of infection of a positive case despite thorough contact tracing. Then it is presumed that the virus is in general being transmitted in the community," he said.Hitting out at ICMR, he said it has mentioned that the study does not include data from the containment zones and the spread of the virus was not uniform everywhere. So if you exclude the most active areas of transmission which are the containment ones obviously the prevalence rate you will arrive at will not reflect the reality, Bajpai added.Dr Manoj Goel, Director and Head, Pulmonology, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, said it would not be right to believe that there is community transmission at the national-level, but it is definitely happening in certain cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad.The ICMR sero-survey found that lockdown and containment measures were successful in preventing rapid spread of the disease, but a large proportion of the population still remains susceptible.Bhargava had said the study surveyed a total of 83 districts with 26,400 people enrolling for it and 28,595 households were visited. The surveyed districts were categorised into -- zero cases, low incidence, medium incidence and high incidence--- and were selected based on incidence of reported COVID-19 cases as on April 25.        The findings shared with the media stated that data from 65 districts has been compiled till now.

13-06-2020||Helsinki/Tel Aviv||India repatriates 227 stranded citizens from Finland, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia||As many as 227 Indian nationals stranded in Finland, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia have been flown back home under the third phase of the mega evacuation exercise Vande Bharat.National carrier Air India on Friday evening operated its first passenger flight ever from the Finnish capital city Helsinki, bringing back the Indian citizens stranded in the four European countries due to the international travel restrictions following the coronavirus outbreak.Air India's Country Manager in Israel, Pankaj Tiwari, whose office coordinated the repatriation flight, told PTI that the AI 1184 flight landed in New Delhi on Saturday."The repatriation provided immense relief to stranded Indians, especially those who had come to Finland as tourists, business travellers, senior citizens who had been visiting their children and students who finished their academic year," India's Ambassador to Finland Vani Rao told PTI."Among them were a couple who came to Finland for their honeymoon and got stuck for three months. Several are returning to India for medical attention and family emergencies," Rao added.While most of the stranded passengers were from Finland, 15 were from Estonia, some from Denmark and one from Latvia.The Air India flight also brought to Finland 168 people, including 15 infants, who were stranded in India.The special flight was a massive effort and a challenging one because Air India does not have any operations in Finland and all the logistics and ground support had to be handled by the Finnish operators concerned and was managed remotely by the Air India office in Tel Aviv, Rao said."This operation was very special as it was the first ever passenger flight from Finland to India by Air India. Another first was the scale at which thermal screening was carried out at the Helsinki airport -- in the last 15 years a thermal screening operation of so many passengers was not done in Helsinki on a single day," she said.The Finnish government, especially the foreign ministry, the border police and the airport management company, Finnavia, extended their cooperation and support to the inbound and outbound flights in coordination with the Indian embassy and the Air India office in Tel Aviv.The Indian community in Finland also came forward to volunteer in the efforts."While the mission was extremely challenging and needed coordination on several fronts, the happiness of the stranded Indians and their relief at finally heading back home made it completely worthwhile. For the embassy and the Indian community, an Air India flight landing at Helsinki was a moment of pride and a very memorable one," Rao said.Some Indians in Finland and Estonia who could not be accommodated on the flight, and are keen to go back to India, have been advised to take the Vande Bharat Flights from Frankfurt and Paris through direct booking."Handling operations at an offline location is challenging, but with the excellent support from the team of Embassy officials, local authorities in Finland and the Air India team it was a seamless experience," Tiwari said.The third phase of the Vande Bharat Mission got under way on Thursday and will continue till July 2. Phase-III will have 432 international flights from 43 countries reaching 17 states and union territories.A total of 1,65,375 Indians have returned from abroad till Thursday under the evacuation mission, the first phase of which was launched on May 7.

The surgical procedures are currently on," said a party source.It may be recalled that on Friday, Aditya Thackeray had announced that he would not celebrate his birthday on account of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.His uncle, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena President Raj Thackeray also declared he would forego his birthday tomorrow (June 14) and urged his followers to concentrate on helping the people.

13-06-2020||Dehradun||Indian, Chinese armies ‘disengaging’ in a phased manner: Army Chief on eastern Ladakh row||The “entire situation” along India’s border with China is under control, and both the armies are “disengaging” in a phased manner beginning from Galwan Valley, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane said on Saturday, in the first official confirmation of mutual pulling back of troops after the face-off began in eastern Ladakh over five weeks back.The Chief of Army Staff also said military talks between the two armies had been “very fruitful”, and exuded confidence that the ongoing dialogue would “settle” all perceived differences over the Line of Actual Control, the de-facto Sino-India boundary.Gen Naravane was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the passing out parade of the Indian Military Academy.“Both sides are disengaging in a phased manner. We have started from the north, from the area of the Galwan river where a lot of disengagement has taken place. It has been a very fruitful dialogue that we have had. As I said, it will go on and the situation will improve as we go on,” he said.The Indian and Chinese armies are engaged in the standoff in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh. A sizeable number of the Chinese Army personnel even transgressed into the Indian side of the de-facto border in several areas including Pangong Tso.The Indian Army has been fiercely objecting to the transgressions and demanding their immediate withdrawal for the restoration of peace and tranquillity in the area. Both sides held a series of talks in the last few days to resolve the row.“I would like to assure everyone that the entire situation along our borders with China is under control. We are having a series of talks which started with corps commander level talks which were followed up with meetings at the local level between commanders of equivalent ranks,” Naravane said.“As a result, a lot of disengagement has taken place and we are hopeful that through the continued dialogue that we are having, all perceived differences that we (India and China) have will be set to rest,” he said.The military sources, on Tuesday, had claimed that the two armies began “disengagement” around patrolling points 14 and 15 in Galwan Valley and another in the Hot Spring area, adding that the Chinese side had even moved back up to 1.5 km in the two areas.However, neither the Ministry of External Affairs nor the Ministry of Defence responded to the queries about the disengagement so far.People keeping track of the stand-off suggested that there was no evidence so far to show that the Chinese troops were withdrawn from the Indian side of the LAC in Galwan Valley and Hot Spring.In their first serious efforts to end the row, Lt General Harinder Singh, the general officer commanding of Leh-based 14 Corps, and Commander of the Tibet Military District Maj Gen Liu Lin held a nearly seven-hour meeting on June 6.The meeting was followed by Major General-level talks on Wednesday and Friday. The Indian side, on both the occasion, pitched for the restoration of status quo ante and immediate withdrawal of thousands of Chinese troops from the areas which India considers on its side of the LAC.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, on Friday, reviewed India’s overall military preparedness in eastern Ladakh and several other sensitive areas along the Line of Actual Control in Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh.In the review meeting, Rajnath Singh told the top military brass to continue to deal with the situation in eastern Ladakh and other areas with “firmness”, at the same time insisting that the two sides must resolve the row through talks, they said.Following the stand-off in eastern Ladakh, the two sides have deployed additional troops along the LAC, the de-facto Sino-India border, in North Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh in the last few days, the sources said.After the stand-off began in early last month, Indian military leadership decided that the Indian troops would adopt a firm approach in dealing with the aggressive posturing by the Chinese troops in all disputed areas of Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie.The Chinese Army has been gradually ramping up its strategic reserves in its rear bases near the LAC by rushing in artillery guns, infantry combat vehicles and heavy military equipment.The trigger for the face-off was China’s stiff opposition to India laying a key road in the Finger area around the Pangong Tso Lake besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.The road in the Finger area in Pangong Tso is considered crucial for India to carry out a patrol. India has already decided not to stall any border infrastructure projects in eastern Ladakh in view of Chinese protests.The situation in the area deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

13-06-2020||United Nations||India's presence in UNSC will help bring its ethos of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' to world: Envoy||India's presence in the United Nations Security Council will help bring to the world its ethos of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam', the country's envoy to the global body has said, ahead of elections for the non-permanent seat of the powerful UN organ.India is all set to join the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member, elections for which will be held on June 17.India is a candidate for a non-permanent seat from the Asia-Pacific category for the 2021-22 term. Its victory is a given since it is the sole candidate vying for the lone seat from the grouping.New Delhi's candidature was unanimously endorsed by the 55-member Asia-Pacific grouping, including China and Pakistan, in June last year.India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti, in a video message on Friday, underscored that the United Nations as well as the multilateralism need to change to reflect the contemporary realities and remain credible as the world organisation marks its 75th anniversary this year.“India's journey with the United Nations is quite a remarkable one. As a founding member of the United Nations, India's contribution to implementing the goals of the United Nations Charter and to the evolution of UN specialised agencies and programmes has been substantial. In many ways, quite extraordinary,” he said.“I'm confident that at a time when we are poised to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations and later the 75th anniversary of India's independence in 2022, India's presence in the Security Council will help bring to the world our ethos that the world is one family - Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,” Tirumurti said.Ahead of the elections, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has outlined New Delhi's priorities for its candidature.India's focus will be on the ‘New Orientation For A Reformed Multilateral System' (NORMS).India's priorities include new opportunities for progress, effective response to the international terrorism, reforming multilateral systems, comprehensive approach to peace and security and technology with a human touch.Tirumurti said as the UN commemorates its 75th anniversary this year, “it is clear to us that the United Nations and indeed multilateralism itself need to change to reflect the contemporary realities to enable them to remain effective and credible.” The envoy referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for a reformed multilateralism and multilateral system as essential to ensure that the international system is inclusive and caters to the requirements of all countries, which will in turn facilitate stronger actions.“We also believe that the current crisis that we face, especially in the context of the COVID-19, provide the seed for new opportunities,” Tirumurti said.Previously, India has been elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the years 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985, 1991-1992 and most recently in 2011-2012.India has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the Security Council, saying it rightly deserves a place as a permanent member of the UNSC, which in its current form does not represent the geo-political realities of the 21st century.The video message outlined India's role and contribution to the UN over the decades, including its leadership role in the UN peacekeeping, launch of the India Human Development Partnership Fund, Modi's call to commemorate International Yoga Day and India's gift of the Gandhi Solar Park installed on the roof of the UN headquarters.It also highlighted the pioneering men and women from India whose contribution helped shape the world organisation.They include Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar, the first president of the UN Economic and Social Council ECOSOC in 1946; reformer and educator Hansa Mehta, India's delegate to the UN Commission on Human Rights from 1947 to 1948, who is widely credited with making a significant change in the language of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by replacing the phrase “All men are born free and equal” to “All human beings are born free and equal”.Lakshmi Menon was India's delegate to the Third Committee in 1948 and argued forcefully in the favour of non-discrimination based on sex and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit who was the first woman to be elected as the President of the General Assembly in 1953.“Independent India deemed its membership of the United Nations as an important guarantee for maintaining peace and security. We stood at the forefront, not just in the United Nations but outside it as well during the years of struggle against colonialism and apartheid,” Tirumurti added.

13-06-2020||Kolkata||IIT Kharagpur researchers develop AI-based system to track social distancing||A group of researchers at IIT Kharagpur has developed a cyber-physical system based on artificial intelligence for monitoring social distancing in public places, an official said on Saturday.The team, under the leadership of Prof Debashish Chakravarty and Prof Aditya Bandopadhyay, has engineered a low-cost device which could detect the gap between individuals, a spokesperson of the IIT said."The device will play a proximity alert sound through audio output, whenever any violation of the social distancing norms occurs. It captures images of the field view and computes the distance as per criteria set by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare," a member of the research group said.The researchers had focused on the ease of deployment of such a device in remote places and curtailing the cost by using inexpensive and easily accessible hardware materials, he said.Students have come up with the device leveraging readily-available hardware while the lockdown was in place, the spokesperson said.The system has been successfully tested by installing three prototypes of the device within the IIT Kharagpur campus.

13-06-2020||New Delhi||Revive non-motorised transport to fight Covid-19: Govt to states||As people appear to prefer personal modes of commute during a pandemic, the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry has advised states to promote and revive non-motorised transit systems, like cycling, to prevent transmission of the coronavirus.It also asked them to implement cashless technology on public transport systems.Citing the examples of world cities which have promoted non-motorised transport to tide over the COVID-19 crisis, the ministry said New York has added 40 miles of new lanes to support cyclists and Oakland has closed 10 per cent of its streets for motor vehicles.Bogotá in Colombia added 76 km of cycling lane overnight, it said.Similarly, in an advisory to states and Metro rail companies on Friday, HUA Secretary Durga Shankar Mishra said non-motorised transport systems should be encouraged and revived across India.“As most urban trips are clocked in under five kilometres, non-motorised transport offers perfect opportunity to implement in this COVID-19 crisis as it requires low cost, less human resource, is easy and quick to implement, scalable and environment-friendly,” the advisory said.For public transport systems, the ministry suggested a “three-pronged strategy” — with short (six months), medium (one year) and long-term (one to three years) measures.It said public transport should be restarted with “greater confidence of commuters”.It is imperative that transmission of infection through public transport is curbed by adopting the right sanitisation, containment and social distancing measures, the ministry said.“Touch-less systems like BHIM, PhonePe, Google Pay, PayTM and National Common Mobility Card will reduce human interaction in operations of public transit systems,” it said.India has a robust 700 km of operational Metro rail in 18 major cities and a Bus Rapid Transit network of about 450 km operational in 11 cities, carrying 10 million passengers daily. The capacity is likely to remain underutilised for some time as commuters remain wary of using shared systems due to fear of contracting the coronavirus.“Due to the social distancing norms being practiced, their capacities would be utilised at 25 to 50 per cent of pre-coronavirus levels. Such dramatic and dynamic changes in demand and supply will require complementing these public transport systems with alternative modes of transit,” it added.

The two nations should work together to make China observe the rule of law, he said.He held a virtual interaction with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Rahul said tolerance was the DNA of India and the US, and he “doesn’t see that level of tolerance in the two nations anymore.” Those creating divisions and weakening their country are now claiming to be nationalists, Rahul said.According to Burns, “We are not looking for a conflict with China, but we are waging, in a way, a battle of ideas with China.”Rahul suggested positive cooperation with China without going in for a war and said it was difficult for India and the US to make the democracy argument with authoritarianism at play within.In a veiled comments on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India and Trump in the US, where protests are ongoing against George Floyd’s killing, Rahul said, “Those who divide Africans and Americans in the US and Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs in India weaken the structure of the country and call themselves nationalists.”Burns said the democracies in India and the US could always self-correct, but that wasn’t the case with authoritarian nations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/authoritarian-nations-a-challenge-for-india-us-says-ex-diplomat-98459

Now, it has become a general order applicable to all such cases.“There can be no denial that the lockdown measures had serious consequences both on employers and employees,” said the Bench, which also included Justice SK Kaul and Justice MR Shah.Noting that the industry and workers needed each other, it said efforts should be made to sort out the differences regarding wages for the 50-day lockdown during which the MHA notification was in force. The Centre had told the court during the hearing that the said MHA notification had been withdrawn last month.It posted the matter for further hearing in the last week of July.

HP’s cure rate is 54.23 per cent.Government sources said the cure and mortality rates were the best indicators of the quality of state’s Covid response and management.“These two indicators determine the response to the pandemic since the virus is here to stay and a vaccine or a drug is not in sight,” VK Paul, member health, NITI Aayog, said.A growing recovery rate means cured persons progressively outnumber the infected and the proportion of persons susceptible to the virus decreases.
