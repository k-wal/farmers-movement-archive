Such a case had also come to light in Deoria in UP,” Priyanka Gandhi said.In this scenario, such an incident again coming out shows that everything is suppressed in the name of investigations, but very inhuman incidents are taking place in government child protection homes, she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyanka-attacks-up-govt-over-media-report-about-kanpur-child-shelter-home-102303

His two-wheeler was recovered from a spot by the river,” he added.The body was found by National Disaster Response Force personnel on Sunday after 24 hours of continuous search in the flooded river around 3 kilometres downstream from the spot, Baruah said.“We had picked up the girl’s father and a relative yesterday. After the recovery of the body, we arrested them today. Her mother was also arrested,” he said.Meanwhile, Dibrugarh Deputy Commissioner Pallav Gopal Jha imposed prohibitory orders in Lezai and Dewanbari areas under Dibrugarh West revenue circle.A fringe group on Saturday protested in Lezai on NH-37. The protesters blocked the road, burnt a motorcycle and damaged a police vehicle, following which police personnel baton-charged them to control the situation.Jha said that prohibitory orders have been imposed in view of the violent protests and “deterioration of law and order situation leading to serious breach of public peace and tranquillity and loss of life and property”.The orders prohibited any unauthorised movement of person or vehicle in the area, use of communication and speeches aimed at communal hatred, and any activity pertaining to breach of public peace.

21-06-2020||New Delhi||Govt grants emergency financial powers to three services||The government has granted the three services emergency financial powers of up to Rs 500 crore per procurement project to buy ammunition and weapons in view of the escalating border standoff with China, government sources said Sunday.The special financial powers had been given to the forces to procure weapons and military hardware at short notice to enhance their operational preparedness along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), they said.The government has also relaxed certain rules to cut delays in a military purchase like allowing the three services to procure required weapons and equipment from a single vendor, the sources said.Twenty Indian Army soldiers were killed in a violent clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15, triggering a massive escalation in tension between the two countries.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has already directed the Army, the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force to enhance their operational readiness along the LAC, the 3,500 km de-facto border between India and China, amid fears of fresh confrontation.Military sources said the Army is going to use the emergency financial powers to expand its stock of ammunition as there is little possibility of any resolution of the standoff soon.“The three services have been given emergency financial powers of up to Rs 500 crore per procurement project,” said a source.The clash in Galwan Valley was the worst cross border confrontation between the two sides in 45 years. China’s People’s Liberation Army has not yet talked about the number of casualties it suffered.The Chinese soldiers used stones, nail-studded sticks, iron rods and clubs in carrying out brutal attacks on Indian soldiers after they protested the erection of a surveillance post by China on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control in Galwan.The two armies were engaged in a standoff in Galwan and several other areas of eastern Ladakh since May 5 when their troops clashed on the banks of the Pangong Tso.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.Prior to the clashes, both sides had been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it was necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

21-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana cricket great Rajinder Goel dies||Haryana's Rajinder Goel, one of the best and unluckiest cricketers of India, has died today at his residence. He was 77.Goel, who had been keeping unwell for some time, held the record for most wickets in the Ranji Trophy, 637. The left-arm spinner's First-Class career lasted from 1958 to 1985.Goel was one of India's best spin bowlers in the 1960s-70s but could not represent India because of the quality of spin-bowling talent available in India in that era. He came close in 1974 when he was included in India's squad for the series against West Indies. He bought new boots, bat and the entire kit but was not included in the playing XI. Sunil Gavaskar noted in a tribute to him that Goel was one bowler he was "never comfortable against".A very simple, humble man. Highest wicket taker in his last first class season. 750 First- class wickets but never played for India. Was India’s loss. Rajinder Goel ji ko vinamra Shraddhanjali. Om Shanti pic.twitter.com/qTYvalr1nU  Goel was the recipient of the CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award by the Indian cricket board in 2017.Goel's career ran concurrently with that of Bishan Singh Bedi, rated among the greatest left-arm spinners of all time, so Goel could never make it to the Indian team.750 wicketsOverall, Goel took 750 wickets First-Class cricket in a long and successful career in which he represented Patiala, Southern Punjab, Delhi and Haryana.Born to an assistant station master at Narwana (then Punjab, now part of Haryana) in the Indian Railways in 1942, Goel first tasted success for North Zone schools in 1957. He made his Ranji debut in the next season, for Patiala, which later evolved into the Southern Punjab team. He moved to Delhi in 1963 and to Haryana 10 years later.Goel played in an unofficial 'Test' against Ceylon at Ahmedabad in 1964-65 when he took four wickets in the second innings. Gavaskar, in his book 'Idols', noted that he felt the selectors did not really want to give him a chance in Test cricket because Bedi's "return to the team would have been delayed for some time" if Goel had taken a few wickets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/haryana-cricket-great-rajinder-goel-dies-102292
21-06-2020||New Delhi||SC to hear on Monday pleas seeking recall of its order staying Puri Rath Yatra||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday the pleas seeking recall of its order staying this year’s historic Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra, attended by lakhs of people from across the world, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The apex court had on June 18 said that in the interest of public health and safety of citizens, this year’s Rath Yatra, which was scheduled for June 23, at Puri in Odisha cannot be allowed and “Lord Jagannath won’t forgive us if we allow” it.A day after the order was passed, some applications were filed in the top court seeking recall and modification of its order.                              A single judge Bench of Justice S Ravindra Bhat is scheduled to hear on Monday these applications, including the one filed by ‘Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch’, which have urged the court to allow the Rath Yatra.While the Rath Yatra festival, held over 10-12 days with lakhs of people participating, was scheduled for June 23, the ‘Bahuda Jatra’ (return car festival) was fixed for July 1.Three heavily-built wooden chariots of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra are traditionally pulled by thousands of devotees over a distance of three kilometres twice during the nine-day festival of the Trinity at Puri.The application filed by ‘Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch’ has sought recall and modification of the June 18 order, saying the festival is deeply associated to the religious beliefs of millions of devotees of Lord Jagannath and it is “not impossible and impracticable” for the state and district administration to conduct the Rath Yatra by maintaining social distancing and following the Centre’s guidelines.Besides this, a separate application seeking modification of the June 18 order has been filed by one Aftab Hossen, who has said that “as per the ritual of Lord Jagannath, the Rath Yatra is performed in every year and if one year it is not performed, same cannot be performed for the next 12 years”.Hossen, while urging the apex court to modify its order and allow the Rath Yatra, has said in his application that restraining the Rath Yatra this year would practically mean restraining it for the next 12 years and this could create “great repercussion and chaos” in the Lord Jagannath culture and rituals.In its separate application, the ‘Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch’ has said that as per the earlier direction of the Orissa High Court as well as decision of the state government, 372 people were engaged in the construction of three raths/chariots for more than one-and-half months and all were isolated, tested and found COVID-19 negative.“Under the above facts and circumstances the applicant most humbly prayed that the order dated June 18, 2020 as passed by this court may be recalled and modified to the extent that the Rath Yatra ritual may be performed with the help of 500-600 servitors by following the guidelines, maintaining social distancing and with certain impositions and conditions,” said the application, filed through advocate Hitendra Nath Rath.The application has further said that Puri municipality is categorised as a ‘green zone’ and these facts were not placed before the apex court during the hearing on June 18.“Under the above facts and circumstances, it is not impossible and impracticable for the state government and the district administration to conduct the Rath Yatra by maintaining social distancing and following the guidelines of the Central government and the state government,” it said.

21-06-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||US should have cared about Indo-Pak conflict: ex-US NSA Bolton||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 21In stark contrast to the attention paid to the US in New Delhi, former US National Security Adviser John Bolton’s “tell-all” book about his one year at the White House has scant references about India.The few comments that are made about India are not in a positive light. On the post-Balakot military crises between India and Pakistan, the US establishment did not think it would amount to much. But Bolton felt the rivalry should not be ignored as it could snowball into unmanageable proportions as had happened with Iran and North Korea.“After hours of phone calls, the crisis passed, perhaps because, in substance, there never really had been one. But when two nuclear powers spin up their military capabilities, it is best not to ignore it. No one else cared at the time, but the point was clear to me: this was what happened when people didn’t take nuclear proliferation from the likes of Iran and North Korea seriously,” wrote Bolton.Trump, recalls Bolton, flatly rejected India’s complaint that it would be disadvantaged if it stopped buying oil from Iran. Not only will India have to find new suppliers but the price will be higher.“India making this argument was understandable” but Trump simply said there was no need to consult Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“He’ll be okay,” he told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a phone call on the issue.While narrating this incident, Bolton, too, was unsympathetic to the grave discomfort that India will face. He even angrily reacted to bureaucrats who sought to point out that India was buying Iranian oil at prices well below the global market.“It is incomprehensible,” he said on officials stating that “India is so important” or “Japan is so important.”Trump’s indifference to the troubles of allies was not restricted to India but applied in full measure to others as well.“On one foreign leader’s trip to Washington on the same issue, Trump asked his aides to impose sanctions ‘before he gets here, and then I’ll say I didn’t know anything about it’.’’The Trump team also was at odds with India’s ballistic missile\nuclear policy as well as on its stand on climate change in which they believed India got a free ride. “The Paris Agreement was a charade. In this case, it gave leeway to countries like China and India, which remained essentially unfettered,” he wrote.Trump was also bitter over the goodwill for India in Afghanistan in contrast to the Afghan attitude to the Americans. “They hate us and they shoot us in the back while India builds a library and advertises it all over,” he cribbed.Trump had also asked Bolton to look into a news report on India purchasing the Russian S-400 air defence systems, which were reportedly better than America’s Patriot defence system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-should-have-cared-about-indo-pak-conflict-ex-us-nsa-bolton-102286
21-06-2020||New Delhi||Freeze on new posts to cutting down on stationery use, railways set to adopt austerity measures||Calling for a freeze in the creation of new posts, rationalisation of manpower at workshops, shifting outsourced work to CSR, moving ceremonial functions to digital platforms, cutting down on the use of stationery by 50 per cent—the railways is gearing up to adopt a slew of austerity measures proposed by its financial commissioner in view of the serious dent in its earnings this year due to the coronavirus crisis.In a letter dated June 19, the financial commissioner of the railways told the general managers of all the zones that the traffic earnings of the national transporter dropped by 58 per cent at the end of May, as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.“There is a need to explore new areas of expenditure control and enhancement of earnings,” the letter said.It stated that such measures were already announced by the then financial commissioner in 2017 and the Railway Board in 2019.“As you are aware, the railways has been mandated by the government to meet all of its revenue expenses, including pension, from its own receipts. The COVID-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown are, however, likely to adversely impact the budgeted earnings target of the current year,” the letter said.It also advised the zones to control expenditure by reducing staff cost, rationalising staff and also by making them perform multiple tasks. It also asked the zones to review contracts, reduce energy consumption and cut cost in administrative and other areas.“Immediate review of re-engaged staff and feasibility of curtailing the same to a bare minimum shall be explored. Freeze new post creation except for safety-related posts.“Review of posts created in the last two years should be done and if recruitment has not been done against those posts, the same may be reviewed for surrendering, rationalisation of manpower in workshops. Time and motion study of workshops and production units for review of allowed time and incentives,” the letter said.The financial commissioner also recommended that all file work be moved to the digital sphere and advised that all correspondence must be done through secure e-mails. It also instructed the zones to reduce the use of stationery articles, cartridges and other items by at least 50 per cent. It also asked the zones to review and close all uneconomic branches of the ministry.Describing the annual inspection by the general manager as a “big affair”, the financial commissioner said, “Annual inspections should be a silent and a low-key affair carried out with a minimum staff required.”The letter also said all outsourced activities such as onboard housekeeping, linen management, station cleaning, elevator and escalator manning, station announcement should be reviewed and curtailed and attempts should be made to get them done through corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds.The financial commissioner also proposed grounding of all diesel locomotives of over 31 years through sale or export.Railways eases norms for vendorsThe Railways has made its procurement norms easier by allowing vendors who have been approved by one railway institution to be automatically eligible for supply of the same goods and services at other railway establishments.Previously, vendors had to go through the approval process at every establishment.“Vendor empanelled at one place/railway institution for the supply of any goods/service was not considered automatically eligible for supply of the same good/service at other railway establishments in the country. So, his opportunities used to get restricted to supplying those things only at the given one place. In case he wanted to supply the same stuff at other places, he had to go through the entire registration/application/empanelment process afresh for each of the establishment he wanted to supply. This was a long process,” an official explained.This decision, officials said, would not only save time and effort of vendors by doing away with the need of approaching multiple approving agencies but also increase the competition in public procurement, making it more economical and efficient.“This shall also promote better utilisation of manufacturing capacity of the industry in India, helping the cause of ‘Make in India’,” they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/freeze-on-new-posts-to-cutting-down-on-stationery-use-railways-set-to-adopt-austerity-measures-102283

This was the worst cross-border violence between the two armies in 45 years and it had frayed ties between India and China.Following the incident, members from various Opposition parties demanded that a meeting of the standing committee on external affairs be called to discuss the matter.The RSP MP, NK Premchandran, a member of the panel, said a meeting had to be called on the standoff between India and China.“A meeting has to be called at the earliest as it is an issue of national importance. Foreign secretary and defense secretary should be invited to brief the panel on the violence faceoff,” Premchandran told PTI.Former Home Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said all top officials who could throw light on the incident should be called to brief the members.“A meeting must be called and the foreign secretary should brief on the violent stand-off between forces of India and China in Galwan Valley and members must be allowed to call other top officials of the government who can throw more light on this,” Chidambaram said.But BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi said political leaders from across parties should stand united with the government in a time of crisis. She also said there was politics behind this demand at such a moment.“To fight the Chinese wall, political leaders should stand united with the government as a firewall and avoid propaganda and politics,” Lekhi said.Wondering why MPs from opposition parties didn’t demand a meeting of the standing committee amid the COVID-19 pandemic, she asserted that “there is definitely politics behind this meeting (call).”Her party colleague and member in the committee Poonam Mahajan said the meeting wouldn’t be feasible as it could be risky for members of the Lok Sabha Secretariat due to the pandemic.The members had a right to demand meetings of the parliamentary standing committees but these panels were not a platform to do politics on issues of national interest, she said.Meanwhile, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu have asked the secretary generals to explore the possibility of arranging a meeting via video-conference.

21-06-2020||New Delhi||Modi’s LAC comments ‘endorsed Chinese position’: Kapil Sibal||Stepping up the offensive against the government on the Ladakh standoff, the Congress on Sunday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “endorsed the Chinese position” by saying that there was no intrusion into the Indian territory.Congress leader and former Union minister Kapil Sibal said the government should not remain in denial. It should not back down till the Chinese retreat and status quo ante is restored at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de-facto border between India and China.At an all-party meeting on Friday to discuss the situation along the India-China border, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said: “Na wahan koi hamari seema mein ghusa hua hai, na hi hamari koi post kisi dusre ke kabze mein hain (Neither is anyone inside our territory nor is any of our post captured).”Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks triggered massive criticism with the Congress accusing him of surrendering the Indian territory to China. It asked where the 20 Indian soldiers were killed if the Chinese military did not come to the Indian side of the LAC.Also read: Narendra Modi is actually Surender Modi: Rahul’s swipe at PM over LAC face-off“When China violated the LAC and staked a claim on the Galwan Valley and you (PM Modi) said no one intruded into Indian territory, you are yourself saying what China is,” Sibal said at a virtual press conference.“Has not the PM in a way endorsed the Chinese position that they never intruded into our territories. The PM must explain,” he said.“Let no one in the central government remain in denial. Until the Chinese retreat and status quo ante is restored, our government should not let up or appear to cede any part of these territories to the Chinese,” he added.Kapil Sibal asked if the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement wasn’t an affront to the valour and supreme sacrifice of the soldiers who sought to evict the Chinese from Indian territory in the Galwan Valley.In more questions directed at the government, he asked: “Does the government mean that their sacrifice was in vain. Is it not correct that China has never claimed Galwan Valley as its territory? Is it also not correct that China has now committed brazen transgressions into Galwan Valley?”Sibal said the Prime Minister’s remarks contradict statements made by the Defence Minister, the External Affairs Minister and the Army Chief.He asked: “Why is the PM refuting the statement of Defence Minister on ‘Chinese presence in large numbers’ and EAM’s statement that we seek to restore ‘status quo ante’? Didn’t the Army Chief clearly state that ‘disengagement’ is underway?”The Congress leader, however, said the entire country stood behind the government in every step they would take to defend India’s territorial integrity.“India’s armed forces and the people of India will protect our territorial integrity with all our might. We will never compromise on issues of national security,” Sibal said.“China’s brazen transgressions into India’s territory in the Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso Lake area and Hot Springs cannot be accepted. Our territorial integrity will not be compromised under any circumstances,” he said.After Modi’s statement triggered a political firestorm, the Prime Minister’s Officer (PMO) issued a statement on Saturday clarifying that his “observations that there was no Chinese presence on our side of the LAC pertained to the situation as a consequence of the bravery of our armed forces, who foiled an attempt by Chinese troops to transgress into the Galwan Valley”.Attempts are being made to give a “mischievous interpretation” to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks, it said.Twenty Indian soldiers, including a colonel, were killed in the violent face-off with Chinese troops on the night of June 15/16 in Ladakh's Galwan Valley. This is the biggest confrontation between the militaries of India and China after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La when India lost around 80 soldiers while the death toll on the Chinese side was over 300.

21-06-2020||New Delhi||Narendra Modi is not just king of ‘nar’ but also ‘sur’: Nadda||BJP president JP Nadda on Sunday retaliated to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s latest salvo against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying you should understand the language of gods.“Narendra Modi is now Surendra Modi. This has come from your side, even the God is not helping you. It means that Narendra Modi is not just the king of ‘nar’ (men/human beings) but also ‘sur’ (devta/gods). The God is also thinking ‘shubh’ (good/auspicious). You should understand the language of God,” BJP president Nadda said while addressing the Uttar Pradesh Jan Sanvad virtual rally. Also read: Narendra Modi is actually Surender Modi: Rahul’s swipe at PM over LAC face-offNarendra means ‘lord/king of men’ with Sanskrit word ‘nar’ (man) combined with Hindu god ‘Indra’ denoting ‘lord/king’.‘Sur’ in Surendra means ‘devta’ or gods, though Gandhi’s jibe was obviously meant “surrender” or “giving up” as the PM is being accused by the Congress in the ongoing standoff with China at the LAC.Taking a jibe at the prime minister over the ongoing border conflict with China in Ladakh, Rahul Gandhi today said Narendra Modi “is actually Surender Modi”. The Congress leader also referred to an article published in Japan Times, which claimed that India’s “policy of appeasement” has failed to deter China from adopting an aggressive approach towards India.Nadda said the Congress does not even know how a responsible Opposition should behave, advising it to take tuition from the BJP which has a long experience of sitting in the Opposition.“All through the Covid crisis, the Opposition has done nothing but politics. We have been in Opposition for long and have always stood with the government at the times of crisis. The Congress, however, indulged in petty politics throughout the crisis. “You asked us for the road map. The prime minister has a road map ready for the country, you think about your party which is only going down. You don’t even know how to behave like an Opposition. I think you should take tuition from us (BJP), we have been in Opposition for long,” Nadda said also assuring that under the leadership of PM Modi, “every inch of the country and its borders are safe”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narendra-modi-is-not-just-king-of-nar-but-also-sur-nadda-102279
21-06-2020||Vijay Mohan||Scientists at Nainital-based ARIES shed new light on evolution of stars||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 21Astronomers at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nanital, have found that stars of varied ages can co-exist in open clusters.This challenges earlier understanding that all stars in an open cluster have the same age.Open star clusters are a system of stars bound by gravity in which stars are born from the same molecular clouds. All the stars in a cluster follow the evolutionary sequence as per their initial masses at the time of formation of these stars. Open clusters are also important in probing the formation and evolution of the Milky Way galaxy as they are distributed throughout the galactic disk.Scientists at ARIES measured the light emitted from three poorly studied open clusters, NGC-381, NGC-2360 and Berkeley-68 using the 1.3-m telescope situated in the Himalayas for studying the evolution of stars in these clusters. They found two different stellar evolutionary sequences in the cluster NGC-2360, which has been observed in very few open clusters in the Milky Way until now.The team at ARIES, an autonomous institute under the Department of Science and Technology, observed thousands of stars in the three aforementioned clusters. The clusters are found to be relatively older, having ages between 446 Million years to 1,778 million years.Other than the stellar evolution, the researchers also studied the dynamical evolution of these clusters for the first time. The mass distribution of stars belonging to the clusters has shown the preferential distribution of massive stars in the inner part of the clusters while low mass stars are found towards outer region of the clusters.Scientists believe that some of the very low mass stars have in fact, left their parent clusters and may be roaming as a free star like our own Sun.The study, recently published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, a leading journal in the field of astronomy and astrophysics published by Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, has lent important insight about the stellar and dynamical evolution of these clusters.According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology today, the scientists are further aiming to do an in-depth analysis of many more open star clusters in the near future using observational facilities available at ARIES along with the supplementary data provided by other space missions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scientists-at-nainital-based-aries-shed-new-light-on-evolution-of-stars-102275

Their families are starving. They cannot pay their children’s fees,” A L Quadros, General Secretary, MTU said in the letter.According to Quadros, small businessmen and those employed in private offices mainly hire taxis to go to work. “Those who provide essential services avail of public transport and do not hire taxis,” Quadros said in his letter.He alleged that traffic policemen harass taxi drivers who are caught ferrying passengers even if there are just two people in a car.The taxi drivers are also miffed at the government permitting app-based cabs which have resumed operations in Mumbai.There are around 45,000 taxis and two lakh auto-rickshaws in Mumbai. According to the MTU, around a third of the drivers and owners of the vehicles are migrants who have left the city during the lockdown.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-may-ease-norms-for-taxis-autos-102263

21-06-2020||Bhubaneswar||Well-orchestrated plan to stop Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra: Shankaracharya||The Shankaracharya of Puri, Swami Nischalananda Saraswati, on Sunday alleged that there was a well-orchestrated plan to stall Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra this year amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.The Puri seer’s statement comes after Gajapati Maharaja Dibyasingha Deb and servitors sought Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik’s intervention for rushing an application for modification of the Supreme Court’s June 18 order that put a stay on Lord Jagannath Rath Yatra on June 23.They want the state government to seek permission from the Supreme Court for holding the car festival sans any congregation.Dismayed over the cancellation of this year’s Rath Yatra, the Shankaracharya said: “There is a well-orchestrated plan to stop the annual event.”In a video message, the Puri seer said: “On June 20, the Supreme Court could have accepted the review petitions seeking modification of its June 18 stay order. There are precedents of the Apex Court taking up important cases even during vacations.”Joining the chorus for allowing the Rath Yatra in Puri, Rajya Sabha MP and famous sculptor Raghunath Mohapatra alleged that the Supreme Court was given misleading information that there will be a congregation of 10 to 12 lakh people in Puri during the Yatra.Based on this number, the Apex Court has put the stay, Mohapatra, who is also a member of the Shree Jagannath Temple Managing Committee, said.Meanwhile, Gajapati Maharaja Dibyasingha Deb in his letter to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has categorically said holding Lord Jagannath’s annual Rath Yatra in Puri is “sanctioned and mandated”.The Gajapati Maharaja said this quoting the sacred scriptures such as Skanda Purana, Brahma Purana, Neeladri Mahodaya and Bamadeba Samhita.“These scriptures clearly state that Shree Shree Jagannatha Mahaprabhu (also referred to in the scriptures as Shree Purushottama) is the Supreme Lord. He is not an Avatara but the Avatari and the Shree Jagannath Dham is His Eternal Abode on this planet earth,” Gajapati Maharaja, who is also the chairman of the Shree Jagannath Temple Managing Committee, said in the letter to the Chief Minister.The Gajapati also made it clear that the Rath Yatra was not simply a tradition but a ritual being followed for centuries and cannot be stopped in any situation, including the one created due to the pandemic. He said the scale of celebration could be reduced, but the ritual should continue.Earlier, the temple managing committee headed by him had also recommended to the state government to conduct a devotee less festival by sealing Puri town from all sides. The people can witness the festival through television, he said, adding that the state government had not accepted the proposal.The rituals of Akshya Tritiya on April 26 and Chandan Yatra of the Lord have been performed in the temple premises in absence of the devotees.“Since the Supreme Court was not given proper information, it chose to put a stay on the mega festival of the Lord,” said Rabinda Dasmohapatra, president, Daitapati Nijog.Meanwhile, BJP Odisha unit president Samir Mohanty said the state government should pay importance to what Gajapati Maharaja suggested and to hold talks with the Shankaracharya.State Congress president Niranjan Patnaik said the present situation had been created as the state government “failed” to take any concrete decision regarding the Rath Yatra well in time.Despite the mounting pressure from many quarters, the state government is yet to respond to the demand for immediate steps to seek the Apex Court’s permission for holding the Rath Yatra only in Puri by a limited number of servitors in the absence of devotees.Meanwhile, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said he had filed an application for clarification/modification of the earlier order of the Supreme Court.“Today, I filed an application for clarification/modification of earlier order of SC and sought permission for the Holy Rath Yatra of Shri Jagannath Mahaprabhu in Puri scheduled for 23rd June. Hope all our prayers are answered by the Lord of the Universe,” he tweeted.Patra had contested the last Lok Sabha election from Puri seat on BJP ticket but lost to BJD candidate Pinaki Mishra.Puri BJP MLA Jayant Sarangi has also written a letter to the Chief Minister for holding of the Rath Yatra.Multiple petitions have also been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a necessary modification to the original stay order on the festival.Among others, one Aftab Hossen, Odisha Jagannath Sanskruti Janjagran Manch, Daitapati Nijog and International Hindu Mahasangha have filed separate petitions in the Apex Court, seeking modification in its June 18 order.

The education system in India has adopted and accepted the webinars so fast, which is remarkable but we should not make our education system automatic as technology cannot replace teachers,” he added.Dr Pankaj Mittal, Secretary-General, Association of Indian Universities (AIU), said: “COVID-19 enabled us to face the practical aspects of the education system in India.”She further pointed out that within the next two months, the higher education institutes in India should be ready with technical infrastructure, capacity building of teachers and faculty staff, evaluate cost-effective online platforms.“Where education can be imparted, assessment and evaluation system should be streamlined, placement and internship opportunities should be identified, national and international collaboration should be made for students and counselling and mental health session should be organised to culturally engage students,” she added.The new online system has increased the screen time of students and faculties both, which might hamper their mental health in the near future, said Dr Pankaj Gupta, President, IIHMR University.In his keynote address, Dr Kamlesh D Patel, founder and guide, Heartfulness Institute, popularly known as Daaji, said the new pattern would bring phenomenal changes in the education system by laying emphasis on empathy, ethical intelligence, and emotional intelligence.Patel largely defined the purpose of education as flexible consciousness and focused on the process of continuity in improvement and learning. He suggested a harmonious way of living and conducted online meditation session for the speakers and participants.Hailing the Indian education system, Dr Geoffrey Clemants, chairman, Commonwealth Infrastructure Partners, London, UK, reacted that it has deep traditions of knowledge and skills. India should look for global leadership in the domain of higher education and it would inevitably emerge as a world-known leader in transform education.Dr H Chaturvedi, Director, Birla Institute (BIMTECH) and alternate president, EPSI India, said: “With more than 40 million students in higher education space in India, and more than 1.45 lakh teachers, India lacks personal touch in communicating with each other. In the coming years, education institutes should be empathetic towards students who lack technology and are facing monetary issues in their families. We should focus on transforming education by cultivating heartful leadership and heartful teaching methods.”Dr DP Goyal, director, IIM, Shillong; Dr Sandeep Sancheti, Vice-Chancellor, SRM Institute, Chennai; Dr Bhimaraya Metri, Director, IIM Tiruchirappalli; Dr Elizabeth, editor-in-chief, Trainer & Curriculum Development, Heartfulness Institute; Dr Ravi Gupta, founder, CEO & editor-in-chief, Elets Technomedia also spoke on the subject.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/technology-cant-replace-teachers-ugc-vice-chairman-102255
21-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt issues revised order on home isolation||The Delhi Government has issued a revised order stating that the novel coronavirus patients who do not have co-morbidities or require hospitalisation could opt for home isolation following withdrawal of the decision on five-day mandatory institutional quarantine.“All individuals who are positive will be referred to the COVID care centres for assessment of clinical conditions, severity of illness and presence of co-morbidities,” it said in an order on Saturday.An assessment will also be done to check whether adequate facilities like minimum two rooms and a separate toilet exist so that the family members and neighbours are protected and a cluster of cases does not develop in that locality, according to the order.“If adequate facility for home isolation exists, and the person on clinical assessment is found to have no co-morbidities and does not require hospitalisation, he would be offered to either continue to stay in COVID centre/paid isolation facility (hotels etc), or can opt for home isolation,” the order said.The order said the patients in home isolation should follow home isolation guidelines laid down by the Health Ministry and should stay in touch with healthcare providers so that if their condition deteriorates, they can be moved to the COVID hospitals.Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal had directed on Friday five-day mandatory institutional quarantine for every coronavirus patient, but the decision was revoked on Saturday following stiff opposition from the AAP government.The development came after two meetings between the Delhi Government and the Baijal.The AAP government had contended that the mandatory institutional quarantine rule would be seriously harmful as the facilities would not be able to take the burden of the rising number of coronavirus cases.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-govt-issues-revised-order-on-home-isolation-102252
21-06-2020||Naveen S Garewal||Telangana calls BJP prez Nadda 'irresponsible' for COVID-19 comment||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, June 21Telangana has strongly reacted to BJP national President JP Nadda, who charged the state of not doing enough to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. Reacting strongly, the state Health Minister, Eatala Rajender, questioned the BJP president over the COVID-19 response in the BJP-ruled states, which showed dismal performance in tackling the pandemic.Speaking to the media, the Health Minister said: “COVID-19 was raging in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and in other BJP-ruled states and leaders from the national party have the temerity to criticise Telangana for its COVID-19 response without extending much help to the state.”Terming the BJP president’s utterances as ‘irresponsible’, Eatala Rajender said the BJP leader should refrain from such utterances when the entire country was struggling to come up with a cogent response to the pandemic.He said a high-end medical diagnostic device, which was procured by Telangana to enhance its COVID-19 testing capacity, was diverted from Chennai to West Bengal at the instance of the Centre but the BJP president was raising fingers at the state.“That machine could have increased our testing capacity to 4,500 COVID-19 tests per day but it was diverted to West Bengal from Chennai by the Centre. I took up the issue with Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and the Director-General of the ICMR, Dr Balram Bhargava. They said it was diverted because the situation in West Bengal was not good. Without much protest, we focussed on developing our own capacities and abilities. How many times did ICMR change its guidelines? And yet, we kept looking for improvement,” Eatala said.Rajender reminded that Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao was among the few leaders in the country who embraced the concept of clapping and lighting lamps for healthcare workers mooted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Ever since the first COVID-19 case was reported on March 2 in Telangana, the Chief Minister had given the message to avoid politicising the pandemic which has affected the entire country, the state Health Minister stated.He also pointed out that even during the video-conferences with the Prime Minister, Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao was the only lone voice for unity. “We always assured the Prime Minister that we will work together and emerge victorious from the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.The Telangana minister said: “When there is a cordial relationship between the Chief Minister and the Prime Minister and even teams from the Centre appreciated Telangana’s response to COVID-19, such irresponsible comments are an attempt to create unnecessary frictions.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-calls-bjp-prez-nadda-irresponsible-for-covid-19-comment-102250

Two of the death penalties were later commuted to life imprisonment.The prosecution case was that the 25-year-old victim, who was working as a cook in a ladies hostel in Kasaragod, got acquainted with Mohan in 2009.He visited her house thrice and promised to marry her.On July 8, 2009, the woman had left her house, saying she was going to a temple at Sullia.Mohan took her to Bengaluru and when the family members called him about her, informed them that they had got married and would return home soon.He had taken the woman to a lodge near the bus stand.She had a physical relationship with him and before leaving the next day, was asked to leave her jewellery in the room.They went to the bus stand where he gave her a cyanide laced tablet, making her believe that it is a contraceptive pill and left the place, the prosecution said.The woman consumed the tablet and collapsed near the toilet of the bus stand.She was rushed to a hospital by a constable, but was declared dead on arrival.A case of unnatural death was then registered.After Mohan was arrested in October 2009, the victim's sister, seeing his pictures, identified him and filed a complaint, following which the criminal investigation department took up the probe.Public prosecutor Judith O M Crasta had argued the case earlier, which was taken over later by Jayaram Shetty.

These include 503 coaches in Delhi and 372 in Uttar Pradesh.The coaches are “ready to move in’ but there are no takers yet. Two or more air-conditioned coaches will also be provided for the medical staff to rest in.June is a hot month, the hottest in many parts of the country, and the biggest challenge is how to make sure the patients are comfortable. Officials are hoping the monsoon sets in to bring some relief from the infamous Indian summer and some said in hushed tones that the coaches might well be useless otherwise.Using non-air conditioned coaches was mandated by the Health Ministry, they said, adding that temperatures inside the coaches could reach 43 degrees Celsius, making it unbearable inside.The Railways is now experimenting with a variety of options to bring down the temperature inside the coaches. These include bamboo blinds on windows and bubble-wrap on the roof as well as heat-resistant coating and portable coolers.It has also used cover-sheets over the coaches to keep the heat out and the interiors cool.These measures will, however, bring the inside temperature down by up 1 degree Celsius only, an official said.The Northern Railways has also coated the roof of isolation coaches with heat-reflective paint as a trial and found that the temperature inside can be reduced up to 2.2 degrees Celsius using this method.Trials are being planned for another coating developed in association with IIT-Bombay.A trial has been carried out by placing portable coolers inside the coaches as well, the Railways said, adding that temperature reduction of up to 3 degrees Celsius was achieved using them.While efforts are underway to cool things down, officials said they are praying for rain.Giving details of the measures taken to adapt the coaches for COVID patients, they said the middle berths have been removed. Each sleeper coach is divided into eight bays or “cabins” with each having the capacity for 16 beds. Each coach will have three toilets - one western and two Indian style and one bathroom, complete with handshowers, bucket, mug and bathroom stool.The Railways is working to neutralise the risk of infection being spread, officials said. Chlorine tablets have been placed in the chambers of the bio-toilets, which also have bio-enzymes in their tanks to take care of human waste.The Railways has got clearance from the Environment Ministry for a one-time exemption for disposal of biodegradable material generated during patient stay.Space has been created in the coaches to hold IV fluid bottles, extra bottle holders and clamps have been provided to hang them. Two oxygen cylinders with clamping arrangement have also been provided.For segregation of medical waste, there are three different colour-coded dustbins. Mosquito nets have been installed on windows.Bright LED lights and low noise fans have been installed with 18 mobile charging points per coach.Railways will maintain the coaches, provide linen and maybe food as well, depending on feasibility, if requested by states. It will also provide security and wifi connection.According to guidelines from the Health Ministry, coaches will be decontaminated daily with disinfectant---freshly prepared with 1 per cent hypochlorite---and detergent solution. Surface mopping of floors and cleaning of bathrooms,  underside of beds and other related items placed in the coaches will be carried out scrupulously, officials said.

Many injuries resurface due to this torture. There was formation of pus and swelling in my eyes and brain. I have blurred vision in the right eye and I cant see at all from the left one,” she said, apparently referring to her imprisonment in the 2008 Malegaon blast case.Asked about her posters appearing in Bhopal claiming she was ‘missing’ during the coronavirus outbreak, Thakur said she could not return to Bhopal from Delhi earlier because of travel restrictions due the lockdown.Thakur said she along with her staff and security could not get tickets on time due to the travel restrictions.Congress MLA and former state minister P C Sharma claimed that Thakur was in Bhopal when the lockdown began and left for Delhi later for treatment of a small ailment.Talking to PTI, Sharma also rubbished her claim that she was tortured under the Congress regime.“We respect women. How can the Congress torture her when there was a BJP government for 15 years in Madhya Pradesh and six years at the Centre?

India's density may be contributing to this and we've seen high rates of spread in some of the larger metro areas like Mumbai, Delhi and also Chennai,” Jha told PTI."But what concerns me most is major population areas - such as in Bihar and UP - that have not yet gotten hit very hard. When they do get hit we will likely see a large increase in the numbers of cases and deaths, which we need to prepare for,” he said.Jha stressed that the “trajectory” of cases is “very concerning” in India, which jumped into the top five countries in the world in terms of numbers of new cases.“For six days in a row, India has seen over 10,000 new cases, and given the lag between infection, onset of symptoms and death, I expect numbers to continue to rise in the coming weeks and months,” he said in an email interview.The renowned health expert noted that the number of cases in India may be higher than what the data suggests because while testing has been improving, it has not been rolled out in a way that will capture all low-symptomatic patients.Jha said since several factors come into play, it is hard to predict how COVID-19 will pan out across India.Jha referred to the ‘Youyang Gu COVID-19' model, which forecasts infections and deaths from the virus around the world, for an estimate of a probable COVID-19 death toll in India. The Gu model suggests that there could be 136,056 projected total deaths and 27,333,589 total infected people in India by October 1, 2020.Noting that while the number is only an estimate, Jha stressed, “What we do know is that we are not as far along in the trajectory of the disease as we hoped; this may be a 12 month fight or more.” Responding to a question on India's response in dealing with the outbreak so far, Jha said he has supported the national lockdown implemented in March and thinks “it was the right thing to do” but may not be sustainable.“I also recognise the cost of this measure for people across the country. While it may have been the right approach, it's not sustainable. Lockdowns are meant to buy time, so the real question is - How did we use the time that the lockdown gave us? "What is not clear to me is if this period was adequately leveraged to set a strong foundation for getting the disease under control. It is imperative that when lockdowns are employed, they are used well,” he said.Jha noted that in line with leveraging the lockdown, testing capacity has increased somewhat over the past two months but said that it is “still far too low.” India is testing approximately 4.2 people per 1,000, which he said is “one of the lowest testing rates” in the world. It is the lowest of highly-infected countries, compared to the US (72/1000), UK (59/1000), Russia (106/1000).Jha pointed out that while the development of the contact tracing app ‘Aarogya Setu' was a "step in the right direction”, widespread privacy concerns may plague its effectiveness.On what should be done by India to control the infection rate, Jha said a lockdown is never a long-term strategy.“If COVID-19 is going to be the reality for the next 12 months, India requires a detailed plan for how to control this virus moving forward,” he said.He stressed that testing needs to be ramped up significantly and broadened to include more people who are not acutely ill. Further, this testing strategy needs to be paired with comprehensive tracing and isolation efforts, particularly given what is now known about the potential for asymptomatic, or pre-symptomatic spread. There is also a need for real support for states that do not currently have the infrastructure required to meet an increase in cases.   “What it comes down to is India's response needs to be driven by science and data as much as possible; keeping an eye on the number of cases, number of deaths and overall mortality due to the disease. Without the data that widespread testing and contact tracing provides, the government cannot make informed, evidence-based decisions to guide an effective COVID response,” he said.Further, with the majority of India's workforce in the informal sector with limited or no basic labour assurances, Jha said workers are “highly susceptible to stresses in the system such as a lockdown, which is particularly painful, and in some cases, deadly.” He asserted that he disagrees with the view that there are only two options - lockdown completely or engage in high-risk work.“There's a third option: with widespread testing, tracing and isolating, we carefully reopen, in a way that's responsive to risk, making sure that people who do need to work are as safe as possible - taking time off if they contract the disease. "But this requires sustained and country-wide commitment to testing workers regularly, tracing their contacts and safe and supportive isolation for the infected,” he said.

The ties between the two countries came under severe strain after Chinese military killed 20 Indian Army personnel and injured around 76 in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narendra-modi-is-actually-surender-modi-rahuls-swipe-at-pm-over-lac-face-off-102229
21-06-2020||New Delhi||Armed forces told to forcefully deal with Chinese aggression along LAC||The armed forces deployed along the 3,500-km de-facto border with China have been given “full freedom” to give a “befitting” response to any Chinese misadventure, government sources said after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reviewed the situation in eastern Ladakh at a meeting with the top military brass on Sunday.They said the ground commanders of the Army have even been allowed to use firearms in rare cases, in a departure from the decades-old understanding between the two militaries to not resort to gun power in face-offs.The government has also granted the three services additional financial powers of up to Rs 500 crore per procurement project to buy ammunition and weapons in view of the tense border standoff with China.At the meeting, the defence minister carried out a comprehensive review of the entire security situation in eastern Ladakh and all other sensitive areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the sources said.The meeting was attended by Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh and Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria.India has already mobilised fighter jets and sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border with China after 20 Indian Army personnel were killed in a brutal attack by Chinese military in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15.The clash in Galwan Valley, the worst cross-border violence in 45 years, significantly frayed ties between the two countries, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi sending a strong message to China that “India wants peace but if provoked, India is capable of giving a befitting reply”.Also read: Sino-India border situation 'very tough', US talking to India and China to help them out: TrumpReady for any situation along LAC: IAF ChiefNarendra Modi is actually Surender Modi: Rahul’s swipe at PM over LAC face-offGovt grants emergency financial powers to three servicesIn the meeting on Sunday, Singh told the top military officers to maintain a strict vigil on Chinese activities around the land border, the airspace and in strategic sea lanes, the sources said.Following the Galwan incident, the sources said, Indian troops will no longer be bound by the long-held practice of not using firearms in faceoffs. Indian Army is likely to convey to the Chinese military about the decision soon.The armed forces were told to be fully ready to give a befitting reply to any Chinese misadventure, they said adding a “tough” approach is being adopted to guard the border.The two armies had mutually decided not to resort to use firearms during face-offs in sync with provisions of two agreements on border management. The agreements were signed in 1996 and 2005.“Henceforth, our approach will be different. The ground commanders have been given full freedom to take decisions depending on the situation,” a top military official told PTI on the condition of anonymity.The IAF has already moved a sizeable number of its frontline Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar, Mirage 2000 aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to several key air bases including Leh and Srinagar in the last five days.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria on Saturday said the IAF is “well prepared” and “suitably deployed” to counter any security challenge along the border with China and even hinted that his force has flown combat air patrols in the Ladakh region as part of heightened preparedness.Under combat air patrols, fully armed fighter jets can be scrambled at short notices for specific missions.The two armies were engaged in a standoff in Galwan and several other areas of eastern Ladakh since May 5 when their troops clashed on the banks of the Pangong Tso.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.Prior to the clashes, both sides had been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it was necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Singh’s review of the situation in eastern Ladakh came a day before he embarks on a three-day visit to Russia to attend a grand military parade in Moscow to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Germany in the Second World War.The government in 2018 enhanced the financial powers of the three vice chiefs from Rs 100 crore to Rs 500 crore, effecting a five-time increase for augmenting procurement of arms and ammunition and upgrade of defence preparedness. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/armed-forces-told-to-forcefully-deal-with-chinese-aggression-along-lac-102226

21-06-2020||New Delhi||Indian journalist narrates how he beat coronavirus stress with 'laughter medicine'||From the call informing him that he had tested positive for COVID-19 to the one that he was negative for the infection, it was a rollercoaster two weeks.PTI journalist Manik Gupta writes his account of his days in isolation in Jammu where he had gone to meet his family.It wasn't quite 6.30 am when the phone rang. I woke up with a start in my Jammu hotel room where I had checked in three days earlier after coming from Delhi where I work. A new day had begun and so had my two-week nightmare."We are sorry but you have tested COVID positive," said the voice on the other end, polite and emotionless. Numb with shock and petrified, I pinched myself to confirm whether it was happening for real. It was.It was May 25.I broke the news to a friend first, the office next and then my uncle. Not sure how my single mother, who suffers from anxiety issues, would react to her only child being diagnosed with an infection that could turn fatal, we decided to hide it from her as long as possible.The long two-month wait under lockdown in Delhi, nine hours on a Delhi-Jammu train and three days in paid quarantine. It was all to meet my family in Jammu I had been missing desperately. After the train reached Jammu, I had to undergo a mandatory coronavirus test. And it had come to this. Till the week before, I was following the COVID-19 tally. Now I was part of it. A few days earlier, I had interviewed a COVID-19 patient. Now I was the one waiting for an ambulance.Questions raced through my mind: How did I get it? Who could have passed on the infection, the grocery delivery guy at my home in Delhi? The migrant labourer I had interviewed? Somebody on the train? Is the report right?By afternoon, I was shifted to hospital and quickly realised the virus may well be evil number two – I first had to deal with the quality of healthcare. The government hospital I was taken to is a gold mine for stories for a working journalist. But at that point I was just another patient scared for his life.Filthy floor, cobwebs laced in overlapping layers on windowsills, overflowing dustbins without lids, some fans not working and others working, very slowly, and lights in the toilet, a luxury not all wards were lucky enough to have.There were eight other patients in my ward. Most of them, including some who were nearing the end of their mandatory 14-day period, said no doctor, not one, had come to visit them during their stay."They (doctors) say that we are being observed through the camera. They do call once in a while but that's about it. No one shows up. They are all scared," one of the patients told me.  Just as it was all sinking in, the phone buzzed. It was my mother. I answered, and all I could hear were her sobs. As a journalist, I should have realised – news travels fast in small towns but 'COVID-19 news' transmits at the speed of lightning.In less than a day, I had become the talk of Jammu town. From WhatsApp forwards to a half-baked news story, which created full-blown panic, I was the centre of many a conversation."A 27-year-old journalist from PTI posted in New Delhi who had come to meet his mother in Jammu city has been tested COVID-19 positive," a prominent newspaper in Jammu reported.The fact that I was under quarantine and had never made it home found no mention.The publicity had its inevitable repercussions. My locality was virtually sealed. The high levels of fear and my ‘notoriety' resulted in our family food business, which had just found takers after a long lull due to the lockdown, hit rock bottom again.    My phone didn't stop ringing. Be it a friend in Los Angeles or a long-lost acquaintance in Bengaluru, my virus story was viral and how.  Somewhere in the middle of all this, I was also trying desperately to move hospitals. I have shifted to a private hospital the next day thanks to some colleagues and friends. I had been there just one night and already the thought of a single room with an attached bathroom was like the unattainable dream.And so, I shifted late at night on May 26. The room, on the Gynaecology and Obstetrics ward on the fifth floor, had an attached bathroom and also an air-conditioner. I was thrilled.But the entire floor was empty. There were no patients, no attendants, no nurses, no doctors, nobody. And that's how it was for the next 12 days. I showed no symptoms but I had tested positive for the disease. Even so, no doctors were dropping by every day. In my entire stay, there were only two doctor visits. At the end of the two weeks, a lab assistant came to take nasal and oral swabs for a second test. There was no human contact and no wi-fi either. Food was coming from home but it would be sent to my floor in the lift. I'd get a call, wait for the lift and pick up the tray. There would be somebody to clean the floor but no one would enter my room.And just as I was drowning in self-pity, I got a reality check from a doctor friend."Gynae unit, pink and white washroom ... now for god sake don't be the cry baby and complete this picture for us," she joked.I just laughed out loud.Her humour—though cringeworthy—might just have done the trick. I suddenly felt light and positive about the whole scenario and decided not to let the fear of the virus and the negativity control me any further.Laughter is the best medicine, I was told, and since the world was busy finding one for the virus, I thought why not put my weight behind it for the time being. I indulged myself in a newfound genre of PJs (patient jokes) and time-tested wisecracks and started writing a diary. I read books and took on an I-don't-care-two-hoots attitude towards the virus and the havoc it was playing in the outer world.Sometimes, I would take advantage of being the only one on the floor and dance in the empty corridors or play shadow cricket—where I would first bowl like Shoaib Akhtar and then hit the same ball for a six just the way Sachin did during the 2003 World Cup. All the while, harbouring the hope that I would soon be able to knock out the virus from my body in a similar heroic fashion.    That I was asymptomatic for the most part helped. The challenge was psychological, not physiological.        Of course, it is not that I didn't have my low days. Being so close to home and yet so far was troubling. I would see cars coming and leaving from the window and it was unsettling, the fear that my isolation would continue if I tested positive again weighing me down.So what did I do to beat the stress?I thought more and more of the people rooting for me and the effort they were putting in to make my stay comfortable. Like my mother—a rookie in the kitchen—trying her hand at cooking, my grandmother sent me a flower from her well-manicured lawn every day, or my friends, office colleagues and bosses making it a point to check on me every other day.I completed 14 days on June 7.It was an early morning call again. But this was one that brightened my day. I had tested negative. The home was calling and so was my mother.And this time I did meet her.

21-06-2020||Bhopal||94-year-old woman reunites with her family after 40 years with help of Google, WhatsApp||Thanks to the Internet, a 94-year-old woman from Maharashtra who had gone missing four decades ago has been reunited with her family.Unfortunately, when Panchubai, the woman, reached her grandson's house in Nagpur three days ago, she could not meet her son. He had died three years ago.Sometime in 1979-80, a truck driver spotted a woman, clueless and in a pitiable condition, walking along a road in Madhya Pradesh's Damoh district."She had been stung by honeybees and could not speak coherently," Israr Khan, the truck driver's son, told PTI.Khan's father took the woman home, and she began to live with his family. Israr himself was a baby then."We called her Achchhan Mausi. She was mentally unstable and used to mutter in Marathi which we could not understand," he said."I sometimes asked her about her family, but she could not tell anything," he said.Khan also wrote about her on Facebook, but it did not lead to anywhere."She used to talk about a place called `Khanjma Nagar'. Google search of the name yielded no result. Then on May 4 this year, as we were at home amid lockdown, I again asked her about her hometown," he said."This time she spoke about a place called Parsapur. We googled it and found that there is one Paraspur in Maharashtra," Khan said.On May 7, he contacted a man called Abhishek who runs a shop in Paraspur and told him about the woman.Abhishek, who belongs to the Kirar community, told him that there is a village called Khanjma Nagar near the town."I sent him Mausi's video at 8:30 pm on May 7, which he shared on a WhatsApp group of the Kirar community. I received a phone call from Abhishek around midnight, saying the woman had been identified and her relatives traced," Khan said.A video of the old woman was sent to Prithvi Bhaiyalal Shingane, Panchubais grandson who lives in Nagpur. The Shingane family was astounded. They were eager to bring her home, but the wait was not yet over as lockdown was in force.Finally, on June 17, Shingane took his grandmother—whose full name is Panchfulabai Tejpalsingh Shingane—home."We are natives of Khanjma Nagar in Achalpur tehsil in Amravati district of Maharashtra, but the family shifted to Nagpur about five decades ago," he told PTI."In 1979, my father brought my grandmother to Nagpur for treatment of her mental ailment from Khanjma Nagar. The doctors were optimistic about curing her. But one day she left home in the evening, telling neighbours that she was going to her father's place, and disappeared forever," he said."My father searched for her for years without success.He died in 2017. It would have been so much better if I had found her three years ago," Shingane added."At the age of 94, my grandmother is still in good health thanks to the Khan family who looked after her for such a long time," he added.

21-06-2020||Lucknow||UP, Haryana, Uttarakhand chief ministers decide to suspend Kawariya Yatra amid coronavirus crisis||Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Uttarakhand have decided to suspend Kawariya Yatra this year in the light if the ongoing COVID-19 public health crisis.The month long-yatra that Hindu God Shiva’s devotees follow usually begins when Shravan begins, which is on July 23 this year.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath held a virtual meeting with his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar and Uttarakhand counterpart Trivendra Singh Rawat to call off this year’s yatra as the public health crisis continues to mount alarmingly across the country.The three chief ministers agreed to establish dialogue with the ‘dharma gurus’ (religious leaders) of their respective states to inform the people of the decision to suspend the Kawariya Yatra this year in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.Following the agreement with the heads of Uttarakhand and Haryana, Adityanath had a virtual meeting with all police heads across Uttar Pradesh in which he asked them to meet the religious leaders, Kanwar Sanghs and Peace Committees in their respective areas.It is expected that these opinion leaders would take the initiative to widely propagate among the masses the reason for the Kawariya Yatra being suspended this year due to it violating the strict COVID-19 rules of social distancing, sanitization, facemasks etc.The Kanwar Yatra is an annual pilgrimage of Shiv’s devotees known as Kanwarias or ‘Bhole’ to Hindu pilgrimage places like Haridwar, Gaumukh and Gangotri in Uttrakhand and Sultanpur in Bihar to fetch holy waters of river Ganga.Millions travel by foot in groups for hundreds of kilometres chanting ‘bol bom, singing bhajans and dancing to bring back holy water from Ganga for Lord Shiva established in their respective Shiva shrines.Until the late 1980s the yatra used to be a small affair undertaken by only by a few saints and older devotees. However, the yatra also gained popularity among the young in a development that coincided with the mandir movement in the early 90s.In recent years, its popularity has seen a dramatic increase clearly supported by Adityanath’s government. It makes special arrangements by restricting traffic for the Kanwariyas, providing them free food and other facilities on the way, allowing DJs, preventing the sale of non vegetarian food on the route and even making an ADG level police officer shower them with rose petals from a helicopter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-haryana-uttarakhand-chief-ministers-decide-to-suspend-kawariya-yatra-amid-coronavirus-crisis-102219

21-06-2020||Washington||Releasing Rana on bail will strain ties with India: US attorney||Describing 26/11 convict Tahawwur Rana, a Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman as a flight risk, the US has opposed his release on bail, arguing that if he were to flee to Canada, he may escape the possibility of a death sentence in India.“Given the stakes, allowance of bail in any amount would not guarantee Rana’s presence in court. Granting bail would invite the possibility of embarrassing the United States in the conduct of its foreign affairs, straining its relationship with India,” Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian told a federal court in Los Angeles last week.Rana, 59, who was released from jail on compassionate ground after testing positive for the COVID-19, was rearrested in Los Angeles on June 10 following an extradition request by India, where he is a declared fugitive.On Friday, US District Judge Jacqueline Chooljian of the Central District of California scheduled his bond hearing for June 30. His attorney has been asked to submit his plea by June 22 and the federal government’s response is due by June 26.In his submission on behalf of the US government, Lulejian urged the Los Angeles court that Rana be not released pending resolution of the extradition proceeding against him to India.Moreover, to protect the US ability to meet its treaty obligations to India, the US attorney also requested the court to notify the parties within a reasonable time in advance of any contemplated release order.Asserting that Rana is a flight risk, and arguing that his escape to Canada would jeopardize his extradition to India, the US attorney said the court “should detain” him without bond.India seeks his arrest on a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating, and murder under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Rana, the US attorney said, is sought for his role in 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.The complaint details how Rana and his co-conspirator, David Headley, conspired with Lashkar-e-Taiba, which carried out the attacks that killed 166 people and injured hundreds more.Lulejian argued that if Rana is extradited to India and the Indian courts convict him of the charges of conspiracy to commit murder and/or murder, he faces the possibility of the death penalty or life imprisonment.“In light of these serious penalties, Rana has every incentive to flee the US to a country that does not have an extradition treaty with India or a country that may not extradite him without assurances from India that it will not seek the death penalty,” he told the court.According to the extradition treaty between Canada and India, extradition may be refused when the offence for which extradition is requested is punishable with death under the laws of the requesting state and the laws of the requested state do not provide such punishment for the conduct constituting the offence, unless India assures Canada that the death penalty shall not be executed, if imposed.“Thus, if Rana were to flee to Canada, he may escape the possibility of being sentenced to death for his alleged role in facilitating the murder of 166 men, women and children. Rana should not be given the opportunity to potentially create such a result, which would be an affront to the victims and their families, as well as the Indian legal system,” said the US attorney.In addition to being a flight risk, Rana, a convicted terrorist, poses a danger to the community, the US attorney said.As detailed above, a federal jury convicted him of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism in Denmark and to Lashkar-e-Taiba.The fact that Rana conspired with Headley and members of a terrorist organization,  knowing what would happen, demonstrates his lack of respect for human life, Lulejian argued.At Rana’s trial in Chicago, the US presented evidence that but for the intervention of law enforcement aganecies, attackers were planning to storm the Jyllands Posten facility in Copenhagen, take hostages, behead innocent employees of the newspaper, throw their heads to the street below, and set up a stronghold fight to the death with Danish forces.Further, Headley testified at trial that after Rana, who provided him the cover to conduct surveillance of Mumbai, learned that Lashkar-e-Taiba mercilessly slaughtered approximately 166 men, women and children in that city, he praised the attacks, stating that the victims deserved it, he informed the Los Angeles court.“If India convicts Rana of the charges of conspiracy to commit murder and/or murder, he does not face a sentence of years, but instead a potential life sentence or the death penalty. Thus, the justification used for shortening Rana’s sentence is not applicable in the instant case where the penalties are more significant,” the attorney said.Asserting that Rana poses threat to the community if released on bail, the US attorney said in the years since the attacks in Mumbai and the plans to attack the Danish newspaper, he has never publicly expressed remorse for his conduct, disavowed his actions, or his association with Lashkar-e-Taiba, which remains an active terrorist organization.“Rana’s lack of empathy and his callous and wanton disregard for human life demonstrates that he continues to pose a danger to the community today as he did 11 years ago,” said the US attorney. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/releasing-rana-on-bail-will-strain-ties-with-india-us-attorney-102191
21-06-2020||Washington||Sino-India border situation 'very tough', US talking to India and China to help them out: Trump||Amidst the "very tough" standoff at the China-India border, US President Donald Trump has said that his administration is talking to both countries to "help them" resolve their ongoing tensions.Trump's comments came in the backdrop of the violent face-off between the Indian and Chinese armies in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15 in which 20 Indian military personnel were killed, significantly escalating the already volatile situation in the region. According to US intelligence sources, more than 35 Chinese soldiers were also killed during the skirmish."It's a very tough situation. We're talking to India. We're talking to China. They've got a big problem there,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Saturday before boarding Marine 1 on his way to his first post-COVID-19 election rally in Oklahoma."They've come to blows, and we'll see what happens. We'll try and help them out,” Trump said when asked about his assessment of the situation between India and China.Over the past few days, the entire Trump Administration has rallied behind India against the illegitimate incursions of the Chinese Army into the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh.Trump last month offered to "mediate or arbitrate" the raging border dispute between India and China, saying he was "ready, willing and able" to ease the tensions. India virtually rejected his offer to mediate, saying it was engaged with China to peacefully resolve the ongoing border row. China also said both the countries have proper mechanisms and communication channels to resolve their issues through dialogue and consultations.The United States has accused China of escalating border tension with India and other neighbours by trying to take benefit of these countries busy fighting coronavirus pandemic."The PLA (People's Liberation Army) has escalated border tensions with India, the world's most populous democracy. It's militarizing the South China Sea and illegally claiming more territory there, threatening vital sea lanes,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, in a major speech on China a day earlier.In his virtual address on 'Europe and the China Challenge' during the 2020 Copenhagen Democracy Summit on Friday, Pompeo described the ruling Chinese Communist Party as a 'rogue actor.'      Early this week, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president is aware of the situation and the US is monitoring the situation between Indian and Chinese forces along the line of actual control in Eastern Ladakh.During a phone call on June 2 that Trump had with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, they did discuss the situation on the Indo-China border, McEnany said."Trump and Modi have a terrific relationship and trust between them,” Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, said, adding that the statements coming from the White House, the State Department and the US Embassy in New Delhi is reflective of this.Coming out in support of India, Texas Congressman Lance Gooden said that China cannot be trusted."As more news comes out about the deadly conflict between China and India, once again CHINA appears to be an aggressive bad actor,” the Republican Congressman said.“The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) cannot be taken at their word, EVER,” Gooden said in a tweet.On the Senate floor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that “on land, for the sake of grabbing territory, the PLA appears to have instigated the most violent clash between China and India since those nations went to war in 1962”.Needless to say, the rest of the world has watched with grave concern this violent exchange between two nuclear states. We are encouraging de-escalation and hoping for peace,” McConnell said.Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell earlier said that this Chinese activity is similar to activity the world has seen in the past on border disputes with the People's Republic of China.“I would point you to those – I think it was 2015 when Xi Jinping travelled to India the first time,” he said."The PLA (People's Liberation Army) invaded this contested area deeper and longer, with more people, than ever before historically. Whether that was a negotiating tactic or just a punch in the nose to demonstrate their superiority, I don't know,” he told reporters early this week.“But then we saw the Doklam issue down near Bhutan, where we saw similar concerns.  I wish I knew. Again, we don't have a lot of visibility and we don't have a lot of open dialogue with our Chinese counterparts, and honestly, I'd like to see more of that if we can,” Stillwell said.US experts feel that the latest Chinese behaviour will swing India towards China.“Even before the latest flareup, a majority of Indian strategists saw Chinese assertiveness as India's biggest foreign-policy challenge. This has resulted in an unspoken but unmistakable swing toward the US," Jeff Smith from The Heritage Foundation think tank said.“The bullying of US partners and allies needs to come at a cost,” Smith said in a tweet.The US is currently involved in a tense showdown with China on the issue of trade, the origins of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Beijing's new security crackdown in Hong Kong and the communist giant's aggressive military moves in the disputed South China Sea.

21-06-2020||New Delhi||India witnesses annular solar eclipse, Sun appears like 'ring of fire'; see pictures||An annular solar eclipse, wherein the Sun appears like a ring of fire, is currently underway but cloudy skies are likely to play a spoilsport for sky gazers in the national capital.The annular phase began at 10.19 am and will end at 2.02 pm.The annular phase was visible on Sunday morning from some places within a narrow corridor of northern part of the country (parts of Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttarakhand). Few prominent places within this narrow annularity path are Dehradun, Kurukshetra, Chamoli, Joshimath, Sirsa, Suratgarh.It will be seen as a partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country.The annular path also passes through Congo, Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, and China.The annular path also passes through Congo, Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, and China. Tribune photo/Pradeep TiwariObscuration of the Sun by the Moon at the time of greatest phase of partial eclipse will be around 94 per cent in Delhi.N Rathnashree, Director of Nehru Planetarium, said visibility of the eclipse is being hampered due to solar eclipse.The next annular eclipse will be seen from South America in December 2020. Another annular eclipse will occur in 2022, but that it will be hardly visible from India, Rathnashree added.  A solar eclipse occurs on a new moon day when the Moon comes in between the Earth and the Sun and when all the three objects are aligned.             An annular solar eclipse will occur when the angular diameter of the Moon falls short of that of the Sun so that it cannot cover up the latter completely. As a result, a ring of the Sun’s disk remains visible around the Moon. This gives an image of a ring of fire.Rathnashree cautioned that eclipsed Sun should not be viewed with the naked eye, even for a very short time as it can cause permanent damage of the eyes leading to blindness even when the Moon covers most portion of the Sun.   Safe technique to observe the solar eclipse is either by using proper filter like aluminised mylar, black polymer, welding glass of shade number 14 or by making projection of the Sun’s image on a white board by telescope. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-witnesses-annular-solar-eclipse-sun-appears-like-ring-of-fire-see-pictures-102181

In Rajasthan, the fortunes reversed, with the BJP bagging one seat and the Congress two. Earlier, it won three seats unopposed.Overall the ruling party managed to gain crucial ground in the Upper House, winning eight of the 19 seats in the first major electoral exercise since the Covid outbreak, though it failed to get that one extra seat from Rajasthan amid allegations of “poaching” by the Congress ahead of the polls. To say the BJP did not try a MP or a Karnataka in Rajasthan to win one extra seat is difficult to believe as much as its leaders may deny, say observers. Otherwise why did it field a second candidate knowing well it did not have the numbers?Its second candidate in Rajasthan lost, adding to the persona of CM Ashok Gehlot.In spite of “rumours” of various shades and sorts, including that Rajasthan Deputy CM Sachin Pilot was “seen” with some top BJP leaders, the general consensus was even if the saffron party was trying a Madhya Pradesh or a Karnataka in Rajasthan itmay not find it as easy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-gains-critical-ground-in-rajya-sabha-102000
