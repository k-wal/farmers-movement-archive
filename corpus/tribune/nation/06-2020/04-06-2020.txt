He said Delhi-NCR should be considered as a single region and Delhi’s borders with Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Sonepat should be opened.Terming the UP and Haryana administrations’ decisions to restrict movement for permissible activities in NCR through “blanket orders of sealing borders without reasonable exceptions” as illegal, he said it violated citizens’ rights.The top court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to take instructions as to how to resolve the difficulties faced by commuters in NCR due to restrictions on inter-state movement.The Bench said there was a recommendation that suggested a common pass for the entire NCR region.The restrictions violated MHA’s May 1 guidelines which allowed traffic movement for permissible activities, Bhalla alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-delhi-up-haryana-to-prepare-plan-for-smooth-movement-in-ncr-94516

It is cruel, wrong and illegal but such incidents do happen at places where wild animals create problems for farmers. The legal way to get rid of wild boars is long and tortuous,” they said.Incidentally, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, who said killers would not be spared, named Kerala several times to assert it is “not an Indian culture to feed firecrackers and kill”.Several BJP leaders have used Maneka Gandhi’s statement to target the Pinarayi Vijayan government in the state where the party is trying to make inroads.“It is not an incident. It is a murder. A pregnant elephant was fed a pineapple filled with a bomb that exploded its mouth. Malappuram is very famous for incidents like this. It is the most violent district in the whole of India. For instance, they throw poison on roads so that 300 to 400 birds and dogs die at one time. The Kerala government has not taken any action in Malappuram,” Maneka Gandhi was quoted as saying.Vijayan said the investigation was underway and the state government would take strict actions against the culprits.However, according to the officials, it was not so easy to punish in such cases.“The issue is too complex and layered. ‘Gundu’, a firecracker used during celebrations, is often inserted in fruits to scare wild animals. There is also no evidence to suggest that the elephant was intentionally fed the explosive. Traps are laid to snare the wild boars/pigs not only in Kerala but also Karnataka.“Arrests will be made but they will get away due to lack of evidence. Farmers use the illegal way to get rid of wild animals because the legal way is long and tortuous,” the officials said.Originally belonging to the Silent Valley National Park (SVNP) in Palakkad, the elephant died at Velliyar River with its trunk in the water.Due to the explosion, it received deep injuries in the upper and lower jaws, after which the areas were filled with maggots. Because of the injuries, the elephant could not eat or drink anything for weeks, as per the reports.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maneka-says-malappuram-famous-for-such-incidents-forest-officials-say-no-one-fed-elephant-pineapple-intentionally-94514

For almost all of them, it was their first experience of air travel.“I am happy to have come back safely. I am thankful to all those who helped us return,” said Rajni Chandra (28) who was carrying her two-year-old child in her arms.Chandra, who worked as a labourer at a construction site in Karnataka, was stuck there after lockdown was imposed in March to contain coronavirus.She was a bit jittery as she was traveling by aircraft for the first time, but the journey will remain etched in her memory forever, she said.The Raipur district administration made arrangement for medical screening of arriving migrants at the airport and provided buses to ferry them to their respective districts, said a local official.The passengers will be quarantined after they reach their home districts, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/law-school-alumni-donors-help-airlift-179-migrants-to-raipur-from-bengaluru-94511

India’s huge demand brings down the global price of vaccines.           “In today’s challenging context, I want to reiterate that India stands in solidarity with the world. Our proven capacity to produce quality medicines and vaccines at low cost, our own domestic experience in rapidly expanding immunisation, and our considerable scientific research talent are all at the service of humanity,” he said.Modi was among around 35 heads of state and government participants, including US President Donald Trump, to virtually join the conference aimed at raising USD 7.4 million to immunise a further 300 million children in the world’s poorest countries by 2025.Modi pledged that the world can “count on India’s support” in the critical mission of vaccination against infectious diseases, highlighting the country’s role as the world’s fourth-largest producer of vaccines.The Indian prime minister also pointed to the government’s Mission Indradhanush, which aims to ensure full vaccination of children and pregnant women, as a sign of the importance attached to immunisation within the country.He said: “We are fortunate to contribute to the immunisation of about 60 per cent of the world’s children. India recognises and values the work of Gavi, which is why we became a donor to Gavi while still being eligible for Gavi’s support.”            “Gavi is not just a global alliance, it is also a symbol of global solidarity and a reminder that by helping others, we can also help ourselves,” he said.The UK government said the funding raised from the summit will not only protect children from deadly diseases like polio, diphtheria and measles and save up to 8 million lives, but will also help ensure a global recovery from the coronavirus.“Just as the UK is the single biggest donor to the international effort to find a coronavirus vaccine, we will remain the world’s leading donor to Gavi, contributing 1.65 billion pounds over the next five years. I urge you to join us to fortify this lifesaving alliance and inaugurate a new era of global health cooperation, which I believe is now the most essential shared endeavour of our lifetimes,” Johnson said in his address.The UK said vaccinating millions of children against these other deadly diseases would help protect healthcare systems in the world’s poorest countries so they can cope with rising coronavirus cases.Health experts have warned that if the virus is left to spread in developing countries, this could lead to future waves of infection reaching the UK, Downing Street said.As the world focuses on tackling coronavirus, the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF and Gavi have warned that the pandemic is disrupting routine immunisation, affecting approximately 80 million children under the age of one across 68 countries.“The world is quite rightly focusing on responding to the invisible killer that is coronavirus. But we cannot allow this pandemic to disrupt routine immunisation in some of the world’s poorest countries and cause other deadly diseases to spread across the globe,” said UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.“We know vaccines work, which is why at today’s summit we need others to step up and pledge funds to Gavi, so it can continue to save the lives of millions of children and protect everyone from infectious diseases,” she said.

We are prepared to take all appropriate action to defend our businesses and workers against any such discrimination,” said USTR Robert Lighthizer in a statement.Four years back, India levied six per cent tax on for advertisements hosted on off-shore businesses such as mobile phone apps, social media platforms and digital content streaming services.This was fine with the USTR, but it has opposed the latest Union Budget expanding the scope of the equalisation levy (tax) to revenues generated by non-resident e-commerce firms operating in India.Though the levy is two just two per cent, the US is keen on a probe.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/another-trade-irritant-with-us-as-it-starts-probe-into-digital-services-taxes-adopted-by-10-countries-94509

04-06-2020||New Delhi||Urban learning internship programme launched for engineering graduates||The Centre, on Thursday, launched an urban learning internship programme — TULIP — for fresh engineering graduates, who will get an opportunity to work for 4,400 urban local bodies and 100 smart cities in the country.Housing and Urban Development Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ jointly launched an online portal of The Urban Learning Internship Programme, which will allow applicants internship for up to one year in areas like urban planning, financing, environmental engineering, sanitation and infrastructure.Puri said urban services in the country were very comprehensive and this programme offered on-ground experience for fresh engineering graduates, asserting that ‘it is a dynamic model”.He said both ULBs and smart cities could utilise the fresh ideas of the young people in improving services and making local bodies effective.Pokhriyal said the government aimed to provide internship to one crore youths in the next five years.Housing and Urban Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra said the Ministry was working on producing “specialised cadre” that could be utilised in different sectors.He said the online portal would provide a common platform to interested candidates, ULBs and smart cities, who would post details of their requirements.“This is a flexible programme. We have set a target of providing 25,000 fresh engineering graduates in the next one year. An applicant will also have liberty in choosing his or her subject like sanitation, urban planning, infrastructure and financing,” Mishra said.He said the government was soon going to launch “Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0” where water management will be in focus.According to the government, the new programme would lead to infusion of fresh ideas and energy with engagement of youth in co-creation of solutions for solving India’s urban challenges.It also said it would further government’s endeavour to boost community partnership and government-academia-industry-civil society linkages.An MoU has also been signed between the MoHUA and the All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) as per which technical support for the platform shall be anchored by the AICTE and the programmatic non-technical support shall be anchored by the MoHUA.A Steering Committee chaired by Secretary, HUA, including AICTE chairman and other officials from the MoHUA and the AICTE, has also been constituted to review the progress of the programme on a periodical basis.The plan to introduce the programme was announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the budget speech.“Such a programme will help reap the benefits of India’s demographic dividend as it is poised to have the largest working-age population in the world in the coming years. India has a substantial pool of technical graduates for whom exposure to real world project implementation and planning is essential for professional development. General education may not reflect the depth of productive knowledge present in society. Instead of approaching education as ‘doing by learning,' our societies need to reimagine education as ‘learning by doing’,” the HRD minister said.

04-06-2020||New Delhi||Steps taken but onus on healthcare workers to protect themselves from COVID-19: Centre to SC||The Centre, on Thursday, told the Supreme Court that though hospitals were responsible for implementing the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) activities, the final responsibility lies with the healthcare workers to protect themselves from COVID-19.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare told the Supreme Court that it was the responsibility of the healthcare workers to adequately train themselves and take all possible measures for preventing the infection, which not only include COVID-19 but other diseases as well.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MR Shah allowed petitioner Dr Arushi Jain’s counsels advocate Mithu Jain and Arjun Syal to file the rejoinder affidavit to the Centre’s reply within a week and posted the matter for June 12.Arushi Jain, a private doctor, in her plea has questioned the Centre’s new Standard Operating Procedure of May 15 for the frontline COVID-19 HealthCare Workers (HCWs) by which it has ended the 14-day mandatory quarantine for them.In its reply to the plea, the Ministry said: “It is submitted that while the Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC) in the health facility is responsible for implementing the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) activities and for organising regular training on the IPC for the HCWs, the final responsibility lies with the HCW to prevent infection and to protect himself/ herself.”It said it was also his/her responsibility to adequately train himself/herself and take all possible measures for preventing the infection, and if adequate measures were scrupulously observed, the HCWs chances of contracting the infection would not be higher than that of any other person.“…It is submitted that the current pandemic of COVID-19 is unprecedented and there is no time tested and universally acceptable protocol pertaining to COVID-19 preparedness. Furthermore, the biggest challenge to deal with this pandemic is that there are currently no proven therapeutics or vaccines or rapid point of care diagnostic tests, risk assessment and management protocols for COVID-19 and here are major research gaps in many other key areas of COVID patient and hospital management,” the Ministry said.Justifying the advisory and SOPs of May 15, the Health Ministry said it was a step in the right direction and the guidelines emphasised the role of taking adequate preventive measures by all HCWs working in the hospital setting against the likelihood for contracting the infection at their workplace.It added that the risk profiling of those exposed had been deliberated in detail in the technical body under the Directorate General of Health Services, the Joint Monitoring Group (JMG), which also had a representative of the World Health Organisation.“This risk assessment approach is also in line with guidelines issued by the Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, US, that only high-risk exposure needs to be quarantined for 14 days. Hence, mandatory quarantine for 14 days, after rostering duty of health care workers of 7/14 days is therefore not justified and warranted,” it added.The Ministry, in its reply affidavit, said healthcare workers were properly protected by PPEs in workplace settings carries no additional risk to their families or children.It said the grievances raised by the petitioner with regard to the infirmities in the new guidelines dated May 15, issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare were completely presumptuous, vacuous, ill-founded and sans any empirical or medical evidence.“It is most respectfully submitted that the number of cases of COVID-19 is constantly increasing and at some point of time in near future, apart from existing hospitals, a large number of temporary make-shift hospitals will have to be created in order to accommodate COVID-19 patients requiring admission, medical care and treatment,” it said.The government said to successfully create an optimum infrastructure to provide best medical care to the COVID patients, the Central Government would also have to adequately address human resource issue for this envisaged surge capacity scenario.“Hence, conserving healthcare workforce is the need of the hour in order to cater to the anticipated patient load in the hour of distress,” it said.The Supreme Court, on May 26, had asked the Centre to file a reply on the affidavit filed by Dr Jain raising questions on the May 15 advisory which ended the 14-day mandatory quarantine for all health care workers in COVID and non-COVID areas.As per the advisory, quarantine of healthcare workers, other than the two categories — in case of high exposure to COVID-19 and in cases of healthcare workers showing symptoms of COVID-19 — was not warranted, the plea had said.On April 8, the Apex Court had observed that the doctors and medical staff are the “first line of defence of the country” in the battle against COVID-19 pandemic and directed the Centre to ensure that appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) were made available to them for treating COVID patients.While passing a slew of interim directions to ensure the safety of doctors and healthcare professionals, the Apex Court had expressed concern over the recent incidents of attack on them and directed the Centre, all states and Union Territories to provide necessary police security to the medical staff in hospitals and places where patients, who are either quarantined, suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19, are housed.

We hope the Security Council will designate them soon,” it added.

However, there is a further legal issue that needs resolving before Mr Mallya’s extradition can be arranged,” the spokesperson said.“Under United Kingdom law, extradition cannot take place until it is resolved. The issue is confidential and we cannot go into any detail. We cannot estimate how long this issue will take to resolve. We are seeking to deal with this as quickly as possible,” the official added.On May 21, the spokesperson in the external affairs ministry said India was in touch with the British government over Mallya’s extradition after he exhausted all legal options against New Delhi’s request to the UK to extradite him.The UK top court’s decision marked a major setback to the 64-year-old businessman as it came weeks after he lost his high court appeal in April against an extradition order to India.Mallya has been based in the UK since March 2016 and remains on bail on an extradition warrant executed three years ago by Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017.The high court verdict in April upheld the 2018 ruling by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot at the end of a year-long extradition trial in December 2018 that the former Kingfisher Airlines boss had a “case to answer” in the Indian courts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/legal-issue-needs-to-be-resolved-before-mallyas-extradition-uk-govt-94477

Several of these members had tested positive for COVID-19.The lockdown from March 25 was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.The Tablighi Jamaat members were blamed for the spread of COVID-19 in more than 20 states and Union Territories with more than a thousand COVID-19 positive cases and over two dozen deaths traced to them.Among blacklisted members were nationals from nearly 40 nations.They are the US, the UK, France, Australia, Russia, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam,  Saudi Arabia, Algeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Iran, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, the Philippines, Qatar, Senegal,  Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Sweden, Tanzania, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia and Ukraine.The government has already decided not to issue a tourist visa to any foreigner who wishes to visit India and take part in Tablighi activities.After finding of their illegal stay in India, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba had also told the states and UTs to take action against foreigners, who had participated in the missionary activities of the Tablighi Jamaat, for violation of visa conditions.In April, the Home Ministry had directed DGPs of all states and UTs, and the Delhi Police Commissioner to take necessary legal action against all such violators, on priority, under relevant sections of the Foreigners Act, 1946, and the Disaster Management Act, 2005.Last week, the CBI has registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) against the organisers of Tablighi Jamaat for alleged dubious cash transactions and hiding of foreign donations from authorities.The enquiry was registered on a complaint that the organisers of the Jamaat were indulging in dubious cash transactions through illegal and unfair means, the officials said.The Delhi Police have also registered a case against the Tablighi Jamaat and its office bearers. The head of the organisation, Maulana Saad, is still to be apprehended by police.

04-06-2020||Lucknow||Babri demolition: BJP leader Vinay Katiyar, five others appear before CBI court||BJP leader Vinay Katiyar, former MP Ram Vilas Vedanti and four other accused appeared before a special CBI court in the Babri demolition case here on Thursday.The court, however, recorded the statement of only Vijay Bahadur Singh for want of time and asked the rest to appear before it on Friday.Others who appeared before the court were Pawan Pandey, Santosh Dubey and Gandhi Yadav.Special Judge S K Yadav also directed them to furnish in writing the defence evidence, if any, after the recording of their statement.Thirty-two people, including former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh, ex-deputy prime minister L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar, Sadhvi Rithambara and Sakshi Maharaj, are facing trial in the case.L K Advani, M M Joshi and Uma Bharti have been exempted from personal appearance till further orders.This stage of the trial is also meant to explain to the accused the evidence gathered against them by the prosecuting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation.The Babri Masjid was demolished in December 1992 by “karsevaks” who claimed that the mosque in Ayodhya was built on the site of an ancient Ram temple.The prosecution had wrapped up the examination of its witnesses by March 6 and the court asked some of the accused to appear before it on March 24 for recording their statements under Section 313 of the CrPC.But the proceedings did not take place as the court in Lucknow closed due to the coronavirus crisis.When the proceedings resumed on May 18, the defence counsel moved an application to summon three prosecution witnesses in order to cross examine them. This was allowed.On April 19, 2017, the Supreme Court had ordered the special judge to conduct a day-to-day trial, concluding it in two years.Calling the demolition of the disputed structure a crime which shook the “secular fabric of the Constitution”, it allowed the CBI plea on restoration of criminal conspiracy charge against the VIP accused.The court had termed the Allahabad High Court’s February 12, 2001 verdict dropping conspiracy charge against Advani and others as “erroneous”.On May 8 this year, the top court set a new deadline for the special judge, asking him to deliver the verdict by August 31.Before the 2017 verdict of the apex court, there were two sets of cases relating to the demolition, going on in Lucknow and Raebareli.The first case involving unnamed “karsevaks” proceeded in a Lucknow court and the second set of cases relating to eight VIPs was being heard in a Raebareli. The cases were then clubbed.Last year, another bench of the Supreme settled the land dispute over the site where the mosque stood.The SC allowed the construction of a Ram temple at the site and ordered the allocation of a separate plot in Ayodhya for building a mosque. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/babri-demolition-bjp-leader-vinay-katiyar-five-others-appear-before-cbi-court-94468

The BMS is committed to fight until it stops the government from taking the anti-public sector and anti-worker decisions. BMS will launch a nationwide agitation on June 10 under the banner ‘Save Public Sector, Save India’,” the body said.A meeting of the National Coordination Committee of Public Sectors of the BMS was held on Tuesday and Wednesday.The meeting was attended by representatives of BMS unions in the sectors of coal, non-coal, defence, railway, postal, banking, insurance, steel, marine and PSUs like telecom, power, heavy engineering, oil and gas, aviation, chemical, currency and coins, atomic energy, etc, it said.The meeting was held to decide the plan of action by the BMS against “the process of privatisation aggressively pursued by the Central Government in different names in various sectors such as the commercialisation of coal sector, corporatisation of defence ordnance factories board and railway, strategic sale of PSUs, merger and privatisation of banks, Insurance, increasing FDI cap etc.”Public sector’s contribution to the national economy has been significant, BMS said, adding it is being observed from past few decisions of the government that it is trying to push and impose unjust decisions on the workers of the country.The advisors to the government are the dearth of ideas to generate revenue, hence the only way out they provide to the government is corporatise and privatise, it said.“Such predatory advisors are working against the interest of the nation.”The government should start consulting stakeholders to find out other means to address fiscal deficit and revenue generation, the union added.The government has already tried to sell loss-making units, but no buyer was ready to take up these, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bharatiya-mazdoor-sangh-to-hold-nationwide-agitation-against-govts-privatisation-drive-on-june-10-94465

SIT formed for the purpose is making a significant headway in this regard. Forest Dept will leave no stone unturned to ensure max punishment to the offenders," the Department said in a tweet.However, it also said there was no conclusive evidence that injury to the animal's lower jaw was caused by pineapple stuffed with cracker and this might be a possibility."There's no conclusive evidence that injury to lower jaw was caused by pineapple stuffed wd cracker. However, this may be a possibility. Dept. has booked offence against unknown offenders, whose identity is being established," another tweet said.As the incident triggered an outrage, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday said a wildlife crime investigation team from Kozhikode has been dispatched to the place of the incident in Mannarkad Forest division in Palakkad district.The Centre, which took serious note of the incident, has sought a report from the state.Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday said the Centre has sought a complete report and assured stern action will be taken against the culprits involved."We have sought a complete report on the incident. Stern action will be taken against the culprits," he had said.In a tweet on Thursday, the Minister condemned the incident, saying "This is not an Indian culture to feed fire crackers and kill.""We will not leave any stone unturned to investigate properly and nab the culprit(s)," the Minister said in a tweet.The elephant died at Velliyar River on May 27 after efforts by forest personnel to bring it to the river bank using two other trained elephants failed."Her jaw was broken, and she was unable to eat after she chewed the pineapple and it exploded in her mouth," a senior forest official had said earlier.The post-mortem revealed that the pachyderm was pregnant.Voicing concern over the incident, Bollywood celebrities including Anushka Sharma, Shraddha Kapoor, Randeep Hooda demanded strict action against animal cruelty.The pachyderm's tragic end in the Silent Valley forest came to light after Mohan Krishnan, a forest officer, posted an emotional note on his Facebook page, narrating it."When we saw her she was standing in the river, with her head dipped in the water. She had a sixth sense that she was going to die.

But now this cyclone has lost its intensity and weakened into a low pressure area.”“In the changing weather conditions, there is a possibility that Nisarga may enter Madhya Pradesh from its southern parts like Betul, Chhindwara and Seoni around 7 pm on Thursday,” he said.According to the forecast, the cyclone is likely to have an impact in the areas under Narmadapuram, Bhopal, Sagar, Rewa, Jabalpur and Shahdol divisions in the coming hours.The meteorologist said that in the 24 hours that ended 8.30 am on Thursday, the places that recorded maximum rainfall include Segaon (136 mm), Khandwa (132 mm), Sendhwa (104 mm), Niwali (102 mm), Sonkatch (100 mm), Bhainsdehi (95.4 mm) and Amarpur (94 mm).The state government has put the administration on alert and told the authorities to be prepared to deal with the situation.In some districts, including Indore, citizens were urged to remain indoors.Several parts of MP have been getting showers since Wednesday night, which has brought relief from the sweltering heat.Barring parts of Gwalior and Chambal divisions, rainfall occurred in almost entire MP as an effect of cyclone Nisarga, said G D Mishra, senior meteorologist with IMDs Bhopal office.“Rains lashed 46 districts out of the total 52 districts in MP,” he said.According to the forecast for western parts of the state, heavy to very heavy rainfall and thunderstorm accompanied by lightning is most likely to occur at isolated places in next 24 hours.Similarly, heavy to very heavy rainfall, thunderstorm accompanied by lightning and gusty winds with speed reaching 30 to 40 kmph is very likely to occur at isolated places in eastern MP, it said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyclone-weakened-may-enter-mp-from-its-southern-parts-imd-94451

04-06-2020||New Delhi||People with medical emergency can get e-pass to enter Delhi, AAP govt tells HC||The Delhi High Court was informed on Thursday by the AAP government that its guidelines for COVID-19 lockdown allow people with medical emergencies to enter the national capital by applying for an e-pass which will be made available to them.The Delhi government said its Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has issued an order on June 1 with regard to prohibited and permitted activities, during the phased reopening - unlock 1, and the guidelines permit entry into the national capital from neighbouring states in case of medical emergencies.The submission was made before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan by additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose and advocate Urvi Mohan, appearing for the Delhi government.Taking note of the submission and the DDMA order of June 1, the bench disposed of a plea by lawyer Kushagra Kumar seeking immediate de-sealing of Delhi borders to enable citizens in NCR or other states to access central government hospitals and medical facilities in the national capital.While disposing of the matter, the court directed Delhi government to upload the June 1 order on its various department websites today itself in a prominent manner and have it highlighted for easy access by the citizens.The AAP government has sealed the Delhi borders for one week starting June 1 and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that the moment we open the borders, people from across the country will come to Delhi for treatment. Delhi hospitals should be reserved for the people of Delhi.The Delhi-Gurugram, Delhi-Ghaziabad and Delhi-Noida borders are shut for a week. Only essential service providers will be allowed and employees could cross the border by showing their identification cards or ID cards, Kejriwal had said.The plea had said those working in Delhi and residing in NCR like Noida and Gurugram or other states are deprived of their right to avail central government’s medical facilities like AIIMS in Delhi.“The order of the Delhi government is not only inhumane and illegal but authoritarian in nature. Instead of creating medical infrastructure and working to ensure medical facilities, it is sealing the borders and thereby stopping people from availing medical facilities in central government hospitals in Delhi,” it had claimed.

It will be undergirded by a logistic sharing agreement that gives armed forces of both countries easier access to each other’s military bases.To propel this security relationship further, Foreign and Defence Ministers will meet in a ‘2+2’ format to discuss strategic issues at least once every two years.The interaction provided a glimpse of their extended relationship with Asian countries including tri-laterals with Japan and Indonesia, respectively, seven-country consultations on COVID-19 with Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Vietnam and a quadrilateral with the US.The security side pushed into the background a vital agreement to cooperate on rare mineral exports to India which officials had earlier said would be instrumental in reducing the dependence on China as well as position India for 21st-century technologies.Australia did not raise upfront its expectations of India signing the RCEP agreement that would have given its dairy sector, under pressure from China, an alternate outlet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-australia-sign-joint-declaration-to-enhance-bilateral-partnership-94441

04-06-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi holds virtual summit with Aussie counterpart Scott Morrison||A process of comprehensive reforms covering almost all areas has been initiated in India as it is viewing the coronavirus crisis as an “opportunity”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday at an online summit with his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison.In his opening remarks, Modi also pitched for a coordinated and collaborative approach to come out of the adverse economic and social impact of the epidemic that has infected around 65 lakh people and killed 3.88 lakh globally.Referring to the virtual summit, the prime minister termed it “a new model of India-Australia partnership, a new model of conducting business”. It was the first time that Modi held a “bilateral” virtual summit with a foreign leader. The prime minister described his talks with Morrison as “an outstanding discussion”, covering the entire expanse of ties between the two strategic partners.“Our government has decided to view this crisis as an opportunity. In India, a process of comprehensive reforms has been initiated in almost all areas. It will soon see results at the ground level,” the prime minister said.               Modi also conveyed his appreciation to Morrison for taking care of the Indian community in Australia, especially the students, during the “difficult time”.The overall focus of the talks was on further broadbasing bilateral ties in a range of areas like healthcare, trade and defence.In his remarks, Morrison complemented Modi for his “constructive and very positive” role including at the G-20 role in pushing for a concerted global approach in dealing with the coronavirus crisis.Modi said he believed that it is the “perfect time and perfect opportunity” to further strengthen the relationship between India and Australia.“We have immense possibilities to make our friendship stronger,” Modi said, adding: “How our relations become a ‘factor of stability’ for our region and for the world, how we work together for global good, all these aspects need to be considered.”      The prime minister said India was committed to expand its relations with Australia on a wider and faster pace, noting that it is important not only for the two countries, but also for the Indo-Pacific region and the world.“The role of our comprehensive strategic partnership will be more important in this period of global epidemic. The world needs a coordinated and collaborative approach to get out of the economic and social side effects of this epidemic,” he said.Relationship between the two nations was upgraded to a ‘Strategic Partnership’ level in 2009. Since then, both countries have expanded their cooperation in a range of key areas.In its White Paper on Foreign Policy in 2017, Australia recognised India as the “pre-eminent maritime power among Indian Ocean countries” and a “front-rank partner of Australia”.The bilateral economic engagement too has been on an upswing in the last few years. According to official data, the trade between the two countries was around USD 21 billion in 2018-19.Australia’s cumulative investment in India is about USD 10.74 billion whereas India’s total investment in Australia is USD 10.45 billion. Australian Super Pension Fund has invested USD 1 billion in India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.In the last few years, both the countries have been focusing on expanding maritime cooperation.India and Australia commenced their first bilateral naval exercise ‘AUSINDEX’ in 2015 which was focussed at deepening defence and maritime cooperation especially in the Indian Ocean.The third edition of AUSINDEX-2019 was held in the Bay of Bengal in April 2019.Australia has been supportive of India’s position on cross-border terrorism and on asking Pakistan to take meaningful action against terrorist groups operating from its soil.Australia also co-sponsored UNSC resolution to declare Azhar Masood a global terrorist.

04-06-2020||Ahmedabad||Two Gujarat Cong MLAs resign ahead of RS polls||In a major blow to the opposition Congress ahead of the June 19 Rajya Sabha polls for four seats from the state, two party MLAs have resigned as members of the Legislative Assembly.The Congress has accused the BJP of trying to break the opposition party to win the Rajya Sabha polls. However, the ruling BJP dismissed the charge, saying MLAs were leaving the Congress as they were "unhappy" with the party leadership.Gujarat Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi said Congress MLAs Akshay Patel and Jitu Chaudhary met him on Wednesday evening and handed over their resignations."I have accepted their resignations. They now cease to be the legislators," Trivedi told reporters in Gandhinagar on Thursday.Patel represented Karjan seat of Vadodara while Chaudhary won from Kaprada seat of Valsad.Since March, seven Congress MLAs have so far resigned, including Patel and Chaudhary.In the 182-member state Assembly, the ruling BJP has 103 MLAs and the opposition Congress now has 66 legislators.Of the four Rajya Sabha seats from the state set to go for polls on June 19, three are currently held by the BJP and one by the Congress.While the Congress has fielded two candidates for the Rajya Sabha polls, the BJP has fielded three, making it difficult for the opposition party to win a second seat.The BJP has fielded Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramilaben Bara and Narhari Amin, and the Congress has announced names of senior leaders Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki for the polls.Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani accused the BJP of breaking the Congress to win the Rajya Sabha polls."The BJP has opened its shop to buy Congress MLAs from the money amassed through corrupt means. The BJP is using the state machinery and money power to win elections," he alleged.However, BJP's Narhari Amin refuted the allegations."I believe that some more Congress MLAs would also resign in near future. They are leaving Congress because they are unhappy with the party leadership," Amin said.The Rajya Sabha elections for four seats from Gujarat are scheduled to be held on June 19.Earlier, the elections were supposed to be held on March 26. However, the polls were then postponed for an indefinite period in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent imposition of the lockdown.In March, five Congress legislators had tendered their resignations, days after the Rajya Sabha polls were announced.With two more legislators now quitting the Congress, its chances of winning the second seat are slim.In the 182-member Assembly, BJP has 103 MLAs, Congress-66, Bharatiya Tribal Party-two and NCP-one.One seat is held by an Independent, Jignesh Mevani, while nine seats are vacant - two due to court cases over poll-related disputes and seven due to resignation of MLAs.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-gujarat-cong-mlas-resign-ahead-of-rs-polls-94432
04-06-2020||New Delhi||Know why Delhi has witnessed a sudden spike in corona cases||The number of cases of novel coronavirus disease is unabated in the national capital.According to the Union Health Ministry data, Delhi has reported a total of 23,645 cases so far and stands at third position in terms of reporting most number of the cases in the country, after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.On Wednesday, Delhi witnessed a record single day spike of over 1,500 cases.What factors are responsible for making the national capital the hotbed for coronavirus pandemic? The state government attributes the rising number of cases to the extensive testing.On May 1, Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, "In Delhi, the state government conducted 2,300 tests for one million people, which is way higher than the national average. Our aim is to test more number of people, so that we can detect coronavirus positive patients and start proper treatment."According to Gurvinder Kaur, Medical Superintendent Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, the 'Unlock 1' in Delhi is one of the key factors for the rising number of cases here. Speaking to IANS doctor Kaur said, "Till Delhi was in lockdown, mingling was less. The incline was there though, but was not so steep. Now with lockdown ending, there are more people on the roads, more people using public transport which is leading to faster transmission and there is also an increase in tests. Therefore, we need to be mindful of the same.Kaur also said that there is a life cycle to a pandemic. Every patient who is affected leads to infection in 2.6 more people. As the number of affected people rises the likelihood for them passing on the infection to others also rises. "Incubation period of the disease is for 14 days, so anyone who is affected, will take 14 days to show symptoms and during this time the infected person will continue to pass on the infection. These are the factors which have worked in sync in increase of patient numbers," she said, adding "if we need to contain the virus in the coming days, then maintain hand hygiene, maintain social distancing and we need to take the advisories seriously to flatten the curve.Another expert, Dr. Col. Vijay Dutta of the Internal Medicine Department of the Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, Delhi, told IANS that increased number of testing and unlock 1 are the most important factors responsible for the spike in the cases here. "The sudden spike is happening due to the number of testing that has increased and now the markets are open, it will go further."  He also suggested that the government should avoid opening of schools for children up to the age of 10 years as they have been showing diverse manifestations of the disease."It is clear by now that the virus is here to stay even if we develop a vaccine. Therefore, our strategy should be to reduce transmission, for which social distancing and awareness about the symptoms remain key factors. At the workplaces which have started operation, sanitization of surfaces and hand hygiene will remain important," he said.He said: "The government may consider ways for crowd management in markets which have opened now, especially the smaller ones selling things of daily needs. Children have shown diverse manifestation of the disease, so opening of schools should be avoided. It is important to make sustained efforts to ramp up testing that will help in identifying cases." Meanwhile, the rising number of cases in the national capital continue to give sleepless nights to the Delhi government and it has tightened the criteria for testing of COVID-19. It has restricted the criteria for testing close contacts and said that the asymptomatic close contacts will only be tested if they have comorbidity.The government has also sealed its borders with the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in places like Gurugram, Faridabad and Gautam Buddha Nagar. It has also mandated for seven days home quarantine for all asymptomatic passengers coming to Delhi.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/know-why-delhi-has-witnessed-a-sudden-spike-in-corona-cases-94430
04-06-2020||---||No coercive action against companies on payment of wages||New Delhi, June 4The Supreme Court on Thursday said no coercive action could be taken against employers for violating the March 29 notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) mandating full payment of wages to employees during COVID-19 lockdown.The interim order came from a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan after the Centre submitted that the MHA notification was a temporary measure for 54 days.The top court reserved its order on a batch of petitions challenging the validity of the MHA notification for June 12.  They also challenged Labour Ministry's March 20 notification on the issue.The petitioners, including Karnataka-based company Ficus Pax and Ludhiana Hand Tools Manufacturer Association, have challenged the validity of Section 10(2)(i) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.The provisions of this Act cannot “impinge upon express provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and take away the right to layoff workmen during times of natural calamity, they said.Terming the MHA order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 as arbitrary, they said the order violated the private companies' right to carry on any occupation, trade or business guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.Attorney General KK Venugopal said the notification was to stop the workers from migrating en masse and preventing human suffering."But your notification compelled the payment of 100 per cent of salaries...it can be around 50 to 75 per cent. So the question is, do you have the power to get them to pay 100 per cent, and on their failure to do so, prosecute them?" the Bench sought to know.As several counsel representing the companies attacked the MHA and Labour Ministry notifications, the Bench asked, "Can you run an industry without labour? You have to strike a balance and this should not be tilted either on the side of the employer or the employees."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-coercive-action-against-companies-on-payment-of-wages-94429

04-06-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 lockdown-like interventions may help combat air pollution in India, say scientists||The lockdowns enforced due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to large improvement in air quality in India, say scientists who suggest that such interventions may be used as a possible emergency measure to combat severe air pollution episodes like those witnessed in Delhi-NCR region during the winter months.Ahead of the World Environment Day on June 5, experts have outlined several environmental factors that saw improvements in India as a result of the lockdowns, namely air quality, noise pollution, water quality, and biodiversity among others due to reduced industrial and human activities.On March 24, the Union government ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, limiting the movement of people in India as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 pandemic.Since then the lockdown has been extended many times with gradual lifting of restrictions.“There is a large improvement in air quality, especially in urban areas—from alarming or poor to satisfactory or good. The main reason is reduced human activities,” said S K Satheesh, Professor at Centre for Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore.“On an average, reduction in particulate matter (PM) concentrations over southern part of India is around 50 to 60 per cent, and over the Indo-Gangetic basin, including Delhi, UP, Bihar, West Bengal etc it is as much as 75 per cent,” he told PTI.Satheesh noted that the major contributing factors of pollution are transport vehicles, industries, crop-residue burning, waste burning and so on.He explained that in cities, more than half of the air pollution is caused due to vehicular emissions, adding that during the lockdown, there was a large reduction in the number of vehicles on road.According to two studies, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in May, the levels of two major air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide, drastically reduced since lockdowns were enforced worldwide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.In India, satellite data has shown a significant drop in particulate matter or aerosol levels after the COVID-19 lockdown over most parts of the country, Satheesh said.“Our field measurements show that there is a substantial reduction in the concentration of suspended particulate matter (PM), a major component of air pollution, in the atmosphere due to reduced human activities as a consequence of the lockdown,” he said.The scientist explained that multi-spectral measurements of aerosol absorption, in addition to data available from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), indicate that the drastic decrease in pollution levels is mainly due to a reduction in fossil fuel burning emissions.Manish Kumar Singh, Assistant Professor, Earth Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar agreed with Satheesh, adding such lockdown measures can be used in the future to combat pollution.“In my opinion, the kind of recovery shown by mother nature during the lockdown, there is no harm in using lockdown as a possible emergency measure to combat severe air pollution episodes like we witness in Delhi winters,” Kumar told PTI.“Similarly, industrial effluent tracing is possible by episodal closure and opening to recognise the impact on water resources,” he said.Environmental Engineer Bose K Varghese noted that when the lockdown came into effect, nobody was really thinking about the environment as people were staring at the direct fallout of a complete lockdown.“As days went by and we struggled with getting used to life indoors, we started noticing the environment around us transforming in palpable ways,” said Varghese, Head of Green Initiatives at Infosys Limited, which won the UN Global Climate Action Award at COP25 climate conference in Spain in December last.“The most noticeable effects are cleaner air, cleaner water, less waste, very low noise levels, and the wildlife that came out of hiding,” said Varghese.He explained that while the real extent of the effect of COVID-19 on the environment is not known yet, the effects witnessed can easily be explained by a cause-and-effect analysis.According to Satheesh, lockdown measures may not only help reduce pollution levels, but also have an impact on the upcoming monsoon, however, it is too early to make a conclusive statement.Based on earlier studies, he believes that atmospheric aerosols have a crucial role in determining the onset date of monsoon, and also the distribution of monsoon rainfall across India.Varghese noted that the lockdown has also resulted in effects that people cannot see, like the gradual repair of the ozone hole.Large reduction in air traffic resulted in a significant reduction in particulate matter and greenhouse gas emissions in the upper atmosphere, some of which are already shown to impact the stratospheric ozone layer through self-lofting of these pollutants emitted by airplanes, Satheesh explained.Large reduction in airplane emissions would further the recovery of ozone hole, which is already taking place, he said.Varghese noted that when COVID-19 fears recede, things are expected to quickly go back to normal, however, it is hoped that people will retain some of the lifestyle changes that are beneficial to the environment.“The undeniable benefit of this outbreak is that it showed us a better future that we all want to embrace. It gave us a preview of an environment that we all aspire to live in,” he added.

04-06-2020||New Delhi||Was advised not to speak to Rahul, claims Rajiv Bajaj||During conversation on the economic fallout of the lockdown due to Covid-19, industrialist Rajiv Bajaj claimed that he was advised not to speak to the former Congress president Rahul Gandhi as it can lead to trouble.When Rahul Gandhi praised Rajiv Bajaj for his braveness for speaking to him, Bajaj said, "I'm speaking with Rahul and the first reaction was from a friend, don't do it. I said, but why not?, 'Mat karna, this can get you into trouble'. But I said, I may have said some things, perhaps a little too vehemently."Bajaj said he had spoken to media houses earlier, but his friend advised him not to speak to Rahul Gandhi. According to Bajaj, his friend said, "Nahi, media me bolna ek baat hai but Rahul Gandhi se baatein karna ek dusri baat hai". (It is one thing to speak to media, but quite different when you are speaking to Rahul Gandhi.)"I pushed that actually a bit, I'll tell you very candidly. I said, we are going to talk about business, economics, lockdown, what to do, how to move forward, technology, products, he loves motorcycles and so we'll talk about motorcycles etc," Bajaj said. While Bajaj did not tell who his friend is who advised him not to speak to Rahul Gandhi, but said, "So that person maintained, that why, why take a risk? But yes, that is the general mahol (current environment) and you know, my own father raised that point, in November, at the economic award function, where the home minister was there, the finance minister was there.""So, you know, one hears a lot about this, but I try to ask people why this should be so because at least so far I have not faced any repercussion, so to speak, of this. But yes, what you say is true, this seems to be the general impression, which is sad because I think this openness is our strength and we must not lose it," Bajaj told Rahul Gandhi.While Rahul Gandhi praised Rajiv Bajaj and said, "Yesterday, a friend of mine asked me, you know, what is your next interview? And I said, you know, I'm speaking to Mr. Bajaj and the guy said, "Oh dum hai bande me'. So I said, what do you mean? And he said, 'Well he's got guts to talk to you'".

According to the Indian Embassy website, the sculpture of Mahatma Gandhi is cast in bronze as a statue to a height of 8 feet 8 inches. It shows Gandhi in stride, as a leader and man of action evoking memories of his 1930 protest march against salt-tax, and the many padyatras (long marches) he undertook throughout the length and breadth of the Indian sub-continent.The statue, the design of which was created by Gautam Pal, is a gift from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). The pedestal for the statue of Mahatma Gandhi is a block of new Imperial Red also known as Ruby Red a block originally weighing 25 tonnes reduced to a size of 9'x7'x3'4". It now weighs 16 tonnes.

04-06-2020||Vibha Sharma||Agriculture reforms only for traders and corporates, not farmers, say experts||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 4The Government on Wednesday announced three "major agriculture reforms" for farmers, including an Ordinance to promote “barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade outside APMC market” and amendment to the Essential Commodities Act., removing commodities like cereals, pulses oilseeds edible oils onion and potatoes from list of essential commodities.Briefing about the three reforms after the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the decisions, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar called it a “historic day" in fact a day of "freedom for farmers”.However, according to leading agriculture experts and activitists, the “reforms were for traders and not farmers".While Tomar said states are on board in the Ordinance, they believe many would consider it as “infringement of their power under the federal structure”.Questions are also being raised on the move to impose ECA under extraordinary circumstances. Who will decide what the extraordinary circumstances are, experts said.“Removing stock limits do not benefit farmers. They are not touching APMC, which is a good step. However, the real reform would be to expand the network of APMC ‘mandis’ in the country and assure that MSP becomes a legal obligation,” said agricultural policy analyst Devinder Sharma.Agriculture expert Sudheer Panwar said, “It is the exporters, traders and processors who will benefit.""The amendment (in essential commodities act) has nothing to do with farmers. Regarding the Ordinance, trade outside 'mandis' is happening even now, only now there will be a law. Ever since liberalisation/WTO, the government’s thinking is consistent on market reforms,” said Panwar.Giving a point by point rebuttal, Kavitha Kuruganti from the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture said amendments in Essential Commodities Act was related to farmers only to the extent that seed trade and fertilisers get regulated under some Orders of this Act."Otherwise, this was always about consumers, and to say that this will now benefit farmers is laughable. It will benefit traders from what one can see, neither farmers nor consumers," she said.Regarding amendments in APMC legislations and creating "One India - One Market", she said there is no evidence to show that deregulation of markets as is the case with Bihar or Kerala has actually ensured remunerative prices for farmers."It is nobody's case to argue that from now on, small and marginal farmers of the country (many are illiterate and lack knowledge/information about distant markets) who are the largest chunk of farmers are going to go in search of distant markets for better prices.”"Better farmgate prices are not to be expected either, as long as farmers are trapped in the clutches of local traders who also double up as credit agents.”"What should be ensured is remunerative prices which should become legally guaranteed entitlements, and oversight mechanisms for implementation, even as trader collusion and political interference in APMCs have to be stopped, and even as freedom to sell wherever a farmer finds a better market ensured. It is just corporations, traders and economists who would call them solutions,” she saidHowever, praising the government's efforts, Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal said, “Farmers in India suffer from various restrictions in marketing their produce. There are restrictions for farmers in selling agri-produce outside notified APMC market yards. The farmers are also restricted to sell the produce only to registered licensees of the state governments.”“Further, barriers exist in free flow of agriculture produce between various states owing to the prevalence of various APMC legislations enacted by state governments," the Agriculture Secretary said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agriculture-reforms-only-for-traders-and-corporates-not-farmers-say-experts-94405

This would be in addition to his present duties at New Delhi.Following a cadre review that was approved by the Cabinet in October 2019, two new commands, one based at Chandigarh and the other at Guwahati for the eastern theatre, are to be raised. These are to be headed by officers of the rank of ADG, equivalent to a lieutenant general in the Army. “An imperative need has been felt to make these headquarters functional immediately,” Deswal’s orders state.All ITBP ‘frontiers’ located in the eastern and western theatres would now report to their respective command headquarters. At present, the force is divided into five frontiers that report directly to Force Headquarters, along with other training, logistic and administrative establishments, through an ADG based in New Delhi. The geographical responsibility of each frontier is generally aligned with the stretch of the border shared by respective states with China.Western Command will control the Dehradun-based Northern Frontier comprising Shimla, Dehradun and Bareilly sectors and the North-West Frontier, recently moved from Chandigarh to Leh that comprises Srinagar and Ladakh sectors. Eastern Command will control the Northern Frontier and the North-eastern Frontier. The Bhopal-based Central frontier along with the ITBP’s specialist battalions and some other establishments would be under the command of the ADG at Force Headquarters.ITBP, mandated for the peacetime management of the border with China, has 56 service battalions and four specialist battalions, out of which 32 are deployed in border guarding duties, 11 in internal security and eight in anti-Naxal operations.The need to create commands in the ITBP was felt to streamline command, control and coordination over field formations in view of the force expansion due to new battalions being raised, increasing commitments and raising border volatility. This necessitated the creation of new posts that included two ADGs, 10 IGs (equivalent to Major General), 10 Deputy Inspector General (equivalent to Brigadier) and 13 posts of Commandant (equivalent to Colonel), in addition to more posts at lower levels.While the Director General of all Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) under the Ministry of Home Affairs is an officer from the Indian Police Service (IPS), other higher level posts are tenable by a mix of IPS and cadre officers. Till now, cadre officers could only reach up to the level of IG, but the cadre review opened doors to the level of ADG and also created more vacancies for them at other ranks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-stand-off-with-china-itbp-rushes-to-raise-new-command-at-chandigarh-94399

He said that the vow was taken after several NGOs and institutions, which were providing food to the needy amid lockdown, withdrew their services.जिन राहों पर कोई चलने को तैयार नहीं... वहाँ भी मदद करने सिख पहुँच ही जाते हैं 🙏🏻Langar on Wheels initiative of Gurdwara Sri Bangla Sahib serving thousands of people everyday in different parts of New Delhi. pic.twitter.com/8i7EPApBjM  The Committee President added that the initiative has been started for one month but will be extended from time-to-time till the economic activities are restored and disadvantaged people are able to sustain themselves.The Committee will remain in touch with the Sikh leaders, government officials and resident welfare associations of the respective areas to gauge the demand of the food. He added that additional food will be rushed to any place if the demand escalates.Vans with banners highlighting food and water arrangements for needy persons will also be stationed at different places like railway stations and bus stands. Those in need will be served 'langar' at a convenient place with social distancing.Harmeet Singh Kalka, General Secretary of the committee, said that the decision to start 'Langar on Wheels' has been taken as it was 'impractical' for most of the poor people to find the nearest Gurdwara. "Now, we have decided to go where the people are."The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee had earlier launched a similar community kitchen initiative for migrant labourers at around ten locations in the national capital region.

At one of the spots, the difference is around 10 km.As per the existing framework of LAC management between India and China, troops of either side do not hold ground in disputed areas along the LAC. They come for patrol and return.In Galwan, the third point of tension between the two armies, India is very clear that China has to vacate its newly occupied positions. The Line of Actual Control is not disputed here. India has conveyed to China that its troops were in the areas that were never disputed.India can either pressure China by carving out a new position of its own along the LAC or reason out with it to withdraw. There are no posts in the area. Only patrolling is done here.India will also seek that the heavy armour and artillery guns, which China has moved to various locations in the Aksai Chin area or all along the 826-km-long Line of Actual Control, be moved back.Sources said the conduct of the June 6 meeting would be on the Chinese side of the Chushul-Moldo meeting point.
