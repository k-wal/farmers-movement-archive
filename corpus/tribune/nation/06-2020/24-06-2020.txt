24-06-2020||New Delhi||China ramps up military presence at friction points in Ladakh, other areas along LAC||China has significantly ramped up its military presence in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley and several other friction points in eastern Ladakh even as it is engaged in military and diplomatic talks with India to ease tension in the region, people familiar with the development said.Also read: India, China agree to 'sincerely' deescalate at LACArmy chief Gen Naravane visits India-China stand-off site in LadakhChina again blames India for violent face-off in Eastern LadakhThey said Chinese military has also deployed a sizeable number of its troops in Galwan Valley, the site of the violent clashes on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.The erection of a surveillance post by China in the area had triggered the clashes. However, Chinese troops have again put up some structure around patrolling point 14 in the area, notwithstanding India’s stiff opposition, they said.Over the last few days, China has been laying claim over Galwan Valley though India called it “untenable”.Besides Pangong Tso and Galwan Valley, the two armies are also locked in a standoff in Demchok, Gogra Hot Spring and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh. A sizeable number of Chinese Army personnel transgressed into the Indian side of the LAC.China has also increased the number of troops and weaponry in several other key sectors along the Line of Actual Control in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Uttarakhand, the people cited above said.The increase in military build-up by China along the LAC, the de-facto border between the two countries, came amid bilateral diplomatic and military talks.Senior military commanders of the two armies on Monday held a nearly 11-hour meeting during which they arrived at a “mutual consensus” to “disengage” from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh in a gradual manner.The two sides on Wednesday held diplomatic talks under the framework of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs.In the meeting, both sides agreed to ensure expeditious implementation of the understanding on disengagement of troops from eastern Ladakh as decided in a meeting of senior military commanders on June 6, the Ministry of External Affairs said.In the midst of fast-paced developments, Army Chief Gen M M Naravane on Wednesday visited various forward areas in eastern Ladakh and reviewed the Army’s operational preparedness.On the second day of his visit to Ladakh, Gen Naravane took stock of the Army’s combat preparedness in four forward areas and interacted with soldiers deployed there besides holding detailed deliberations with ground commanders.The Army Chief reviewed the overall security situation in the region with Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Yogesh Kumar Joshi, commander of the 14 Corps Lt Gen Harinder Singh and other senior Army officials on both Tuesday and Wednesday, sources said.The Chief of Army Staff is expected to return to the national capital on Thursday.“General M M Naravane #COAS visited forward areas in Eastern #Ladakh and reviewed the operational situation on the ground. #COAS commended the troops for their high morale and exhorted them to continue working with zeal and enthusiasm,” the Army said in a tweet.The sources said India is also bolstering its military presence along the 3,500 km LAC with China.On Sunday, the government gave the armed forces “full freedom” to give a “befitting” response to any Chinese misadventure along the LAC.The Army has already sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border in the last one week.The IAF has also moved a significant number of its frontline Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar, Mirage 2000 aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to several key air bases including Leh and Srinagar following the clashes.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.Prior to the clashes, both sides had been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it was necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

24-06-2020||Washington||Pakistan remains ‘safe haven’ for terrorists: US report||Pakistan took “modest steps” in 2019 to counter terror financing and restrain India-focused militant groups from conducting large-scale attacks following the Pulwama attack in February, but it remained a “safe harbour” for regionally focused terrorist groups, the US said on Wednesday.The suspension of US aid to Pakistan, which was announced by President Donald Trump in January 2018, remained in effect throughout 2019, the State Department said.“Pakistan took modest steps in 2019 to counter terror financing and restrain India-focused militant groups from conducting large-scale attacks following the February attack on a security convoy in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir linked to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM),” it said.In its Congressional-mandated annual report 2019 Country Reports on Terrorism, the State Department said Pakistan took action against some externally focused groups, including indicting Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed and associates in three separate terrorism financing cases.“However, Pakistan remained a safe harbor for other regionally focused terrorist groups,” the State Department said.It allowed groups targeting Afghanistan, including the Afghan Taliban and affiliated Haqqani Network (HQN), as well as groups targeting India, including the LeT and its affiliated front organisations, and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), to operate from its territory, the report said.“It did not take action against other known terrorists such as JeM founder and UN-designated terrorist Masood Azhar and 2008 Mumbai attack ‘project manager’ Sajid Mir, both of whom are believed to remain free in Pakistan,” alleged the State Department.Pakistan, however, did make some positive contributions to the Afghanistan peace process, such as encouraging Taliban reductions in violence. Pakistan made some progress toward meeting the Action Plan requirements for the FATF, allowing it to avoid being blacklisted, but did not complete all Action Plan items in 2019, it said.Although al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been seriously degraded, key figures among the outfit’s global leadership, as well as its regional affiliate al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), continued to operate from remote locations in the region that historically served as safe havens, it said.Pakistan is one of the countries that figures in the terrorist safe havens list. Although Pakistan’s National Action Plan calls to “ensure that no armed militias are allowed to function in the country,” several terrorist groups that focus on attacks outside the country continued to operate from Pakistani soil in 2019, including the Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e-Toiba, and Jaish-e-Mohammed, it said.“The government and military acted inconsistently with respect to terrorist safe havens throughout the country. Authorities did not take sufficient action to stop certain terrorist groups and individuals from openly operating in the country,” said the State Department.According to the report, in January 2018, the US government suspended most of its security assistance to Pakistan over the government’s failure to adequately address the threat posed by militant and terrorist groups operating on Pakistani soil.“That suspension remained in effect throughout 2019,” the report said.“However, a recalibration of our civilian assistance portfolio was implemented in 2019 to target a narrower set of priority areas: people-to-people exchanges, law enforcement and counterterrorism cooperation, stabilisation for the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, fostering trade and economic growth, supporting civil society, and helping treat polio and other infectious diseases,” it said.The report notes that in June 2018, the FATF placed Pakistan on its “gray list” and issued an Action Plan directing Pakistan to take specific steps by September 2019 to address strategic deficiencies in its combating the financing of terrorism efforts.“The FATF expressed serious concern at its October 2019 plenary about Pakistan’s continued deficiencies but noted it had made some progress and extended the deadline for full Action Plan implementation to February 2020,” it said.In 2018, Pakistan was designated as a “Country of Particular Concern” (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. It was re-designated as a CPC in 2019, it said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-remains-safe-haven-for-terrorists-us-report-103868

Under the agreement, the two parties were to get “opportunity to consult each other on important bilateral, regional and international developments”.The PIL alleged that the agreement “may have matter involving national importance.”The PIL—which made Congress President Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi respondents in the case—demanded that if not an NIA probe, there should be a Supreme Court-monitored CBI probe into it.In 2008, Sonia Gandhi had visited Beijing along with Rahul Gandhi and her daughter Priyanka Vadra, son-in-Law Robert Vadra and their two children to attend the opening of the Olympic Games, it submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-seeks-nia-probe-into-2008-agreement-between-congress-chinese-communist-party-103863

He is an MP from the Narsapuram segment.Earlier this week, Raju went public with claims that he had been denied a meeting with Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy because the chief minister has been influenced by some party leaders. Some time ago, he had written a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla saying that he feared for his life as some of his own party legislators and workers were threatening him. He sought appropriate protection as the local state police failed to act on his complaints.The notice issued by YSRC general secretary V Vijaya Sai Reddy reads, "In recent times you have shown your disinclination to being a primary member of the party, which is discernible from various statements made by you on many party and government programmes in the state. You have publicly adopted a stand discordant with the YSRC line."The relation between Raju and the party leadership has been under strain for the past few days with Raju opposing several decisions of the government publicly and issuing statements opposed to decisions taken by the high command. Recently, he questioned the proposed sale of Trumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) properties, and alleged corruption in house-site distribution, sale of sand, etc.In recent times, there have been reports of Raju publicly taking on his fellow party men, leading to verbal duels with his fellow party legislators in West Godavari district and other places questioning the decisions of the YSRCP government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ysrcp-mp-who-claimed-threat-to-life-from-own-party-legislators-served-notice-103851

24-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi violence: HC seeks police reply on Ishrat Jahan’s plea against extension of time to complete probe in UAPA case||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked Delhi Police to respond to a plea by former Congress municipal councillor Ishrat Jahan, booked under anti-terror law UAPA in a case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi in February, challenging an order extending time for completing the investigation by 60 more days.Justice Suresh Kumar Kait, who conducted the hearing through video conferencing, issued notice to Delhi Police and asked it to file written arguments within 10 days.The court also allowed Jahan’s counsel to file written arguments and some additional documents related to the case.Additional Public Prosecutor Amit Chadha accepted the notice on behalf of Delhi Police and sought time to file the reply after which the court listed the matter for further hearing on July 7.Jahan, who was arrested on February 26, has challenged the trial court’s June 15 order granting 60-day extension to police to complete its investigation against her and activist Khalid Saifi.The court was informed that Saifi had allegedly travelled outside India and met persons including fugitive Zakir Naik, controversial Islamic preacher, to get funds for spreading his agenda and the investigation regarding this required more time.Advocate Manu Sharma, who appeared for Jahan, sought setting aside of the trial court’s order, saying it was “erroneous, bad in law and wrong on facts” and it was against the democratic and fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.“The application by the prosecutor is an abuse of the legal process as the same fails to make out any legal or factual basis that justifies extension of time. This exercise is only to subvert and defeat the right of the petitioner to seek regular and statutory bail under the CrPC.“The order deserves to be set aside on this ground alone. Speedy and fair investigation are fundamental tenets of the criminal justice system…,” the plea, filed through advocate Lalit Valecha, said.It contended that the prosecutor has not mentioned any specific reason as to why the custody of accused Jahan was required, which is a mandatory condition under the provisions of the UAPA, still the sessions court granted extension of time to file charge sheet.Jahan’s counsel claimed that she has been fully cooperating with the investigating agency and already revealed the questioned source of funds to the IO.The trial court, in its June 15 order, had said the prosecution has set out a case for extension of the statutory time period to conclude the investigation but the investigating officer was not divested of his obligation of concluding the probe expeditiously.The trial court, which granted time till August 14 to conclude the pending investigation, had noted the police contention that Saifi got suspicious funds through a NRI account of a person, who is serving in Singapore, in the account of an NGO which he is running in partnership with his friend.The prosecutor had alleged that Jahan has got illegal funds through an unaccounted channel and Khalid got funds from Popular Front of India (PFI) as well as from outside India.Saifi was a member of United Against Hate, a citizens’ campaign launched in 2017 to protest against series of lynching in the country and was allegedly involved in the violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in which financial support was provided by the PFI, formed in 2006 in Kerala as a successor to the National Democratic Front (NDF).The police had sought extension of time till September 17 for concluding investigation against Jahan and Khalid, under section 43D (2) (b) of the anti-terror law.Section 43-D (2) of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) provides that if it is not possible to complete the investigation within the 90 days period, then upon the report of the public prosecutor indicating the progress of the probe and the specific reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the 90 days period, after satisfaction, the court can extend the period of probe to 180 days.Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, Meeran Haider, Jamia students Asif Iqbal Tanha, Gulfisha Khatoon, Jamia Alumni Association President Shifa-Ur-Rehman, JNU students and Pinjra Tod members Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, suspended AAP councilor Tahir Hussain, Shadab Ahmed, and Umar Khalid have also been booked under UAPA in the case.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and scores injured.

24-06-2020||Dehradun/New Delhi||Patanjali didn't have permission for coronavirus drug; issuing notice: Uttarakhand official||The Uttarakhand government is serving a notice to yoga guru Ramdev’s Patanjali Ayurved for launching a drug claiming to be a cure for COVID-19 when it had only applied for a licence to manufacture an immunity booster against cough and fever, an official said Wednesday.The revelation from the state comes even as the AYUSH ministry at the Centre prepares to examine the herbal products company’s documents on research and the composition of the drug developed by it.Union minister Shripad Naik Shripad Naik said Patanjali coming with the medicine was a “good initiative” but due process has to be followed.Hours after the launch of “Coronil” on Tuesday, the Union AYUSH Ministry had asked the firm to provide the details, telling it to stop advertising it till the issue is examined.Naik said Patanjali Ayurved has submitted the documents.“The reports which were sent to the ministry on Tuesday will be examined,” he said.“At a time when everybody is grappling for a cure for COVID-19, such an initiative is definitely good but then the due process has to be followed,” the minister said.Apart from the notice from the Uttarakhand government, the Haridwar-based firm could also face litigation in Bihar. A complaint has been filed against it in a Muzaffarpur court over its claim.Uttarakhand’s Ayurved department’s licence officer Y S Rawat said the notice is being issued to the firm to explain from where it got the permission to launch a “corona kit” as a cure for the virus.“Patanjali Ayurved Ltd had the licence only for manufacturing an immunity booster against cough and fever. There was nothing in their application related to the treatment of coroavirus,” the official said.“We did receive an application from Patanjali on June 10. The application was approved after examination by a panel on June 12 but the firm had the permission to manufacture only two or three drugs as immunity boosters against cough and fever, and not a drug for coronavirus,” he added.He said the notice will be sent to the firm under Rule 170 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, which makes it mandatory for companies to seek permission from the licensing authority before advertising a product in print or the electronic media.In Muzaffarpur, a complainant has approached the court seeking the registration of an FIR against Ramdev and company chairman Acharya Balkrishna, alleging that they put at risk the lives of lakhs of people by claiming to have developed a COVID-19 cure.Chief Judicial Magistrate Mukesh Kumar posted the matter for hearing on June 30.At the “Coronil” launch, the company had claimed that its medicine can cure the contagious disease within seven days.It said “Coronil”, taken along with another product developed by it, had shown a 100 per cent success rate in clinical trials on infected patients, except those on life support.Ramdev said the medicines were developed by Patanjali Research Center, Haridwar in association with privately-owned National Institute of Medical Science, Jaipur.Patanjali, however, is not the only herbal products company to have claimed coming up with a cure against the contagious disease.The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) has said it has found 50 campaigns by Ayurveda and homeopathic drug makers offering a cure for COVID-19 in April alone, and had flagged them to the Union government for action.The advertisements violated the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) order dated April 1, prohibiting publicity and advertisement of Ayush-related claims, an ASCI statement said.The self-regulatory body said the ministry had sought its help to alert it about such advertisements.The body also made public the list of the 50 companies which were found to have advertised a COVID-19 cure or a product to prevent it.There were no big brands in the list, and most of them seemed to be localised entities from various parts of the country.

The footage of the incident sparked outrage on social media with #ShameSuratPolice dominating the Twitter trends at that time.Though the incident took place around 4.30 pm and the camera footage of the slapping incident was circulating widely, it took considerable effort by netizens, including journalist Sucheta Dalal, to have the FIR registered late at night. The constable on the other hand came on camera to give his version of the manhandling and has still not been arrested.What had irked social media users the most was the absence of any response or assurance from the city administration or the Surat police all through the evening.On Wednesday, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also took up the matter by calling up the Surat Collector Dhaval Patel who assured her that timely action will be taken on the FIR filed late at night.Sitharaman further said she will be closely following this matter and assured bank staffers that the Government views their safety concerns seriously. “Amid challenges, banks are extending all services to our people. Nothing should threaten their safety and dignity,’’ she posted on social media.The Union Finance Minister’s office was following up the case and had informed her that Commissioner of Police Bhrambhatt had visited Canara Bank’s branch who assured the staff of full cooperation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/finance-minister-sitharaman-comes-to-aid-of-woman-banker-assaulted-by-surat-cop-103826
24-06-2020||Faridkot||DGHS allowed relaxation in physical reporting to NRI, ‘locked down’ candidates for MD/MS courses||The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) on Wednesday allowed the online reporting to many candidates, including NRIs, who were allotted seats in MD/MS courses but they were facing difficulty in physically reporting to the colleges/institutes allotted to them due to lockdown situation.Earlier, the DGHS had directed all candidates who were allotted MD/MS courses seats in different government medical colleges over the country, to report physically on their allotted seats before June 30 or their seat allotment will be deemed cancelled.In the new public notice, issued on Wednesday, the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) of DGHS said that it was receiving many representations from candidates about problems being faced by them in reporting physically due to non availability of transport and accommodation at allotted institutes and also from NRI candidates who are stuck abroad.To facilitate such candidates, the MCC is allowing for the online reporting of Round-2 candidates on case to case basis and the genuineness of case will be decided by the college/institute authorities where the seat has been allotted.However, this relaxation is allowed only to the Round-2 of counselling candidates.The MCC has further conveyed that All India Quota seats, which remain vacant after last date for joining (June 30), will be deemed to be converted into state quota. Such seats after reversion to state quota are to be filled by the state counselling authorities for Round -2 of state quota. The MCC has clarified that the seats of Round-1 candidates who reported online but did not join physically at the allotted college will be cancelled by the college on the last day of reporting (June 30) and these seats will come back in the system and included in further rounds of counselling.The security deposits of such candidates will be forfeited.The Round-2 candidates who do not report at the allotted colleges or express willingness to join the Round-2 seats online will “Exit with Forfeiture”.“After the second round of counselling for All India Quota seats, the students who take admission in All India Quota seats should not be allowed/ permitted to vacate the seats. This would ensure that very few seats are reverted to the State Quota and also All India Quota seats are filed by students from the all India merit list only. The students who secure admission in Deemed Universities pursuant to the second round of counselling conducted by the DGHS shall not be eligible to participate in any other counselling,” the MCC clarified.Hence, the candidates of Round-1 and Round-2 who join their respective seats will not be allowed to vacate/ resign their seats, conveyed the MCC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dghs-allowed-relaxation-in-physical-reporting-to-nri-locked-down-candidates-for-md-ms-courses-103825

They will not be tested before, during or after quarantine unless symptomatic," Army Spokesperson Col Aman Anand said.The revised protocol also recommended avoiding short duration duties of up to seven days unless deemed crucial for the interest of the services, officials said.They said the revised protocol has been issued in view of the evolving pattern of the pandemic, new evidence emerging from new researches as well as the response of the government in dealing with the infection. Under the previous guidelines, all personnel coming to any military station from home or other stations were mandated to go for a 14-day quarantine period if they did not fulfil certain conditions.According to the revised protocol, the 14-day quarantine at station facilities/ unit segregation/home will be continued as in vogue for all personnel returning from leave or temporary duty and reporting on permanent duty.The 14-day quarantine period may be exempted on a case by case basis as per medical advice for asymptomatic individuals with no history of being in contact with a suspect, probable or confirmed case of COVID-19 in the preceding 14 days before travel and those travelling from one duty station to another without any halts in between.Those personnel who have travelled to the duty station using service aircraft, service transport or self-driven vehicle as well as those providing self-declaration certificate countersigned by the commanding officer, may also be exempted from the 14-day quarantine.According to the revised protocol, no testing will be required before, during and after quarantine unless symptomatic.In March and April, the Army headquarters issued a series of directives with an aim to insulate the 13-lakh-strong force from the novel coronavirus.

24-06-2020||Beijing||China again blames India for violent face-off in Eastern Ladakh||Asserting that China and India are “important neighbours to each other”, Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday said  maintaining peace and tranquillity along the Sino-India border is in the common interests of both the parties and requires joint efforts.In separate statements, the Chinese foreign and the defence ministries, however, repeated Beijing’s stand that India was responsible for the June 15 violent face-off in Eastern Ladakh.Defence Ministry Spokesman Col Wu Qian said the two defence ministers are negotiating on the phone.Also read: Army chief Gen Naravane visits India-China stand-off site in LadakhCoursemates pay homage to ‘hero of Galwan’ Col Babu“The two sides held a second military-level meeting on June 22 to exchange in-depth views on controlling tensions and maintaining peace and stability in the border areas,” he said.Noting that China and India are important neighbours to each other, Wu said that maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border area is in the common interests of both parties and requires the joint efforts of both parties.“We hope that India and China will meet each other, effectively implement the important consensus between the leaders of the two countries, strictly abide by the agreement reached by the two parties, and continue to properly resolve relevant issues through dialogue and negotiation at all levels. We will make joint efforts to ease the situation in the border areas and maintain peace and stability in the border areas,” he added.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the foreign ministers of the two sides during their telephone talk on June 17 agreed to deal with this serious matter in a just way.“The two sides will stick to the Commander-level meeting consensus and cool down the situations soon as possible. The two sides will also maintain peace and tranquillity of the border areas, in accordance with the agreement reached so far,” he said.Zhao also said that a second round of Commander-level meeting was held on June 22 and 23 during which the “two sides agreed to take measures to de-escalate the situation and jointly promote peace and tranquillity”.          The talks were held in the midst of escalating tension between the two countries following the violent clashes in Galwan Valley on June 15 that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead, significantly escalating the already volatile situation in the region.Zhao again accused India of “provoking” a border clash, saying “the onus is not on China’s part”.              “This risky behaviour by the Indian side greatly violated the agreement between the two countries and the basic norms guiding international relations. It’s very serious, with very severe consequences,” he said.Asked why after a positive meeting between the Commanders of the two armed forces, he is repeating the allegations, Zhao said, “what I have just said is meant to clarify the whole situation, tell the truth to everyone. We made this statement because the MEA in India and also Indian media have made some false reports”.             The Indian and Chinese armies are engaged in the standoff in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh. A sizable number of Chinese Army personnel even transgressed into the Indian side of the de-facto border in several areas including Pangong Tso.The Indian Army has been fiercely objecting to the transgressions, and demanded their immediate withdrawal for restoration of peace and tranquillity in the area. Both sides held a series of talks in the last few days to resolve the border row. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-again-blames-india-for-violent-face-off-in-eastern-ladakh-103810

24-06-2020||Muzaffarpur||Complaint filed in Bihar court against Ramdev over COVID-19 medicine claim||A criminal complaint has been filed in a Bihar court against yoga guru Ramdev and Patanjali Ayurved MD Acharya Balkrishna, alleging that they have misled and put at risk the lives of lakhs of people by claiming to have developed a medicine to treat COVID-19.The complaint seeking registration of an FIR on cheating, criminal conspiracy and other charges was filed in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Mukesh Kumar here on Tuesday by Tamanna Hashmi, who identifies himself as a social worker and is often in news for his numerous court complaints against politicians over various issues.The court posted the matter for hearing on June 30.The complainant has named Ramdev, the convenor of the Patanjali Research Institute, and his aide Balkrishna, the organisation's chairman, as accused.Hashmi submitted that Ramdev and Balkrishna claimed to have prepared "Coronil tablet" to cure COVID-19, which is nothing but misleading.The complainant submitted that the Ayush Ministry has asked Patanjali Ayurved to stop advertising and publicising its claims about the medicine.The Ayush Ministry has said that they have not been provided any information with regard to the details of the composition of the ayurvedic medicine, Hashmi said.The complainant has sought registration of a case under IPC sections 420 (cheating and dishonesty inducing delivery of property), 120B  (criminal conspiracy) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), among others.Ramdev's herbal medicine company Patanjali Ayurved has launched 'Coronil tablet and Swasari vati' medicines claiming they can cure the highly contagious disease within seven days.It has also claimed that the two Ayurveda-based medicines have shown 100 per cent favourable results during clinical trials on COVID-19 infected patients except those on a life support system. However, the AYUSH ministry said that the facts of the claim and details of the stated scientific study are not known to it.It has sought from the company a detailed report on composition, testing and other data of the drugs.The ministry also used powers under a 1954 law to ask the firm to "stop advertising/publicizing" claims of corona cure drug until the issue is examined by it.A government notification bars companies from advertising a cure without government approval. But it wasn't immediately clear if the drug can still be sold.Ramdev said the medicines have been developed by Patanjali Research Center, Haridwar and privately-owned National Institute of Medical Science, Jaipur following all protocols with clinically controlled trial-based evidence.Patanjali group has an estimated turnover of around Rs 10,500 crore.

24-06-2020||New Delhi||Pak attempts to list three Indians in Afghanistan as terror sponsors||In its eighth term at the UN Security Council, India will have to spend its diplomatic energy on fending off attempts by Pakistan to list three Indians as terrorists after the US blocked its first bid to list another Indian.Last year, Pakistan had proposed the designation of four Indian nationals under the UN 1267 Sanctions List under which Masood Azhar was listed a terrorist.After the US did not see much substance in the Pakistani proposal to target Venumadhav Dongara, an engineer who at that time was working on a project in Afghanistan, Pakistan has turned its attention to three others—Ajoy Mistry, Gobinda Patnaik and Angara Appaji.Pakistan alleges that these people were using their work as engineers as cover to provide financial, technical and material support to terrorist groups including TTP, Tariq Gidar Group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar.“We are disappointed that Pakistan’s proposal to designate Venumadhav Dongara as a terrorist has been objected to. Pakistan hopes that the listing requests of other three Indian nationals will be given due consideration by the UNSC 1267 Sanctions Committee in an objective and transparent manner,’’ said a Pakistan Foreign Office statement.“Taking advantage of the prolonged conflict in our neighbourhood, India has fomented terrorism inside Pakistan by providing training, financial and material support to terrorist groups to kill innocent people in Pakistan. These Indian nationals are now residing in India with impunity which vindicates Pakistan’s position that India is a state-sponsor of terrorism,” it added.Pakistan was unable to provide additional evidence to back up its accusations against Dongara, working with an RPG group company, of having orchestrated the Peshawar airbase attack last year.Pakistan began the move to accuse the four Indians in March last year, which sources say was retaliation for New Delhi’s vigorous efforts to get Jaish-e-Mohamed chief Masood Azhar listed as a designated terrorist. Getting wind of the FIR against Dongara filed in Peshawar, Indian agencies managed to ask Dongara to get out of Afghanistan to preclude the possibility of Pakistani agencies kidnapping him. The other three Indians are also back in the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-attempts-to-list-three-indians-in-afghanistan-as-terror-sponsors-103791

24-06-2020||New Delhi||Chemists not to sell Remdesivir, only direct supply to hospitals: Drug controller||After permitting restricted emergency use of antivirals Remdesivir and Favipiravir in COVID-19 patients, the government on Wednesday issued guidance on the manner of supply of drugs to ensure their proper use.The apex drug regulator said Remdesivir injectable formulations allowed for use in severe COVID-19 patients can’t be sold off chemist counters and will only be supplied for use directly to hospitals and institutions.Favipiravir tablets, approved by Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for use in mild to moderate COVID-19 cases, will, however, be available at chemist shops.“Both drugs will be sold only on medical prescription by the treating doctor and in both cases, informed consent of the patient or his representative in a prescribed form are mandatory before initiating treatment,” DCGI VG Somani said in an order today.Informed consent form requires patients to sign up for: “I have been informed of the possible benefits and well as risks (including side effects) from the usage of the drug by my physician after which I have made an informed choice to take it.”In a major development, the government has restricted the stability period for Favipiravir tablets to four months from June to September which means its use will be reviewed after four months.“The idea is to collect efficacy data on the drug which has been approved for COVID use for the first time in India. The current shelf life of FabiFlu which Glenmark will market is only four months. If the efficacy data is satisfactory the expiry date can be extended. If not, drug use can be modified,” a source said.While Remdesivir injectable formulations are expected to be available within 48 hours in hospitals, Favipiravir has already been stocked by chemists.DCGI has allowed Cipla and Hetero Drugs to manufacture and market the generic version of Remdesivir, originally developed by the US-based Gilead Sciences; while Glenmark Pharmaceuticals have been permitted to make Favipiravir, the first oral therapy for COVID-19. Favipiravir has shown rapid reductions in viral load in limited trials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chemists-not-to-sell-remdesivir-only-direct-supply-to-hospitals-drug-controller-103771
24-06-2020||Washington||Trump defends suspending Green Card applications till Dec 31||US President Donald Trump has defended his decision to suspend issuing of green cards till the end of the year, saying it was needed to give jobs to Americans.Through an executive order, Trump, in April, had suspended issuing of green cards for 90 days. On Monday, he issued a proclamation which extended the suspension till December 31, 2020.“So, we want to give jobs to Americans right now. Right now, we want jobs going to Americans,” Trump told reporters in San Luis, Arizona on Tuesday when asked by reporters to explain the suspension order.Trump, seeking another term in the White House in the November 3 presidential election, on Monday said the step was essential to help millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the economic crisis amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.Trump said that the overall unemployment rate in the country nearly quadrupled between February and May of 2020 -- producing some of the most extreme unemployment rates ever recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.While the rate of 13.3 per cent unemployment in May reflects a marked decline from April, millions of Americans remain out of work.With the current suspension in effect, the wait time for Indian technology professionals to get legal permanent residency in the US is now running into decades.The US every year allocates only 1,40,000 green cards for all employment-preference immigrants, including accompanying family members.Currently, there is a backlog of almost 10 lakh foreign nationals and accompanying family members lawfully residing in the United States. These applicants have been approved but are yet to receive employment green cards.The backlog is projected to increase each year because the number of foreign workers who self-sponsor or are sponsored by their US employers for green cards each year exceeds the annual allocation.In addition to this numerical limit, there is a statutory seven per cent per-country ceiling applied to each preference category, which prevents the monopolisation of employment-based green cards by foreign nationals from a single country.“This per-country ceiling has created decades-long waits for nationals from large migrant-sending countries such as India and China,” a latest Congressional report said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trump-defends-suspending-green-card-applications-till-dec-31-103767
24-06-2020||New Delhi||India records highest single-day spike of 15,413 COVID-19 cases, Delhi surpasses Mumbai||As India recorded the highest single-day jump of nearly 16,000 COVID-19 cases, Delhi surpassed Mumbai on Wednesday while the lockdown in containment zones in West Bengal was extended till July 31 and a fresh ‘test, track and treat’ strategy put in place by the Centre to curb the spread of the infection.Use of combination of various tests and making testing widely available to all symptomatic individuals across the country were at the heart of the government’s revised strategy to fight the pandemic that has claimed over 14,000 lives.Delhi, which already is the second worst hit state in terms of coronavirus caseload and fatalities, overtook Mumbai after the number of cases soared by 3,788 to touch 70,390. Mumbai has so far recorded 69,625 cases, according to official figures.As part of the Delhi government’s revised COVID-19 response plan, a house to to house screening will be completed by June 30 in containment zones and for the rest of the city by July 6 in what is billed as a mammoth exercise.As COVID-19 cases continued to spike in West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced extension of the lockdown in  the containment zones  till July 31. The lockdown in these zones was to end on June 30. With overall cases in the state inching towards 15,000, it is in the 7th position in the all India tally.Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka surpassed the 10,000 mark while Telangana inched towards this grim milestone, according to official figures from the states.In all, 12 states now account for more than 10,000 coronavirus cases as they continued to report record daily spikes that were mainly attributed to augmented testing.As daily testing of samples of blood and throat and  nose swabs crossed two lakh for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic, over 14,000 new coronavirus cases were registered in the country for the fifth day in a row to take the total count  to 4,56,183, according to the Union Health Ministry data. The fatalities also rose by a record 465 and the death toll stood at 14,476.At the same time the recovery rate was steadily improving to reach 56.71 per cent, the data showed.The country has witnessed a surge of 2,65,648 infections from June 1 till June 24 with Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh remaining the top five contributors to the rising tally.  As many as 3,890 new COVID-19 cases were registered in Maharashtra on Wednesday, taking the count of patients to 1,42,900, a health department official said.Andhra Pradesh accounted  for 10,331 cases with 497 more people testing positive. While it took close to three months from March for the first 5,000 cases to emerge in AP, the second 5,000 came in just 15 days.The tally in Karnataka was 10,118 with the state reporting  397 new positive cases.The surge in COVID-19 cases continued unabated in Tamil Nadu with an all-time high of 2,865 people testing positive in a single day, taking the tally to 67,468 while the toll mounted to 866 with 33 deaths.With the focus on increasing testing, the state analysed a record 32,079 samples on Wednesday. Inter-district public transport bus services were also  being withdrawn in the state for six days from Thursday.Kerala also reported  the highest single day spike  of 152 cases pushing the infection count to 3,603, officials said.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said a total of 73,52,911 samples were tested up to June 23 with 2,15,195 samples being  analysed on Tuesday and there were over 1,000 COVID-19 testing laboratories but acknowledged more needs to be done.“However, in spite of these developments, access to testing still remains a huge challenge in a large country like India. There is a definite need to increase the outreach of testing by introducing rapid point of care diagnostic tests,” the ICMR noted in its advisory issued late on Tuesday.Expanding the testing criterion for coronavirus, the ICMR said it should be made widely available to all symptomatic individuals across the country.“Since ‘test, track and treat’ is the only way to prevent spread of infection and save lives, it is imperative that testing should be made widely available to all symptomatic individuals in every part of the country and contact tracing mechanisms for containment of infection are further strengthened,” it said in an advisory on ‘Newer Additional Strategies for COVID-19 Testing’ .The apex health research body has also advised authorities to enable all government and private hospitals, offices and public sector units to perform antibody-based COVID-19 testing for surveillance to help allay fears and anxiety of healthcare workers and office employees.The earlier advisories on rapid antibody testing advisories had focused on areas reporting clusters (containment zones), large migration gatherings/evacuees centers and testing of symptomatic ILI individuals at facility level.Besides, the ICMR also recommended deployment of rapid antigen detection tests for COVID-19 in combination with RT-PCR tests in all containment zones, all central and state government medical colleges and government hospitals, all private hospitals approved by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare (NABH), all NABL-accredited and ICMR approved private labs, for COVID-19 testing.“ICMR advises all state governments, public and private institutions concerned to take required steps to scale up testing for COVID-19 by deploying combination of various tests as advised,” the advisory added.Also, there is value in conducting serosurvey with IgG-based antibody tests, an additional testing method, in certain situations, it said. The Immunoglobulin (IgG) Serum test is performed to determine the presence of any infection in the body and the level of immunity.In Delhi, authorities have planned to use Aarogya Setu app coupled with an IT-driven tool to boost surveillance and contact tracing in the COVID-19 affected areas.This is part of the new COVID-19 response plan prepared by Delhi government health department, as per the recommendations from the Union Health Ministry.The purpose is to boost surveillance of positive cases and improve contact tracing, officials said.The Karnataka government also issued an order notifying establishment of fever clinics and swab collection centres in 66 private hospitals or medical colleges in the city, aimed at controlling the spread of the disease.It said, with the spike in number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) cases, there is a need to increase the number of fever clinics and swab collection centres.In the national capital, the Army Medical Corps(AMC) was  roped in to manage the  health care at the  Railways’ COVID-19 care centre at the Shakur Basti station where the first  two patients  were put up in isolation coaches.The Indo-Tibetan Border Police(ITBP) also took over a 10,000-bed capacity centre in Delhi for coronavirus patients, officials said.A team of officials from the border guarding force visited the Radha Soami Beas facility and held discussions with the Delhi government and other stakeholders who will be partners in running the centre, an ITBP officer said.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-records-highest-single-day-spike-of-15-413-covid-19-cases-delhi-surpasses-mumbai-103762

24-06-2020||New Delhi||Time for unity and solidarity; relaunch of 'scion' can wait: Nadda||In a stinging attack on the Gandhi family of the Congress, BJP president JP Nadda on Wednesday said a dynasty and its courtiers had "grand delusions" of the opposition being about itself and stated that a "rejected and ejected" family is not equal to the entire opposition.In his tweets, Nadda said it was time for unity and solidarity, and the "relaunch of the scion for the nth time can wait", an apparent dig at Rahul Gandhi, who has been aggressive in his attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his handling of the border row with China.Nadda said India lost thousands of square kilometres of land due to the "misadventures of one dynasty" and claimed that the Siachen glacier, where the Indian Army has a strong presence, was almost gone. No wonder India has rejected them, he said.The BJP president posted a news report to back his assertions about Siachen."One 'royal' dynasty and their 'loyal' courtiers have grand delusions of the Opposition being about one dynasty. A dynast throws tantrums and his courtiers peddle that fake narrative. Latest one relates to the Opposition asking questions to the Government," Nadda said.Though he did not directly name the Gandhi family or any of its members, the reference was clear.He said it was the opposition's right to ask questions and added that the all-party meeting called by the Prime Minister saw healthy deliberations, with several opposition leaders giving their valuable inputs.They also fully supported the Centre in determining the way ahead, Nadda said."One family was an exception. Any guesses who," he asked.Targeting the Gandhis, the BJP president said, "One rejected and ejected dynasty is NOT equal to the entire Opposition. One dynasty's interests are not India's interests. Today, the nation is united and supportive of our armed forces. This is the time for unity and solidarity. Relaunch of 'the scion' for the nth time can wait."

A total of 12 out of 157 trainee sailors have been found coronavirus positive as on date," the release said.Since the infection is contained to one particular quarantine block, the possibility of spread of infection to other areas/personnel of the establishment is negligible.However, all precautions have been instituted to obviate further spread, it said.All precautions, instructions and directions issued with respect to COVID-19 by the Government of India and the Indian Navy, from time to time, are being strictly adhered to, the release said.All personnel in the base are already maintaining the required precautions against COVID-19, it added.INS Shivaji is an Indian Naval station located in the hill town of Lonavala in Maharashtra's Pune district. It houses the Naval College of Engineering which trains officers of the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard.

This also shows how Nepal’s current regime has surrendered to China and is now making anti-India statements and resorting to anti-India activities,” top sources said.Apart from Rui village, China has also occupied strategic lands at 11 places across Nepal. Around 36 hectares in four districts of Nepal, which border China, have been illegally occupied by China, but so far the Nepalese government is tight-lipped about it.
