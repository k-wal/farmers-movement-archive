However, we cannot give you a consolidated amount of money they paid as the services are still running. “Currently we have a demand for 15 trains. We have also written to the states to give their balance demand. We will run these services as long as they are needed,” PS Mishra, Member Traffic, Railway Board said at an online press briefing.Last week, the Railways had said that the average fare per person on Shramik Special trains was Rs 600 and indicated that by carrying 60 lakh migrant workers home since May 1, it has generated a revenue of around Rs 360 crore.It also said that the Railways spent Rs 3,400 per Shramik Special train and incurred a total loss of around Rs 2,040 crore in running these trains. The cost of operating such trains is being shared by the Centre and the states in a 85-15 per cent formula respectively.The running of Shramik Special trains had kicked up a storm after political parties alleged that the national transporter was charging migrants for the journey.Mishra also said that while the Railways’ freight loading suffered during the lockdown period, it was already showing signs of recovery. He said there was a dip in freight loading by 57.95 MT (28 per cent) during the period April-May 2020. In June, loading increased to 64.52 MT which was a dip of around 8.31 per cent than in June last year.During the lockdown phase (between April and May), the railways achieved 70 per cent of last year’s freight loading and also maintained the supply of essentials with foodgrains loading being 94 per cent more than last year, he said.                                 The official added that during the opening up phase in June, there was a revival in freight loading with the railways achieving 90 per cent of last year’s loadings during the same month. These included steel, cement, foodgrains and fertilizers. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-pendency-from-states-on-payment-for-shramik-special-trains-railways-102739

22-06-2020||---||Two locust swarms from Indo-Pak border areas reported||New Delhi, June 22Two locust swarms from Indo-Pak border areas, one each in Bikaner and Sri Ganganagar district, in Rajasthan, were reported on Monday, the government said.The officials said the locust-control operation was in full swing mainly in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.At present, swarms of immature pink locusts with an intermittent population of maturing yellow adults are active in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Sri Ganganagar, Jaipur, Nagaur, and Ajmer districts of Rajasthan, Panna district of Madhya Pradesh and Lalitpur district of Uttar Pradesh.The immature locust is very active and mobile, making it difficult to control the swarm at one location, owing to which it takes four to five days to control at different locations to completely eliminate the locust population in one place.The yellow, mature adults appear tending to copulate in some areas, it said.As on June 21, locust control has been undertaken in 1,14,026-hectare area in Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.As many as 62 spray equipment (21 Micronair and 41 Ulvamast) are being used by Locust Circle Offices while 200 employees of Locust Warning Organisation are deployed for conducting survey and control work.“Control room has been established in all 10 Locust Circle Offices and also at LWO, Jodhpur. Even beyond the Scheduled Desert Area, temporary base camps are set up, at Jaipur, Ajmer, Dausa and Chittorgarh in Rajasthan; Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh; and at Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh for effective control of desert locust,” it said.Presently, the control work is in full swing with the cooperation and coordination of the states’ Agricultural Department, local administration and the BSF.Every day, locust-control operations are carried out in the morning hours with the help of vehicle-mounted sprayers, tractors and fire tender vehicles. The control operations are conducted with the cooperation and in coordination with concerned officials of district administration and states’ Agriculture Department.So far, the Rajasthan government has deployed total 2,142 tractors and 46 fire brigade vehicles, Madhya Pradesh totals 83 tractors and 47 fire brigade vehicles, Uttar Pradesh 4 tractors and 16 fire brigade vehicles, Punjab total 50 tractors and 6 fire brigade vehicles and Gujarat deployed 38 tractors for locust control.The supply order for 60 additional sprayers is placed with M/s Micron, UK.The Government of India has also issued a supply order of five CD Atomizer kits with GPS trackers for aerial spray capabilities from this UK-based company.For effective control of locusts in inaccessible areas and on top of tall trees, the use of drones is also being explored.An e-tender was invited to provide services of drones for aerial spraying of pesticides. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has approved a conditional exemption for locust control.An Empowered Committee has been constituted under the Chairmanship of Additional Secretary, DAC&FW to assess and facilitate the possibility of aerial control capability as a locust control measure.On its recommendation, work order for engagement of drones was issued to five companies on June 6. These companies have started work in Barmer, Jaisalmer, Phalodi, Bikaner and Nagaur areas and so far, 12 drones have been deployed.The supply order has also been issued for purchase of 55 additional vehicles to strengthen the control capacity. As many as 33 vehicles have been delivered and deployed in locust control operations.The situation is monitored constantly by higher authorities and needful is being done on priority basis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-locust-swarms-from-indo-pak-border-areas-reported-102724
22-06-2020||New Delhi||Virtual meeting of foreign ministers of India, China and Russia to set tone for lowering of LAC tensions||A virtual meeting between the foreign ministers of India, China and Russia on Tuesday will form a critical component of New Delhi’s move to lower tensions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) where a meeting of senior army generals on Monday failed to provide a breakthrough.This second conversation between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart within a week is expected to pave the way for a more substantial meeting in Beijing between Indian Ambassador Vikram Misri and Luo Zhaohui later in the week.The effort will be to leverage the lowering of tensions to seek a pre-May 5 status quo at several sectors on the LAC as well as agree on not raising permanent structures in overlapping areas, said sources.The tenor of the talks will be undergirded by conversations currently on in Moscow between Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Sergei Shoigu, a trusted Putin aide.Sources said Singh’s visit was announced after several chips had fallen in place including the first telephonic conversation between Jaishankar and Wang a day after 20 Indians and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died in a scuffle in Galwan Valley on June 15.That Singh reached Moscow two days before the Victory Parade commemorating World War II suggests intense conversations with trusted Putin aides, they said.Russia has been positioning itself as an interlocutor because a rupturing of China-India ties is against its two-decade old policy to dilute US influence over the subcontinent and Central Asia by involving them in multilateral organisation such as BRICS and RIC (Russia-India-China) formats.Moscow also backs the China initiated Shanghai Cooperation Organisation of which India, Pakistan and four Central Asian countries are also members.In contrast to Donald Trump’s repeated offers to insert the US in cooling down tensions after castigating China, the Russian approach has been discreet.The Kremlin has let it be known that it is confident that both countries will be able to bilaterally sort out their differences.“We consider that the two countries are capable of taking necessary steps to prevent such situations in the future and to ensure that this is a safe region for nations, first of all, China and India,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had observed.Russian Ambassador in India Nikolai Kudashev has been regularly briefed on the situation by Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla. Russian interest has been leavened with India clearing orders worth Rs 5,000 crore for more Mig and Sukhoi fighter jets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/virtual-meeting-of-foreign-ministers-of-india-china-and-russia-to-set-tone-for-lowering-of-lac-tensions-102723

22-06-2020||Chandigarh||IAF airlifts dozens of tanks to Ladakh to beef up firepower||As military build-up on both sides of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh continues, a constant stream of IAF heavy lift aircraft have airlifted dozens of additional tanks and armoured personnel carriers to the Himalayan heights for beefing up Indian firepower.Amidst carrying out combat air patrols over Ladakh and maintaining operational readiness platforms at various airbases to scramble fighters, the IAF is using its American C-17s and Russian IL-76s freighters for carrying out multiple sorties out of Chandigarh and other places over the past weeks for the purpose.Some elements of armoured formations based in the Western Sector, which include the newer T-90s, have been earmarked for the Ladakh frontier.Prior to the current face-off with China, which witnessed extremely violent moments, India had three armoured regiments stationed in Ladakh, amounting to the equivalent of an armoured brigade.The manner of concentration and employment of an armoured formation in high-altitude areas is a lot different than that in the plains, the tradition domain of mechanised forces.“This is for the first time since 1962 that tanks and mechanised elements have been urgently airlifted to Ladakh to meet operational requirements and beef up offensive and defensive capabilities when both sides are locked in close confrontation,” an officer said.“Tanks already stationed there were also airlifted over a period of time, but that was done under different conditions,” he added.During the 1962 Sino-Indian war, the IAF had used the AN-12 transport aircraft to ferry six AMX light tanks of 30 Lancers, to Chushul, just south of the Pangong Tso lake, another flashpoint in the ongoing stand-off.In the 1990s, the IAF began airlifting T-72 tanks and BMP-1/2 mechanised infantry combat vehicles in the IL-76 aircraft to Leh. The doctrine of deploying tanks in Ladakh saw a reversal subsequently, but was revived again with the forming up of three armoured units picking up in 2014The Army’s perspective plans call for an armoured brigade each in the northern and eastern sectors along with three additional mechanised infantry battalions outfitted for high-altitude operations, but financial constraints have cast a deep shadow over the process.China, on the other hand, is reported to have an armoured division and two motorised infantry divisions in Lanzhou Military Region opposite Ladakh and two armoured brigades and four motorised infantry divisions in Chengdu Military Region opposite Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. A division has three brigades.Though mountainous and extremely rugged, there are some relatively flat areas in the Ladakh sector like Chushal and Demchok where tanks and armoured personnel carriers can be employed for defence as well as offence.Besides adding to firepower, tanks also act as a deterrent. While the general altitude where tanks would be operating in Ladakh is 12,000-14,000 feet, the Army has carried out successful trials of driving up tanks to altitudes above 18,000 feet.The employment of tanks in such a terrain and altitude also has some constraints. Rarefied air affects engine performance and freezing temperatures affect fuel and lubricants. Tank crew also requires special cold weather clothing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-airlifts-dozens-of-tanks-to-ladakh-to-beef-up-firepower-102716

Officials say residents ofbuildings who were strictly observing the lockdown for the past three months are now easing up and coming out in large numbers. Moreover, many buildings are allowing maids, drivers and other household help to enter the premises.On Monday the civic body sealed Tahnee Heights, a 28-storeyed building in posh Malabar Hill, after 21 people tested positive for the virus over a week.“We suspect that the driver employed by one of the residents infected other servants including security personnel employed in the building. Subsequently, two residents were also infected,” says Assistant Municipal Commissioner Prashant Gaikwad in whose ward the building falls.The authorities sealed the entire building on Monday preventing people from moving in and out of the premises, officials said.Civic officials say they expect more such cases in the coming days.”Around 70 per cent of the cases in my ward are among building residents while the rest is from the slums,” says Assistant Municipal Commissioner Bhagyashree Kapse of the R/Central ward in suburban Mumbai.“Many people who tested positive say they only came out to buy groceries or pick up packages from couriers,” says another civic official.According to officials, the cases from buildings may go up as many residents who return to their offices and businesses allow maids and other essential workers to access their premises.With similar statistics coming from officials in the suburbs, the authorities have begun a door-to-door drive to check for cases in the buildings. Health workers are going around in ambulances in thesuburbs to quiz people about fever, breathlessness and other symptoms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/house-help-and-vendors-bring-covid-19-virus-back-to-mumbai-buildings-102705

With this, India “joins the ranks of a handful of countries doing WBE on COVID-19”, Andrew Singer, an environmental microbiologist at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, said on Twitter.The WBE is a promising approach to understand the status of disease outbreak in a certain catchment by monitoring viral load in wastewater.Recent studies had reported that the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was present in the faeces of infected individuals. Genetic material (RNA) from the virus has been found in sewage entering treatment plants.Because treatment plants collected wastewater across large regions, measuring the level of RNA in untreated wastewater might provide a valuable insight into the percentage of people infected within a region, the researchers said.In the latest study released on June 18, scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Gandhinagar collaborated with the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB). They studied samples of wastewater collected on May 8 and May 27 from the Old Pirana Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Ahmedabad.The plant receives up to 106 million litres per day (MLD) of influent from the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital which is treating COVID-19 patients, explained Manish Kumar of the Discipline of Earth Sciences, IITGN, who led the research effort.All three SARS-CoV-2 genes — ORF1ab, N and S — were found in the wastewater coming into the treatment plant, said the researchers, who have submitted their study for publication in the international journal ‘Science of the Total Environment’.They noted that no gene was spotted in the effluent leaving the plant after treatment.The scientists said the gene copy loading — the quantity of the genetic material of the virus — detected on May 27 was almost 10 times more than that detected on May 8.This corresponded broadly with the trajectory of the incidence of the disease. The number of active COVID-19 patients in the Ahmedabad city was two times higher on May 27 than on May 8, they said.According to the scientists, the WBE was an effective tool during outbreaks of other viruses such as poliovirus and hepatitis A.The Ahmedabad study aims at assisting concerned authorities and policymakers to formulate or upgrade COVID-19 surveillance to have an explicit picture of the phase of the pandemic, the researchers added.Kumar cited reports to say a WBE study has indicated the presence of the coronavirus in Italy in December 2019, way before the first confirmed case in the country.“Developing an advanced surveillance system for environmental samples using biotechnological approaches is the need of the hour. This can help us track real-time situations not only for the current pandemic but also for seasonal epidemics,” Madhvi Joshi, joint director of GBRC and one of the authors of the paper, told PTI.According to the researchers, the number of gene copies was found comparable to that reported in the untreated wastewaters of Australia, China and Turkey, and lower than that of the US, France and Spain.Prosun Bhattacharya of Sweden’s KTH Royal Institute of Technology noted that WBE could be unimaginably impactful in the war against COVID-19 with the right information about the catchment and number of people residing in the vicinity, adding that the research by Kumar and his colleagues had put India on the world map pertaining to WBE surveillance.Estimates based on European and North American data suggest that each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 would excrete millions if not billions of viral genomes into wastewater per day, they said.This translated to between 0.15 and 141.5 million viral genomes per litre of wastewater generated, the researchers said.While infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 through wastewater had not yet been reported, the virus potentially enters the wastewater stream from patient excretions and thus can be a great tool for pandemic monitoring, the researchers said.Using reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) — a laboratory technique of molecular biology — researchers should be able to detect the novel coronavirus with high sensitivity, Kumar said.“The findings reported by Kumar and colleagues demonstrate the successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater — a highly valuable contribution to global SARS-CoV-2 surveillance research efforts,” Kyle Bibby, associate professor and leader of Global Collaboration on WBE, University of Notre Dame in the US, told PTI.Bibby heads the WBE global collaboration comprising over 50 institutes and researchers.The group is compiling and sharing all results obtained through WBE surveillance for global comparison, according to an article published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.“I would like to congratulate India as one of the elite nations in world-wide efforts in detecting and quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials in their sewage samples. Kumar and his colleagues showed the capabilities of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in India, the second most populated nation with rapidly growing numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases,” said Keisuke Kuroda, associate professor in Environmental and Civil Engineering at Toyama Prefectural University, Japan.“This report will surely facilitate a nationwide initiative for detecting the early warning signals of COVID-19 outbreaks in various communities,” Kuroda told PTI.Ryo Honda of Japan’s Kanazawa University, who is leading a task force on wastewater surveillance in Japan, said the study was an important step for WBE of COVID-19 in India.

22-06-2020||Johannesburg||Terminally-ill Karnataka bishop, 4 infants among 340 evacuated from South Africa||A terminally-ill bishop from Karnataka stuck in South Africa due to the COVID-19 lockdown was among 336 passengers and four infants who left for India on a chartered flight on Sunday.The passengers on the Ethiopian Airlines flight also included an eight-member Christian group from Goa visiting South Africa on a religious seminar but having landed in jail and another 15-member group of Hakki Pikki tribe of traditional healing oil makers from Karnataka.Almost all the passengers were from various southern states with about half of them from Hyderabad alone, said Anju Ranjan, Consul General in Johannesburg, who coordinated and arranged for the stranded Indians to fly back to the Telangana capital via Addis Ababa.Ranjan arranged repatriation of Indians with assistance from Satguru Travel and India Club, a group of expatriates, who have been undertaking community service work in South Africa for nearly two decades now.The Karnataka bishop has been suffering from the last stage of cancer and got stranded here amid the lockdown, said India Club officials, adding his only desire was to die in his homeland.“The group from Goa was here on a religious seminar but had landed in jail as they were unable to pay for their accommodation in a hotel after their extended stay due to the COVID-19 lockdown,” said Ranjan, as she flagged off several buses bedecked with the Tricolours.“The Consulate General of India with its efforts, was able to get them released and put them on the charter,” she added.The Hakki Pikki group of 40 people was stuck in South Africa, mostly in Johannesburg and Cape Town, for the past five months and had no means to travel back to India, said Ranjan.“The Indian High Commission and consulates in Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg, with support from the business community, was able to sponsor tickets for 12 of them to travel back to India on the charter flight,” she said, adding the three others managed to buy tickets on their own.“I would like to thank the India Club for their initiative with a chartered flight with Satguru Travels; as well as the local community and South African government for assisting in this mammoth task of sending these passengers to Hyderabad,” Ranjan said.The passengers were in buoyant mood. Most of them did not mind even paying Rand 17,000 (over Rs 74,000) each for their air tickets, almost four times the normal single airfare between Johannesburg and Hyderabad.Ashish Sharma of Satguru Travels said they had rallied to the call from Ranjan, and the company provided as many sponsorships as it could for the Indian citizens who had been stranded in South Africa.India Club officials said with more than  half of passengers hailing from Hyderabad, it would make their mandatory quarantine periods on arrival easier than what it would have been had they landed in Delhi or Mumbai.

22-06-2020||Kolkata||Indian smartphone makers feel anti-Chinese sentiments unlikely to work in their favour||Indian smartphone makers are not too hopeful over prospects of a reversal in fortunes due to the current anti-Chinese sentiments triggered by the Sino-India border tension, insisting that low-cost funding is the need of the hour to take on foreign rivals.There have been calls for boycott of Chinese products from several quarters following the Ladakh clash that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead.“The early trends are exciting. But, Indian handset makers need low-cost funds to counter the deep-pocketed Chinese companies,” Executive Director of the Jaina Group, which owns the ‘Karbonn’ brand, Abhishek Garg, told PTI.Proper intervention by the government can bring back the fortunes of Indian brands, he said.Most Indian smartphone makers were relegated following the entry of Chinese companies in the last few years, while others turned into OEM suppliers for the overseas firms, industry experts said.Lava International Ltd, another Indian company, said the anger among people against China and its products will not translate into more business for the firm.“It is more of a responsibility for the country. A responsibility to grow ourselves and build such skills and capabilities that could enable us to compete in the China market as well.“These short-term emotions will die down quickly; finally we have to beat our competition by delivering products, which provide a much better proposition than our competitors,” said Hari Om Rai, one of the founders and managing director of the company.Garg said Indian handset makers suffered on several grounds like the inability to match huge marketing spends.Banks, too, tightened credit lines with sliding market share, he said.According to market reports, Karbonn Mobiles, Lava International and Micromax are set to launch new models.

22-06-2020||New Delhi||CBSE likely to inform Supreme Court on Tuesday about its decision on pending board exams||The Central Board of Secondary Education is likely to inform the Supreme Court on Tuesday about its decision on conducting the pending Class X and XII board exams, which were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, officials said.The board last week told the court it would “very shortly” take a decision, after a plea by a group of parents sought quashing of the notification for conducting the remaining Class X and XII exams from July 1 to 15 and demanded that the students be awarded marks based on an internal assessment or in line with marks allotted for practical exams.A similar request has been made by the Maharashtra, Delhi and Odisha governments to the HRD Ministry.“The decision will be informed to the court on Tuesday and an official notification will accordingly be issued as per directions of the Apex Court,” a senior CBSE official said.The parents have said in the plea that students could be exposed to COVID-19 infection if they appeared for exams amid an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.They have cited that the CBSE had cancelled the examinations of Class X and XII for its around 250 schools situated abroad and the board has decided to award marks on the basis of either practical exams or an internal assessment because of the pandemic.The CBSE has decided the fresh schedule of board exams from July 1 to 15 to ensure that they are completed before competitive examinations. While engineering entrance exam JEE-Mains is scheduled from July 18 to 23, medical entrance exam NEET is to be held on July 26.“A decision about the two exams will also be taken in accordance with the decision on board exams,” the official said.The CICSE board has already announced that Class X and XII students can choose to not appear for pending board exams and be marked as per their performance in pre-board exams or internal assessment.The board had submitted the proposal before the Bombay High Court last week in response to a petition filed by a parent seeking directions to the authorities to cancel exams in view of the spike in COVID-19 cases.Universities and schools across the country have been shut since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shut down as part of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. A nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into effect the next day.While the government has eased several restrictions, schools and colleges continue to remain closed.

22-06-2020||New Delhi||SC allows restricted  Puri Rath Yatra, says ‘can’t micromanage’ it||Four days after placing a ban on this year's Lord Jagannath's Rath Yatra at Puri, the Supreme Court on Monday allowed it in a restricted manner after the Centre, Odisha Government and the temple management assured that social distancing norms and other COVID19 protocols shall be followed.The Puri Rath Yatra festival­­­---which attracts a large number of Indian and foreign devotees and tourists---is scheduled to commence on June 23. An estimated one million people took part in the Rath Yatra that goes on for 20 days.While allowing a restricted Rath Yatra, a three-judge Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde made it clear no public participation will be allowed. The order came on applications files by several individuals and organisations, including Pattajoshi Mohapatra---the Hereditary Chief Servitor of Lord Jagannatha Temple, Puri---seeking recall of the June 18 order."Indeed,  if it is possible to ensure that there is no public attendance,  we see no reason  why the  Rath Yatra cannot be conducted safely along its usual route from temple to temple," the top court said.While modifying ts June 18 order that had put a blanket ban on this year's Rath Yatra in view of COVID19 pandemic, the Bench issued an elaborate 11-point order to be followed for the Rath Yatra.It ordered that all entry  points  into Puri---airports, railway stations, bus stands, etc.--- shall be closed during Rath Yatra festival.Odisha Government shall impose a curfew in Puri beginning 8 pm Monday on all days and during all  the time when Rath Yatra chariots are taken in procession.  It may also impose curfew in Puri on such other days and during such time as deemed  necessary.  No one to come out of their houses, places of residence, hotels, lodging houses, etc.it said.Each Rath shall be pulled by not more than 500 persons, including officials and police personnel, who shall be tested for COVID-19 and shall be permitted to pull the chariot only if found negative, it said.There shall be an interval of one hour between two chariots and each one engaged  in  pulling  the chariot  shall  maintain  social  distancing  before, during and after the Rath Yatra, the Bench said.Only such persons shall be associated with rituals relating to Rath Yatra who have tested COVID-19 negative, it added. The top court made it clear that the primary responsibility for conducting Rath Yatra shall be that of the Committee  in-charge of Puri Jagannath Temple  Administration. Committee members  shall  be  responsible for compliance conditions  imposed by court and directions issued  by Centre, state government.  Officers designated by  the state for Rath Yatra shall be responsible, it said.In view of the fact that devotees were not allowed to take part in the Rath Yatra, it directed that rituals and Rath Yatra shall be freely covered by the visual media and state Government shall allow TV cameras to be  installed at such places as may be found necessary by TV crew.Bare minimum number of  people  shall  be  allowed by  the  committee  to  participate  in rituals  and  Rath Yatra, it emphasized.It said Odisha Government may take such help as may be found necessary from the Centre.  The top court directed the state government to maintain a record of all those allowed to participate in Rath Yatra or rituals connected therewith along with details of their medical conditions after testing.  "While we do not have the official copy of the gazette itself, we are informed that in the 18th-19th century a yatra of this kind was responsible for the spread of cholera an plague 'like wild fire'.   We say this in order to remind the authorities concerned that the situation can become dangerous if the rules of caution are ignored," it said.    Earlier, the Centre told the top court that the historic Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra in Puri can be allowed without public participation in view of COVID19 pandemic.“The tradition of centuries may not be stopped. It's a matter of faith for crores. If Lord Jagannath will not come out tomorrow, he cannot come out for 12 years as per traditions,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said. Also read: Entire nation delighted over SC decision on Jagannath Rath Yatra: Amit Shah'Delighted'Home Minister Amit Shah welcomed the court’s decision and said the “entire nation is delighted with Supreme Court’s decision”.Shah said he had spoken to the Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s instructions.   “Prime Minister Narendra Modi not only understood sentiments of devotees but also initiated consultations,” he said.

22-06-2020||Kolkata||DRI busts wildlife smuggling syndicate, seizes 22 exotic birds||The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence has busted a major wildlife smuggling syndicate and seized 22 exotic birds, including the Hyacinth Macaw, illegally brought into the country from Bangladesh, the DRI said on Monday.Other birds seized at the Kolkata airport were Pesquet’s Parrot, Severe Macaw and Hahn’s Macaw, the DRI said in a statement. The cobalt-coloured Hyacinth Macaw is possibly the most stunning of the macaw family, with a ring of bright yellow around its eye and at the base and the corners of its beak, and it is also the largest of all parrots.These birds are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with Hyacinth Macaw being accorded the highest protection.This makes them more vulnerable to smugglers and DRI says the increasing trend of smuggling of endangered fauna from the world over into India is apparently “driven by the human greed to have such wildlife as exotic pets” in farmhouses.Illegal wildlife trade ranks as the fourth-largest transnational organised crime, after narcotics, counterfeit goods and human trafficking.“West Bengal and Northeast India have become particularly exposed to this type of wildlife smuggling due to the border with Bangladesh and Myanmar along with proximity to Thailand,” the agency said.“There is consequently an urgent need to step up the fight against wildlife crime, which has clear environmental and therefore social and economic impact as well. The possibility of spread of zoonotic diseases on account of smuggling in such exotic species of fauna is increasingly becoming not just a concern for India, but a global concern, in the backdrop of COVID-19,” the DRI said.“Apart from the risk of an ecological disaster that this kind of smuggling entails, increasingly, these can also pose significant health hazards as they are potential harbingers of zoonotic diseases,” it added.The birds, smuggled in through Bongaon area on the Indo-Bangla border and being taken to Bangalore, have been handed over to the Alipore Zoological Garden.The DRI said two Kolkata residents, both under 30 years of age and well-educated, had been arrested in connection with the case. They were aware that these highly endangered birds had been smuggled from the Indo-Bangladesh border, the DRI said.The two face a sentence of up to seven years of imprisonment, it said.“DRI has been over the past few years, frequently conducting wildlife enforcement operations leading to successful interceptions and seizures of such exotic wildlife. Amongst the birds seized in these operations, it does appear that Macaws are an unfortunate favourite of the smuggling syndicates,” it added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dri-busts-wildlife-smuggling-syndicate-seizes-22-exotic-birds-102665

The quake also caused cracks on highways and roads at several places, he added.  The full extent of the damage is yet to be ascertained, the official said.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured Chief Minister Zoramthanga of all possible support from the Centre. "Spoke to the Chief Minister of Mizoram, Shri Zoramthanga Ji, on the situation in the wake of the earthquake there. Assured all possible support from the Centre," the prime minister tweeted. Union Home Minister Amit Shah also spoke to Zoramthanga and took stock of the situation. The home minister also assured the chief minister of all possible help from the central government to deal with the situation. The depth of the quake was 20 km while the coordinates of the epicentre are 23.22 (latitude) and 93.24 (longitude), it said.  An earthquake of 5.1 magnitude also hit the state on Sunday around 4.10 pm, the tremors of which were also felt in Meghalaya and Manipur. Another earthquake of 4.6 magnitude occurred on June 18. The Mizoram chief minister said assessment of the damage has been undertaken by the local MLA and district administration. He thanked the prime minister and the home minister for their assurance of support.  Chief Minister of neighbouring Tripura Biplab Kumar Deb said he hoped that the effect of earthquake in Mizoram was minimal and people were safe. "People of Tripura are always with Mizoram," he added. The Northeast falls in the high seismic zone and earthquakes are frequent. A minor earthquake on 2.8 magnitude hit Nagaland around 12.40 pm on Monday. The epicentre was 44 km away from Kohima, according to the National Centre for Seismology.

When you compared Indian case load keeping the population in mind you will see that India is doing much better than most nations despite its huge population. This is the result of graded preemptive response,” the Ministry said.The COVID responders of the government also said India was widening the gap between active infections and recoveries.Out of 4.25 lakh cases, 237295 have recovered and 174387 are active.The recovery rate is up to 55.77 per cent.Total number of deaths now are 13699 with new daily infections at 14821 and new daily recoveries at 9440.Rising numbers of cases in Delhi and Maharashtra continue to be top concerns of the government with these two states making up nearly 45 per cent of all cases in India. Delhi has also overtaken Tamil Nadu to become the second most COVID affected state in India after Maharashtra.Active testing and tracing efforts are key to disease control along with the community’s realisation that physical distance is a life saver until a vaccine or a drug arrives on the scene which would not be earlier than year end as per optimistic projections by the WHO.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-19-cases-per-lakh-lowest-globally-health-ministry-102642

This is the third young fan to have taken the extreme step.The family claimed that the Class 6 student would remain glued to the TV watching the news of the actor’s suicide before he took the extreme step on Saturday.Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Sarvesh Mishra said that the boy, whose father is an engineer with a private firm in Greater Noida, was at home with his mother, elder sister and grandmother.He went up to his room upstairs, bolted the door from inside and hanged himself with a cloth.The police officer said that the post mortem was not conducted on the request of the family.“There is no other apparent reason which could have made the boy end his life. We would request all parents to keep their children away from disturbing details of morbid incidents on news and social media,” he said.On June 16, a Class 10 student, who could not bear the loss of his favourite star, had committed suicide in Bareilly.Before hanging himself to death, the boy left a suicide note, in which he wrote, “If he can do it, Why can’t I” Earlier, a girl ended her life in Odisha because she could not bear the actor’s passing away.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/12-year-old-fan-of-sushant-rajput-ends-life-102636

Quoting a few experts, it sought to deliver a warning to India against doing anything similar to China for there could be “devastating results”.Also read: PM cannot allow China to use his words as a vindication of their position: ManmohanLin Minwang, a professor at Fudan University’s Center for South Asian Studies in Shanghai, was quoted by the newspaper as saying, “It is normal to see heated nationalism in India, but we don’t need to worry whether nationalism will hijack the policymaking of India to further provoke China.”“When India is in conflict with Pakistan or other neighbours, nationalism might drive New Delhi to take actual operations, but when it comes to China, it is a different story,” Lin said.Also read: Forces told to be fully prepared for unprecedented LAC actionThe newspaper also quoted Wei Dongxu, whom it identified as a Beijing-based military expert, who alluded to that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words at an all-party meeting on Friday: “Indian forces can take all necessary steps are a show of strength for domestic audiences to appease the Indian masses and boost the Indian troops’ morale.”Also read: Vigil up as China lines up more jets, bombersHe was referring to this against the backdrop of the June 15 clashes in Galwan Valley in Ladakh, in which 20 Indian soldiers died and more than 70 others were wounded without reflecting on the Chinese casualties.Wei said: China’s capability not only in terms of the military but also overall and international influence, is superior to India’s.”The headline of the story was fairly provocative as it said ‘India knows it can’t have a war with China.’Chinese experts sought to draw comparisons with Pakistan which is already engaged in terror-boosting activities besides intensifying the cross-LoC firing inflicting casualties on soldiers and civilians and facing befitting retaliation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-media-urges-india-not-to-equate-beijing-with-pakistan-102627

Nearly 47 leading brands have partnered with Khanna in his initiative, under which over two million sanitary pads and 128,000 slippers have also been distributed.Last month, Khanna had organised one of the largest feasts in Mumbai on the occasion of Eid, mobilising efforts to feed nearly 1.75 lakh people in the city amid the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.“My hope is solidarity. Solidarity is everything. We can beat corona and we should all be united to figure out how to defeat this virus,” Khanna had said.India on Monday added 14,821 new COVID-19 cases, pushing the infection tally to 4,25,282, while the death toll rose to 13,699 with 445 new fatalities. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chef-vikas-khanna-organising-food-distribution-drive-for-mumbais-dabbawalas-widows-in-vrindavan-102625

22-06-2020||New Delhi||Record 15K spike, cases double to 4 L in 18 days||Rapid daily surges in new infections today pushed India’s Covid burden beyond four lakh cases to settle at 4,10,461 with nearly half the patients discharged and 13,254 dead.Government data recorded a 24-hour spike of 15,413 cases — a parameter that continues to set daily new peaks, posing the biggest challenge to Covid responders across the country. Even more worrisome is the fact the cumulative load has taken only 18 days to double from two lakh to four lakh cases. The count was 2,07,615 on June 3.With the disease growing significantly, India’s apex drug regulator today approved applications of two Indian pharma firms — Cipla and Hetero — to manufacture and sell the anti-viral drug Remdesivir for use in moderately ill Covid patients who are responding poorly to oxygen treatment.Cipla and Hetero can now manufacture the generic version of Remdesivir, which is manufactured by US-based Gilead Sciences. Gilead has already signed pacts with Cipla and Hetero for production and marketing of their branded drug in India.Remdesivir, like Favipiravir, will, however, only be available for emergency use to currently ill Covid patients and not to everyone.The government today clarified Remdesivir is an investigational therapy subject to further studies. The Drug Controller, two days ago, also permitted Glenmark Pharma to make and market Favipiravir, another anti-viral drug for emergency use in Covid patients.The government said Remdesivir is to be used in patients with moderate disease (those on oxygen). The drug cannot be given to persons with renal impairment, pregnant or lactating women and children under 12 years. It is to be administered as an injection for five days.The Health Ministry, meanwhile, is focusing on recoveries with 2,27,755 patients having already cured, taking the national recovery rate to 55.48%.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/record-15k-spike-cases-double-to-4-l-in-18-days-102467
22-06-2020||New Delhi||Bolton: US shouldn’t have ignored Indo-Pak  rivalry||In stark contrast to the attention paid to the US in New Delhi, former US National Security Adviser John Bolton’s “tell-all” book about his one year at the White House has scant references to India.  John Bolton, Ex-NSA, USThings may get out of handOn the post-Balakot military crises between India and Pakistan, the US establishment did not think it would go too far. The rivalry should not be ignored as it could snowball into unmanageable proportions.The few comments that he made about India are not in a positive light. On the post-Balakot military crises between India and Pakistan, the US establishment did not think it would go too far. But Bolton felt the rivalry should not be ignored as it could snowball into unmanageable proportions as had happened with Iran and North Korea.“After hours of phone calls, the crisis passed, perhaps because, in substance, there never really had been one. But when two nuclear powers spin up their military capabilities, it is best not to ignore it. No one else cared at the time, but the point was clear to me: this was what happened when people didn’t take nuclear proliferation from the likes of Iran and North Korea seriously,” wrote Bolton. Trump, recalls Bolton, flatly rejected India’s complaint that it would be disadvantaged if it stopped buying oil from Iran. Not only will India have to find new suppliers but the price will be higher. “India making this argument was understandable” but Trump simply said there was no need to consult Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “He’ll be okay,” he told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a phone call on the issue. While narrating this incident, Bolton too was unsympathetic to the grave discomfort that India will face. He even angrily reacted to bureaucrats who sought to point out that India was buying Iranian oil at prices well below the global market. “It is incomprehensible,” he said on officials stating that “India is so important” or “Japan is so important.”Trump’s indifference to the troubles of allies was not restricted to India but applied in full measure to others as well. On one foreign leader’s trip to Washington on the same issue, Trump asked his aides to impose sanctions “before he gets here, and then I’ll say I didn’t know anything about it.” The Trump team also was at oddswith India’s ballistic missile\nuclear policy as well as on its stand on climate change in which they believed India got a free ride. "The Paris Agreement was a charade. In this case it gave leeway to countries like China and India, which remained essentially unfettered,’’ he wrote.Trump was also bitter over the goodwill for India in Afghanistan in contrast to the Afghan attitude to the Americans.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bolton-us-shouldnt-have-ignored-indo-pak-rivalry-102466

It has also ramped up aggression and vigil to prevent Indian troops from patrolling east of “Finger 4” in the north of Pangong Tso.India has also ramped up preparations on its side as the two armies remain fully deployed along the 826-km front of the LAC in Ladakh.Also read: Chinese media urges India not to equate Beijing with PakistanBoth sides are expected to facilitate another meeting of their lieutenant general-level officers in the coming week. A similar meeting was held on June 6. Major general-level officers of both armies were asked to hold talks to reduce tension. However, on the intervening night of June 15 and 16, a deadly clash resulted in the killing 20 Indian troops, besides casualties to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).Indian agencies have noticed deployment of additional fighter jets, bombers and attack helicopters at four bases close to the LAC. Such additions have been noticed at Hotan in Xinjiang (just north of Ladakh), Ngyari (around 100 km south-east of Ladakh) and Shigatse (150 km north of Sikkim). There has also been PLA movement at Nyingchi, north of Arunachal Pradesh.At Pangong Tso, the attempt of the PLA is to alter the LAC unilaterally. Armour and artillery buildup has also been done at Gogra Hot Springs.Indian positions at Depsang, Murgo, Galwan, Hot Springs, Koyul, Fukche and Demchok face enhanced threat from the PLA.India has added Apache helicopters, Sukhoi fighter jets and tanks along the LAC.

The Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Bipin Rawat, and the three service chiefs were at the meeting where Singh made it clear that the services would have to be “fully prepared” to take any unprecedented action along the LAC. Sources said he did not specify what the “unprecedented” action implied, but it was being seen as a “free hand” being given to the battle commanders on the ground.The Defence Minister has also given directions to the Army to be cautious during patrol duties along the LAC, a 3,488 km de facto boundary with China which is undemarcated.The other two forces, the IAF and the Navy, have been asked to keep an eye on air intrusions or on any unusual activity at sea. All assets are ready and deployed, said sources.The Army had sought a change in the military rules of engagement at the LAC after the recent Galwan valley clash. These rules of engagement had been cast in line with various diplomatic agreements with China since 1993.Sources said the standing instructions for soldiers confronting Chinese troops in a violent faceoff foreclosed the option of opening fire. With China not adhering to any agreement, holding on to any diplomatic promise appeared imprudent after the enemy action at the Galwan valley on the night intervening June 15 and 16.The agreement on confidence-building measures in the military field along the LAC signed in 1996 says: “Neither side shall open fire within 2 km of the LAC.”Steps afoot to curtail cheap Chinese goodsThe government has sought product-wise details of cheap imports, comparison with domestic prices and tax disadvantage, if any, from industry to curb low-quality inbound shipments, especially from China, and boost domestic manufacturing, sources said.

Of the total population of the slum, around 5 lakh have been screened.With density of 2,27,136 persons per square km, Dharavi had 491 cases in April 2020, a 12 per cent growth rate and a case doubling period of 18 days.House-to-house surveys and isolation ensured Covid growth here dipped to 4.3 per cent in May 2020 and further to 1.02 per cent in June. The case doubling rate in the slum has improved from 43 days in May to 78 days in June.The major challenge to the BMC in Dharavi was the dependence of 80 per cent population on community toilets.

Granting bail would invite the possibility of embarrassing the United States in the conduct of its foreign affairs, straining its relationship with India,” Assistant United States Attorney John J Lulejian told a federal court in Los Angeles last week. Rana (59) was ordered to be released from jail on compassionate grounds after he told a US court that he has tested positive for Covid-19.
