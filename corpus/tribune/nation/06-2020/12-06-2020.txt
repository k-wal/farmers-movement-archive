12-06-2020||New Delhi||Govt allows certain categories of foreigners to enter India amid Covid-19 curbs||The government, on Friday, allowed certain categories of foreigners, including the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders, to enter India amid restrictions on the entry of people from abroad due to the COVID-19 pandemic, officials said.Among those allowed entries into India are married couples, one of whom is an OCI cardholder and another Indian national, and students who are OCI cardholders and whose at least one parent is Indian or OCI cardholder.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has allowed certain categories of foreigners, including OCI cardholders and minors who hold OCI cards and whose parents are Indian nationals, a senior ministry official said.Foreigners were restricted from visiting India ever since the nationwide lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 to check the spread of COVID-19.Foreign nationals who are single parents of minor children holding Indian passports or OCI cards, students who are foreign nationals where at least one of their parents is an Indian citizen or an OCI cardholder were allowed to visit India.Dependent family members of foreign diplomats and official and service passport holding service staff accredited to foreign diplomatic missions, consular offices or accredited international organisations in India can now come to India.The OCI cardholders who wish to come to India on account of family emergencies such as critical medical conditions of immediate family members or death were allowed to visit India.However, these foreign nationals will have to obtain a fresh visa of appropriate category from the Indian Missions and posts abroad.Foreign nationals holding a valid long-term multiple entry visa of appropriate category issued by the Indian missions and posts abroad shall have to get the visa re-validated from the Indian Mission and post concerned.Such foreign nationals will not be permitted to travel to India on the strength of any electronic visa obtained earlier.Consequently, the visa restrictions imposed by the MHA on April 17 and May 5 would not apply to the above mentioned of foreign nationals.Similarly travel restrictions imposed on May 7 would not apply to any aircraft, or any other vehicle by which the above-mentioned categories of foreign nationals including OCI cardholders may travel to India.International arrival to India was banned with effect from March 25 when the first phase of nationwide lockdown was announced.The government on May 7 had launched a special operation under the name of ‘Vande Bharat Mission’ for evacuation of stranded Indians in foreign nations through air and sea.Subsequently, the government had allowed the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders, who wish to come to India on account of family emergencies.The nationwide lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Modi on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.The lockdown was first extended till May 3 and then again till May 17. It was further extended till May 31.The lockdown is now restricted only in containment zones across the country and will continue till June 30. A large number of social, economic, religious and sports activities are currently allowed to function which the MHA termed “Unlock 1”.

12-06-2020||New Delhi||Hindu outfit moves SC to open Kashi, Mathura temple disputes||Seven months after the Supreme Court paved the way for construction of Ram Temple at Ayodhya, a Hindu organisation has moved the SC to open Kashi and Mathura temple disputes.Petitioner Vishwa Bhadra Pujari Purohit Mahasangh has challenged the validity of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which said character of religious places at the time of Independence can't be changed.The petition is being seen as an attempt to start a legal battle to reclaim disputed religious sites at Kashi, Mathura and some other places.The petition, which has challenged Section 4 of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, assumes significance in the case of Kashi and Mathura where two disputed mosques stand.In its unanimous November 9 verdict, a five-judge Bench headed by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi had described the 1991 Act as a legislative instrument designed to protect the secular features of Indian polity.But now the Mahasangh' has sought directions to declare Section 4 of the 1991 Act unconstitutional. The petition said the top court's remarks were mere observations without any judicial force as the Act was not under challenge before it."The impugned Act has barred the right and remedy against encroachment made on religious property of Hindus exercising might of power by followers of another faith," it said.By making the impugned provision, Parliament has without resolution of dispute, through process of court, abated the suit and proceedings, which is per se unconstitutional and beyond its law making power, it said.Parliament cannot restrain Hindu devotees from getting back their religious places of worship through the judicial process, the plea said.It cannot make any law that takes away or abridges the vested religious right of devotees and cannot make any law with retrospective effect, it said, invoking fundamental right to religion under Article 25 of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hindu-outfit-moves-sc-to-open-kashi-mathura-temple-disputes-98275

This is anathema to China whose mission here has frequently issued rebuttals to Indian media reports on Taiwan’s desire to be re-invited as an observer at the World Health Assembly.The organiser of the event in Taipei, entrepreneur Manoj Kriplani said the intention was to bring awareness about Taiwan on a global scale. “This will be the first time that any foreign community is coming out in large numbers to thank Taiwan,’’ he noted.Kriplani also touched on the WHO issue by pointing out that Taiwan might have been excluded from its General Assembly but it refused to be isolated by providing nearly 3 crore medical masks to other countries.“The Indian community in Taiwan has felt touched by how Taiwan has treated citizens, residents and tourists alike- with respect, dignity and compassion. Taiwan has seemed like the safest place to live on earth during these tumultuous times,’’ he said.China bears down hard on any country affording leeway to Taiwan as it believes the island country is part of the mainland and it is a matter of time before both are united. However, the current government in Taiwan is pressing for Independence and has been more visible on the global scale than the opposition Kuomintang Party seen as China-friendly.That the event has the blessings of the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party is indicated from a press release issued on behalf of the Indian community in Taiwan. “Under the guidance and coordination of the Government of Taiwan’’, the textile industry is outfitting the participants, it said. Over 3,000 Indian and a few hundreds of business people comprise the Indian expatriate community in Taiwan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-lac-tensions-indians-to-thank-taiwan-for-covid-help-98266
12-06-2020||Lucknow||Retired UP cadre cop booked for ‘misinformation’ on Yogi government’s COVID strategy||An Uttar Pradesh cadre IAS officer who took voluntary retirement four years ago has been booked for allegedly posting ‘misinformation’ on a social media platform relating to the state government’s efforts to deal with COVID-19 situation.The case against Surya Pratap Singh, a 1982 batch officer, was registered at the Hazratganj police station on the complaint filed by Subhash Singh, a police outpost in charge at the secretariat.The complainant mentioned in the FIR that the former bureaucrat had posted some content that is inaccurate and insulting to the state government.In a series of tweets, Singh had said that a senior bureaucrat after a meeting with the chief minister had scolded district magistrates and asked them to go slow on testing samples for COVID-19 saying that it would not win them additional brownie points.“Is no test= no corona Uttar Pradesh’s strategy” he has asked.Singh questioning the government’s strategy of reportedly keeping the number of tests low to show low occurrence of Covid-19 has earned him the wrath of the state government.Assistant Commissioner of police (ACP) Hazratganj Abhay Mishra said: “The former IAS officer has been booked under various sections for disobeying government orders, crime committed with intent to cause fear or alarm to the public, conducting public mischief, statement intent to cause fear and alarm among the residents who may be induced to commit offence against the state and public tranquility, disobeying public servant orders. Besides, sections of the Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Disease Act have also been included”.Mishra also said that the cyber-cell of the police will also assist the Hazratganj police in the case and relevant sections of the IT Act would be included after the probe.Meanwhile, reacting to the government’s decision Singh in a tweet said that he was waiting for the police to arrest him.“Hiding the numbers of Corona cases would help neither the Yogi Adityanath government nor the state and the government. Registering a case against me for my demanding more tests is a violation of my fundamental rights”, he said in a tweet.“As an IAS officer I had launched a campaign against the previous Akhilesh Yadav government. Then senior leaders of the BJP appreciated me and Akhilesh Yadav never took the criticism personally. The action of those who speak of “freedom of expression” has shocked and stunned me,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/retired-up-cadre-cop-booked-for-misinformation-on-yogi-governments-covid-strategy-98264
12-06-2020||New Delhi||Urdu poet Gulzar Dehlvi dies days after recovering from COVID-19||Veteran Urdu poet Anand Mohan Zutshi ‘Gulzar’ Dehlvi passed away on Friday afternoon, five days after he recovered from COVID-19.He died at his Noida home and was a month shy of turning 94.“His corona test came negative on June 7 and we brought him home. Today he had lunch and at around 2.30 pm he passed away,” his son Anoop Zutshi told PTI.“He was quite old, and the infection had left him very weak. So doctors are thinking it was possible a cardiac arrest,” he added.A freedom fighter and a premier ‘inquilabi’ poet, Dehlvi was admitted to a private hospital on June 1 after testing positive for coronavirus.Born in old Delhi’s Gali Kashmeerian in 1926, he was also the editor of ‘Science ki Duniya’, the first Urdu science magazine published by the Government of India in 1975.Remembering her fond memories of Dehlvi, historian-writer Rana Safvi recalled seeing the poet at most ‘mushairas’ in Delhi.“I cannot express how big a loss it is. We used to see him at every 'mushaira' in Delhi. It's a big loss to Delhi and the world of poetry,” Safvi said.She also took to Twitter to express her condolences.“Sad to hear about Gulzar Dehlvi saheb’s demise. He was the quintessential Dilli waala. May he rest in peace,” she tweeted.According to Delhi-based poet and lawyer Saif Mahmood, Dehlvi was “the presiding bard of Delhi”, following in the footsteps of iconic poets like Mirza Ghalib, and Mir Taqi Mir.His death is the “end of an era”, he said.“No one knew the nooks and crannies of Mir and Ghalib's Delhi like him. Gulzar saheb claimed that his father, Allama Pandit Tribhuvan Nath Zutshi 'Zaar Dehlvi', was a disciple of the renowned poet Daagh Dehlvi,” he said while reminiscing his meeting with Dehlvi three years back.The poet had recited a still unpublished ‘sher’ (couplet) then, Mahmood said, which seems more relevant now in the aftermath of his demise.“Mere baad aane waalon, meri baat yaad rakhna/ mere naqsh-e-pa se behtar, koi raasta nahin hai”.  (Those who come after, remember what I say/ there’s no better way than to follow my footprints).“He was a true exemplar of not just the Urdu language but also of the Urdu culture. In fact, he was a living and breathing form of Urdu tehzeeb,” Mahmood said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/urdu-poet-gulzar-dehlvi-dies-days-after-recovering-from-covid-19-98260

In north-west India, where the monsoon has not yet set in, rains in June to September season are 42 per cent above the LPA. They are 95 per cent and 28 per cent above average over the central and south peninsular India, respectively. However, in the East and northeast India, rains are deficit by 4 per cent and also late.Under the influence of two current weather systems, the low-pressure area over the north coastal Andhra Pradesh and adjoining coastal Odisha and an east-west shear zone across Peninsular India, heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over many places, including Mumbai — where iFLOWS was launched by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Earth Sciences Minister Harsh Vardhan for the early prediction of floods.The system would help “predict floods before they happen, help protect property and save lives” and make the city become more resilient, by providing early warning for flooding especially during high rainfall events and cyclones, the officials said.“Using this, it would be possible to have an estimate of the flood inundation three days in advance, along with 3 to 6 hours Nowcast, that is immediate weather updates. It will be very useful, especially if people need to be evacuated from low-lying areas as we will be able to forecast 12 hours in advance that a particular spot may get flooded. The system will also forecast the rainfall in each pocket,” the officials added.A similar system developed by the MoES scientists is also operational at Chennai.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-progresses-rains-34-pc-above-lpa-countrywide-42-pc-above-lpa-in-northwest-98255
12-06-2020||New Delhi||Rajnath Singh reviews India-China border situation with CDS Bipin Rawat, Service Chiefs||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday reviewed India’s overall military preparedness in eastern Ladakh and several other areas along the Line of Actual Control in Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh, even as Chinese and Indian armies held another round of Major General-level talks on the current border standoff, official sources said.The Defence Minister was given a detailed account on the overall situation in eastern Ladakh by Army Chief Gen MM Naravane at a high-level meeting, which was also attended by Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh and Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, they said.The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in an over five-week standoff in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie. The two sides have deployed additional troops along the LAC in North Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh following the standoff.It is understood that Singh told the top military brass to continue to deal with the situation in eastern Ladakh and other areas with “firmness”.“The defence minister carried out a comprehensive review of the situation in eastern Ladakh,” said a senior official on condition of anonymity.Military sources said the two armies held another round of Major General-level talks on Friday to find a way out to defuse tension in eastern Ladakh.India on Thursday said it is maintaining military and diplomatic engagements with China to peacefully resolve the row at the “earliest”.In their first serious efforts to end the row, Lt General Harinder Singh, the general officer commanding of Leh-based 14 Corps, and Commander of the Tibet Military District Maj Gen Liu Lin held a nearly seven-hour meeting on June 6.In the next one week, the field commanders of the two sides are slated to hold a series of meetings to discuss specific measures to defuse the tension.On Wednesday, the two sides held Major General-level talks in a positive atmosphere with an aim to end the bitter tussle.In the over four-and-half-hour dialogue, the Indian delegation pressed for total restoration of status quo ante and immediate withdrawal of thousands of Chinese troops from the areas which India considers on its side of the LAC, the sources said.In Friday’s meeting too, India reiterated its demand, they added.After the standoff began in early last month, Indian military leadership decided that Indian troops will adopt a firm approach in dealing with the aggressive posturing by the Chinese troops in all disputed areas of Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie.The Chinese Army has been gradually ramping up its strategic reserves in its rear bases near the the Line of Actual Control (LAC) by rushing in artillery guns, infantry combat vehicles and heavy military equipment, the sources said.The trigger for the face-off was China’s stiff opposition to India laying a key road in the Finger area around the Pangong Tso Lake besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.The road in the Finger area in Pangong Tso is considered crucial for India to carry out patrol. India has already decided not to stall any border infrastructure projects in eastern Ladakh in view of Chinese protests.The situation in the area deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

Being in opposition in Rajasthan as well, the saffron party challenged Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to prove allegations against the party, trashing all charges of “Operation Lotus” in the state.The Supreme Court termed the state of affairs in Delhi hospitals as “horrific”, with dead bodies being stacked next to COVID-19 patients.BJP leader Sambit Patra said the Delhi government would have to think hard about the court’s observations, and leaving aside politics and publicity, should work on the ground.“Politicians, who are in power in Delhi, should get out and understand people’s concerns. They should not confine themselves to press conferences and publicity for politics,” Patra said accusing the Kejriwal government of spending money on publicity instead of focusing on the basic necessities in Delhi.Given the experience in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, observers are smelling ‘Operation Lotus’, as BJP takeover of the Opposition-ruled States is called, in Rajasthan.Though the BJP has challenged the state Congress to prove allegations of poaching ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls, blaming its trouble on “internal differences” in the grand old party, the observers said signs were “all too familiar” and “if not now it may be a matter of a couple of more months before Rajasthan gets a saffron government again”.The Congress has charged the BJP with attempts to destabilise the Rajasthan government with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot claiming that some of the party MLAs were offered Rs 25 crore each.Meanwhile, accusing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of “insulting, defaming and showing India in poor light” in his conversation with former US diplomat Nicholas Burns on the coronavirus crisis, senior BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain asked him to apologise to the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-delhi-bjp-hits-at-kejriwal-led-government-challenges-ashok-gehlot-in-rajasthan-to-prove-charges-against-it-98245

Though his condition was initially serious, he recovered after a stint in the ICU."Indian companies which have obtained licenses from Gilead to manufacture and market Remdesivir in the country are yet to get clearances. The delay by the central agencies is costing people's lives," a health department official said.The Maharashtra government has however decided to go ahead on its own to start trials of Remdesivir in 18 medical colleges across the state after importing the drug from Bangladeshi companies. "So far 3000 vials have been acquired and we are in the process of getting 10,000more," Health Minister Rajesh Tope told reporters here.Officials here say that Remdesivir has been successfully administered on compassionate use basis to save the lives of some bureaucrats and politicians who had contracted the virus. The drug is being sold at exorbitant rates in the grey market and on the dark web.Earlier today, senior doctors in Maharashtra sought the help of the state government in speeding up the use of plasma therapy for those suffering from the Covid-19. The central government's ICMR has allowed state-run medical colleges in Maharashtra to start clinical trials on the use of plasma from recovered patients on those moderately ill from the virus.Sources say, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is likely to take up the issue of slow clearances from central agencies with the Union government in the coming days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-pandemic-bureaucratic-hurdles-hamper-remdesivirs-availability-says-maharashtra-govt-98242
12-06-2020||New Delhi||Unutilised railway tickets fare to be recovered from members says Rajya Sabha||At a time when it is working overtime to reduce expenditure during COVID-19, the Rajya Sabha stumbled upon a fact that it is reimbursing the Ministry of Railways for tickets booked by its members that were neither used nor cancelled.Concerned over the expenditure, the Rajya Sabha has now asked its members to cancel tickets not being used, stating in future fare of such bookings would be recovered from those who incur it. However, recovery process may take time, Parliamentary sources said, since Railways is now planning to install software for separate record of bookings by Rajya Sabha MPs. At present, Parliament split a third of the cost to Rajya Sabha and 2/3 to the Lok Sabha.With the Ministry of Railways making claims for re-imbursement, the Rajya Sabha Secretariat noticed instances of multiple bookings made by some members in various trains departing from same/different stations to different destinations for the same day.“Members would appreciate that non-performance of journey on reserved berths and non-cancellation thereof in time lead to unnecessary expenditure and avoidable drain on Rajya Sabha budget. It also put the public to inconvenience as they fail to get confirmed berths/seat”, Rajya Sabha Secretary General Desh Deepak Verma said.   In one instance a former MP made 63 bookings during January 2019 costing Rs 1.69 lakh while travelling only on seven occasions for total fare of Rs 22,085, sources in Rajya Sabha said. The Secretariat paid Rs 1.46 lakh or 87 per cen of that sum, the sources said.During 2019, the Secretariat paid Rs 7.8 crore to the Ministry for Railways as re-imbursement of ticket cost both for sitting MPs and former MPs. Of this expenditure for sitting MPs for both the Houses accounted for a slightly over Rs.4 crore. Earlier, the Rajya Sabha Secretariat identified expenditure of  Rs 60 crore to be slashed as part of its post-Covid19 cost-cutting exercise.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unutilised-railway-tickets-fare-to-be-recovered-from-members-says-rajya-sabha-98239

But, they said, initially the officers could be asked to manage and coordinate affairs in the COVID-19 designated hospitals.The rising COVID-19 cases in the country has led to an increased pressure on the healthcare facilities, which is dealing with a spurt in the demand for beds, ventilators, isolation wards, and oxygen cylinders. Shortage of manpower is another issue being faced by the sector.“The doctors-turned administrators may be pivotal in efficient management at the frontline,” a senior DoPT official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-mulls-roping-in-civil-servants-with-medical-degree-as-frontline-covid-19-warriors-98232

In Rajya Sabha elections other than for Independent candidates everybody has to show his or her vote to a designated person by the party as per the Constitution of India. The people of Rajasthan and the legislators of Rajasthan will give you a befitting reply by decisively defeating your conspiracies and your attempt at denigrating democracy,” Surjewala commented.Gehlot said an FIR on the alleged MLAs’ poaching and online cash transfer was also lodged with the SOG and it would be probed who had offered such transactions.“How could I reveal the facts when the cases are pending with the investigating agencies,” he added.On Thursday, BJP state President Satish Poonia had asked why the Congress was putting strain on the party to cover its failure and prove the allegations instead.  The chief whip in the assembly, Mahesh Joshi, had also moved a written complaint to the Anti-Corruption Bureau seeking a probe into the matter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mlas-poaching%C2%A0being-probed-by-sog-acb-rajasthan-cm-98228
12-06-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Centre’s decision to reopen activities was not taken in haste, says Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court Friday said the central government’s decision of phased reopening of lockdown was not taken in haste and it was done to ensure a proper balance between containing the spread of COVID 19 pandemic and making it certain that people are not forced to starvation.The high court’s order came while dismissing with a cost of Rs 20,000 a PIL by a law student challenging the May 30 order of the Centre by which lockdown was extended in containment zones and reopening of activities was done in a phased manner outside containment zones.The petition was “completely misconceived” and has been filed only to “gain publicity”, said the 23-page judgement of the high court which held that nothing has been shown by the petitioner as to how the May 30 order was so arbitrary or is based on such irrelevant consideration that it deserves to be struck down as being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said the government is expected to remain cognisant of the situation and evaluate it closely and if it is found that the rate of infection is going up, they can always review their decision and impose curbs, depending upon the situation.The high court said a series of orders have been passed by the government starting from March this year to tackle the situation and decisions have been taken to ensure minimum hardship to people and several economic packages have been announced to regenerate the economy.“This court can also take judicial notice of the fact that world over, the trend is now to reduce the restrictions which were imposed due to lockdown and to return to normal life. In order to ensure a proper balance between containing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and at the same time make certain that people are not forced to starvation the government has issued the impugned order.“The re-opening has been directed in a phased manner and is not a decision that appears to have been taken in haste. The government is expected to remain cognisant of the situation and evaluate it closely. If it is found that the rate of infection is going up, they can always review their decision and impose curbs, depending upon the situation,” the bench said.It noted that the lockdown has resulted in loss of jobs for several lakhs of people and scores of people were forced to walk considerable distance and stand in long queues at food distribution centres just to have two square meals a day.It said several people have gone hungry and were not able to get one meal and many were left shelterless and several lakhs of migrant labour had to walk on foot and go back to their native places.“The economic situation of the country has taken a terrible hit due to the lockdown. In fact, many analysts have opined that the lockdown has caused more human suffering than COVID-19 itself. Economists have forecasted that Indian economy will shrink as a result of the steps taken to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Indian economy virtually came to a standstill during nationwide lockdown.“Production in the country came to a grinding halt during the lockdown period. Construction activities in the country have stopped. People have become unemployed which raises grave concerns regarding the law and order situation in the country,” the high court said.The bench said Arjun Aggarwal, a fifth year law student, filed the petition without looking at the position in law.He challenged the guidelines on the ground that phased reopening will result in rampant spread of COVID-19 in the country and it has been done only keeping in mind economic considerations while endangering its citizens to the extent of succumbing to a contagious disease in the absence of any proven medical cure for it.The plea claimed there was no need or justification for reopening the prohibited activities.The bench said in its order that during the hearing, it had informed the petitioner’s counsel that the court was not inclined to entertain the petition as it found the plea was an abuse of the process of the law.“We had also warned the counsel that if he presses the petition, we would be constrained to dismiss it with costs. We cautioned the counsel only because the petitioner is a law student. Despite that, counsel for the petitioner upon taking instructions from the petitioner, continued to address arguments, wasting valuable judicial time.“We deprecate this conduct of the petitioner. He has not cared to read the judgments relating to public interest litigations and the limits on the Court while exercising its power of judicial review on policy matters,” the bench said.While dismissing the plea, it directed the petitioner to deposit the cost of Rs 20,000 in the Delhi High Court Bar Association Lawyers’ Security and Welfare Fund within two weeks.The bench said the courts cannot act as an appellate authority examining the correctness, suitability and appropriateness of the policy.“Nor are courts advisors to the executive in matters of policy which the executive is entitled to formulate. The courts cannot interfere with the policy either on the ground that it is erroneous or on the ground that a better or a wiser alternative is available. Illegality of the policy and not the wisdom and soundness of the policy is the subject matter of judicial review,” it said.

Travel an extra mile and channel some extra money to address their grievances. The country cannot afford to have dissatisfied soldiers in this war against Corona,” a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre.While hearing a petition by Doctor Arushi Jain, the Bench said courts should not be involved in issues like non-payment of salary to health workers and government should sort it out.Jain alleged that frontline healthcare workers were not being paid salaries or their salaries had been reduced or delayed. She also questioned the Centre’s new SOP making their 14-day quarantine non-mandatory.“We saw report that doctors went on strike. In Delhi, some doctors have not been paid for past three months. These are concerns that should have been taken care off. It should not require court intervention,” the Bench said, adding, the government needed to do more to address their concerns.The Bench posted the matter for hearing next week after Mehta said if better suggestions came, they could be accommodated and the issues could be sorted out.The top court had earlier said doctors and medical staff were the “first line of defence of the country” in the battle against COVID19 and directed the Centre to ensure appropriate PPEs were made available to them.The Centre had told the court that a “large number” of make-shift hospitals will have to be built in the near future to accommodate the constant rise in the number of newly infected people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-make-soldiers-unhappy-during-war-sc-on-non-payment-of-salaries-to-doctors-98221

The special meeting will also discuss who should pay for the borrowing if there is a shortfall, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the media after the meeting.“ Understanding the need for states to have money in their hands, we corrected one end of the anomaly, wherein Centre could release money and give to states without states having to do any adjustment. This enabled us to clear the GST compensation bills of December, January and February, which have been lying pending. States have appreciated the decision to sort this matter out,” said the Minister.The GST Council also decided to defer a decision on duty inversion structure in three sectors---textiles, fertilisers and footwear.“While every Minister agreed with the logic but there was a bit of discussion. The question is when do we want to rationalise the rates? While the need to relook the duty structure was agreed upon, a decision has been postponed. The discussion happened on textiles. The other two items did not come up for discussions,” she said.The GST Council decided to entrust the task to a Group of Ministers headed by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi.  The GST Council agreed on certain relief to GSTR-3B returns and to small taxpayers. It waived the late fee for those with no tax liability but have not filed GST returns from July 2017 to January 2020. It capped at Rs 500 the late fee for those with tax liability for the same period. This will apply to all returns submitted between July 1 and September 30.Further relief is being offered to small tax payers for late filing of returns for the Covid-period of February, March and April. For small tax payers whose aggregate turnover is up to Rs 5 crore, the rate of interest for late furnishing of GST returns is being reduced from 18 per cent to 9 per cent.Tax payers who could not get cancelled GST registrations restored in time are also being given an opportunity to apply for revocation of cancellation of registration up to September 30.

Since a COVID protocol is still in force in Nepal, the police asked them to disperse immediately, which led to an altercation between the locals of Janaki Nagar and the neighbouring country police,” he said, adding that the villagers also rang their relative in Janaki Nagar village and they also reached the spot.“As per the Nepal police, around 15 rounds were fired, 10 in the air and five on the people, killing an Indian and injuring three others. The firing was carried out to disperse the crowd which had assembled in Nepal’s area from the Indian side,” the SSB D-G said, adding that a detailed report is awaited from Bihar.The unfortunate incident took place at the Lalbandi-Janki Nagar border in Pipra Parsain panchayat under Sonebarsha police station of the Sitamarhi district of Bihar, officials in the SSB said.The deceased person has been identified as Vikesh Yadav (22), who suffered a bullet injury in the abdomen area, while Uday Thakur (24) and Umesh Ram (18) are injured and admitted to a private hospital in Sitamarhi, which is around 125 kilometers from Bihar capital Patna, the officials said, adding that an Indian national, Laagan Yadav (45), has been taken into custody by the Nepal border police.According to reports, even on May 17, Nepal police had fired blank rounds to disperse dozens of Indians trying to cross the border. It was not clear if they were farmers.Nepal shares a 1,850-km open border with India and people travel across it for work and to visit family. It had closed its international borders on March 22 amid the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-indian-dead-2-injured-in-firing-by-nepal-police-near-border-in-bihar-98198
12-06-2020||New Delhi||Families scramble to get patients treated as Delhi govt claims enough beds||With the number of Covid-19 cases set to explode in Delhi, residents are increasingly concerned about the future as horrifying tales emerge of patients running from pillar to post to secure hospital beds or even get themselves tested.The fear of the infection almost equals the dread of navigating the complicated testing protocols and getting to the right doctor, say residents as governmental claims on hassle-free access to treatment and the number of beds clash with anecdotal reality.On Wednesday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal projected that the city would require 1.5 lakh beds. A day earlier, his deputy Manish Sisodia said the total number of coronavirus cases could rise to 5.5 lakh by July end, a quantum jump from the 32,810 cases as of Thursday.   Though the government claims there are more beds than needed, the national capital's COVID-19 reality, retold through social and other media, is also about the anguish of sons, daughters, wives and others trying desperately to get medical help for their unwell family members.   “He is no more. The govt failed us.” That was the brief, almost staccato message on Twitter from social activist Amarpreet Kaur who took to the microblogging site to first seek help to get her father admitted and then to announce his death.Her father tested positive for COVID-19 on June 1, but was advised home isolation. When his condition started deteriorating, the family took him to the LNJP hospital – Delhi government's designated COVID-19 hospital. But the doctors, the family alleged, were unhelpful and asked them to go to Ganga Ram hospital instead.   "My dad is having high fever. We need to shift him to hospital. I am standing outside LNJP Delhi & they are not taking him in. He is having corona, high fever and breathing problem. He won't survive without help. Pls help," Kaur tweeted.An hour later, he was dead – outside the hospital.  LNJP authorities denied her charge.That was not the end of her story. The family needed to get tested. And she again had to go on Twitter to ensure it happens.Aman Pathak was luckier. He also did the round of hospitals in an effort to get his father admitted to a hospital and finally managed to do so. The father is at the Intensive Care Unit of the LNJP hospital.Recounting his struggles, Pathak said his 51-year-old father developed high fever on May 24 but it subsided after a few days."However, my father lost his appetite. We thought he had mild symptoms so we took care of him at home. But from June 3, he started developing breathing issues. I took him to several hospitals, both private and government, but most of them turned us away," the 24-year-old software engineer told PTI.  On June 4, he even tried to get his father tested at the Delhi-government run Ambedkar Hospital, but failed to do so immediately. He tested positive the following day but now, of course, needed a hospital.That's when the rounds began. He went from one hospital to another to be told that there were no beds. Pathak tried to reason that the app developed by the Delhi government showed otherwise but to no avail. "My father could not even walk, but I took him to hospitals in that condition, only to be turned away," he said. He also sent out desperate tweets seeking help. Finally, on June 6, he managed to get his father admitted at the Ambedkar Hospital. From there, he was moved to the LNJP. His fingers crossed, Pathak is hoping his father returns home soon. Five days after his father developed fever, another Delhi man started shows signs of the novel coronavirus on May 29. Nine days later, he died in Bhopal without ever going to a hospital or getting any treatment.He first went to a local health care centre and told to go home after taking paracetamol. He also went to the GTB Hospital for a test but was reportedly. Over the next week, the man went to five hospitals only to be turned away by each one of them. With no option left, his teen son in Bhopal asked him to travel to the city. And so, with a fever of 103-degrees F, the man even took a train to the Madhya Pradesh capital, his high fever going undetected both at the Delhi and Bhopal railway stations. On June 7, he died. Back in Delhi, his 15-year-old daughter also tested positive for COVID-19 while his wife got an asthma attack due to the shock. "When the time to test these (medical) facilities came, a promising person, who wandered in Delhi for five days but did not get treatment, died," Madhya Pradesh Health Minister Narottam Mishra told reporters after the man's death, hitting out at claims about Delhi's health infrastructure. The stories continue in a seemingly endless loop. Whether well-heeled and connected or poor and with no resources, the stories found resonance everywhere. Of frustrating struggles to get tested and then treated. Several people complained that the Delhi government has launched an app to give information on availability of beds and ventilators but the reality is different. Many a time, even the helpline goes unanswered.On June 3, 42-year-old Narender Jain died of COVID-19.  His family ran from one hospital to another in east Delhi. Jain, who suffered from diabetes, developed fever in the last week of May. When his situation deteriorated, the family looked for a hospital.On June 1, the two hospitals they first approached did not have the facility to test coronavirus patients. They moved to a private hospital which had the facility to conduct a coronavirus test but not a bed for COVID-19 patients.His brother-in-law Vikas Jain told journalists that he was moved to a super speciality hospital which had beds but no ventilator. Finally, he was moved to the GTB Hospital which did have a ventilator. But it was too late. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi this week shared a video of journalist Ajay Jha seeking help for treatment.Jha's entire family – wife, two daughters aged nine and five, and in-laws --- tested positive.  He said his in-laws had died within 10 days.The Delhi government is saying that everything is in control but people have been left  to god's will, he said.   According to an official of the Delhi government, they contacted Jha and the family is now being given proper care. These accounts could well be the tip of the proverbial iceberg as Delhi battles the pandemic. Not everyone has the wherewithal and means to access social media. On May 30, Kejriwal said his government is “several steps ahead” of the novel coronavirus. There are a total of 6,600 beds and 4,500 of them are still unoccupied, he had said, adding that by June the capacity will be ramped up to 9,500 beds. As of Thursday morning, there were 9,179 beds in both private and Delhi government hospitals of which 4,279 were vacant, PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/families-scramble-to-get-patients-treated-as-delhi-govt-claims-enough-beds-98192

12-06-2020||Satya Prakash||Covid-19 deaths: SC issues notice to Centre, Delhi, Maha, WB, TN on ‘horrendous’ situation||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 12Terming the situation created by COVID19 pandemic in the capital, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal as "horrendous", the Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to the Centre and these states asking them to explain the lapses in treating patients and offering a dignified departure to the dead.A Bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan, Justice SK Kaul and Justice MR Shah said media reports indicated a sorry state of affairs in handling of COVID19 crisis by some of the states.As Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, representing the Delhi Government, said, "We accept notice", the Bench shot back, "You have to do more than accepting the notice.""There are states where bodies were found in garbage bins. They are being treated worse than animals," the Bench said.Asking the Centre and states to file their responses, it posted the matter for further hearing on June 17. Chief secretaries of Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal are required to file status reports on handling of the pandemic.The top court issued a separate notice to LNJP hospital in the national capital seeking its response.With bodies of COVID19 victims piling up in the capital and decent cremation/burial becoming rare, former law minister Ashwani Kumar had on Wednesday written to CJI SA Bonde and other judges of the top court urging them to enforce the court’s own rulings on the right to die with dignity. The Supreme Court took suo motu cognisance of Kumar's letter and converted it into a PIL."What is happening? Mumbai, Chennai are increasing testing but your testing has gone down from 7,000 to 5,000. This is a horrendous situation. Look at the treatment of patients. Patients are crying and no one is looking after them," the Bench said.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, "I saw pictures yesterday which were shocking. Even the right to decent departure is enshrined under Article 21.""Look at the condition of hospitals...Bodies are there in the wards. Mumbai is testing 16,000 to 17,000 whereas in Delhi it’s falling below 7,000. Media has highlighted this issue," the Bench said, adding, "We are more concerned about the living ones than those dead."It said there were instances when the relatives of the deceased were unable to attend their funerals. "This is a very sad condition," it said.The top court said, “The Solicitor General has shown government directives issued on March 15 for handling of dead bodies. But no one is following the directives. Relatives are not being informed of the death."On the issue of COVID19 testing, the top court said, "Whoever requests for tests, the request can't be denied on technical grounds. The Government may consider simplifying the procedure so that more and more tests are done. Apart from Delhi, there is a grim situation in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.It said COVID19 cases were increasing everyday in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Ahmedabad and had reached 10,000 a day. "How can tests go down? Non-testing is not the solution. Increasing the number of tests is the duty of the state so that people can know their (COVID19) status," the Bench said."COVID19 patients are running from pillar to post to get admitted whereas a large number of beds in government hospitals are lying vacant. State is duty-bound to provide staff to man the wards. Media reports have shown pathetic condition of patients which has pained this court," the Bench said."It was shown that patients had no oxygen support. No saline drips were shown with the bed. This was the condition of JP Hospital which has been turned into a COVID19 hospital by the government. This is a 200-bed hospital," it said.It mentioned a TV report broadcast on June 10 which showed the deplorable condition of patients and medical wards in Delhi. "Dead bodies were not only in the ward but lobby and waiting area," it noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-deaths-sc-issues-notice-to-centre-delhi-maha-wb-tn-on-horrendous-situation-98184
12-06-2020||New Delhi||SC asks Centre to discuss ticket price refund issue with airlines||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre and the airline companies to discuss modalities for full refund of tickets for domestic and international flights which were cancelled following the Covid-19 lockdown.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah asked the Centre to take a stand on the issue and work out ways for full refund.A plea was also raised that airlines across the world are facing tough time due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and they too be heard as parties to the plea filed by one NGO, Pravasi Legal Cell.The top court has now fixed the plea for further hearing after three weeks. It had on Monday sought responses from the Centre and the DGCA on the plea seeking directions to airlines operating domestic and international fights in India to refund full amount collected for tickets due to cancellation of flights in wake of the lockdown.The plea urged the court to declare the alleged action of airlines of not refunding entire value of cancelled air tickets as violative of the civil aviation requirement issued by the authority.“It is submitted that the airlines instead of providing the full refund of the amount collected for the tickets due to cancellation, are providing a credit shell, valid up to one year, which is clear in violation of the Civil Aviation Requirement of May 2008 issued by the DGCA which clearly states that ‘the option of holding the refund amount in credit shell by the airlines shall be the prerogative of the passenger and not a default practice of the airline,” said the plea. Referring to the prevalent practice, it has said in case of credit card payments, refund shall be made by the airlines within seven days of the cancellation to account of the credit-card holder and in case of a cash transaction, the refund shall be “made immediately” by the airline office from where the ticket was purchased.The Civil Aviation Requirement of May 2008 sets a limit of 30 working days for airlines to complete the refund process for tickets booked through travel agents/ portals, the plea has said.The plea referred to the April 16 office memorandum of the Ministry of Civil Aviation which deals with refund of ticket amount collected without levy of cancellation charge.It claimed that the memorandum directed airlines to provide full refund to only those people who booked  tickets during the lockdown period, and "leaving out people who booked tickets prior to lockdown but the flights cancelled due to lockdown amounts to treating equals unequally and thus the same is in clear violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution".The plea said: “It is clear from the Office Memorandum that directs the airlines to refund only those tickets that were booked during the lockdown period, leaves out the vast majority of passengers who had booked tickets before the flights were banned."Which indirectly approves to the practice of the airlines providing Credit Shell for booking effected before the lockdown, though the same clearly violates the refund rules of the DGCA.”There was no question of anyone booking a ticket during the lockdown knowing that schedule passenger flights were cancelled for period of travel and this made Office Memorandum of the Ministry of Civil Aviation “ambiguous and devoid of any logic”, the plea has claimed.

We are not looking for a conflict with China, but we are waging in a way, a battle of ideas with China,” Burns said, seeking Gandhi’s opinion on China at a time when the US Present Donald Trump has openly accused the Dragon land of exporting COVID-19 across the world.Gandhi took a cautious position on the matter, suggesting positive cooperation with China without ever going into a war.Gandhi also said that it’s difficult to make the democracy argument with authoritarianism at play within the two countries.Speaking of India, where he said a unilateral disruptive leadership was in power in oblique references to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi said, “The most important battle from our perspective, yours and ours, is to actually bring back our countries to where they used to be — where we embrace our people and give a healing touch as opposed to this sort of aggressive politics that we are stuck in.”Gandhi said while tolerance was the DNA of both India and the US he “doesn’t see that level of tolerance in the two nations anymore.”“Those who divide Africans and Americans in the US, and Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs in India weaken the structure of the country and call themselves nationalists,” said the former Congress president in a veiled remark on both PM Modi and US President Trump.Gandhi’s take on US and India together wishing a battle of ideas with China was, “We can't have an authoritarian perspective internally and then make that argument. That argument has to be made from the foundation of democracy, within the country itself, within our countries.”Burns however said as democracies India and US could self correct themselves by going to the ballot box, holding demonstrations, but that was not the case with authoritarian nations.“We can't decouple ourselves or delink ourselves from China. India, United States can be working together not to fight China but to make it observe the rule of law as we try to live together in this world.”Gandhi rued what he called a disruptive regime at home and said he was hopeful of change.“You take unilateral decisions, you do the biggest lockdown in the world, most rigorous lockdown in the world and then you have millions of manual laborers walking thousands of kilometres back home. So it is this unilateral episodic type of leadership. It's very destructive. But it's the flavour of the time, that's the unfortunate thing. And we are fighting it. I’m hopeful new ideas will emerge.”On the post-COVID world order, Burns said he disagreed with many people who say China is winning the pandemic war.“I actually don't see that. China certainly has extraordinary power in the world... What China lacks is the sophistication and openness of a democratic country like India or the United States. China has a fearful leadership. The Chinese system is not going to be flexible enough to accommodate the desires of the Chinese people for human freedom,” said Burns.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-should-work-together-to-make-china-observe-rule-of-law-ex-diplomat-burns-tells-rahul-gandhi-98172
12-06-2020||New Delhi||No coercive action against pvt companies for non-payment of wages during lockdown: SC||In a huge relief to private companies and industries, the Supreme Court on Friday restrained the Government from taking any coercive action against them for failing to pay wages to workers during COVID-19 lockdown.A three-judge Bench, headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, said the issue of non-payment of wages during the lockdown has to be settled through negotiations between employees and employers. The negotiations have to be facilitated by the state governments’ labour departments, it added.The Bench had passed a similar order with regard to some companies earlier. Now it has become a general order.The Bench—which also included Justice SK Kaul and Justice MR Shah —said it can’t be disputed that the industry and workers need each other, and therefore, efforts should be made to sort out the differences regarding payment of wages for the 54-day lockdown during which the MHA notification was in force.The Centre had told the court during the hearing that the said MHA notification had been withdrawn last month.While ordering no coercive action against private establishments till the end of July, it posted the matter for further hearing in the last week of July.Those industries or employers who were working during the lockdown but not to their full capacity can also enter negotiations, it said.It said employees should be allowed to report back to work without any prejudice to the negotiations.The Bench gave four additional weeks to the Centre to file its response to petitions challenging the validity of the March 29 MHA notification that had ordered mandatory payment of wages during the COVID-19 lockdown.Several private companies have challenged the MHA’s notification on the grounds that they can’t be forced to pay full wages during the lockdown ordered by the government.The petitioners, including Karnataka-based company Ficus Pax and Ludhiana Hand Tools Manufacturer Association, have challenged the validity of Section 10(2)(i) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.The provisions of this Act cannot “impinge upon express provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and take away the right to layoff workmen during times of natural calamity,” they said.Terming the MHA order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 as arbitrary, they said the order violated the private companies’ right to carry on any occupation, trade or business guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-coercive-action-against-pvt-companies-for-non-payment-of-wages-during-lockdown-sc-98171

It might be that the non-violent way towards a civilised society would prove itself. It is perhaps more likely that an effective dictatorship of the right would be set up...’.Philip Spratt, 1939.  Sitharaman then posted a weblink to an article published in September 2018 about the Poland government organising event to honour former Jamnagar king, Maharaja Jam Saheb Digvijaysinhji Jadeja, for giving shelter to 1,000 Polish children during World War II.“In 1939, when Philip Spratt, from Britain, belonging to the Communist International wrote, (who @Ram_Guha quotes) this was what was happening in Gujarat: Jamnagar... Maharaja Jam Saheb Digvijaysinhji Jadeja... saved 1,000 Polish children #Culture,” Sitharaman tweeted.Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani also responded to Guha’s tweet saying that Indians would not fall for “tricks” of dividing them.I thought it was only the Gujarat CM, but now it seems even the FM is obsessing about a humdrum historian's tweets. The economy is surely in safe hands. https://t.co/bBpcK85Hel  Soon after, Guha tweeted: “I thought it was only the Gujarat CM, but now it seems even the FM is obsessing about a humdrum historian’s tweets. The economy is surely in safe hands.” Taking a swipe at Guha, Sitharaman tweeted late in the evening: “The economy is very much in safe hands; worry not, Mr. Guha.

Legal action is being taken against persons spreading #FakeNews", it said.The principal of NRS Medical College, Saibal Kumar Mukherjee, wrote to Kolkata Police Commissioner Anuj Sharma that 14 unclaimed bodies were handed over to the KMC as per the list provided by different police stations under the jurisdiction of the hospital's morgue."And none of these bodies were of COVID patients. The subject of this video is fake, and you may take necessary action in this regard," Mukherjee said in his letter.Dhankhar said in a tweet, "Anguished at the disposal of dead bodies with heartless indescribable insensitivity. Not sharing videos due to sensitivity. In our society, the dead body is accorded highest respect - rituals are performed as per tradition."     Anguished at disposal of dead bodies @MamataOfficial -with heartless indescribable insensitivity. Not sharing videos due to sensitivity. Have sought an URGENT UPDATE @HomeSecretaryWBIn our society dead body is accorded highest respect-rituals r performed as per tradition(1/3)In yet another post in the micro-blogging site, the governor said "Response @HomeSecretaryWB has come. Virtual admission about callous handling of dead bodies promising procedure will be streamlined. Rather than booking those responsible for such inhuman criminality, the police are being misused to 'teach a lesson' to those who exposed it."     Assuring people that he would look into the incident, the city mayor Firhad Hakim said that the bodies of novel coronavirus victims in the city are cremated at a separate burning ground at Dhapa in its eastern fringes.The opposition CPI(M) and BJP criticised the state government and alleged that the "video clip is a proof of the TMC trying to hide the actual number of COVID-19 deaths in the state".BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said it must be ascertained whether the bodies are of those who died of COVID-19.The corpses that were kept in the crematorium appeared to be more than a month old, he said."I have earlier said that the real number of COVID-19 deaths in West Bengal are being suppressed," he told newspersons at the party's state headquarters here.

12-06-2020||New Delhi||Covid-19: India records single-day spike of 10,956 cases; surpasses UK to become fourth worst-hit nation||The nationwide COVID-19 tally neared the 3-lakh mark on Friday, with a record number of over 10,000 new cases getting detected across states and union territories. The government stressed on the need for stringent containment measures to check the pandemic, with the last one lakh cases emerging in just ten days.The Centre has asked states and UTs to pay special attention on emerging epicentres of cases and to focus on containment, testing and tracing, upgrading health infrastructure, clinical management and community engagement for effective management of COVID-19, the Union Health Ministry said.Sources said Prime Minister Narendra Modi may hold a fresh round of consultation with Chief Ministers next week in the backdrop of the rising number of cases in the country.While the first case of the novel coronavirus infection was detected in India on January 30, it took more than 100 days to reach the one-lakh mark on May 18, but the 2-lakh mark was breached only about a fortnight later on June 2.India on Thursday went past the United Kingdom in terms of coronavirus cases to become the fourth worst-hit country, according to the Worldometer.India is the fourth worst-hit nation by the COVID-pandemic 19 after the US, Brazil and Russia. While the US has reported more than 20 lakh confirmed cases so far, the tally for Brazil is over 8 lakh and for Russia more than 5 lakh.Globally, more than 4 lakh have lost their lives and over 75 lakh have tested positive for COVID-19 since its emergence in China last December. However, nearly 36 lakh have recovered too.In India, more than 1.47 lakh COVID-19 patients have recovered so far, while there are nearly 1.42 lakh active cases at present, according to the health ministry.In its morning 8 am update, the ministry said the total number of confirmed cases has reached 2,978,535 and the death toll has mounted to 8,498, after record numbers of 10,956 cases and 396 fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours.However, a PTI tally of figures announced by states and UTs till 9.40 pm showed the overall case count having risen to 2,98,382  and the toll to 8,743.It also showed a higher number of recoveries at more than 1.52 lakh.The ministry said the doubling time of coronavirus cases in India has improved to 17.4 days, from 3.4 days when the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25. A phased withdrawal of all lockdown restrictions began on June 1, except for in containment zones.The Delhi High Court said the central government’s decision of phased reopening of lockdown was not taken in haste and it was done to ensure a proper balance between containing the pandemic and making it certain that people are not forced to starvation.The Supreme Court, in the meantime, said the situation was “grim” at hospitals in Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Gujarat, as it took note of reports about “horrific scenes” at the national capital’s COVID-19 dedicated LNJP hospital.The court said the duty of the Delhi government does not end by informing citizens that it has arranged 5,814 beds in government hospitals and 9,535 beds in private hospitals. It said the situation in Delhi is “horrendous, horrific and pathetic”.The Delhi High Court also directed the North Delhi Municipal Corporation to pay by June 19 the salary for March to resident doctors in its six hospitals.Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal, in the meantime, constituted a high-level expert committee, which includes Indian Council of Medical Research Director-General Balram Bhargava, to suggest effective steps to deal with the outbreak in the city.Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, saw its own tally cross the 1-lakh mark after 3,493 new cases were reported to take its total to 1,01,141, while its death toll rose to 3,717.The state also reported a large number of recoveries. As many as 126 cancer patients, who had tested COVID-19 positive, have also recovered in Mumbai itself.In Tamil Nadu, another badly hit state, the tally saw a record one-day jump of 1,982 cases to cross the 40,000-mark, while the toll reached 367.Gujarat reported 495 new cases and 31 more fatalities, taking its case count to 22,562 and the death toll to 1,416.Uttar Pradesh reported 20 more COVID-19 deaths and 528 fresh cases, the biggest single-day spike so far for the state. This took the state’s death toll to 365 and the case count to 12,616. However, more than 7,600 people have recovered already, giving a recovery rate of over 60 per cent.West Bengal breached the 10,000-mark with its highest single-day spike of 476 cases, while nine more fatalities were reported to take the toll to 451.New cases were also reported from Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry, Goa, Chhatisgharh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur, Sikkim, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, among other states and UTs.

The illustration printed beside the letter is that of a boy with a dark complexion."The book is not part of the textbooks referred by the education department. It was introduced by the school. We have zero tolerance for acts which instil prejudices into the minds of students," Education Minister Partha Chatterjee told reporters here on Thursday.He said the two teachers of a local municipality-run school had been placed under suspension with immediate effect based on a preliminary investigation and stricter action would be taken against them later.Though the school is now closed because of the lockdown, the matter came to light when the father of a student was teaching him with the help of that book. He informed other parents and the education department was apprised of the issue, sources said.

Chavda had moved the top court seeking directions to prohibit the sale and use of Coca Cola, Thums Up beverages and also issuing notification apprising people at large not to drink and use it, as the same is detrimental to the cause of health. A bench headed by Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi said: "We accordingly dismiss the petition and impose costs quantified at Rs 5,00,000 on the petitioner. The costs imposed shall be deposited in the Registry within one month and shall be disbursed to the Supreme Court Advocates-on Record Association. In default of compliance, the Registry shall place an Office Report for directions."The top court observed that the affidavit in support of the petition states that the contents of the petition are true to the knowledge and belief of the petitioner and the petition has been filed without the petitioner having any technical knowledge on the subject. "The source of his assertions has not been substantiated. No justification or explanation is forthcoming during the submissions of S.P. Singh, senior counsel (for the petitioner) on why two specific brands in particular are chosen to be the target of the proceedings. The petition has been filed for extraneous reasons. The invocation of the jurisdiction under Article 32 is an abuse of the process," said the bench.After hearing the petitioner's counsel's argument on the matter, the top court said: "We have come to the conclusion that invocation of the jurisdiction under Article 32 is not a bona fide recourse to the jurisdiction in a public interest litigation. Consequently, besides dismissing the petition, an order directing the imposition of exemplary costs is necessary."The petitioner has moved the top court seeking directions to the Centre to submit complete analytical report and scientific approval by scientists in providing license of sale and use of liquid items like Coca Cola and Thums Up.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-ban-coca-cola-thums-up-sc-slaps-rs-5-lakh-fine-on-petitioner-98123

The ISI is in the process of hiring around 550 tech-savvy persons, who also know how to handle and manage social media platforms,” said a top Intelligence Bureau (IB) official. The official said, “We have reported to the ministry that they have put in place a plan to distribute such hired persons in a dozen odd teams and assign them the task to radicalise Indian youth and draw them towards terrorism in a number of ways.”The IB officials said the report also mentioned a recent meeting held by the ISI in Rawalpindi, where the plan was chalked out to allot the tasks of waging “1,000 fights” with India by exploiting the cyberspace to further this agenda.As part of this design, ISI teams have begun their activities, as recently they widely circulated fake videos of police beating Muslim youths in mosques. Security experts are of the view that the ISI has devised the online mode to foment trouble in India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isi-planning-virtual-war-against-india-intel-report-98019

State BJP president Satish Poonia said the Congress was “putting strain on the party to cover up its failure”. “It is surprising that those who played the game of horse trading for 55 years are blaming the BJP. They have their internal differences,” Poonia said.He said the Congress should prove the allegation that attempts were being made to poach the Congress and Independent legislators in the state. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday night claimed that some of the party MLAs were offered Rs 25 crore each. Government chief whip Mahesh Joshi had moved a written complaint to the Anti-Corruption Bureau, seeking a probe into the matter”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prove-poaching-charge-rajasthan-bjp-tells-congress-98021

It urged states to test more. Experts said India’s consistently low mortality rate of 2.8 per cent and improving recoveries were positive signs.Sero surveyA sero survey is a blood sample assessment to detect if the person has developed antibodies to the virus.The ICMR took blood samples of 26,400 persons in 28,595 households across 83 districts to see if they had developed antibodies to the virus. An indigenously developed kit, ‘Elisa’, was used and results showed that 0.73 per cent people had past exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus and the fatality rate was 0.08 per cent.The sero survey, however, covers the period until April 30 and mirrors early gains of the lockdown imposed on March 24 midnight. Fresh surveys would be needed to see how vastly the disease spread after April 30 to reach today’s level of 2.86 lakh cases.“In the 83 districts surveyed, 0.73 per cent population showed evidence of past exposure to SARS-COV-2. This means the lockdown was successful in keeping the disease low. The survey also shows that a large proportion of the population is still susceptible and urban slums are highly vulnerable so local lockdown measures must continue. The states cannot lower the guard on effective surveillance and containment,” ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said. The expert said there was no community transmission in India. “We want to emphasise that India is not in a community transmission stage” Bhargava said.Delhi is becoming corona capital: HCNew Delhi: The Capital is fast heading towards becoming the “corona capital” of the country, observed the Delhi High Court while expressing concern over the spike in Covid-19 cases and directed that all private hospitals equipped with labs to test for coronavirus and having ICMR sanction be permitted to conduct the test.

In fact, this is several times bigger than the 1962 war.Unlike 1962, the forces on either side are now backed by latest technology such as satellite imagery and UAVs besides long-range guns, contemporary fighter jets and radars.The Indian assessment is clear — the Army stays at the LAC if People’s Liberation Army (PLA) doesn’t withdraw and restore status quo ante as on April. The cutoff date of status quo ante is April.LAC resolution to be peaceful: IndiaIndia on Thursday said a series of diplomatic and military engagements with China have underlined the need to arrive at an early resolution of disputes on the LAC. In recent weeks, India and China have maintained communications through established diplomatic and military channels to address the situation in areas along the India-China border. tnsOver the past three decades, India has gradually built up troops and bases close to the 3,488-km LAC, allowing quick addition of soldiers and equipment. It is the PLA that has mobilised troops, guns, tanks, fighter jets at a rapid pace at its bases located across the Indian territory in HP, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. India has reportedly moved its rear formations up the Himalayas. Some 1.50 lakh troops are mandated for the China front under normal circumstances. However, in emergencies, the numbers can be ramped up. The Army is 13 lakh strong.In Ladakh, one half of the 14 Crops is mandated to face China. In Himachal and Uttarakhand, specific brigades exist. In Sikkim, the 33 Corps is positioned. Arunachal is divided among two Corps — the Tezpur-based 4 Corps that looks after the western part and the Dimapur-based 3 Corps. Besides, a division of the Mountain Strike Corps exists.The IAF, besides the fighter jets, has special operations planes and heavy-lift aircraft apart from hundreds of helicopters to quickly move troops.In the areas facing Sikkim, China has upgraded its facilities at Shigatse, to house greater number of fighter jets and attack platforms. Similarly, Chinese bases to the north and east of Arunachal Pradesh have facilities to launch attack platforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/buildup-several-times-bigger-than-1962-war-97974

12-06-2020||Kathmandu||Nepal will get back land from India through dialogue: Oli||Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has said his government will seek a solution to the Kalapani issue through diplomatic efforts and dialogue on the basis of historical facts and documents.“We will get back the land occupied by India through dialogue,” Oli said while responding to questions in Parliament on Wednesday.Souring of ties — the triggerHe claimed that India built a Kali temple, created “an artificial Kali river” and “encroached the Nepalese territory through deploying the Army” at Kalapani. The river defines the border between the two countries. Oli’s claim comes amid a raging boundary row between the two countries with India sternly asking Nepal not to resort to any “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims after Kathmandu released a new political map laying claim over Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura.KP Sharma Oli, Prime MinisterOur ancestors founded and saved this country through their struggles. We will be able to establish our territorial integrity if we remain firmThe ties between India and Nepal came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh Pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.Nepalese officials say Nepal had control over the area before 1962, when the India-China war took place. At that time India stationed its army seeking permission from then Nepalese rulers for temporary purpose, but it never removed its forces, they claim.Although there are border issues in other areas such as Susta but the government has given priority to Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as Nepali territories have not been captured by deploying army in other parts of its international border, Oli said in response to a question in Parliament.Earlier this week, the Nepalese Parliament unanimously endorsed a proposal to consider a constitution amendment bill to pave way for putting the new political map that includes Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s national emblem.A discussion on the issue started in the Parliament since Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Shivamaya Tumbahanfe tabled a Bill for the second amendment to the Nepalese Constitution to incorporate the new political map of Nepal on May 31.Prime Minister Oli said he was happy to learn that the unprecedented unity has been shown both within and outside the Parliament on the issue of national unity and territorial integrity. “Our ancestors founded and saved this country through their struggles. We will be able to establish our territorial integrity if we remain firm,” he said.Prime Minister Oli also raised objection to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s reported remark that Nepal should not repeat the mistake which Tibet made. “If Adityanath spoke about that, it was not appropriate,” he said.“It is not appropriate to threaten Nepal in that way... This should not have been spoken by a chief minister of UP,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-will-get-back-land-from-india-through-dialogue-oli-98014
