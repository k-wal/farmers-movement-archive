19-06-2020||---||Plea in SC seeks modification of order staying Lord Jagannath Rath Yatra||New Delhi, June 19A day after the Supreme Court stayed the famous Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath Temple, Puri, Odisha, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a plea has been filed a seeking modification of the order.Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagrana Manch urged the Supreme Court to modify its order and permit Rath Yatra — scheduled to commence on June 23 — with a limited number of devotees with social distancing.The Manch has contended that Odisha Vikas Parishad, on whose petition the Supreme Court stayed the Rath Yatra, did not disclose the Orissa High Court’s June 9 order refusing to stay the celebration leaving it to the state government to decide whether to hold it or not.The HC had said if the state decided to hold the Rath Yatra, social-distancing norms prescribed by the Centre would be strictly followed.It said the Deba Snana Purnima ritual was performed on June 5 with the help of 800 servitors, who first underwent COVID-19 tests. The 800 servitors have been in isolation for more than a month now, it added.The Supreme Court, on Thursday, had stayed the Rath Yatra in view of a rising number of COVID-19 cases.“A procession of this magnitude cannot be permitted at the time of a pandemic... Lord Jagannath will not forgive us if we allow this to continue,” a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had said while ordering a ban on all activities related to the Rath Yatra 2020.The Puri Rath Yatra festival, which attracts a large number of Indian and foreign tourists, is attended by lakhs of devotees and goes on for almost 20 days. Last year, an estimated one million people had taken part in it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-sc-seeks-modification-of-order-staying-lord-jagannath-rath-yatra-101456

19-06-2020||New Delhi||‘Recent tremors in Delhi-NCR don’t signal big event but strong quake can’t be ruled out’||The recent tremors in Delhi-NCR do not point towards a big event though a strong earthquake cannot be ruled out, the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology has said.It said such tremors are not unusual in the Delhi-NCR area, but indicate that strain energy is built up in the region.All the earthquakes in Delhi-NCR are due to the release of strain energy which has been accumulated as a result of northward movement of the Indian tectonic plate and its collision with the Eurasian plate through the fault or weak zones, the institute said in a statement.There are so many weak zones and faults in the Delhi-NCR: Delhi-Haridwar ridge, Mahendragarh-Dehradun subsurface fault, Moradabad fault, Sohna fault, Great boundary fault, Delhi-Sargodha ridge, Yamuna river lineament, Ganga river lineament, it said.           The Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology functions under the Department of Science and Technology.   Since the seismic network is quite good, present micro to minor earthquakes in and around Delhi-NCR could be recorded, it added.All the recent 17 quakes recorded in the Delhi-NCR region were of low to medium intensity on the Richter scale – April 12 - Delhi (3.5); April 13-Delhi (2.7); April 16 – Delhi (2); May 3 – Delhi (3); May 6 – Faridabad (2.3); May 10 – Delhi (3.4); May 15 – Delhi (2.2); May 28 – Faridabad (2.5); May 29 – Rohtak (4.5 and 2.9); June 1 – Rohtak (1.8 and 3); June 3 - Faridabad (3.2); June 4 – Rohtak (2.1); June 8 - Delhi-Gurgaon border (2.1); June 18 – Rohtak (2.1); June 19 – Rohtak (2.3).  Of these 17, only the quake that occurred at Rohtak was above 4 on the Richter scale which falls under medium intensity quake.The historical earthquake catalogue shows that there were strong earthquakes of 6.5 magnitude at Delhi in 1720; 6.8 at Mathura in 1803; 5.5 near Mathura in 1842; 6.7 near Bulandshahar in 1956; 6 near Faridabad in 1960 and 5.8 near Moradabad in 1966 in the Delhi-NCR.The Delhi-NCR has been identified as the second highest seismic hazard zone (Zone IV).“Sometimes, a vulnerable zone remains quiet, experiences small magnitude earthquakes that do not indicate any bigger earthquake, or receives a sudden jolt by a big earthquake without any call,” the statement said.              Out of 14 small magnitude earthquakes in the Delhi-NCR, the Rohtak earthquake on May 29 had the magnitude of 4.6, it added.“Since an earthquake cannot be predicted by any mechanism, the tremors cannot be described as the signal of a big event,” it said.The recent events cannot be defined as the “foreshocks”, it added.If a big earthquake takes place in a region, all smaller tremors that occurred in the immediate past at that region are categorised as the foreshocks.“Therefore, scientifically all these tremors in the Delhi-NCR can be demarcated as foreshocks only after a big earthquake takes place immediately. Though it cannot be predicted, a stronger earthquake posing a threat to people and properties cannot be ruled out,” the institute said in the statement.“Though our understanding, in terms of when, where and with how much energy (or magnitude) an earthquake can occur, is not clear, but the vulnerability of a region can be understood from the past seismicity, calculation of strain budget, mapping of active faults,” it added.Since an earthquake cannot be predicted by any mechanism, the tremors cannot be described as the signal of a big event, the institute added.

19-06-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus: Delhi L-G makes institutional quarantine mandatory before home isolation||Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has made five-day institutional quarantine mandatory for every coronavirus patient asking to be home quarantined in the national capital---a development that comes after the central government wrote to states against casually allowing the home isolation option.The L-G’s new order states that home isolation would be allowed only after a review of the patient in question at the end of the five-day period.The central government has written to states warning them against routine and casual use of home isolation facility for those with COVID-19 infection.In an urgent warning to states, the Centre said: “Some instances have been noticed wherein home isolation is allowed in a routine manner in certain States, and clauses of the revised guidelines are not followed in letter and spirit”.“This may lead to spread of the disease within the family members and neighbors, more so in urban settings such as dense urban agglomerations. The Ministry of Health requests States to ensure strict implementation of the Guidelines on Home Isolation at the field level to effectively curb spread of COVID-19 pandemic,” a government statement said, a development that comes as the national capital continues to witness an unprecedented surge in cases.The government said that its guidelines allow home quarantine only for very mild and pre-symptomatic COVID-19 patients, provided the patient has a room to himself with an attached toilet, and that he has an adult attendant.“Also, the patient shall agree to monitor his health and regularly inform the health status to the District Surveillance Officer for further follow up by the surveillance teams”.“An important clause of the Revised Guidelines is that the treating doctor is satisfied about the patient opting for home isolation based on medical assessment and assessment of his/her residential accommodation. In addition, the patient shall fill in an undertaking on self-isolation and shall follow home quarantine guidelines,” Centre’s reminder to states said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-delhi-l-g-makes-institutional-quarantine-mandatory-before-home-isolation-101451
19-06-2020||---||There should be uniformly in COVID-19 testing rates across India: SC||New Delhi, June 19As private labs charge varying rates for COVID-19 tests, the Supreme Court on Friday said there should be uniformity in testing charges across India.However, it chose not to pass any directions after being told that the Centre has issued orders to reduce the testing charges by private labs.“We have come to know that the rates of the tests to be conducted in the private labs is substantially reduced by the Government of India for which orders have also been issued,” a three-judge Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said.The Bench again pulled up the Delhi government for giving an impression that everything was fine in hospitals in the national capital.“When the (Delhi) Government does not endeavour to know any shortcomings or lapses in its hospitals and patient care, the chances of remedial action and improvement becomes dim. Every organisation, every individual should be more than ready to know about the shortcomings and lapses and it is only after knowing one’s shortcomings and deficiencies, remedial actions can be taken,” the Supreme Court said.It asked the Delhi government to be more vigilant in knowing about the deficiencies and lapses in the functioning of hospitals and patients care and take immediate remedial steps to redeem the miseries of patients who needed medical care and help.In its affidavit, Delhi government told the court that testing would be increased up to 18,000 per day from June 20 and a committee headed by NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul, having representatives of the AIIMS and the Delhi government, has been set to suggest reasonable rates of various COVID- related facilities/tests for private hospitals, labs.LNJP Hospital Superintendent informed the Bench that CCTV cameras had been installed in the hospital.The Bench asked the Maharashtra government to give reports of COVID-19 tests to the relatives of patients.“We have no doubt that the states and all concerned shall supply a copy of the report of the patient to him or his relatives and the hospital,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-should-be-uniformly-in-covid-19-testing-rates-across-india-sc-101450
19-06-2020||New Delhi||ICMR asks states to ramp up testing capacity for early detection, containment of COVID-19||The ICMR has asked states to scale up COVID-19 testing capacity to enable early detection and containment of the infection.In a letter to chief secretaries of all states, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director General Balram Bhargava said in an effort to ramp up the testing capacity, ICMR has approved a total of 960 labs in public and private sector.“However, in spite of these developments in testing, there is an urgent need to introduce rapid point of care diagnostic tests to make testing widely available in all parts of the country,” he said.“I request you all to kindly take required steps to scale up the testing capacity in your respective state by adopting various available testing options, making testing available to all symptomatic individuals in your state. This will enable early detection and containment of infection which in turn would save several lives,” Bhargava said in the letter.He said ICMR had been exploring alternate, quick and reliable options for diagnosis of COVID-19.“ICMR and AllMS, Delhi independently evaluated the stand-alone rapid point of care antigen detection assay for quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The assay is known as Standard Q COVID-19 Ag kit. On validation, the test has been found to have a very high specificity with moderate sensitivity,” the ICMR director said.“ICMR now also recommends use of Standard Q COVID-19 Ag detection test as a point of care diagnostic assay for testing in the containment zones as well as hospitals in combination with the gold standard RT-PCR test by adopting various available testing options, making testing available to all symptomatic individuals in your state.“This will enable early detection and containment of infection which in turn would save several lives,” he said.He said the ICMR has advised states on use of lgc antibody assays for conducting serosurveys in asymptomatic frontline workers like healthcare workers, sanitation workers, security staff among others for assessing their serostatus for COVID-19.“Since test, track and treat is the only way to prevent spread of infection and save lives, it is imperative that testing should be made widely available to all symptomatic individuals in every part of the country and contact tracing mechanisms for containment of infection are further strengthened,” he said.It is advised that all the patients who are being tested may be requested to share one personal identity, issued by the government to establish the authenticity of the individual, he said.“Also, it has been noted that the phone numbers shared by individuals at the time of testing are often incorrect. Therefore, it is advisable that at the time of testing, a missed call should be given on the shared phone number to verify its correctness,” he added.

19-06-2020||New Delhi||China hasn’t intruded into our territory or taken over any post: PM Modi at all-party meet||No one entered Indian territory nor were Indian posts taken over, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday on the six-week border standoff with China as he briefed prominent political leaders about the killing of 20 soldiers in the Galwan Valley that triggered a massive escalation in tension between the two countries.At an all-party meeting, he said the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice taught a “lesson” to those who had dared to look towards India and that the Army has been given “freedom” to take necessary steps.Read more: China releases 10 Indian soldiers following major general-level talksChina says ‘presently' it hasn't detained any Indian soldiers “At the outset, prime minister clarified that neither is anyone inside our territory nor is any of our post captured,” the government said in a statement, adding he assured the leaders that the armed forces are leaving no stone unturned to protect the country. The categorical statement by the prime minister came in the wake of reports that Chinese military has transgressed into the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de-facto border, in several areas of eastern Ladakh, including Pangong Tso and Galwan Valley.“While on the one hand, the Army has been given freedom to take necessary steps, India has also conveyed its position clearly to China through diplomatic means,” he said, adding that India today has such capability that no one can even dare to look towards “an inch of our land”.Modi said the entire country is hurt and angry at the steps taken by China at the LAC and underscored that India wants peace and friendship, but upholding sovereignty is “foremost”.The nearly four-hour meeting through video conference was attended by top opposition leaders including Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar, Mamata Banerjee and Sitaram Yechury among others.The government said the leaders of the political parties hailed the bravery displayed by the armed forces in Ladakh and reposed faith in the leadership of the prime minister in this hour of need. They expressed commitment to stand united with the government.In the meeting Gandhi asked some tough questions to the government like whether there was any intelligence failure on the situation along the LAC, and sought an assurance from Modi that status quo ante would be restored at the border.In her introductory remarks, she said even at this stage they were in the dark about many crucial aspects of the crisis as she posed a set of questions to the government and sought specifics about when Chinese troops intruded into the Indian territory.“In the government’s considered view, was there a failure of intelligence,” she asked.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the nation will never forget the sacrifice of the martyrs while External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar gave an overview of agreements between India and China on border management, besides sharing details of recent developments.The clash in Galwan Valley was the worst cross border confrontation between the two sides in 45 years. While India lost 20 soldiers, China’s People’s Liberation Army has not yet talked about the number of casualties it suffered.The prime minister’s comment that Indian soldiers taught a “lesson” to those who dared to look towards India is seen as reference to casualties on the Chinese side.The Chinese soldiers used stones, nail-studded sticks, iron rods and clubs in carrying out brutal attacks on Indian soldiers after they protested the erection of a surveillance post by China on the Indian side of the LAC in Galwan.Pawar, a former defence minister, said diplomatic channels should be used to defuse the tension, adding Chinese troops must be “evacuated” from the high ground in the Galwan Valley.He said that the Chinese army is occupying the high ground in the Galwan Valley with a “specific objective of dominating the Dubruk-DBO road on the Indian side”.Chinese troops can at any time decide to enforce closure of this road and India will have to pay a heavy military cost if that happened, the NCP chief said in the meeting.Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee said her party stands firmly behind the Union government in this hour of crisis and urged the Centre not to allow Chinese investments in strategically important infrastructure sectors.The West Bengal chief minister said India “should and will” unitedly tide over the crisis, sources in her party said.“We stand with the government in this hour of crisis. We will win. We will put up a united fight as one nation,” Banerjee was quoted as having told the meeting by a source in the TMC.Opposition parties like the RJD, AAP and AIMIM reacted angrily over not being invited to the meeting and raised questions over the criteria for the invitation.The two armies were engaged in a standoff in Galwan and several other areas of eastern Ladakh since May 5 when the two sides clashed on the banks of the Pangong Tso.The situation in the area deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.Prior to the clashes, both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

19-06-2020||Beijing||China reacts cautiously to mounting boycott calls of its products in India, says it values ties||China on Friday reacted guardedly to calls for a boycott of Chinese products and investments in India following the brutal attack on Indian soldiers at the Galwan Valley, saying it values its relations with New Delhi and both countries are in talks to ease the situation.The boycott calls and the growing anti-India sentiment is causing a sense of disquiet in China especially among its telecom companies like Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo etc which made a big dent in the Indian market, the second-largest in the world after China in mobile phones.China is the biggest beneficiary of the bilateral trade with India, with about USD 60 billion balance of trade in its favour in about USD 92.68 total trade in 2019.Asked about growing calls in India to boycott Chinese products and investments, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the responsibility for the crisis lies with India.“I would like to reiterate that regarding the serious situation in the Galwan valley, the right and wrong is very clear and the responsibility entirely lies with the Indian side," he said.On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and the two sides agreed to "cool down" tensions on the ground "as soon as possible".During the conversation, Jaishankar conveyed to Wang India's protest in the strongest terms on the violent face-off and said the unprecedented development will have "serious impact" on the bilateral ties."The Chinese side took premeditated and planned action that was directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties. It reflected an intent to change the facts on the ground in violation of all our agreements to not change the status quo," Jaishankar told Wang.At the Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing, spokesman Zhao said, “Both China and India are in communication with each other through diplomatic and military channels on easing the situation.“China values our bilateral relations. We hope the Indian side can work with China to jointly maintain the long-term development of bilateral relations," he said.Twenty Indian Army personnel were killed in the clash with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley on Monday night, in the biggest military confrontation in over five decades that has significantly escalated the already volatile border standoff between the two countries.“The impact of rising tensions between China and India following the latest border brawl seems to be spreading to Chinese companies in India," a report in the state-run Global Times said on Friday.Chinese smartphone maker Oppo on Wednesday cancelled the live online launch of its flagship 5G handset in India, it said.“The deadly border incident was something neither party could have anticipated or wanted to see, and the consequent rising nationalist fever in India has already caused significant pressure to bilateral relations and economic ties," the report said.“It is high time to call for both governments and the people to show rationality in the face of the border tension to maintain the stability of bilateral economic and trade ties.

Nepal media highlighted a visit to the upgraded post by Nepal Army Chief of Staff Gen Purna Chandra Thapa.The India-Nepal movement of persons has also become fraught, partly because of the lockdown that has out of bounds many crossing points and also because of the increased vigil by Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) on the Indian side and its counterparts on the Nepal side of the border.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-nepal-ties-slide-amidst-india-and-china-holding-talks-to-resolve-standoffs-101428
19-06-2020||New Delhi||In 2015 China invaded same area ‘deeper and longer, with more people’: US||The US has said it would like to hear more from China about its land border disputes with India. For the first time in recent years, China’s tensions with India are openly figuring in American calculus for the region.Speaking on the India-China border clashes immediately after high-level talks between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Chinese Communist Party Politburo member Yang Jiechi, as senior US government officials wondered whether the Chinese incursions Indian territory since 2015 was a negotiating tactic or just a punch in the nose to demonstrate their superiority.However, the US has clubbed China’s friction with India along with its other longstanding regional disputes such as South China Sea and Hong Kong issues to assert that “the actions that we’ve seen out of China have been not really constructive”, according to Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the US State Department David Stilwell.The US is watching the India-China border dispute “very closely” and finds the current activity at Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso as similar to the activity in the past on border disputes.In this respect, he mentioned Xi Jinping’s India visit in 2015 when the PLA invaded the same contested area “deeper and longer, with more people, than ever before historically. Then we saw the Doklam issue down near Bhutan, where we saw similar concerns”.“We don’t have a lot of visibility and we don’t have a lot of open dialogue with our Chinese counterparts, and honestly I’d like to see more of that if we can,” he added.For the most India was, however, a footnote as the US-China dialogue in Honolulu revolved around safeguarding American interests, including full transparency to combat the ongoing pandemic, implementing phase one of the Indo-US trade deal, North Korea, Hong Kong, South China Sea militarisation and provocative behaviour around Taiwan.Stillwell described the US-China relationship overall as intense.“This is terra incognita for the Chinese. They never had a US government actually stand up and insist that they follow through on their commitments,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-2015-china-invaded-same-area-deeper-and-longer-with-more-people-us-101426

Documents were missing in the plea,” a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra told advocate Reepak Kansal.The Registry officials were working hard to make the functioning of the court smooth for lawyers and litigants, it said.As Kansal tried to compare his petition seeking “none nation one card” with that of Arnab Goswami, the Bench said the two petitions were not comparable as the Republic TV Editor-in-Chief’s petition related to personal liberty.“You cannot compare one nation one ration card plea with that of Goswami. What was the urgency in your plea? Why are you making such allegations? Be responsible,” the Bench said while reserving its verdict on the issue.Alleging favouritism in the listing of cases, Kansal had moved the Supreme Court seeking directions to its the Secretary-General and other Registry officials to stop giving preferential treatment to influential law firms and litigants.“There are many petitioner/lawyers have been suffering by unequal treatment by the Registry as the cases filed by some law firms/influential lawyers are immediately listed by Registry ignoring the cases of ordinary petitioner/ lawyers,” he had said.Accusing the Supreme Court Registry of following “pick and choose” policy, he demanded a set of guidelines to stop discrimination against ordinary lawyers.He said: “Such a mechanism was needed to ensure that litigants were not humiliated and that equal treatment was given to all litigants by avoiding Pick and Choose Policy as adopted by respondents.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-pulls-up-lawyer-for-making-reckless-allegations-of-favouritism-in-listing-of-cases-101424

Sushant not being the son of a film star was discriminated against. Strict action should be taken by registering a case against those who  harassed Sushant." Student leader Nitish said that the case should be investigated by the CBI to resolve the mystery of Sushant's death. His soul will rest in peace only when the culprits are brought to book, he added.

For example, in our signalling system, the way we have initiated the tender policy, our Make-in-India component has become more than 70 per cent.”“Our effort is to ensure that we use more and more made-in-India products and make the import component zero. We are also making efforts to see that the products manufactured in railways are exported,” Yadav said.The Railways on Thursday said it had decided to terminate the contract of a Chinese company due to “poor progress” on signalling and telecommunication work on the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor’s 417-km section between Kanpur and Mughalsarai.The Railways had given the Rs 471 crore contract to the Beijing National Railway Research and Design Institute of Signal and Communication Group in 2016.They were supposed to complete the work by 2019, but only 20 per cent of the work had been completed so far, the Railways had said.The move came after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a fierce clash with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh early this week, the biggest military confrontation between the two countries in over five decades.The officials, however, said the decision to cancel the contract of the Chinese company had nothing to do with the ongoing faceoff.It was the poor performance and inability to deliver the project on time that led to the decision by the implementing agency, the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation Limited (DFCCIL), the officials said.The officials added that the DFCCIL had already applied to the World Bank, which was the funding agency, to initiate the process of cancellation.

What is the way forward?  The entire country would like an assurance that status quo ante would be restored and China will revert back to the original position on Line of Actual Control,” she said in her remarks at an all-party meeting the prime minister had called on Friday to discuss the volatile situation.Gandhi also asked the government to explain the sequence of events leading up to the death of 20 Indian soldiers and asked the government of it thought there was a failure of intelligence.The Congress chief said the meeting should have come earlier in the day and asked the prime minister a series of questions.Gandhi asked: “On which date did the Chinese troops intrude into our territory in Ladakh? When did the government find out about the Chinese transgressions into our territory? Was it on May 5th, as reported, or earlier? Does the government not receive, on a regular basis, satellite pictures of the borders of our country? Did our external intelligence agencies not report any unusual activity along the LAC? Did the Military Intelligence not alert the government about the intrusion and the build-up of massive forces along the LAC, whether on the Chinese side or on the Indian side? In the government’s considered view, was there a failure of intelligence?“Gandhi said there was lack of clarity on the ground situation and that valuable time was lost between May 5 and June 6, resulting in the deaths of Indian soldiers.“Even at this late stage, we are still in the dark about many crucial aspects of the crisis. We in the Congress Party believe that valuable time was lost between May 5 and June 6, the date on which the Corps Commanders meeting took place. Even after the June 6 meeting, efforts should have been made to talk directly, at the political and diplomatic levels, to the leadership of China. We failed to use all avenues, and the result is the loss of 20 lives as well as dozens injured,” Gandhi said, urging the PM to share with all the facts and the sequence of events beginning April this year till date.On the way forward Sonia Gandhi said: “The entire country would like an assurance that status quo ante would be restored and China will revert back to the original position on Line of Actual Control”.She also sought a briefing on the preparedness of defence forces to meet any threat.“In particular, I would like to ask---what is the current status of the Mountain Strike Corps, with two mountain infantry divisions, that was sanctioned in 2013? Should the Government not treat it with utmost priority?” she asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-assurance-that-china-will-move-back-from-current-position-says-sonia-at-all-party-meet-on-lac-101418

19-06-2020||New Delhi||Congress, BJP continue to bicker over Chinese aggression at LAC||The Bharatiya Janata Party and opposition Congress continued to bicker on Friday over a recent act of Chinese aggression at the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh that killed 20 soldiers of the Indian Army---a development that comes even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi  has called an all-party meeting to discuss the development.BJP vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe wrote a letter to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday objecting to the latter calling Modi a “coward”. The letter, which came a day after another BJP leader Sambit Patra called Gandhi “the most irresponsible politician” in the country,  accused the Congress leader of “endangering the unity of the country” during difficult times.“You have given an advantage to China and endangered the unity of India.  By making the most irresponsible and disgusting accusation of cowardice against an elected Prime Minister, you have jeopardised/endangered unity of the country in a difficult time,” the senior BJP leader told Gandhi in his two-page letter.In the letter, Sahasrabuddhe tells Gandhi to consult senior leaders of his party before making “irresponsible” statements.“After the brutal attack (in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed on the LAC) while majority of political leaders condemned China in one voice you, through your messages and tweets of two sentences, tried to take political mileage out of it, calling the Prime Minister a coward and hurting the sentiments of the country,” he said. Incidentally, the BJP had announced it was cancelling its virtual political programmes scheduled over the next as a “tribute” to soldiers killed at the LAC after it was criticised for going ahead as planned despite the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and tensions with China.   Gandhi however kept his attack against the central government. A day after he asked why Indian soldiers were sent “unarmed to martyrdom” in Ladakh, he accused the central government of being fast asleep as the Chinese mounted a “pre-planned” attack. “It is now crystal clear that the Chinese attack in Galwan was pre-planned, GOI was fast asleep and denied the problem, and the price was paid by our martyred jawans”.Even though the BJP leadership continues to quote agreements between India and China that forbid the countries from using any weapon within 2 km of the border, Gandhi’s appears to be far from the only person holding such views---there seems to be a growing debate about the standard operating procedure under such circumstances.  Military experts say that under such circumstances, even if a forward team went ahead for negotiations with the Chinese, there was an established response mechanism that includes using firearms in the face of enemy action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-bjp-continue-to-bicker-over-chinese-aggression-at-lac-101413

If there is one entity in the world who is not happy with the peace in the valley, it is Pakistan. The moment there is peace in the valley, it generates violence---both from across as CFVs as well as sending instructions to entities or its proxies within the valley to generate violence. I do not see any such major connection (between CFV and Ladakh situation) as of now,” Lt Gen Raju said during the press briefing in Srinagar. Official figures reveal there has been a spurt in the ceasefire violations along the LoC in J&K despite the COVID-19 lockdown. Data compiled reveal that 1,632 ceasefire violations have taken place on the LoC from January 1 to June 2, 2020. Most of the ceasefire violations have been occurring on the LoC in the Jammu division.However LoC in Kashmir has also been hot. Four civilians and two soldiers were killed in different ceasefire violations on LoC in North Kashmir since January this year. Only last week a 40-year-old woman was killed and another injured in the Uri sector of Baramulla district in cross border shelling.Lt Gen Raju said they were fully prepared at the LoC to ensure CFVs and infiltrations were kept in check. “The existing CFVs have happened through a pattern and there has not been any great increase in the number of CFVs, but, definitely, some of them have been intense which inflicted some civilian casualties. We are taking proper measures to provide more security and safety to the civilian population. .We are fully prepared at the LoC to ensure that this particular phenomenon of CFVs and infiltration is kept in check,” he said.Lt Gen Raju said the situation on the LoC and in the hinterland is stable.“We will ensure that there will be no misadventure both from outside of the LoC and as well as within the valley. And we will ensure that the situation is kept normal and the people of the valley will be able to go about their jobs in the most normal manner,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-says-no-connection-between-spike-in-ceasefire-violation-at-loc-and-lac-standoff-101406

Why did the Congress field him as itssecond nominee when it did not have the number on their side to make him win?” Mishra said.The state Home Minister was talking to reporters in response to a query. regarding Baraiya.The Congress has 92 MLAs in the House. Of them, the party had asked 54 to vote for the party’s first preference candidate Digvijaya Singh during the Rajya Sabha polls.Although Digvijaya Singh looked set to sail through, Baraiya, placed after Singh in the pecking order by his party, did not have the numbers on his side to win.According to the existing strength of the assembly, Digvijaya needs 52 votes to get re-elected to the Rajya Sabha.With remaining 38 votes, Baraiya stands a thin chance to make it to the Upper House of Parliament.“The Congress has been anti-Dalit since beginning,” Mishra said.He also accused Digvijaya Singh of snatching the opportunities of some reserved category leaders in the past.

The mortal remains of Sepoy Chandrakanta Pradhan (28) were laid to rest at Bearipanga village in Kandhamal district as per Christian rituals.Scores of people thronged the two nondescript tribal villages to pay tributes to the fallen soldiers, who were accorded the guard of honour.Thousands raised slogans such as “Nanduram Soren Amar Rahe” and “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” as they joined Soren’s cortege, which began from Rairangpur town and culminated at the cremation ground in Champauda, seven kilometres away.Soren’s nephew Kanhu Soren lit the pyre in the presence of his family members and relatives.State Revenue Minister Sudam Marndi, Lok Sabha MP Biswasara Tudu, Rajya Sabha member Mamata Mohanta and several other distinguished personalities were among those who bid farewell to the fallen soldier.Soren is survived by his wife Laxmi Soren and three school-going daughters. He had joined the Army’s 16 Bihar Regiment in 1997.He had last visited his family in January on a 45-day leave and made the final phone call to his wife on June 7, a week before the Galwan Valley clash.Similar scenes were witnessed at the funeral of Sepoy Pradhan.A motorbike procession was taken out from Raikia to Bearipanga amid tight security and slogans like “Saheed Chandrakanta Amar Rahe” were raised, Balliguda Sub-Collector Devendra Kumar Nanda said.Around 3,000 people gathered to pay their last respects to Pradhan. The administration ensured adherence to social distancing norms, he said.Pradhan’s mortal remains were buried 200 metres from his house in accordance with Christian rituals.Pradhan, who was unmarried, had joined the 16 Bihar Regiment in March 2014. He is survived by his father, Karunakar Pradhan, mother Bilasini Pradhan, elder sister and two younger brothers.According to his father, Pradhan was the sole breadwinner of the family that belongs to a marginal farming community.“We have lost everything by losing our only earning son. He was very simple, amiable and extremely duty-bound. But at the same time, we feel proud that my son has made the supreme sacrifice for the motherland,” Pradhan’s mother Bilasini said in a voice choked with emotion.The bodies of the two slain soldiers had arrived in Bhubaneswar on Thursday evening.Governor Ganeshi Lal and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik were among a galaxy of dignitaries present at the airport to pay tributes to the jawans.Patnaik, on Wednesday, had announced ex-gratia of Rs 25 lakh each from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for the kin of the two slain jawans.Soren and Pradhan were among the 20 Indian soldiers who were killed in a clash with the Chinese Army in Ladakh's Galwan Valley on June 15, the biggest military confrontation in over five decades that has significantly escalated an already volatile border standoff in the region.

19-06-2020||New Delhi||Teachers recruitment case: Priyanka says UP govt in ‘cover-up mode’||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, on Friday, attacked the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh over the teachers-recruitment case, alleging that it is in “cover-up mode” as names of people associated with the ruling dispensation have come to the fore.Taking to Twitter, she also tagged a media report which claimed that so far 11 people have been arrested in Uttar Pradesh for the alleged fraud in the recruitment of teachers in the Basic Education Department, but the main accused or its masterminds are still absconding.Those young people who worked hard, took the exam and had been waiting for the fruits of their hard work for a year, should get justice, Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.जिन युवाओं ने मेहनत करके परीक्षा दी, जो साल भर से अपनी मेहनत का फल मिलने का इंतजार कर रहे थे उनको न्याय चाहिए।इतने बड़े घोटाले में सरकार ‘लीपापोती मोड’ में है क्योंकि उसमें सत्ता पक्ष से जुड़े लोगों का नाम सामने आ गया।युवाओं के साथ अन्याय मंजूर नहीं।https://t.co/7NhYuW75iO  “In such a big scam, the government is in cover-up mode because the names of people associated with the ruling dispensation have come to the fore,” she claimed.Injustice towards youth is unacceptable, the Congress general secretary in-charge of UP East said.Earlier, Priyanka Gandhi had demanded that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath must take responsibility in the matter and take “strong action” with transparency to ensure justice is done.The Congress has been strongly raising the issue after the Allahabad High Court stayed the appointment of 69,000 assistant basic teachers in the state.The Lucknow bench of Justice Alok Mathur on June 3 had stayed the selection process, prima facie finding that certain questions and answers were ''ambiguous and wrong'' and, hence, it required fresh scrutiny by the UGC.The recruitment examination was held on January 6, 2019, and its result was declared on May 12 this year.

19-06-2020||---||Tone down nationalist rhetoric’ over Indo-China border face-off: Former PM Deve Gowda||Bengaluru, June 19Former prime minister HD Deve  Gowda on Friday pitched for toning down “nationalist rhetoric” and cautioned government against encouraging calls for economic boycott of Chinese products in the backdrop of the death of 20 Indian soldiers in the Gwalwan Valley face-off.He also said a detailed presentation should be made by a senior serving military officer and diplomat on the ground situation for opposition leaders at the all-party meeting on the border situation for a “meaningful” exchange of views.Welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s initiative in convening the virtual meet Friday evening, the JD(S) patriarch also urged his colleagues in the opposition not to use “intemperate” language.He said the government should not encourage “reactionary” language of economic boycott. “Its implications are deep. We should be guided by pragmatism”, Gowda said in a statement, making a series of suggestions.He said “nationalist rhetoric” should be toned down in order to ensure that “we do not escalate matters” and this was not the time for a “language of provocation and revenge”.Media outlets “spreading fake information” and “cheap rhetoric” endanger the lives of Indian soldiers and diplomatic staff, said Gowda, during whose tenure as PM in 1996 a pact was signed with China that made it binding on soldiers to exercise self-restraint and go for immediate consultation in case of a face-off.Also the social media retribution was of particular concern, he said, adding the government should take steps to check this.“By this I do not mean that critical mainstream opinions, analysis and reporting should be stopped,” he added.His remarks came amid rising voices for boycott of China-made products after a violent clash between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh left 20 Indian Army personnel dead early this week.On Thursday, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan appealed to people to boycott products from China and also directed officials of his ministry not to procure any Chinese products for day-to-day office use while his ministerial colleague Ramdas Athawale said all restaurants and hotels that sell Chinese food in India should be closed down.Gowda said he fully appreciated the Prime Minister’s decision to call the all-party meet. “In national interest, and to ensure a bipartisan environment for discussions, I would like to make the following suggestions.”    Gowda suggested that a senior serving military officer and diplomat should make a detailed presentation to opposition leaders on the ground situation, and the progress of talks.“Only with this information could there be a meaningful exchange of ideas between the government and the opposition leaders... The demand here is not for classified details, but truthful information,” he said.The meeting comes in the backdrop of demands by the opposition seeking details of the fierce clash in Ladakh, the biggest military confrontation between India and China in over five decades.However, Gowda would not attend the meeting as he had not been invited, his office said.Also urging opposition leaders not to use intemperate language, Gowda said, this was an hour for cooperation and domestic politics and national security interests cannot be equated.“Having said this, I do not mean we should not question the government. It should be done keeping in mind that there are larger issues at stake,” he said.Gowda said there was a feeling that India was engulfed by hostile nations and it was the duty of the political leadership to ensure that such anxiety is quelled with proper information.It was important to keep the nation informed at all times. Underplaying certain developments and overstating certain information may be a bad strategy in the long run, he said.Pointing out that in recent times, there was an effort to politicise the armed forces and terming it “dangerous”, the former prime minister said, they should be allowed to remain a professional force.When they remain a professional force, they will advise the government of the day fearlessly and correctly.“As we are on the topic of the armed forces, it is important to institute an inquiry into the deaths of soldiers in the Galwan Valley, and know exactly what led to the tragic events,” he said.

According to the FIR, Delhi Police's Special Cell had received an input that the D Company, run by fugitive Indian underworld kingpin Dawood Ibrahim, is funding pro-Khalistan terrorist organisations in Punjab.Davinder Singh was taken in custody under the same FIR.The special cell had also interrogated Singh regarding the Khalistan angle, police said.

19-06-2020||New Delhi||RJD, AAP protest exclusion from PM's all-party meet on LAC standoff||Rashitriya Janata Dal and Aam Aadmi Party both protested their exclusion from the all-party meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called this evening to discuss the LAC standoff and the way ahead.RJD and AAP have not been invited for the deliberations with both objecting to what they described as a “parochial view of things”. Both said they were informed that only those parties that had five or more MPs in the two houses of Parliament had been invited.RJD leader Manoj Jha rushed a letter to the Prime Minister saying he should rise above bureaucratic mindset when organizing a meeting on national security. Jha also said the RJD was the principal opposition party of Bihar and the largest party in the state legislative assembly.“Bihar has a strategic location in relation with the neighouring countries of South Asia because of the open border with Nepal. On raising the exclusion we were told parties with a minimum of five MPs in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha have been invited. While it is regrettable that electoral victory is being used to exclude a historically important party from having a say in such a crucial matter of national interest, it is even more regrettable that the Parliament secretariat is unable to count MPs properly. RJD has five MPs in both houses,” Jha wrote in his letter seeking correction of the error of not inviting RJD.He said parties with fewer MPs had been called to participate (TDP, Apna Dal) and RJD’s exclusion would be a matter of record.AAP for its part attacked the BJP for not taking everyone along in matters of national security. “It is unfortunate in a democracy that AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has not been called for participation in such an important meeting concerning national security. The BJP should have taken everyone along,” said AAP MP Sanjay Singh.The meeting starts at 5 pm today. It is learnt that Defence Minister Rajnath Singh personally called up leaders last night to invite them for the meeting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rjd-aap-protest-exclusion-from-pms-all-party-meet-on-lac-standoff-101376

I don't have any information for you at the moment".“I would like to reiterate that regarding the serious situation in the Galwan Valley, the right and wrong is very clear and the responsibility entirely lies with the Indian side," he said.“China values our bilateral relations. We hope India can work with China to jointly maintain the long-term development of the bilateral relations,” the foreign ministry spokesman said.Ten Indian Army personnel including two Majors were released by the Chinese military on Thursday evening following three days of negotiations, people familiar with the development said in New Delhi.The clash in Galwan Valley is the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La when India lost around 80 soldiers while the death toll on the Chinese side was over 300.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.Meanwhile, commenting on a question on India's election to the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member, Zhao said that the UNSC is an important organ to uphold international peace and security following the UN charter.As a permanent member, China would like to enhance cooperation with all the parties of the UNSC, including the newly-elected non-permanent members to jointly fulfil the responsibility given by the UN charter, he said.Asked about China's stance on the UN reforms, he said: “China's position on the UN reforms is consistent and clear”.China in the past has said that there were major differences among UN members over the UNSC reforms.Beijing has maintained that a “package solution” should be found to accommodate the interests and concerns of all parties.

He was taken to Mumbai by train on May 26.His counsel had alleged that NIA didn’t disclose before the Special Judges about the pendency of bail plea. However, NIA said it was just a matter of chance that Navlakha surrendered in Delhi on April 14 and could not be taken to Mumbai.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhima-koregaon-case-sc-frowns-upon-delhi-hc-for-hearing-navlakhas-bail-plea-101367

Delhi had already filed its response to his plea.Giving further time to Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh to file their affidavits, the Bench listed the matter for further hearing after three weeks.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said whatever will be done will be in accordance with law.The Supreme Court had on May 26 asked governments of Assam, UP, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh to respond to Imam's plea for clubbing of all FIRs lodged against him for his in various states.Dave had cited the court's order in Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnabb Goswami's case in which multiples identical FIRs arising out of the same cause of action were quashed, except the nee being probed by the Mumbai Police.Imam has contended that five FIRs based on same speech and same facts had been registered against him in Delhi, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh"There is nothing wrong in police registering FIR.

Authorities were churning out approvals for construction despite pending applications, he alleged.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta opposed stay. He said he can't give any assurance of no work on ground will be done."Lordships can say whatever happens...whatever work is done will be subject to the orders of the court," Mehta submitted.Mehta asserted that there was no overreaching of process of court in the government's pursuit of clearances for the project.This is the second time in less than two months that the Supreme Court has refused to stay re-development of Central Vista area of New Delhi, saying there was no urgency."During COVID-19, nobody is going to do anything... there is no urgency," a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had said on April 30.Invoking ‘larger public interest’, the top court had in March transferred to itself petitions challenging the re-development of New Delhi's Central Vista area from the Delhi High Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/central-vista-redevelopment-sc-refuses-to-stay-ground-work-101347

The price was paid by our martyred Jawans,” Rahul Gandhi earlier said on Twitter.He had also tagged a report quoting Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik saying the attack was pre-planned by China and the Indian forces would give a befitting reply.Rahul Gandhi’s remarks also come ahead of an all-party meeting convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday evening to discuss the situation along the India-China border.Twenty Indian Army personnel, including a Colonel, were killed in a clash with the Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on Monday night, the biggest military confrontation in over five decades that has significantly escalated the already volatile border standoff in the region.Rahul Gandhi has been questioning the government on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) standoff and asking how the Chinese occupied Indian territory and why Indian soldiers were sent “unarmed to martyrdom” in Ladakh.The External Affairs Minister, on Thursday, said the armies of the two sides did not use firearms as per provisions of the bilateral agreements sealed in 1996 and 2005.“Let us get the facts straight. All troops on border duty always carry arms, especially when leaving the post. Those at Galwan on 15 June did so,” Jaishankar said on Twitter.He also said there was a long-standing practice between the two countries of not resorting to using firearms in faceoffs in view of the two agreements of 1996 and 2005.Hitting out at the incident, Rahul Gandhi, in a video message, had said: “China has committed a big crime by killing unarmed Indian soldiers. I want to ask who sent these Bravehearts towards danger without arms and why. Who is responsible for this? How dare China kill our UNARMED soldiers? Why were our soldiers sent UNARMED to martyrdom?” he added.

19-06-2020||United Nations||India will intensify engagement at UN to move Security Council reform process ahead: Envoy||India will intensify its engagement at the United Nations to move the long-pending Security Council reform process forward as the UNSC's current structure no longer reflects the geopolitical realities of the 21st century, according to the country's envoy at the world body.India has been at the forefront of efforts at the United Nations to push for an urgent long-pending reform of the Security Council, emphasising that it rightly deserves a place at the UN high table as a permanent member.India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti told PTI: “We are of the view that Council's membership no longer reflects the geopolitical realities of the 21st century and needs urgent reform. This is one of our five priorities we have set out.”His remarks came after India on Wednesday overwhelmingly won the election to the Security Council for a non-permanent seat.While the Security Council needs reform, the Council itself is not initially the forum for discussing it, Tirumurti said, adding that as per the 2008 General Assembly resolution, the Security Council reforms would be discussed by the member states at the Inter Governmental Negotiation (IGN) process in an informal plenary of the General Assembly.The General Assembly has renewed the mandate of the IGN annually, and it remains the principal vehicle for Council reform discussions today, he said.Noting that it has been 11 years since the first round of the IGN was held on February 19, 2009, he said this is "clearly a very unsatisfactory situation".“We will intensify our engagement with all reform-minded member states and groups” such as the G4 bloc of Brazil, Germany, India and Japan, the Africa group, L.69 group of developing countries, the African Union Committee of 10 (C10) and "explore ways and means of taking the discussions forward in the IGN."India, the endorsed candidate from the Asia-Pacific States grouping, garnered 184 votes out of the total 192 polled in the Security Council elections on Wednesday in the UN General Assembly.Along with India, Norway, Ireland and Mexico will join the Security Council as the non-permanent members for a two-year term beginning January 1, 2021.This is the eighth time that India will sit at the Council's horseshoe-shaped table. Previously, India was elected for the years 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985, 1991-1992 and most recently in 2011-2012.In 2021, India, Norway, Ireland and Mexico will sit in the most powerful UN organ along with the five permanent members -- China, France, Russia, the UK and the US as well as non-permanent members Estonia, Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Vietnam.The two-year terms of Belgium, Dominican Republic, Germany, Indonesia and South Africa end this year.Tirumurti said last week that as the UN commemorates its 75th anniversary this year, “it is clear to us that United Nations and indeed multilateralism itself need to change to reflect the contemporary realities to enable them to remain effective and credible”.The Indian envoy referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for a reformed multilateralism and the reform of multilateral system as essential to ensuring that the international system is inclusive and caters to the requirements of all countries, which will in turn facilitate a stronger action.“We also believe that the current crisis that we face, especially in the context of Covid-19, provides the seed for new opportunities,” Tirumurti had said.

We're monitoring the situation between Indian and Chinese forces along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany had told reporters when asked about the border clash.“We have seen the Indian Army statement that 20 Indian soldiers died as a result of the confrontation, and we extend our deepest condolences on that,” she had said.McEnany stressed that there are no formal plans to mediate between India and China.“No formal plans on that beyond what I already said in expressing our absolute condolences to the Indian soldiers that died as a result of today's confrontation. We extend our deepest condolences there,” she said.“I would note just that during the phone call on June 2 of this year that President (Donald) Trump had with Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi, they did discuss the situation on the India-China border,” McEnany said.Monday's face-off was the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La when India lost around 80 soldiers while over 300 Chinese army personnel were killed in the face-off.According to a report in the US News, at least 35 Chinese troops, including one senior official, died in the violent clash with Indian soldiers.The Indian Army has been fiercely objecting to border transgressions and has demanded their immediate withdrawal for the restoration of peace and tranquillity in the area. Both sides have held a series of talks in the last few days to resolve the row.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC). China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.

It also slammed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for making “irresponsible” statements and showing “lack of faith” in the Indian Army.Terming him as the “most irresponsible politician” India has seen, the BJP also asked him to “de-escalate” his politics of “misinformation and propaganda” or the country would not forgive him.“Whenever PM Narendra Modi has made a commitment to the nation, he has kept it,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, responding to Rahul’s sustained attack.“Their sacrifice will not go in vain. India is capable of giving a fitting reply if provoked,” the PM had said in his first comment on the Ladakh clash.A day ahead of the all-party meeting called by the PM on the critical issue, Rahul today questioned why Indian soldiers were sent “unarmed to martyrdom” in Ladakh.Citing an agreement between China and India that prohibits armies of both countries from using any weapon within 2 km of the LAC, Patra said: “You are the most irresponsible politician India has seen. Read, understand and then speak... don’t rant against your country.

Those at Galwan on June 15 did so. Long-standing practice (as per 1996 & 2005 agreements) not to use firearms during faceoffs.” He was responding to a tweet by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, asking why Indian soldiers were “sent unarmed to martyrdom”.Let us not muddle facts @DrSJaishankar.

Private telecom companies, including Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, filed affidavits explaining how they intended to clear their AGR dues.Asking the Centre to consider their proposals, the court posted the matter for further hearing in July after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the Department of Telecom needed time to study the proposals and file its response. The telcos want to make staggered payment of their AGR dues and the government has supported their position.At the very outset, Mehta told the Bench that the Centre has decided to withdraw demands of more than Rs 3.70 lakh crore from non-telecom public sector undertakings.

It has also attempted to build a barrier in the Galwan river so that it can hold and release water at will which can possibly threaten bridges on the 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie road.We expect the Chinese side to confine its activities to its side of the LAC. —MEA spokespersonSo far, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has not moved out of the Galwan valley or the ridgelines around it. More than 1,000 troops of each side are still in the valley that is stretched over 6 km. China on Tuesday had claimed that the entire Galwan valley belonged to it. India has categorically rejected that official statement.The two sides, however, have disengaged from the spot of the clash. The Indian side is seeking that all personnel of the PLA withdraw or disengage from the wider area of the Galwan valley. The fresh satellite imagery with the government shows that China has added to military structures east of ‘Finger 4’ which is north of the Pangong Tso (a 135-km lake).Meanwhile, the Indian Army in response to a news report in a US-based newspaper, said: “No Indian soldier is missing in action after the clash on the night intervening June 15 and 16.” The newspaper had claimed some soldiers were missing.This was the third consecutive day of meetings at Galwan.

Swarup pointed out that India had chaired the counter-terrorism committee in the UNSC in 2011-12 and was instrumental in introducing the concept of ‘zero tolerance’ to terrorism.Immediately after the election results were announced with 184 countries out of 192 voting in India’s favour, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN TS Tirumurti said: “We are confident that in the Covid and post-Covid world, India will continue to provide leadership and a new orientation for a reformed multilateral system.”Five new members – India, Ireland, Mexico, Norway and Kenya – will join the UNSC on January 1, 2021, for a two-year term replacing Indonesia, South Africa, the Dominican Republic, Belgium and Germany. As per rules, five non-permanent members out of 10 are elected each year for two years.Tirumurti described India’s election as recognition of PM Narendra Modi’s global role.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-at-global-high-table-wins-unsc-seat-100797
19-06-2020||Kathmandu||Nepal redraws map, President signs Bill||Nepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari on Thursday signed a Constitution amendment Bill to update the country’s new political map which incorporated three strategically important Indian areas, hours after Parliament approved it, a move that could severely hit bilateral ties with New Delhi.India has already termed as “untenable” the “artificial enlargement” of the territorial claims by Nepal after its Lower House of Parliament on Saturday unanimously approved the new political map of the country featuring Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura areas which India maintains belong to it.Nepal had last month released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the strategically important areas, more than six months after India published a new map in November 2019.Earlier in the day, the National Assembly (Upper House) of the Nepalese Parliament, unanimously passed the Bill providing for the inclusion of the country’s new political map in its national emblem. All 57 members, who were present on the occasion, voted in favour of the amendment Bill, said National Assembly Chairperson Ganesh Timilsina. The Cabinet had endorsed the new political map on May 18. Anurag Srivastava, the MEA spokesperson in New Delhi, replying to queries, said: “This artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable. It is also violative of our current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues.” — PTIKATHMANDU UPGRADES CHANGRU OUTPOSTTHE TRIGGER||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-redraws-map-president-signs-bill-100843
