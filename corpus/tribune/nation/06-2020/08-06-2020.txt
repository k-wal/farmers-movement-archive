The ties could have taken a turn for the worse had Nepal approached the International Court of Justice or the UN, which was the stage of a slanging match between India and Nepalese delegations over an “economic blockade” in 2015.There were existing modalities such as the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group on resolving the outstanding issues, which was convened by the Foreign Secretaries of both countries and has been pending official airing for two years now.Besides, there was also a pending proposal for a field survey to demarcate Kalapani, for which a joint boundary committee was to be set up.“There are no dead-ends with Nepal. It is a question of how we handle it from here,” said a source.The Kalapani dispute has been making an appearance for the past two decades but was fanned in November last year. India, while releasing a new political map to depict the carving of J&K into two UTs, also included the Lipu Lek-Kalapani-Limpiyadhura area which is claimed by Nepal.The issue ebbed after the Ministry of External Affairs made conciliatory statements.It came to the fore again in May when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh digitally inaugurated a link road to Mansarovar Yatra. Singh’s tweet prominently mentioned Lipulekh which he described as “China Border” whereas Nepal claims it is a tri-junction.The MEA has been firm that the road section in “Uttarakhand lies completely within the territory of India” and follows “the pre-existing route used by the pilgrims of the Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-asks-nepal-to-use-alternative-steps-to-diffuse-border-row-96328

The 30-year old victim was taken to at least eight hospitals, including government-run facilities, by her husband before she died in the ambulance, just outside a health facility in Greater Noida on June 5.  In the second incident in Noida on Monday, a 26-year old woman was allegedly refused admission by the District Hospital in Sector 30 following which she delivered a stillborn baby on the pavement outside the hospital.The family of the woman alleged that had she received timely treatment the baby could have survived.NHRC observed that if the contents of the news reports were true, they raise a serious issue of violation of human rights as the state authorities have failed to ensure the right to life and medical care of its citizens. “It is understood that amid spread of Covid-19 virus the hospitals are receiving a very large number of patients and there is shortage of infrastructure but refusing to attend to patients by the hospitals is a matter of grave concern,” said the NHRC spokesperson.  The NHRC has also sent copies of the press clippings to the Secretary, Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, to look into the matter and issue specific instructions to all the states and UTs so that people coming to the hospitals in cases of emergency for treatment of illness other than Covid-19 are not denied medical care and critical support.According to the NHRC spokespersons, in the case of the death of the 30-year-old pregnant woman, she was undergoing treatment for pregnancy related complications at a private facility called Shivalik Hospital. However, when the family approached the hospital to get her admitted, they refused forcing the husband to take her from one hospital to another.The husband of the victim has complained that he requested the ESI Hospital, the Child PGI at Sector 30, Sharda Hospital and Government Institute of Medical Sciences, Greater Noida, but all of them allegedly turned them away.He also tried to get her admitted in several private hospitals, including Jaypee, Fortis and Max, Vaishali, but all allegedly told him that there were no beds available.The deceased’s husband has stated that finally he could get her admitted to GIMS Hospital where she was put on a ventilator but it was too late. The District Magistrate of Gautama Buddha Nagar district has reportedly ordered an inquiry into the matter.As per media reports, in the second incident on Monday the family had brought the pregnant woman to the Noida district hospital in an auto-rickshaw. When the hospital refused to attend to the patient the family tried to arrange an ambulance but in the meantime, the woman delivered a stillborn girl on the pavement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nhrc-notice-to-up-govt-over-non-treatment-of-two-pregnant-women-96316

I give my sincere condolences to the family and hope that they are able to withstand this big and untimely loss," the official said.The couple had been active in social service as members of the Blood Donors Kerala-UAE chapter and the youth wing of expat organisation Incas."His work had been hectic these days. He even discussed with me about resigning and going back home. But whenever he managed to get some time, he came for food kit distribution. He was one of our main coordinators for blood donation here," said Jacob.Another friend said Chandran had been a pillar of a volunteering group called Emergency Team International in Kerala and continued to support its mobile blood donation drive during the pandemic."He had arranged some people to donate blood in his hometown even today. He had helped save many lives in Kerala and here. It is very tragic that he died without getting help," the report said.The body was shifted to Rashid Hospital from his apartment in International City for collecting the sample for COVID-19 test before shifting to the police mortuary, it said.The coronavirus has infected over 70,00,000 people and killed more than 4,00,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 1.9 million cases and more than 1,10,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

08-06-2020||New Delhi||DGCA advises airports to not ease wildlife control measures amid COVID-19 pandemic||Indian aviation regulator DGCA on Monday advised all airport operators to not ease their wildlife control measures even though air traffic has reduced due to the coronavirus pandemic.Many regular activities such as grass cutting, bird activity monitoring patrols, and dispersal measures may be limited given the current situation of reduced manpower and lower aircraft movements at airfields, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in its circular.“This may result in an increase of bird/wildlife that forage, feed and rest or even nest within or near aerodromes,” it stated.In the past, there have been many incidents in India where aircraft have hit animals on the runway during takeoff or landing. There have also been incidents where a bird has hit the engine of an aircraft during its takeoff or landing or when it is at a lower altitude.The regulator on Monday said according to its rules, an airport operator must take action to decrease the risk to aircraft operations by adopting measures to “minimise the likelihood of collisions between wildlife and aircraft”.“Therefore, airport operators are advised not to ease bird/wildlife control measures and bird/wildlife monitoring be continued. Particular attention should be given to the increase of bird/wildlife activities as a result of reduced air traffic,” it said.India resumed its domestic passenger flight operations from May 25 after a gap of two months.  Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country.Cargo flights, medical evacuation flights and special repatriation flights have been operating in the country as usual amid the pandemic.The rapid spread and deadly effect of COVID-19 has had a drastic effect on the airport operations, the regulator said in its circular.“During the lockdown period, airports have seen a significant reduction in operations. With less air traffic and stay-at-home orders, it has also seen a reduction in personnel deployed on the airfields for various duties and functions, including wildlife management,” it said.Many airports are near substantial wetlands, or drainage ponds, making these areas attractive to thousands of migratory birds including waterfowl, shorebirds, gulls and other large birds, the DGCA noted.“Unfortunately, it is these birds that present a higher risk to aircraft. Therefore, given the current environment of reduced aviation activity, birds/wildlife are expected to expand their environment,” it said.

The school infrastructure will consist of academic blocks, classrooms, furniture and sanitation facilities.“The Government of India remains committed to continue collaborating with the Government of Nepal and its agencies for socio-economic development of Nepal, including post-earthquake reconstruction projects,” read the statement.In April 2015, a devastating earthquake of 7.8 magnitude rocked Nepal, killing nearly 9,000 people and wounding nearly 22,000 others.In 2016, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli allotted Nepali Rupees 82,135 crore ($6.8 billion) under a five-year plan to complete the reconstruction of all quake-hit academic institutions and health facilities within three years.Marking five since the disaster in April, the Nepal National Reconstruction Authority said of the 7,553 schools that needed reconstruction, only 5,598 had been completed fully or partially built.About 2,015 (26 per cent) of the quake-damaged schools were yet to be reconstructed, the agency had said.

08-06-2020||Satya Prakash||Lockdown exposes digital divide in legal profession||The Covid-19 lockdown has exposed the digital divide in legal profession in India. Major Bar bodies have demanded resumption of physical court hearings, saying 95 per cent of lawyers are not comfortable with the virtual court system activated to prevent the spread of the pandemic.The Bar Council of India, which regulates the legal profession in the country, alleged that legal profession was gradually being attempted to be hijacked by a few lawyers and selected law firms having high-level connections and if virtual court system was allowed to continue, more than 95 per cent of advocates will become brief less. The Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association too said most the lawyers were unable to present their cases effectively in the virtual medium.The situation is a telling comment on the Indian judicial system, which has been a slow learner so far as use of information technology is concerned. Under its ambitious e-courts project, the Supreme Court introduced e-filing of petitions in October 2006. However, almost 14 years on, most of the petitions continue to be filed through physical mode.It’s an irony that at a time when technology should have been appreciated as a solution to the problem created by Covid-19, it is being seen as a part of the problem by those expected to adopt it willingly.Most of the two million lawyers in India practice in subordinate courts and don’t have electronic gadgets and Internet connection needed to use virtual court system. The BCI created such a system for such lawyers in Delhi. But what about lawyers in tier two and tier three cities?In May 2017, the then CJI, JS Khehar, said the SC would start functioning as a digital court in two months. In September 2018, the SC allowed a PIL seeking live streaming of the court’s proceedings in important constitutional matters. Even though the system is yet to be put in place, judges have started adapting to the change. Earlier this month, a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud functioned as a paperless virtual court.There is a need to create a level playing field for lawyers coming from disadvantaged socio-economic background to bridge the digital divide in the legal profession. Else, use of IT will face resistance from a majority of lawyers making the change a painful process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-exposes-digital-divide-in-legal-profession-96298

India is ONE and we have to fight this pandemic together! #IndiaFightsCorona  Mr. Kejriwal says Delhi hospitals are only for Delhiites. Will he please tell us who is a Delhiite?If I live or work in Delhi, am I a Delhiite?  Baijal, who issued the orders in his capacity as the Chairman of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority, made it clear that the Supreme Court has invariably held in several successive judgements that ‘Right to Health’ is an integral part of ‘Right to Life’ under Article 21 of the Constitution.“In exercise of powers conferred under Section 18(3) of the Disaster Management Act, the undersigned in his capacity as the Chairperson of the DDMA, hereby directs all departments and authorities concerned of NCT of Delhi, to ensure that monitoring/treatment is not denied to any patient on the ground of not being a resident of NCT of Delhi,” the order said.The LG also overruled the city government’s order for coronavirus testing only for symptomatic patients, saying it deviated from the ICMR guidelines.He said this deviation in the ICMR guidelines can result in inadequate contact tracing of affected individuals and can result in further spread of COVID-19 in the national capital.Baijal said all nine categories people, including asymptomatic, as prescribed by the ICMR should be examined in the national capital.He said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has issued strategy for COVID-19 testing in India on May 18, which has prescribed testing for nine categories, including asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case to be tested once between day 5 and day 10 of coming into contact.The LG said to contain the spread of COVID-19, it is essential to conduct a thorough contact tracing of affected persons, especially in containment zones and as such, the ICMR strategy for COVID-19 testing should be followed without any deviation.Referring to the AAP government earlier order, Baijal said it had issued an order dated June 6 which changed from the one prescribed by the ICMR.“Now, therefore, in exercise of powers conferred under Section 18(3) read with Section 18(2)(d) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the undersigned hereby directs all departments and authorities concerned of NCT of Delhi, to ensure that ICMR strategy for COVID-19 testing in India issued on May 18 is strictly observed in NCT of Delhi without any deviation,” he said.Kejriwal on Monday said the LG’s order on hospitals has created major problem and challenge for Delhiites.Taking to Twitter, the chief minister said providing treatment to people coming from all the over country is a big challenge during COVID-19 pandemic.The Delhi government will try to make arrangements to provide treatment to all those coming from outside the national capital, said Kejriwal, who has gone into self-quarantine after developing sore throat and fever, and will get himself tested for COVID-19 on Tuesday.His deputy Manish Sisodia lashed out at the BJP, alleging the BJP has pressured the LG into releasing this order to revoke the AAP government’s decision.“The BJP should be thinking about the welfare of the people. The BJP should take back the decision, we need wise-management not political management. Support the decisions of the state government,” he said.On Sunday, Kejriwal had justified the decision on hospitals citing the report of a panel which stated that Delhi will need 15,000 beds by the end of June and if people of other states are allowed to get treatment, all beds here will be occupied within just three days.The panel had been appointed by the Delhi government to guide it on healthcare infrastructure augmentation and overall preparedness of hospitals to battle COVID-19 in the national capital.The Delhi government had on Wednesday issued testing guidelines making it mandatory only for symptomatic patients to be tested for COVID-19.Till Wednesday, Delhi and other states have followed the ICMR guidelines which allow asymptomatic direct contacts of Covid-19 patients to be tested. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lg-overrules-kejriwal-govts-orders-on-reserving-hospitals-for-delhiites-and-covid-testing-96297

People have replaced the Congress with the BJP as the main Opposition party in the state. Under president JP Nadda, Odisha now has to be made a ‘garh’ of the BJP. The party organisation has to be strengthened to make Odisha a developed state so that no one has to go outside to earn a living,” he said, addressing the ‘Odisha Jan Samvad’ virtual rally on Monday.Amit Shah thanked the people of Odisha for sending eight BJP MPs to the Parliament and displacing the Congress as the main Opposition party in the state. He also criticised the “Manmohan-Sonia government” for not doing enough for the state.However, he did not say much about the BJD, with which the BJP enjoys a working relationship.Becoming the first party off the blocks amid the COVID-19 crisis to give wings to its political activities and ambitions with virtual rallies, Amit Shah said “do gaz ki doori” (the mandatory distance of two yards to fight the COVID-19 pandemic) could not distant the BJP and the people.Congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi for leading a “unique” fight against the pandemic, he said: “When the history of epidemics will be written, ‘Janata Curfew’ will be mentioned in golden letters, no matter who is writing it.”“This is exactly why India is among those countries which have fared better in the fight against coronavirus. On the behest of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 130 crore people stayed indoors and cooperated in his fight against the pandemic,” Amit Shah added.The Home Minister conceded that the migrant workers, including those from Odisha, faced difficulties while returning home, but “the Modi government ensured they reached home”.The BJP and the Centre have received huge criticism over the plight and sufferings of migrants following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s four-hour notice for the countrywide lockdown and delay in the evacuation of migrant workers.Enlisting the welfare measures taken by the Modi government in the past six years, Amit Shah said the BJP workers were also providing meals to more than 11 crore people during the COVID-19 crisis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/make-odisha-garh-of-bjp-amit-shah-to-state-cadres-during-odisha-jan-samvad-virtual-rally-96294

08-06-2020||Tribune News Service||SC issues notice to Centre, states and NDMA on PIL alleging rise in child trafficking||New Delhi, June 8The Supreme Court, on Monday, issued notices to the Centre, the states and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on a PIL filed by the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) alleging a sharp rise in child trafficking cases during the COVID-19 lockdown.“We are aware that trafficking is being done for prostitution and for labour... If the need arises, we may also form a panel of experts to study the issue,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said.While asking the Centre, the states and the NDMA to respond to the PIL in two weeks, the Bench sought Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta’s assistance in the matter.The states that have been issued notices included Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and NCT Delhi.Alleging that there was a sharp rise in child-trafficking cases during the COVID-19 lockdown, the BBA sought certain directions to the authorities to check it.“The opening of the lockdown would see a massive spurt in the cases of child trafficking,” it said.On behalf of the NGO, senior counsel HS Phoolka submitted that a pro-active approach was needed by district child welfare committees, especially in the vulnerable districts. Mehta told the Bench that he would sit with Phoolka and collate suggestions on how to deal with the problem. “This is not an adversarial petition. We’ll get together and work out the measures,” Mehta told the Bench.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-states-and-ndma-on-pil-alleging-rise-in-child-trafficking-96275

08-06-2020||---||SC notice to Rajasthan Govt on plea for CBI probe into NLU student’s death||New Delhi, June 8 The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to the Rajasthan Government on a petition seeking a CBI probe into the mysterious death of Vikrant Nagaich, student of National Law University (NLU), Jodhpur, three years ago.  A third-year law student of NLU, Jodhpur, Vikrant—who hailed from Gurugram in Haryana—was found dead under mysterious circumstances in August 2017. He had gone out with friends to a place near the campus. His friends came back but he told them that he would return later. Next morning, his dead body was found.A Bench headed by Justice Rohinton Nariman asked the Rajasthan Government and the CBI to respond to the petition filed by Neetu Kumar Nagaich —  mother of the deceased —  seeking transfer of the investigation from the state police to the central agency.Following a 2019 order of the Rajasthan High Court, the case is being probed by a Special Investigation team (SIT) of the state police.Asking the state police to file a status report on the investigation done by them so far, the Bench posted the matter for further hearing in July. His mother contended before the top court that she had an “inescapable reasonable apprehension” that the lackadaisical and negligent investigation case was a result of “probable collusion” to shield some high, mighty and influential person/s. Even the FIR in the case was registered only after 10 months and there was hardly any progress made in the probe and there had been no efforts on the part of the police to arrest the culprits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-rajasthan-govt-on-plea-for-cbi-probe-into-nlu-students-death-96264
08-06-2020||Lucknow||Priyanka Gandhi equates UP teachers’ appointment matter with Vyapam scam||Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday termed the matter relating to appointment of 69,000 teachers in UP’s Basic Education department as the state’s “Vyapam scam”.The Congress leader also said that if the government does not give justice to hard-working youth in this matter, they would resort to an agitation.The Allahabad High Court on Wednesday stayed the appointment of 69,000 assistant basic teachers in the state, holding that there has been an ‘error’ in the evaluation of question paper“The facts of anomalies in this matter are not normal. Involvement of racket, names of students in diaries, transaction of money, anomalies in examination centres points that its links are vast,” she said in a series of tweets.“Recruitment of 69,000 teachers is UP’s Vyapam scam,” she said.The Vyapam scam refers to irregularities in exams held by the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board, also called Vyavasayik Pareeksha Mandal or Vyapam, for admission in professional courses and state services.The Congress leader said, “Injustice should not be meted to hard-working youth. If government cannot give justice, its reply will be given with agitation”.The Lucknow bench of Justice Alok Mathur on June 3 had stayed the selection process, prima facie finding that certain questions and answers were ‘ambiguous and wrong’ and, hence, it required fresh scrutiny by the UGC.The HC bench had held that there has been an ‘error’ in the evaluation of question paper.The recruitment examination was held on January 6, 2019, and its result was declared on May 12 this year. Earlier, the Supreme Court on May 21 had asked the state government to explain the process adopted for the appointment through a chart, posting the matter for further hearing on July 6.It asked the Uttar Pradesh government to explain why it changed the earlier criteria of 45 per cent cut-off marks for the general category and 40 per cent for the reserved category.The UP government has challenged the high court order.

08-06-2020||Beijing||Ladakh stand-off: Need to implement consensus reached between leaders of both countries, says China||China on Monday said the latest military-level talks with India to resolve the border standoff underlined the need for both sides to implement the consensus reached between the leadership of the two countries and make sure that “differences” do not escalate into “disputes”.The remarks of China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying came two days after a marathon military dialogue between India and China was held to peacefully resolve the current border standoff in accordance with bilateral agreements.She said that on June 6 afternoon, a meeting was held between the commanders of China and India in Chusul Moldo region and the two sides held consultations.“Recently, diplomatic and military channels of the two sides have maintained close communications on the situation along the border.“One consensus is that the two sides need to implement the two leaders’ consensus and make sure that differences do not escalate into disputes,” Hua said, apparently referring to the directions of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi after their two informal summits, asking the militaries of the two countries to take more confidence building measures to maintain peace and tranquillity along the borders.The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson further said that the “two sides will work to maintain peace and tranquillity along the border and create a good atmosphere”.“So the situation overall is stable and controllable and the two sides are ready to engage in consultation to properly solve the relevant issues,” she added.Her remarks came a day after the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in New Delhi said that India and China have agreed to continue military and diplomatic talks to “peacefully” resolve the current border standoff in accordance with bilateral agreements.The Indian delegation led by Lt General Harinder Singh, the general officer commanding of Leh-based 14 Corps, and Commander of the Tibet Military District Maj Gen Liu Lin held the extensive meeting in Maldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh on Saturday that began at around 11:30 am and went on till evening.The high-level military dialogue could not produce any tangible results in ending the confrontation in eastern Ladakh, and India was ready for a long-haul in sensitive areas like Pangong Tso and Galwan Valley, people familiar with the development said in New Delhi.In a statement, the MEA said the meeting took place in a “cordial and positive atmosphere” and that both sides agreed that an “early resolution” of the issue would contribute to the further development of the relationship between the two countries.After the standoff began early last month, the Indian military leadership decided that Indian troops will adopt a firm approach in dealing with the aggressive posturing by the Chinese troops in all disputed areas of Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie.The trigger for the face-off was China’s stiff opposition to India laying a key road in the Finger area around the Pangong Tso Lake besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.

08-06-2020||Satya Prakash||SC refuses to entertain PIL against use of Hindi as official language in subordinate courts of Haryana||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 8The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a petition challenging the Haryana Government's decision to enforce use of Hindi language in all subordinate courts and tribunals across the state."There is nothing wrong in Hindi as the official language of subordinate courts in some states...80% of people don't understand court proceedings in English," a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said while asking the petitioners to approach the Punjab and Haryana High Court. During the British rule, for recording of evidence the language used in subordinate courts was vernacular language, the CJI said, adding that Hindi was being used even in Madhya Pradesh where he served as Chief Justice of the High Court.Petitioner Sameer Jain contended, "We practise in courts of Delhi NCR and making Hindi mandatory will make it difficult for us to argue cases." Jain said he was not against Hindi but making it mandatory would make things difficult for lawyers who argued their cases in English."Show us the clause that excludes English, the CJI said, clarifying that English can be used with the permission of the court.Initially, the top court was ready to issue notice to the state government on the petition. However, it changed its mind and asked the petitioners to go to the high court after Haryana Additional Advocate General Arun Bhardwaj pointed out that the law under challenge was a state law and it would be better if the Punjab and Haryana High Court dealt with it.According to the Haryana Official Language (Amendment) Act, 2020, "In all Civil Courts and Criminal Courts in Haryana subordinate to the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, all revenue Courts and Rent Tribunals or any other court or tribunal constituted by the State Government, work shall be done in Hindi language."Notified last month, the amendment says the State Government shall provide the requisite infrastructure and training of staff within six months for the commencement of the amended Act.Five lawyers have challenged the validity of the Haryana Official Language (Amendment) Act, 2020, terming it  "arbitrary" on the ground that it created an unreasonable classification between Hindi and non-Hindi speaking advocates. Petitioners, including advocate Sameer Jain, urged the court to strike down the amendment.They contended that the amendment was with the assumption that everyone practising law in Haryana not only knew Hindi but was also fluent in it. To say that imposition of Hindi was for people of the state and necessary to get justice was "wholly irrational," they added. They said the level of fluency and expertise needed to argue a matter in Hindi was much higher than just a simple understanding of the language."English is a widely spoken language in our country and precluding its use before various Subordinate Courts is manifestly arbitrary with no legal rationale and having far-reaching consequences for the people living and working in the State of Haryana," they said.Contending that the amendment precluded the use of English which was used widely to conduct legal proceedings, the petitioners said, "This has impinged upon the right to freely practise the legal profession and earn a livelihood as guaranteed under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution."They said imposition of Hindi was not fit for the state as it was an industrial hub and home to multi-national companies, where people from every strata of society resided and majority of them were not fluent in Hindi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-pil-against-use-of-hindi-as-official-language-in-subordinate-courts-of-haryana-96251
08-06-2020||Vijay Mohan||In a first, no parents at IMA passing out parade; event to be telecast live||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 8One of the most cherished moments in a military officer’s life is the passing out parade (POP) from their training academy when they take the ‘antim pag’ or the final step from being cadets to becoming combat leaders. This summer, however, the POP at the Indian Military Academy (IMA), traditionally a grand and elaborate affair, would be a watered down event due to restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Parents, siblings and friends of the cadets passing out would not be present. The event has as much significance and pride for parents and siblings as for the cadets themselves. Traditionally, it is the parents, brothers or sisters who ‘pip’ the cadets — which is the pinning of the two stars of a Lieutenant on each shoulder — to formally make them commissioned officers."This time the piping will be done by instructors, officers and their wives," said Lt Col Amit Dagar, IMA's public relations officer. "Following the Corona outbreak, we had modified our training schedules to ensure that the safety protocols issued by the government are implemented. During the POP, cadets will wear face masks and march with increased distance between them," he added.To compensate, the Army has made elaborate arrangements for a live telecast of the event on some TV channels and also on social media in the same manner as is being done for the Republic Day Parade and the Army Day Parade. Special accounts have been opened on popular social media platforms and these are being widely circulated.The POP for the spring term is scheduled to be held at Dehradun on June 13 and the Chief of the Army Staff, General Manoj Mukund Naravane, is expected to be the reviewing officer, sources said. Special precautionary measures are being undertaken in view of the prevailing coronavirus situation.Last month, the POP at the National Defence Academy, Kharakvalsa, was also a toned-down affair, with no parade being held. Instead, an indoor ceremony in the academy’s auditorium was conducted. Similarly, the graduation ceremony held last week at the Army Cadet College, attached to the IMA, where jawans selected to become officers are trained for three years, was also a low key affair.The IMA holds two POPs each year, the other being in December. The event is seeped in military tradition and elan and proceeds with clockwork precision. Several events precede the POP such as the Commandant’s dinner, prize distribution and cultural programmes. The final day begins with paying tributes at the IMA war memorial and then falling in at the spruced up parade ground in front of the historic Chetwood Hall under the watchfull eyes of the Academy Adjutant mounted on a horse. The Academy Colours are brought on parade.The reviewing officer then arrives, usually in a horse drawn carriage, and is received by the IMA Commandant and escorted to the saluting dias. Reviewing officers in the past have included presidents, prime ministers, defence ministers and service chiefs. After presenting the sword of honour and reviewing the parade, the reviewing officer addresses the gathering. Helicopters shower petals on the parade ground and there may also be a fly-past to mark the event. Cadets then march off the parade ground into the Chetwood Hall, taking the final step.Next is the pipping ceremony in the lawns across the main road from the Chetwood Hall. Foreign cadets, whose relations may not have made it here, are pipped by Indian officers. Finally comes the oath taking ceremony where the Tricolour is brought on parade and the newly commissioned officers swear their allegiance to the Constitution.The IMA was established in 1932 and imparts pre-commission training to officers. It takes in cadets from the NDA, who undergo 12 months training, as well as direct entry graduates who undergo 18 months training. It has trained about 65,000 officers so far, including about 3,000 from 30 friendly foreign countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-a-first-no-parents-at-ima-passing-out-parade-event-to-be-telecast-live-96247

We ask our staff to keep a watch and note down the number of lions in their beat. This is routine work. This is like a standard operating procedure which we follow every full moon night,” Gujarat Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Shyamal Tikadar told PTI.He refused to share findings of the exercise, which sources said involved 300-odd beat guards as well as sarpanchs of villages surrounding the Gir sanctuary.D T Vasavada, chief conservator of forest, Junagadh Range, of which Gir forest is a part, said the estimation exercise was completed by Saturday.He, however, said the release of its findings was a policy decision to be taken by the state government.Vasavada also said that a full-fledged lion census could not be done this year due to the lockdown.“The lion census, done once every five years, is carried out in an extensive manner, with the participation of members of the National Board of Wildlife, large number of central and state government employees, wildlife lovers and NGOs. But, due to the lockdown we cannot call them and a full-fledged census cannot be carried out now,” he said.Summer is the ideal time for lion census as after that, the monsoon season is the mating time of felines for which the sanctuary is closed for four months. Winter season is also not a good time for census, another official said.Asked when the census will be conducted, Vasavada said it cannot be held this year and has been postponed.“Now, it is up to the government to fix the next date for census, he said.Wildlife lovers and activists have been waiting for the census as some two dozen lions died in the last three months due to babesiosis, a malaria-like disease caused by the parasite babesia.Earlier, nearly 40 lions died in Gir in October-November 2018 after getting infected by the canine distemper virus, officials said.

The two planes are likely to be delivered by September," the officials said on Monday.The two B777 aircraft will be operated by pilots of the Indian Air Force and not of Air India.However, the new wide-body planes will be maintained by the Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL), which is a subsidiary of the Indian national carrier, the officials said.Currently, the prime minister, the president and the vice president fly on Air India's B747 planes, which have the call sign 'Air India One'.Air India pilots fly these B747 aircraft for the dignitaries and the AIESL maintains them.When these B747 aircraft are not flying the dignitaries, they are used by the Indian national carrier for commercial operations.The new planes will be used for travel of the dignitaries only. These two aircraft were part of Air India's commercial fleet for a few months in 2018 before they were sent back to Boeing for retrofitting them for VVIP travel.The B777 planes will have state-of-the-art missile defence systems called Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) and Self-Protection Suites (SPS).In February, the US agreed to sell the two defence systems to India at a cost of USD 190 million.The Centre has already initiated the process of divestment of its stake in Air India, which has a debt of over Rs 60,000 crore. However, the process has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Air India and Boeing did not respond to the queries sent by the PTI on this matter.

It died in the Velliyar river a week later on May 27.In a series of tweets, the ministry has said that one person has been arrested in the matter.“Primary investigations revealed the elephant may have accidentally consumed such a fruit. The ministry is in constant touch with Kerala government and has sent them detailed advisory for immediate arrest of culprits and stringent action against any erring official that led to the elephant's death," the ministry said.“As of now, one person has been arrested & efforts are on to nab more individuals who may have participated in this illegal & utterly inhuman act.

08-06-2020||New Delhi||Health Ministry drafts rules to help Covid-19 patients access new drugs||Seeking to facilitate availability of experimental drugs for severely-ill COVID-19 patients, the Union Health Ministry has issued a draft notification for "compassionate use" of any unapproved drug that is in the phase-III clinical trial globally.The draft New Drugs and Clinical Trials (Amendment) Rules stipulate manufacture and import of unapproved drugs based on a prescription by a hospital or medical institution.According to a gazette notification of the draft rules published on June 5, a hospital or medical institution may import new drug for "compassionate use for treatment of patients suffering from life-threatening disease or disease causing serious permanent disability or disease requiring therapy for unmet medical need”, which has not been permitted in the country, but under Phase-III clinical trial (human trial) in the country or abroad, by making an application to the Central Drug Regulator.Also, if any hospital prescribes a new drug for the same purposes then they may be approved to be manufactured in a limited quantity subject to provisions of the rules.The manufacturer intending to manufacture a new drug will have to obtain the consent in writing from the patient to whom the medicine has been prescribed or his legal heirs and make an application to the Ethics Committee of the hospital or medical institution for obtaining its specific recommendation for manufacture of such new drug.After obtaining the recommendation of the Ethics Committee, the manufacturer shall make an application to obtain the permission, to the Central Licensing Authority for manufacturing the new drug for the purpose of compassionate use, the draft rules stated."The manufacturer to whom the permission is granted shall make use of the new drug only for the purposes specified in the permission and no part of it shall be sold in the market or supplied to any other person, agency, institution or place," it stated.The new draft rules will be applicable for 15 days during which people can send their objections and suggestions to be considered by the Central Government after which the final amended rules will be published in the gazette of India.The set of new rules have been inserted under Section 96 which deals with filing an application, granting the licence to the importer or manufacturer, conditions and suspension of such licences among others.For both manufacturing and importing, the licence shall remain valid for a period of one year from the date it has been issued.If an importer or the manufacturer to whom the licence is granted fails to comply with any provision of the Act and these rules, the Central Licensing Authority, may, after giving an opportunity of being heard, suspend or cancel the licence for such period as considered appropriate either wholly or in respect of some of the substances to which the violation relates.The quantity of any new drug manufactured or imported on the basis of permission granted shall not exceed one hundred average dosages per patient, the draft rules stated.But in exceptional circumstances on the basis of the prescription of the medical officer and the recommendation of the Ethics Committee, the Central Licensing Authority may allow the manufacture of such new drug in larger quantity.In both cases, for import or indigenous manufacturing, the application should have details, including rationale for the use of the new drug as compassionate use over the available therapeutic options, the criteria for patient selection with description of the patient's disease or condition and the method of administration of the drug, dose and duration of therapy.It should also mention the description of the manufacturing facility and a description of clinical procedures, laboratory tests, or other monitoring necessary to evaluate the effects of the drug and minimize its risks among others.Several drugs across the country are in phase III clinical trials phase for COVID-19. Anti-viral drug Remdesivir, last week, was approved for "restricted emergency use" on severe COVID-19 patients.India's drug regulator granted US pharma giant Gilead Sciences marketing authorisation for the drug for "restricted emergency use" on hospitalised COVID-19 in view of the crisis posed by the pandemic.

08-06-2020||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel price hiked by 60 paisa per litre for second straight day||Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 60 paisa per litre on Monday, for the second day in a row, as state-owned oil firms reverted to daily price revisions after a 83-day hiatus.Petrol price in Delhi was hiked to Rs 72.46 per litre from Rs 71.86 on Sunday, while diesel rates were increased to Rs 70.59 a litre from Rs 69.99, according to a price notification of state oil marketing companies.This is the second daily increase in rates in a row. Oil companies had on Sunday raised prices by 60 paisa per litre on both petrol and diesel after ending a 83-day hiatus in daily rate revision.Daily price revision has restarted, an oil company official said.While oil PSUs have regularly revised ATF and LPG prices, they had since March 16 kept petrol and diesel prices on hold, ostensibly on account of extreme volatility in the international oil markets.Auto fuel prices were frozen soon after the government raised excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 3 per litre each to mop up gains arising from falling international rates.The government on May 6 again raised excise duties by Rs 10 per litre on petrol and Rs 13 per litre on diesel.Oil companies, instead of passing on the excise hike to consumers, decided to adjust them against the reduction required because of the drop in international oil prices. They used the same tool and did not pass on the Re 1 per litre hike required for switching over to ultra-clean BS-VI grade fuel from April 1.

08-06-2020|| Jodhpur ||After 3 Gujarat Congress MLAs join BJP, 24 others shifted to Sirohi resort||The Congress party on Sunday lodged over two dozens of its MLAs from Gujarat in a resort in Sirohi near here, fearing poaching by the BJP ahead of the election for four Rajya Sabha seats from the state.The step was taken two days after three Gujarat Congress MLAs switched over to the BJP. The party MLAs have been lodged in Wild Winds resorts at Sirohi on Gujrat-Rajasthan border near Ambaji in a bid to insulate party's interest ahead of the polls for the Upper House seats, said a Congress leader.Accusing the BJP of engaging in “unethical practices”, Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda said the MLAS have assembled at the resort to discuss and fix the party's strategy ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections and ensure the victory of party's candidates.  “It is surprising that despite a country-wide pandemic crisis, the BJP has resorted to unethical tactics like intimidating, buying and influencing public representatives in Gujarat. So, we brought our party representatives here to discuss future plans,” said Chavda.  Chavda did not say for how long the legislators would stay in the resort at Sirohi. He said the party chose the location near the border to make their stay “logistically convenient”.  MLAs from Gujrat had begun arriving at the resort on Saturday night and continued to reach here till late Sunday night. Sources said around two dozen MLAs have so far been brought to the resort from Gujrat. The BJP's Sirohi unit, meanwhile, has lodged a complaint with the police against the resort's owner accusing him of violating the anti-COVID guidelines.  BJP's Sirohi unit chief Narayan Purohit said the state government has kept these MLAs in the resort in violation of the protocol, laid out amid the COVID- 19 pandemic and accused the government for misusing power for political gains.

He said issues, which no one dared to touch in 70 years, had been resolved.Calling it the first virtual rally in the history of the Indian politics, he said its purpose was to bring together the people of the country fighting against the Covid-19 crisis.Taking a jibe at the RJD which earlier in the day observed Garib Adhikar Diwas by beating utensils in protest against his rally, he asked who had stopped them from holding virtual rallies? “The Centre brought 1.25 crore migrants home during the lockdown,” he said.Shah also thanked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi for taking steps to battle Covid-19.Meanwhile, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) termed the rally insensitive. “It mocks the worker, poor and farmer and makes fun of 12 crore people of Bihar,” it stated.The rally marks the beginning of the BJP’s poll campaign in Bihar, where elections are due later this year.The BJP has received criticism over sufferings of migrants following the PM’s three-hour notice for a countrywide lockdown.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-get-two-thirds-majority-in-bihar-assembly-poll-shah-96035

In fact, there was only verbal permission from then Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major.AK Antony, Former Defence MinisterI am a former Defence Minister. I have some responsibility. I will not comment.“The government reacted by asking why did you do it? I answered it was my responsibility as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Air Command, to ensure logistics to the Army and paramilitary in all areas of north, including Ladakh, as there were no roads and only air route was viable for supplies,” said Air Marshal Barbora (retd), who is based in Gurugram now. Currently, Indian and Chinese forces are in a standoff in Ladakh, including area closer to the DBO.“Antony was to go to China with earthquake relief material a few days after the landing at the DBO. The Chinese didn’t question him about it. You have got to be right firstly and if you are right, no one says you are wrong. It was within our country. Why should Chinese question it?” he asked.When contacted, Antony said, “I am a former Defence Minister. I have some responsibility.

On the other hand during the pandemic, India held premier-level talks with Australia and a face-to-face Army commanders’ meeting on the Ladakh border with China.Nepal had a few weeks back taken umbrage at India suggesting that talks to sort out their differences be held after the battle against Covid is won.At that time, many in Nepal Parliament and outside had wanted to know that if Defence Minister Rajnath Singh could inaugurate a road via Kalapani during a raging epidemic, there should not be any problems with holding talks as well.After the India-China border meeting, ruling Nepal Communist Party’s Central Committee member Bishnu Rijal noted that the military commanders discussed the border dispute. On June 4, Indian and Australian PMs held a virtual summit and signed seven agreements. “But, India is extending the condition of the end of Covid and creating the right atmosphere for talks with Nepal,” he observed.The constitutional amendment, once passed, will be difficult to reverse as it will have the backing of two-thirds of Parliament. At the moment the proposal has the backing of both main parties, the Nepali Congress and Nepal Communist Party. India has worked the backchannels to avoid such an eventuality and sources had earlier said some formulas were aired in informal contacts with the Nepal leadership.The amendment proposal to include a new political map showing Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura within Nepal was tabled in Nepal’s House of Representatives on May 31.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-takes-umbrage-at-india-china-talks-96037

It tried to take over a ridge in Bhutan in 2017, but the Indian Army resisted and the PLA withdrew.India at the meeting yesterday showed maps and previous claim and holding positions along the LAC to the PLA. An appreciation of the same will be done at Beijing.PLA is not deployed along the LAC, but they can change tactics. Winter, starting from early October, can be harsh but that will not be a hindrance if PLA wants to stay on, is the assessment on the Indian side.Annually, some 500 face-offs occur along the LAC which is not demarcated on ground. The troops, return on encountering each other in disputed areas.The 2020 stand off, is the biggest since  the 1967 stand off at Nathu La in Sikkim which resulted in 3-4 day skirmish.  The ‘History of the Conflict with China. 1962’,  released for ‘restricted’ circulation by the MoD in March 1993, records the event and says “They (China) had lost 400 men killed or wounded as compared to Indian loss of 65 killed and 145 wounded.”  In 1975 four men of Assam rifles were killed when they accidentally crossed the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biggest-impasse-in-53-yrs-but-resolution-might-be-in-sight-96019
