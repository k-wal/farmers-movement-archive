10-06-2020||Beijing/New Delhi||China, India taking steps to ‘ease’ situation along borders: Chinese official||China said on Wednesday that Indian and Chinese troops have started implementing the "positive consensus" reached by the senior military officials of the two countries on June 6 aimed at "easing" the situation along the borders.The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson's remarks came a day after officials in New Delhi suggested that armies of India and China have undertaken a "limited disengagement" in few areas in eastern Ladakh in a demonstration of their intent to end the border standoff peacefully ahead of another round of military talks on Wednesday.Asked about the reports of the troops on both sides disengaging and moving back to their previous positions, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing in Beijing that both sides were taking steps to ease the situation along the borders."Recently the diplomatic and military channels of China and India held effective communication on the situation along the border and reached positive consensus," she said."The two sides are following this consensus to take actions to ease the situation along the borders,” the spokesperson said.However, the spokesperson did not specifically give details about the disengagement or withdrawal of border troops of the two countries.Meanwhile, in New Delhi, people familiar with the Major General-level talks held on Wednesday said that during the meeting, the Indian delegation pressed for the restoration of the status quo ante and immediate withdrawal of a sizeable number of Chinese troops from all the standoff points.The dialogue that lasted for over four-and-a-half hours took place in a "positive atmosphere" with an aim to further ease tension between the two sides, they said.The talks came a day after the two armies began a limited disengagement in a few areas in Galwan Valley and Hot Spring.However, both sides remained engaged in aggressive posturing in areas such as Pangong Tso, Daulat Beg Oldie and Demchok.Military sources on Tuesday said the two armies began "disengagement" around patrolling points 14 and 15 in Galwan Valley and another in the Hot Spring area, adding the Chinese side had even moved back up to 1.5 km in the two areas.Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged since May 5 following a violent clash in Pangong Tso.In their first serious efforts to end the row, Lt General Harinder Singh, the General Officer Commanding of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Commander of the Tibet Military District Maj Gen Liu Lin held an extensive meeting on June 6.Last Saturday's talks came a day after the two countries held diplomatic parleys during which both sides agreed to handle their "differences" through peaceful discussions while respecting each other's sensitivities and concerns.India's External Affairs Ministry on Sunday said the Lieutenant General-level talks took place in a "cordial and positive atmosphere" and that both sides agreed that an "early resolution" of the issue would contribute to the further development of the relationship between the two countries.The trigger for the face-off was China's stiff opposition to India laying a key road in the Finger area around the Pangong Tso Lake besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.The road in the Finger area in Pangong Tso is considered crucial for India to carry out patrol. India has already decided not to stall any border infrastructure projects in eastern Ladakh in view of the Chinese protests.The situation in the area deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC). China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.In their historic informal summit in Chinese city of Wuhan in 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping underscored the importance of maintaining peace and tranquillity in all areas of the India-China border region in the interest of the development of bilateral relations.The summit had taken place months after a 73-day military face-off between the two armies in Doklam that raised fears of a war between the two Asian giants.In their talks on June 6, both sides agreed to follow the broad decisions taken by Modi and Xi in the Wuhan summit to ensure peace and tranquillity along the LAC.

Various modalities were finalised and after completing all the legal formalities these consignments have now been brought back to India," it said, adding they will be formally seized under the PMLA.This is the second such action on this case as ED had earlier brought back 33 consignments of valuables from Dubai and Hong Kong. They were valued at Rs 137 crore then, the ED said.On June 8, a special PMLA court in Mumbai had allowed confiscation of the attached assets of Nirav Modi, the key accused in this case, under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act (FEOA).This was the first such order in the country after the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act was passed two years ago.Nirav Modi (49), currently lodged in a UK jail, was declared a fugitive economic offender in December by the Mumbai court. He was arrested in London in March 2019 and is presently fighting extradition to India.His uncle Mehul Choksi has been evading the law since the probe into this case began and was last stated to be living in Antigua and Barbuda from where the Indian government is seeking his extradition, the probe agencies have said.

The petition in high court stated that on March 11, Dua on his YouTube show had spoken about riots that started from February 23 in North East Delhi and the contents of the show were like other national and international news, which highlighted the mishandling of the riots by the police authorities and the Central Government.“Ironically, all persons who, according to this court in its order dated February 26, should have been punished, have remained unpunished and are completely free from any charges regarding communal hatred. However, the Petitioner who is a Padma Shri and one of the most reputed journalists, is being imputed with the offences of communal hatred, fake news and inciting violence for stating factually verified news regarding the North East Delhi riots,” it said.The journalist Vinod Dua has blatantly lied or has misinformed his viewers about the series of events. There are also a series of old instances where bizarre and unfounded allegations have been made against the government, police and political leaders. The reporting’s full of false content misleading context...(sic)” Kumar has said in his complaint.A case has been registered under IPC sections 290 (punishment for public nuisance in cases not otherwise provided for) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes), police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-court-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-journalist-vinod-dua-in-defamation-case-97290

I want to know the reasons why Mumbai Police want to stop me from doing my programme," Goswami said.On Tuesday, the Bombay High Court refused to exempt Goswami from appearing before the city police.Two First Information Reports (FIRs) have been registered against Goswami in Nagpur and Mumbai for allegedly making provocative comments against the Muslim community during a show on the gathering of migrant workers outside the Bandra railway terminus during the countrywide lockdown.One of the complainants in the case, Irfan Abubakar Shaikh, secretary, Raza Education Welfare Society alleged that Goswami had targetted the mosque outside Bandra railway station even though it had no links to the migrant workers who were protesting to be sent home by train.Shaikh had alleged that Goswami intended to blame the Muslim community for the spread of the Covid-19 virus in Mumbai.The FIR has been registered under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, and language), 295A (deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any citizen) 500 (defamation), 505 (2) (spreading rumour or alarming news with intent to create or promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities), and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arnab-goswami-appears-for-questioning-hits-out-at-mumbai-police-97287
10-06-2020||Botad (Gujarat)||RS polls: Gujarat Congress shifts 17 MLAs from Rajkot resort to Botad||Ahead of the June 19 Rajya  Sabha polls in Gujarat, the opposition Congress on Wednesday shifted 17 of its MLAs from a resort in Rajkot to a farmhouse near Gadhada town of Botad district, a party leader said.Fearing poaching, the party had shifted its legislators to various resorts in Gujarat in the one last week, dividing them in zone-wise groups. While some MLAs gathered in Rajkot in Saurashtra, few others were in Abu Road in Rajasthan.“After meeting local leaders in Gadhada, the MLAs will proceed to Dhari town in Amreli district,” Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani, who is also among these 17 MLAs from Saurashtra region, said.Both Gadhada and Dhari Assembly seats are empty at present after Congress’s Pravin Maru and J V Kakadiya resigned as legislators soon after the Rajya Sabha polls were announced for the first time in March.“When people were fighting the coronavirus pandemic, elected representative of Botad deserted its people either due to pressure or for some financial gains. Thus, we have decided to meet the people of this leaderless region and understand their problems. People will not forgive those who had disrespected the mandate,” Dhanani said.Congress’s Tankara MLA Lalit Kagathara said, “Since Dhari legislator, too, had resigned in March, the sitting (Congress) MLAs will also visit that region to make people understand the game and teach a lesson to them (MLAs who have resigned) in the by-election.”“From Botad, the MLAs will go to Dhari as part of our exercise to make people of that area understand how they were betrayed, both by the MLA and the ruling BJP,” said Kagathara.To save its MLAs from “poaching”, the party had divided its legislators as per zones and shifted them in different resorts across the state in the last one week.As per the earlier schedule, election for four Rajya Sabha seats was supposed to be held on March 26. However, it was eventually postponed for an indefinite period in the wake of coronavirus pandemic and subsequent imposition of the nation-wide lockdown.Till now, eight Congress MLAs have resigned, bringing their strength in the Assembly to 65, a number not enough to win two Rajya Sabha seats on which they the party have fielded its two candidates.In March, when Rajya Sabha polls were first announced, five opposition MLAs, including Maru and Kakadiya had resigned.The three more had resigned this month after fresh dates were announced.The Rajya Sabha election for four seats in Gujarat has now been scheduled on June 19.While the Congress has fielded Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki, BJP has fielded Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramilaben Bara and Narhari Amin.In the 182-member Assembly, BJP has 103 MLAs and the opposition Congress now stands at 65.While the Bharatiya Tribal Party has two MLAs, Nationalist Congress Party has one legislator.One MLA, Jignesh Mevani, is Independent, while 10 seats are vacant, two due to court cases and eight others due to the resignations.The effective strength of the House is 172 at the moment.

They took off from Mumbai for Allahabad, Gorakhpur and Varanasi on Wednesday morning with 180 passengers in each, the sources said.Two more flights with the workers will take off on Thursday.Yadav, on Bachchan's behalf, had also recently flagged off 10 buses for 300 migrants to reach their villages in Lucknow, Allahabad, Bhadohi and other places in Uttar Pradesh. This was done in partnership with the dargahs in Mahim and the Haji Ali, a statement said.Earlier in the week, actor Sonu Sood arranged a special flight to send 180 Assamese migrants home. Last month, he helped 177 workers stuck in Kerala to fly home to Odisha.Sood, who has also arranged for buses to ferry the workers and their families back home, told PTI that he has helped 18,000-20,000 workers to go back to their homes in states such as Odisha, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand.The lockdown, which began on March 25, left lakhs of migrants stranded in different parts of the country. With no money and no work, many walked, cycled or hitchhiked their way to villages hundreds, sometimes thousands, of kilometres away.

But the patient did not follow the instructions and collapsed as soon as he got up from the bed and died.Dr Vikas Reddy, who was attacked, said despite warning the patient not to remove the oxygen mask, he removed it to go to the washroom and collapsed on the way.Just as the doctors rushed and found the patient to be dead, the attendant accusing the doctors of negligence attacked the attending physician with a stool lying nearby.Immediately, the junior doctors launched a protest and said they would not attend to the patients. They went out and collected to stage a protest.Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) – Gandhi Hospital unit president Dr Lohit Reddy said the 55-year-old patient was admitted to the Acute Medical Care (AMC) ward, where the attack on the doctor took place.Around 300 junior doctors boycotted duties, making it difficult for the authorities to handle the patients at the largest COVID care centre in the state.The Telangana Junior Doctors Association has decided not to attend COVID-19 duties until the issue of their safety is addressed by Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, who is known to withstand any ultimatums and pressure, genuine or otherwise.The doctors from the Gandhi Hospital blocked the main road and staged a protest against the attack on some of them.Apart from general wards, the junior doctors attend to patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU).House surgeons (MBBS interns) and Post Graduate medical students come under the umbrella term “junior doctors”. The strike thus has affected work in the entire hospital.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/attacked-junior-doctors-at-hyderabads-main-covid-hospital-strike-work-97282

10-06-2020||New Delhi||Lockdown realities hit home as Iconic Delhi bookstore-cafe closes||Long hours browsing through books and tranquil afternoons of catching up with friends, and sometimes me-time, over hot coffee or cold gazpacho at the Full Circle and Café Turtle in Delhi's Khan Market are over – perhaps forever.The shutters on the bookshop and café, high above the hubbub of the Central Delhi market, came down with the lockdown beginning March 25 and will not go up as the city begins to relax restrictions, the owner of the 20-year-old store announced this week.Priyanka Malhotra, director of the store, said the nationwide lockdown hit the business hard."The flagship store of Full Circle and Café Turtle in Delhi's famous Khan Market has finally decided to pull down its shutters, after having made a loving home there for over 20 years. It was a particularly difficult decision for us to make, since running the bookshop was not mere business for my family, but a way of living,” Malhotra said in an online article on Scroll.in.Khan Market, a hub of eateries, bars and shops, is listed as one of the most expensive retail locations in the world. And failed negotiations with their landlord to waive or reduce rents led to closing down of the business.The Full Circle and Café Turtle will be coming up again soon in Mehar Chand Market and two other branches in Greater Kailash and Nizamuddin will continue to operate. But it will not be the same. The Khan Market branch, the first, was a special place, many Delhi residents said. The well-designed bookshop and the narrow wooden staircase that led to the Cafe Turtle painted in forest green and bright yellow offered visitors an old-world charm all its own.For many Delhiites, the news of a very personal piece of life in Delhi receding into a pre-corona past came as something of a shock. There was also the realisation that this might be just the beginning of more profound changes.It is the end of an era, said Nikita Awasthi, an accountant by profession.She remembers leisurely afternoons spent sitting quietly in a corner on the wooden floor, reading one of the thousands of books in the store."No trip to Khan Market was complete without at least one visit there. It was always lovely to visit Full Circle and Cafe Turtle and this is almost like the end of an era. I remember this one time my dad was stuck in a meeting so I sat reading there for six hours. There was an aura of tranquillity about that space,” the 26-year-old told PTI.Tanyaa Raturi, another frequent visitor, said it was one of the few places where you could sit and read, reminiscent of her visits to a store in Dehradun.“I haven't found many bookstores in Delhi that have that… As a child I used to visit Barista in Dehradun which had a bookstore as well and that concept was fascinating.“Also, it felt like a place where you could sit for hours talking or just reading, with no one to disturb. There wasn't loud noisy music playing as well,” Raturi, a 29-year-old kindergarten teacher, said.

10-06-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Parents move SC against CBSE’s decision to hold pending Class 12 exams in July||Worried about community spread of COVID19, four parents of Class 12 students have moved the Supreme Court against the Central Board of Secondary Education’s decision to hold examinations of remaining papers between July 1 and 15.Petitioners Col. Amit Bathla, Poonam Singla, Charu Singh and Sunitha—whose children happen to be Class 12 students—have challenged the May 18 CBSE notification that announced a fresh schedule for holding examinations for remaining papers.They urged the court to direct CBSE to declare this year’s Class 12 results “on the basis of examination already conducted and to calculate it on an average basis with the internal assessment marks of the remaining subject”.Highlighting the rise in COVID-19 cases in India, the petitioners said the pandemic would be at its peak in India and it would not be safe for students to assemble at examination centres in large numbers.They sought to highlight that Delhi University has cancelled its first year and second year undergraduate examinations due to COVID19 times. Even IITs have cancelled their examinations, including those of final year students, on account of the pandemic, they submitted. Some states have also cancelled all University examinations, they added.“Ensuring proper cleanliness and safety standards as prescribed by the concerned Government in COVID-19 situation in those 15,000 exam centres spreading over length and breadth of the country including rural sectors would not only be risking health and life of children but also would be an exercise in futility and an eyewash,” the petition filed through advocate Rishi Malhotra read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-parents-move-sc-against-cbses-decision-to-hold-pending-class-12-exams-in-july-97268

10-06-2020||New Delhi||Law student moves SC, seeks law to compensate, rehabilitate victims of wrongful prosecution||A final year law student of New Law College, Pune on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court seeking a law to compensate and rehabilitate accused acquitted after languishing in jails for years on account of wrongful prosecution.“The sole purpose of this petition is to compensate and rehabilitate those persons who are the victims of the legal system,” petitioner Yash Giri, who hails from Noida, submitted.To buttress his point, he cited National Crime Relations Bureau data which showed that there were more undertrial prisoners than convicts in jails. He also sought to highlight the fact that the conviction rate in India was merely 48% and more than 50% accused were acquitted.Contending that there was no perpetual statute to decide the theory of compensation to be applied in the case a person was wrongfully prosecuted or incarcerated, Giri requested the top court to direct the government to implement the Law Commission’s 277th report which suggested legal remedies for wrongful prosecution.  He urged the court to interpret Section 2(wa) of the Criminal Procedure Code which defines the expression “Victim”, and Section 357-A of the Code under which in coordination with the Centre, a state government prepares a scheme for providing compensation to the victim or his/her dependents who have suffered loss or injury as a result of the crime.  “In the case, if the accused is acquitted after spending many years behind bars naturally makes him the victim of the system, thus the compensation and rehabilitation should be awarded to the acquitted person who has suffered as a result of the crime.“This happens when the person is wrongfully prosecuted and the delay in the legal system leads to the accused languishing in jail, thus the same is violative of the basic spirit of Article 21 of Constitution (right to life and liberty),” the petitioner said.Some amount of compensation or rehabilitation scheme would help such a victim to gain back his/her reputation and build a fruitful life again with dignity, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/law-student-moves-sc-seeks-law-to-compensate-rehabilitate-victims-of-wrongful-prosecution-97264

10-06-2020||Dibrugarh/Guwahati||2 OIL firemen found dead near blazing well in Assam; PM assures help||Two firefighters of public sector major OIL were found dead in a wetland abutting the site of a major blaze at its Baghjan well, which has been "uncontrollably" spewing gas for the past 15 days in Assam's Tinsukia district, officials said on Wednesday.Tension has gripped the area after the fire, which erupted on Tuesday, damaged a stretch of the adjoining forest, houses and vehicles, provoking an attack by the locals on OIL employees.The two firefighters had gone missing after the well caught fire and their bodies were recovered by an NDRF team on Wednesday morning, Oil India Ltd (OIL) spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika told PTI."Their bodies were recovered from a wetland near the site. Prima facie it looks like they jumped into the water and got drowned as there is no mark of burns. The exact cause will be ascertained only after a post-mortem," he said.The duo has been identified as Durlov Gogoi and Tikheswar Gohain, both assistant operators of the fire service department of the company, the official said.Gogoi was a well-known football player who had represented Assam at several national tournaments in Under-19 and Under-21 categories. He was the goalkeeper of the Oil India football team.A firefighter of the state-owned ONGC suffered minor injuries during the efforts to control the blaze, which the OIL said could take as long as four weeks to put out.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal of all possible assistance to the victims and to resolve the situation.Sonowal called up the prime minister and apprised him of the situation arising from the gas blowout and the subsequent fire, a CMO official said."Gave details of Baghjan fire tragedy to PM Shri @narendramodi ji over phone. Also briefed him about emergency measures taken by @PetroleumMin, @OilIndiaLimited & state machinery. He assured of all possible help to resolve the situation & provide relief to victims," Sonowal tweeted.Sonowal condoled the deaths and said he had requested the Union Petroleum Ministry to compensate the victims."I request the Union Petroleum Ministry to compensate their families adequately as they sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. I also request the ministry to give employment to a member of each of the two families," he told reporters.Sonowal said four OIL employees present at the site had jumped into water but two survived."We will ensure safety and security of all the people living in nearby villages. We will also adequately compensate them for their losses," Sonowal said in Guwahati.Chandra Mohan Patowary, the state's minister of industries, has already reached Tinsukia to assess the situation and hold discussions with the stakeholders.The well, located adjacent to the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, has been spouting gas and condensate droplets for the last 15 days, affecting forested areas and human habitations in a radius of one km."A number of houses, vehicles, small gardens and some forest areas have got burnt. We are trying to get an exact estimation of the damage but it has become difficult due to the raging fire and high temperature. The district administration is working on this," an OIL official said.Apart from fire tenders of the OIL, Army, Air Force, IOC and Assam Gas Company are trying to prevent the fire from expanding further.Three experts from Singaporean firm Alert Disaster Control are present at the site since Monday, supervising efforts to extinguish the blaze.Soon after the blaze erupted, OIL employees in and around Baghjan were attacked by locals, a spokesman for the company said."Many of our staff suffered injuries in the attack. Our vehicles were badly damaged. We could evacuate our staff and those of the ONGC working at the site with great effort with the help of security personnel," the official said.Following the well blowout on May 27, OIL said over 1,610 families were moved out of the area and provided shelter at four relief camps, where following the guidelines to check the spread of the coronavirus, including maintaining social distancing, are proving to be a major challenge.Thick plumes of black smoke shooting into the sky can be seen in areas 30 km away from the blazing well, posing a serious threat to the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, known for its biodiversity.

This reflects on the irregularities in the recruitment system. If the teachers are so unaware, what can they be expected to teach the children?" said a police official, involved in the investigations.According to the SSP Prayagraj, Satyartha Anirudh Pankaj, the main accused has been identified as K.L. Patel, a former Zila panchayat member and cash worth over Rs 22 lakh has been recovered from him.The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the UP government to keep 37,339 posts of assistant teachers vacant, thereby staying the ongoing selection process of teachers in the state.The entire recruitment process has already been stayed by the High Court and the state government has challenged the decision.Meanwhile, the Yogi Adityanath government, on Tuesday, ordered an STF probe into the teachers' recruitment scam in the state.UP Basic Education minister Satish Dwivedi told reporters, "The probe began after one of the applicants named Rahul filed a complaint with the police of bribes being taken for recruitment. The Prayagraj police immediately acted on the complaint and arrested  K.L. Patel and nine others for accepting bribes.

10-06-2020||New Delhi||India’s COVID-19 tally nears 2.8 lakh; nearly one-third cases came in 10 days of June||The nationwide COVID-19 tally neared 2.8 lakh on Wednesday with almost one-third of the total cases getting detected in just 10 days of June. On the positive side, the number of recovered patients has exceeded the count of active cases for the first time.Since June 1, nearly 90,000 cases have been added to the countrywide tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases, while nearly one-third of the overall death toll has also been reported during these 10 days.India’s first COVID-19 case was detected more than four months ago on January 30, but it took more than 100 days thereafter to reach the one-lakh mark on May 18. However, the next one-lakh cases were added in just about a fortnight and the tally can hit the 3-lakh-mark this week itself at the current rate. More than 9,000 new cases have been emerging every day for over a week now.India is the fifth worst-hit nation by the COVID-19 pandemic at present after the US, Brazil, Russia and the UK. But the difference is narrowing fast with the UK, the fourth most affected country.India is ranked 12th for the number of deaths, while it is at the 9th place for recoveries, as per the real-time global data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.In its morning 8 am update, the Union Health Ministry said the number of active cases in the country has risen to 1,33,632, while the total number of people having recovered has now risen to 1,35,205.The Ministry’s update showed nearly 10,000 new cases in 24 hours since Tuesday 8 am, taking the country’s cumulative caseload to over 2,76,583, while the death toll rose by 279 to reach 7,745. This showed a recovery of nearly 49 per cent among the people who have tested positive so far. Nearly 50 lakh tests have been conducted across the country.However, a PTI tally of figures announced by different states and union territories, as of 9.25 pm, showed that the total number of confirmed cases has risen to 2,77,286, while the death toll has mounted to 8,099. It also showed total recoveries at over 1.4 lakh.The Johns Hopkins University data, as of 9.40 pm, showed India’s confirmed cases at over 2.8 lakh.On the morning of June 1, India had nearly 1.9 lakh confirmed cases and less than 5,400 deaths had been reported till then. At that time, there were more than 93,000 active cases as against less than 92,000 recoveries.Globally, more than 72 lakh people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus ever since its emergence in China last December, while almost 34 lakh have recovered so far. More than 4 lakh have lost their lives across the world, while recoveries are close to 34.6 lakh.Within India, Maharashtra alone has more cases than China, which officially reported little over 83,000 confirmed cases and 4,634 deaths. But less than 60 are now said to be undergoing treatment in China with others having been discharged upon recovery.The number of cases in Maharashtra climbed to 94,041 on Wednesday with 3,254 new patients being detected, while the death toll rose to 3,438 with 149 new fatalities being recorded during the day. However, more than 44,500 COVID-19 patients have recovered in the state so far.In Tamil Nadu, a record number of 1,927 new cases emerged and 19 people died to push its tally to 36,841 and the death toll rose to 326. The state government announced recruitment of more than 2,800 medical personnel including over 1,200 doctors and also proposed to double the number of beds in state government hospitals to 10,000.Gujarat, another badly hit state, reported 510 new cases to take its tally to 21,554, while its death toll rose to 1,347.In Delhi, the total count of cases crossed 32,000 with more than 1,500 new cases getting reported, while its death toll mounted to 984.The national capital will need 1.5 lakh beds by July 31 once people start coming from other states for COVID-19 treatment, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, even as he declared that the Lieutenant-Governor’s orders overruling his government’s decisions on coronavirus will be implemented as “this is not the time for disagreements and politics”.“The model that I used for India found that there could be around 8-10 lakh cases in India by mid or end of July. So it won’t be surprising to get to those figures (5.5 lakh) in Delhi,” said Samit Bhattacharya, mathematics professor and researcher at the School of Natural Sciences at Shiv Nadar University.Lovi Raj Gupta, executive dean of science and technology at Lovely Professional University in Punjab, also agreed that reaching the alarmingly high figure of 5.5 lakh is possible using mathematical modelling. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-19-tally-nears-2-8-lakh-nearly-one-third-cases-came-in-10-days-of-june-97202

The idea is to utilise the maximum capacity available to enable such virtual participation, feasibility of enabling participation of members as per the rules of business of both Houses, other technical issues etc.The Secretaries General reported the outcomes of assessment of seating capacity in the chambers of both Houses, Central Hall of Parliament and Plenary Hall of Vigyan Bhawan. The top officials said while the Rajya Sabha chamber can accommodate 60 members as per the norms of social distancing, the Lok Sabha chamber and the Central Hall have space for a little over 100 members. They further said even if the members were to be accommodated in the galleries, the total seating capacity would be much less than required. Even the Plenary Hall of the Vigyan Bhawan would not be adequate to accommodate all 543-Members of the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha has 245 members.Another option discussed was to enable attendance in the chambers of both the Houses of only those many members who can be accommodated as per the social distancing norm by drawing up lists of such members whose participation in various items of business is required on a daily basis.Regarding virtual meetings of the parliamentary committees, it was explained that any change in the rules to hold such meetings required a motion to be carried in both Houses of Parliament.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-session-may-see-virtual-participation-97068

We will have our rights on our land.”Nepal has already issued a new map, including Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulekh.India has refused to be drawn into Nepal’s proposal for a meeting between Foreign Secretaries under the overhang of the resolution, but highly placed sources have expressed the hope that the situation could be turned around provided it is “handled well from here”.While the Nepali Congress came on board last week after a green signal from its Central Working Committee, the die was cast for a unanimous vote after the Madheshis also joined in.Speaking in the House of Representatives, leaders of Janata Samajwadi Party, formed after the unification of Rastriya Janata Party and Socialist Party Nepal, announced their support to the Bill in national interest.Gagan Thapa of the main opposition party, Nepali Congress, set the tone by thanking the government for issuing the map and going a step further by seeking the removal of an Indian Army post at Kalapani.There have been feelers from New Delhi to Baluwatar to explore some existing modalities such as the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group on resolving the outstanding issues. There is also a proposal for a field survey to demarcate Kalapani which is in a limbo.Nepal’s Parliamentarians have 72 hours at their disposal to propose an amendment. The approval by the House of Representatives does not mean the amendment process has been completed yet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-house-approves-new-map-97045

Several national monuments, including the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, as well as a church and several statues were defaced by miscreants during protests against the police killing of George Floyd.A similar incident has taken place in London where a Gandhi statue installed in 2015 was among a large number of city symbols that were spray painted. “It’s disgraceful to see the defacing of the Gandhi statue. Gandhi was a pioneer of peaceful protesting, demonstrating the great change it can bring. Rioting, looting and vandalising do not bring us together,” said Tom Tillis, a Republican Senator.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-disgrace-says-trump-on-gandhi-statue-desecration-96868

But Mamata Banerjee has stuck to her opposition against its implementation,” he said.Shah said under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme, Rs 72,000 crore (Rs 6,000 per farmer) had already been deposited in the back accounts of 9.5 crore farmers. “However, the farmers of West Bengal are yet to get the money as Banerjee is unwilling to share with the Centre the details of eligible farmers,” he said.He said while the BJP was ready to fight political battle with Mamata at any arena of her choice, poor farmers should not be made to pay the price due to her “insecurity”.“You called ‘Shramik Express’ ‘corona express’ and rubbed salt into their wounds. Let me tell you the same ‘corona express’ will take you out of the state, poor migrants will never forget your insult,” Shah told Banerjee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modis-schemes-make-mamata-insecure-shah-96869
