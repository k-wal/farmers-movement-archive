However, ATM related functions shall continue to be operational.Cargo and logistics and trucks ferrying essentials will function as usual.Mobile vans, pushcarts and outlets selling vegetables and other essential commodities, and petrol pumps can operate only between 6 am and 2 pm by following anti-COVID-19 norms, including social distancing.Palaniswami advised the public to avoid using vehicles to buy essential commodities and urged them to confine themselves to their neighbourhood and not venture beyond two km to buy such things.Public Distribution System outlets could work from 8 am to 2 pm and PDS shops in containment areas will be shutdown.Home delivery of government announced relief shall be made available to beneficiaries in hotspots, the Chief Minister said.Now, groceries and vegetable shops function from morning till 8 pm.Autorickshaws and taxis, which are allowed now, shall be off the roads and for emergency medical needs alone, private vehicles and autorickshaws will be allowed.Eateries could be open between 6 am and 8 pm for only takeaway services.Online food delivery services also shall continue to be operational.Government run Amma Canteens and community kitchens shall work as usual.Most restaurants, despite permission to offer both dine-in and takeaway services, cater only to the latter in view of factors like labour shortage and poor patronage.Employees in State and Central government offices cannot exceed 33 per cent of the total strength of workforce and essential state government departments, including the Secretariat here, may function with adequate personnel.Staffers from containment zones need not report for work and they may seek permission in advance from heads of departments, the Chief Minister said.Construction activities will be allowed if they have labourers who stay put at the work site.Continuous process industries and those involved in essential commodities could continue to work.E-pass will be provided to people to move out of Chennai only for medical purposes and on account of wedding or death on production of valid proof.Present norms for returnees from abroad and other states shall continue to be in place.Appealing to people to cooperate with the government to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, the Chief Minister said though the government may come up with curbs, it shall not be possible to stop the pathogen in its tracks without public support. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chennai-to-switch-to-shutdown-mode-for-12-days-from-june-19-cm-palaniswami-99584

The frequency of warm extremes over India increased during the period 1951-2015, with accelerated warming trends during the recent 30-year period of 1986-2015.A significant warming is observed for the warmest day, warmest night and coldest night since 1986.The mean surface air temperature change over India for the mid-term (long-term) period 2040-2069 (2070-2099) relative to the 1976-2005 is projected to be in the range of 1.39 to 2.70 °C (1.33 to 4.44 °C) across greenhouse gas warming scenarios, as per the report.The frequency and intensity of warm days and warm nights are projected to increase in the coming decades, while that of cold days and cold nights will decrease. These changes will be more pronounced for cold nights and warm nights. The pre-monsoon season heat wave frequency, duration, intensity and areal coverage over India are projected to substantially increase during the 21st century.In the past few years, India has witnessed a decrease in monsoon rains, rise in extreme temperature and rainfall events, droughts, and sea levels rising and also an increase in the intensity of severe cyclones along with other changes in the monsoon system.Experts say there is compelling scientific evidence that human activities have influenced these changes in regional climate. As the greenhouse gas emissions are expected to rise in the 21st century, India needs to put sustained effort in building resilience and adaptation frameworks.This report primarily aims at providing answers to questions like how and why India’s climate is changing, what all changes are projected for the future, what are the uncertainties and knowledge gaps in this context, and which are the areas that require greater research. It also talks of combined rise in surface temperature and humidity, amplification of heat stress is expected across India, particularly over the Indo-Gangetic and Indus river basins.The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the tropical Indian Ocean has risen by a degree Celsius on average during 1951-2015, markedly higher than the global average SST warming of 0.7 degree Celsius, over the same period. As per Jayaraman Srinivasan from Divecha Centre for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science, the increase in global mean temperature can be directly linked to the increase in greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. The causes of local climate change are, however, much more complex.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/average-temperature-over-india-projected-to-rise-by-4-4-degrees-celsius-govt-report-on-impact-of-climate-change-in-country-99583

It has been suggested that the rates, once fixed, must be widely publicised so that both the patients and service providers are fully aware and capacities are used optimally. States have also been asked to proactively engage with the private sector health providers and consider pooling in public and private healthcare facilities, as this will help in providing prompt, good quality and reasonable health care to COVID-19 patients,” a ministry statement said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/work-with-pvt-sector-to-reach-reasonable-covid-management-rates-centre-to-states-99577

15-06-2020||New Delhi||No sale & registration of BS-IV vehicle permitted in country: SC||No registration and sale of BS-IV vehicles is permitted across the country, the Supreme Court said on Monday while observing that pollution from such vehicles would be “injurious” and “further burden on human health”.The apex court took umbrage over the “violation” of its March 27 order by which it had allowed sale of limited number of BS-IV vehicles for 10 days across India, except in Delhi-national capital region (NCR), after lifting of the COVID-19 induced lockdown.The top court had on March 27 this year said it was permitting sale of 10 per cent of unsold BS-IV vehicles to make up for six days lost due to the lockdown which had started from March 25.It had also allowed registration of 1.05 lakh two-wheelers, 2,250 passenger cars and 2,000 commercial vehicles which were sold but not registered across the country.The apex court had in October 2018 said no BS-IV vehicle would be sold or registered in India from April 1, 2020. In 2016, the Centre had announced that India would skip the BS-V norms and adopt BS-VI by 2020.A Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and S Abdul Nazeer, which heard the matter on Monday through video-conferencing, said it is “startling” to note that even after lifting of lockdown on May 3, “when the sales have taken place and as per our order, no registration could have been made without informing this court as to how many vehicles have been sold throughout India.”“It is made clear that now no registration and sale of the BS-IV vehicles is permitted,” the Bench said in its order.It said that registration of vehicles, which were to be sold out of the 10 per cent, cannot be made without its permission and without giving particulars as ordered by the court in March.“There is clear cut violation of at least the second part of the order passed by this court (on March 27). Incomplete affidavit has been filed on June 13, 2020,” the Bench said, adding that there is “also violation” with regard to first part of its order.The Bench noted that as per compliance affidavit filed regarding first part of its March 27 order, more than 2,25,000 vehicles were waiting registration as on March 31 and this exceeds the figure which was specified in the order.    “Our order is very clear that the manufacturers should have been ready because of the deadline set for BS-­VI compliant vehicles, there is no justification to extend the time which was fixed long back in the year 2018,” the Bench noted in its order.  “This court further observed that this is not something new which has occurred,” it noted, adding, “It would be further injurious and further burden on human health to be caused by pollution from BS­-IV vehicles when BS­-VI vehicles are supposed to be produced by the manufactures well in advance, considering the deadline of March 31, 2020”.

Announcing this on Monday, the Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation Chairman Mareddy Srinivas Reddy said a record 47 lakh tons procurement in Vaanakalam (Kharif crop) and 65 lakh tons in Yasangi (Rabi crop) during 2019-20 had set new records for the state.He said the state had come a long way from the mere 24 lakh tons of paddy procurements for both seasons in 2014-15. “Within six years of the formation of the state, a record 367 per cent increase was witnessed in the procurement of paddy. Compared to last Yasangi, procurement this year increased by 76 per cent (24 lakh tons),” he said.He said the Yasangi procurement was achieved with the help of 6,408 procurement centres. In all 65 lakh tons of paddy worth Rs 12,000 crore was procured from 9.68 lakh farmers. “So far, Rs 11,000 crore has been deposited into the accounts of farmers and the remaining will be credited into their accounts within a few days,” Srinivas Reddy said.Unlike the past, paddy was taken up in 39 lakh acres in the state and as estimated, 1 crore ton of paddy was produced. Out of this, a total yield of 65 lakh tons was procured by the civil supplies department, 12 lakh tons purchased by rice millers. Around 15 lakh tons are of a fine variety and over 6 lakh tons have been set aside as seed, he said.The state is facing a shortage of gunny bags because of the bumper crop. The demand for gunny bags was estimated at 18 crore. “As on March 24 at the time of imposition of lockdown, there were only 9 crore gunny bags available with the department. Supplies from Kolkata stopped because of the lockdown. But we saw to it that the farmers are not put to trouble because of the shortage. We succeeded in overcoming this problem too,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-emerges-as-rice-bowl-of-india-99570

A lot of medical professionals, doctors are required for all this work. We are in a national emergency and the relaxation is only till June 30,” the Bench told senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, who represented the petitioner.The Supreme Court gave liberty to petitioner Sabu Mathew George, come to it if the notification was extended, and posted it for hearing in the third week of July.George had challenged the notification, which suspended the implementation of Rule 8, Rule 9(8) and 18A (6) of the PCPNDT Rules, 1996 till June 30 this year.Terming it “illegal and arbitrary”, he said the notification was without jurisdiction as the PCPNDT Act didn’t confer any powers on the government for the suspension of the Rules made under the Act.As Parikh pressed for a stay on the notification, the Bench said it would not like to interfere at this stage as the notification was valid only till June 30.Medical resources had been diverted to check the spread of COVID19, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-plea-against-change-in-pcpndt-act-99568

It had also set up a five-member committee headed by former Andhra Pradesh High Court Judge BS Reddy to inquire into the tragedy.The company has challenged the NGT order as also some directions issued by the Andhra Pradesh High Court before the Supreme Court.On May 26, the Supreme Court had allowed the South Korean MNC to have access to the chemical factory after it said not allowing the company to have access to the plant could lead to more problems.However, the District Magistrate did not allow the company’s representatives to visit the plant, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi told the Bench on behalf of LG Polymers.“My plant which is a highly specialised one has been sealed. This order of sealing without an expert opinion is wrong,” he said.He also questioned the HC order asking its directors to deposit their passports.The Supreme Court stayed disbursal of the compensation amount and asked the HC to dispose of petitions pending before it by next week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-disbursal-of-compensation-asks-ap-hc-to-decide-petitions-99566

Everyone knows what the positive and conducive atmosphere is. It is up to the Government of Nepal to do that. We have already reiterated our commitment on earlier occasions,” said highly-placed sources.ALSO READ: Indo-Nepal ties are not ordinary; no power in world can break them: RajnathThe observation comes a day before Nepal’s Upper House will consider a resolution to change the map on the Coat of Arms to include the areas claimed by India as well. The Lower House had unanimously passed the resolution last week.The Indian stand with respect to Nepal is at variance with its attitude to resolving the stand-off with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) where it entered into talks with no preconditions.Charging Oli with unilateral changing Nepal’s political map, the sources said the fact that this was done without fact or evidence, points to domestic political agenda being the prime motivation behind the move.“We don’t know why PM Oli and his government did not tell the Nepalese people about our offer of talks. We keep hearing India has never offered a virtual conference between Foreign Secretaries,” said the sources while pointing out that Nepal did not respond to two offers for talks made over the past nine months.They, however, conceded that PM Narendra Modi has not spoken to Oli on the issue. Their last conversation on April 10 (before Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the road to Lipulekh) was in a broader bilateral context.At the same time, the sources said the dispute has not impaired cooperation in other areas. “Our cooperation is multifaceted. The Government of India has remained in the forefront of Covid assistance to Nepal and work is going on integrated check posts and various rail connectivity links besides small developmental projects,” they said.Oli Covid spike claim falseThe sources also reacted sharply to Oli’s claim that Nepalese returning from India had led to a spike in Covid cases. “This is false and distorted. We are surprised. So many Nepalese are coming from other countries, including China. We have given so many other overflight clearances to flights to Nepal. To single out the name of one country (India) indicates the same political motivation of the current establishment,” they responded.The sources blamed the Nepal Government’s inept handling of the epidemic as the reason for the spike. The sudden surge, they said, was due to lack of proper testing and quarantine measures. “Moreover, once people cross the border, it becomes the responsibility of the host government to ensure proper medical care. The opposition in Nepal had also warned the Government in this respect,” they pointed out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-acts-tough-with-nepal-asks-it-to-create-conditions-for-talks-99557

15-06-2020||Hyderabad||Telangana caps testing and treatment price for COVID-19||The Telangana Government has allowed private hospitals and labs to conduct COVID-19 tests, but at the same time capped the prices for the diagnostic tests.State Health Minister Eatala Rajender said private and corporate hospitals, including private laboratories, would charge Rs 2, 200 for a single coronavirus test.Under a lot of criticism for not testing enough, the government has now brought in private hospitals and labs.But to ensure that the ordinary people are not fleeced, as was happening in other parts of the country, it has asked corporate hospitals to charge Rs 4,000 per day for isolation facilities from mild COVID-19 positive patients and Rs 7, 500 per day from positive patients who need Intensive Care Unit (ICU) facilities without ventilator support.However, those who need to be on a ventilator in ICUs will be charged Rs 9,000 per day.Some private hospitals have reportedly been charging COVID-19 patients in lakhs, sometimes up to lakh a day.The health minister clarified, “These charges are separate from the cost of antiviral drugs that the private hospital will administer to the coronavirus patients.”He said the state authorities were keeping a close watch on the situation and establishing linkages with the hospitals so that the government is aware of the number of cases and other related information.People should try to save themselves from getting infected by adopting the standard operating procedures (SOP) as the treatment despite the capping can be very expensive and in some cases, life-threatening.Some anti-viral injections cost Rs 40,000-50,000, the minister pointed out. Eatala said the directive to private hospitals and diagnostic centres has been issued with a warning of strict action over violation of guidelines and attempt to exploit the situation.He said private hospitals and labs, which had obtained the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) approval, could conduct COVID-19 tests on people reporting Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) symptoms. “The test can be done as per the doctor’s advice and only if the person has any symptom.

This is secured by the quality of India’s various bilateral relationships but the overall helpful approach India has displayed in regard to the health and economic requirements of other nations.Among the first leaders Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached out to, after the lockdown, were those from the Gulf countries that employ Indians in large numbers. India also ensured that the Gulf countries, heavily dependent on food imports, did not suffer from scarcity, and sent a medical team to Kuwait to up-skill its health workers.Jaishankar was delivering the keynote address at the inaugural session of the third annual conference of Protectors of Emigrants (POEs).On building firm bridges with other nations, Jaishankar referred to the assurance by UAE Minister Nasser bin Thani Al Hamli that his country will continue to be a place of opportunity and tolerance for Indian migrants.The Minister revealed that the Vande Bharat Mission of repatriating Indians was engaged in data mining. The reasoning behind seeking details of the returnees’ skill sets by “data capture and mapping as an accompanying element of the Vande Bharat Mission” was to examine if they could be used for India’s development, said Jaishankar.“The coming months will see dedicated efforts in that direction. The contribution that POEs can make to facilitate this national objective is significant,” he added.In this respect, MEA has facilitated data flows to the National Skill Development Council (NSDC) to develop “SWADES”, a database for skilled workers. Together with e-Migrate, these can become basic tools for skill-job matching for migrant workers, he said.Till a week back, 15,634 returning migrants had filled the SWADES skill form and 47 per cent were graduates. Nearly 59 per cent said they were unemployed and the rest still had jobs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-data-mapping-skills-of-returnees-jaishankar-99547

15-06-2020||Vibha Sharma||States advised to encourage agroforestry in contract farming on lines of crops right from pre-planting, planting and harvest||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 15The notion that agroforestry means only timber species, means long maturity period and delayed returns to farmers needs a relook from farmers as well as the industry.The states were being advised to encourage contract farming on the lines similar to crops right from the pre-planting, planting and harvest, the Agriculture Ministry said, laying emphasis on the multiple uses of agroforestry — ranging from additional income to farmers to carbon sequestration for combating climate change.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for ‘vocal for our local’ was of great relevance to agro-forestry and sensitising the implementing states to assist farmers in making the correct choice of species was the general consensus at a webinar to discuss ways and means to connect agro-forestry farmers to the industry, the Agriculture Ministry added.According to Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal, various reforms had been brought in the Agriculture Sector to ensure optimum remuneration to farmers to ensure their welfare, including a Rs 1.63-lakh crore outlay and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance 2020, to establish a national market and give farmers the option to choose.Apart from providing additional income to farmers, agroforestry has several other uses such as green fodder, reduction in requirement of fertilisers by planting leguminous species and carbon sequestration for combating climate change.  The officials said the Central Silk Board had assured to assist farmers who planted the range of silk host species, which on an average started giving returns in three to four years and were ideal for agroforestry systems.“In conclusion, the states are advised to encourage contract farming on similar lines as crops right from pre-planting, planting and harvest. The industry, both existing and potential, should be taken as the hub and activities planned around that. Multipurpose species should be encouraged so that returns start flowing at the earliest, this would enable the fulfillment of the vision of an ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’,” the officials said.“There are a number of rising sectors which would ensure quick returns to farmers as well as fulfil industry requirements, including medicinal and aromatic plants, silk, lac, paper and pulp, tree-borne oil seeds for production of bio-fuels,” as per expert speakers JLN Sastry, Chief Executive Officer, National Medicinal Plant Board; Rohit Pandit, secretary-general, Indian Papers Manufacturers Association; HK Kulkarni, former vice-president, ITC Limited; and Rajit Ranjan Okhandiar, Chief Executive Officer and member secretary, Central Silk Board.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-advised-to-encourage-agroforestry-in-contract-farming-on-lines-of-crops-right-from-pre-planting-planting-and-harvest-99529

15-06-2020||Bhopal||FIR against Congress leader Digvijaya Singh for tweeting ‘edited’ video of CM Shivraj Chouhan||Madhya Pradesh Police registered an FIR against Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh and 11 others on Monday in a case of circulation of an alleged “edited” video of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s old statement on the liquor policy of the previous Kamal Nath government.Singh said he had no objection to the FIR against him, but the police should also investigate the source of the video and who “edited” it.On Sunday night, leaders of the ruling BJP submitted a complaint to the police, demanding that an FIR be lodged against Singh for tweeting the alleged “edited” video.In the video, Chouhan is purportedly seen commenting on the liquor policy of the previous Kamal Nath government.“On the basis of the complaint, a case has been registered against 12 people, including Digivijaya Singh and Avinash Kadbe (MP Congress’ social media coordinator),” Additional Superintendent of Police Nishchal Jharia told PTI.They have been charged under Indian Penal Code Sections 500 (defamation), 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory), 505 (2) (public mischief) and 465 (forgery), the official said.Jharia said the FIR was registered after the complaint received from BJP leaders was found to be “right” in preliminary investigation.“Further action would be taken after the investigation, he said.Reacting to the development, Digvijaya Singh said the BJP is upset as he raised an issue of cheating in Chief Minister Chouhan’s constituency.“The BJP has been fuming and is perturbed since I wrote to Chouhan that tribals in his constituency Budhni were duped of Rs 450 crore by his agents. No action was taken during Chouhans (previous) tenure. I wrote to him that if no action would be taken, I will be forced to sit on a dharna at the CM’s residence, Singh told reporters.He also demanded an FIR against those who duped the tribals in Chouhan’s constituency.“I don’t have any objection to the FIR (against him), but it should be investigated what is the source (of video) and who edited this? The BJP and Modi-Shah bhakts edited Rahul Gandhis video and circulated it and are running fake news.“Action should also be taken against them,” he said.State Congress president and former chief minister Kamal Nath criticised the action against Digvijaya Singh.“The BJP government is continuously showing its malicious thinking by taking oppressive action against Congress leaders in the state, Nath said.He said the BJP government is setting a “wrong tradition” in the state.People associated with the BJP are constantly doing dirty politics against Congress leaders and trying to spoil their image, they have made false complaints against Digvijaya Singh over a viral video, he said, adding that action should be taken against those who created the video.On Sunday night, a BJP delegation, headed by former minister Umashankar Gupta, submitted a memorandum to the crime branch of Bhopal police.In their complaint, the BJP leaders said Chouhan had given a statement against the liquor policy of the then Kamal Nath government on January 12 this year.This 2.19-minute video was edited and a nine-second cropped part of it was shared on Twitter by Singh to malign the image of the Chief Minister, they alleged.They accused Digvijaya Singh and his associates of “conspiring to malign the CM’s image”.Singh, however, deleted the tweet immediately.

15-06-2020||New Delhi||Monsoon may arrive in Delhi, Punjab, HP by June 25-26||Boosted by two low-pressure systems—one over southeast Arabian which later turned into ‘severe cyclone’ Nisarga and another over the Bay of Bengal—the Southwest Monsoon has arrived in Gujarat and East Uttar Pradesh, the IMD said on Monday.With conditions becoming favourable for its further advance into UP and Madhya Pradesh over the next 48 hours, meteorologists are predicting an early arrival of monsoon in the Northwest—including Delhi, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.Meanwhile, the IMD said another low-pressure area is likely to form over North Bay of Bengal and its surrounding areas around June 19.As per forecaster Skymet, until now, the 2020 Monsoon has progressed almost in the “copybook style”.“It kept its date with the normal onset over Kerala. We think it can arrive over Delhi by June 25-26. Pre-monsoon rains will pick pace from June 20,” says Mahesh Palawat of Skymet.“The onset over Gujarat is well ahead of time. Usually, monsoon reaches parts of Kutch around June 25, this time it is almost 10 days early. Likewise in the Central and Eastern parts of the country, either it is on time or slightly ahead by a day or two,” says Palawat.While the initial push to monsoon over west coast came via Nisarga, in the second week of June, the low-pressure area over Bengal became instrumental in boosting its progress in Eastern and Central India.“We expect rain to continue with moderate-to-heavy intensity over Eastern and Central parts of the country, including Gujarat. The weather of hills, as well as Northwest India, will remain almost dry and hot for at least the next 3 to 4 days.”“Isolated pockets of Rajasthan can also experience heatwave conditions. The rains are expected to reach Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab and parts of Jammu and Kashmir by around June 25/26 with an error margin of three days,” says Palawat.The normal arrival date in the region has been revised up to June 27.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-may-arrive-in-delhi-punjab-hp-by-june-25-26-99514

15-06-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Indo-Nepal ties are not ordinary; no power in world can break them: Rajnath||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 15Making an overture to Nepal, which is angry with India for making a road to Lipulekh Pass, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said "if there is any misunderstanding among citizens of Nepal we will resolve it through talks; we will sit down and resolve it”.“Relations between the two nations are not ordinary, it is ‘roti-beti ka rishta’, he said. “No power in the world can break it,” Singh said in an obvious reference to China’s growing proximity to Nepal.   Singh was speaking at the ‘Uttarakhand Jan Samwaad’ virtual rally organised by the BJP.Notably, in the past two such rallies, one on June 8 and the other on June 14 for Maharashtra and J&K, respectively, he had spoken about the ongoing India-China dispute along the LAC in Ladakh. On Monday, he avoided China and addressed Nepal where Parliament has approved a new map showing Indian territory in Uttarakhand as Nepalese land.On the Dharchula-Lipulekh road, he said, “The 80 km road is in Indian territory; however, in Nepal there is a misunderstanding over this,” Singh said. “India and Nepal not only have social, cultural, historical and geographical relations, we have spiritual relations. How can we forget Baba Pashupati Nath”, he said referring to the temple by the same name in Nepal. “Can anyone delink Pashupati Nath, Kashi Vishwanath and Somnath from Amarnath? The link between India and Nepal is of a ‘different world’, no one can change the link despite wanting to do it. Indians cannot have any ill-feeling about Nepali citizens,” Singh said.The Dharchula-Lipulekh road leads to Mansarvaor (lake in Tibet), an important Hindu pilgrimage site and reduces travel time by six days.Singh went on to highlight ties with Nepal and cited the Gorkha regiment of the Indian Army. The war cry of the regiment is “Jai Mahakali, ayo Gorkhali”, the Defence Minister said.He said the Defence Ministry had set a target of having Rs 35,000 crore-worth export weapons by 2024. Singh reminded his audience that the Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, was from Uttarakhand.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indo-nepal-ties-are-not-ordinary-no-power-in-world-can-break-them-rajnath-99481
15-06-2020||New Delhi||World Elder Abuse Awareness Day: Senior citizens recall abuse, torture by families||Champiya, who is in her late 80s, does not fear COVID-19.She says years of mental torture and physical abuse by her children have prepared her to deal with “anything in life”.This World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, elderly like Champiya recall the trauma they went through before parting ways with their loved ones.“Once, one of my sons slapped me so hard I couldn’t hear from one ear. I still remember one night he pulled me out of my room by my hair and kept hitting me,” the resident of Mann ka Tilak old age home in Delhi recalled.“I only knew that time was passing because I saw the Sun rising,” she said.After ages of torture and abuse, Champiyas’s youngest grand-daughter rescued her and brought her to the old age home. “Now I don’t fear anything in life, not even the dreaded coronavirus,” she said.Shabana (name changed), 78, lives alone in a one-bedroom apartment in Noida. She lived with her son earlier but decided to move out after the abuse started.“It was first neglect then verbal abuse. But when they stopped giving me food and asked me to fend for myself, I knew I should leave,” she said.Shabana said her late husband had left some money for her with which she bought a home for herself. For the past 10 years, she has been living alone and surviving on his pension.Rukmanni, who is in her 70s, recalls how she would sit near the phone in an old age home, day after day waiting for her son’s call, which never came.“I stayed with my youngest son, but he struggled to find a job. Finally, he admitted to me that he could not afford to take care of me, and he had to send me away.“Overnight, my world was turned upside down, I begged and pleaded with him, told him that I would do anything but he refused to listen and dropped me at an old age home,” she said.Rajesh (name changed) was thrown out on the streets by his son on a cold December night.He now lives with his sister, but says he still gets nightmares of getting hit by his son frequently.“I just had one son and after my wife died there was no use of me. I tried to show him that I can be productive by doing household chores but that was not satisfactory for him and his wife and they threw me out one day. Since then I moved in with my sister,” he said.He hopes that no one goes through the trauma he underwent and people become more compassionate towards their old parents.“They should remember that we were the ones who taught them to walk and try to be patient with us,” he said.According to psychiatrist Rabia Hasan, it is often seen that even if the elderly do not undergo extreme abuse, there is a form of neglect and ignorance which affects most of them.“With nuclear lives becoming predominant, it has been seen that old parents feel they have been left behind. Many of them feel ignored,” she said.Hasan advised people to make efforts to engage their old parents in their day to day lives that will give them a feeling of being relevant.Sonali Sharma, head of communications at HelpAge India, said there is no excuse for neglecting or abusing one’s parents.                 “When we were young, our parents would very patiently answer all our questions but this generation does not understand that. There is a constant feeling of disrespect and neglect that older people face today,” she said.Noting that neglect, verbal abuse and isolation are the three top forms of abuse that elderly suffer from, Sharma said it has been seen that the main abusers are their own children, either sons or daughter-in laws.“We tell a couple of things to both generations—to older people we tell that there is maintenance act (Maintenance and Welfare of Senior Citizens Act, 2007) under which if you do not look after your parents then you can be jailed and you can be fined so this is a legal tool that can be used by elderly and we sensitize them to use it to protect themselves,” she said.“Secondly, we tell them that no matter how much ever you love your child please do not give them everything through your will till you are alive. We tell them to retain hold and power in their hands so we tell them that do not give your core economic strength to your caretaker,” she said.Moreover, she said elderly need to become independent digitally.“There is a huge digital divide between the abuser and the abused so we keep telling older people that you need to become independent and not depend on your child for everything. We conduct digital literacy classes for basic digital empowerment of elderly,” she added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/world-elder-abuse-awareness-day-senior-citizens-recall-abuse-torture-by-families-99477

15-06-2020||New Delhi||2 High Commission staffers released in Islamabad after India lodges protest over reported arrest||Two officials of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad who were detained by Pakistani authorities  on Monday morning were released in the evening, government sources said---a development that comes hours after India protested Pakistan's detention of the two officials in a "hit-and-run" case.Top government sources confirmed that the two Indian staffers were released by Pakistani authorities and they are back at the Indian High Commission.The duo left the High Commission in a vehicle for official duty at around 8:30 AM (IST) and did not reach their destination, the sources said.India summoned the Pakistan charge d'affaires in Delhi and lodged a strong protest over the reported arrest of the two officials.Pakistani media had reported that the two Indian staffers were arrested for their alleged involvement in a "hit and run accident".Official sources said the Pakistan charge d'affaires (CDA) was summoned to the Ministry of External Affairs and a demarche was issued to him, making it clear that there should be no interrogation or harassment of the Indian officials and the responsibility for their safety and security lay squarely with the Pakistani authorities.The sources said the Pakistan side was asked to return the two officials along with the official car to the High Commission immediately.The incident comes two weeks after India expelled two Pakistan High Commission officials here on charges of espionage.India had declared Abid Hussain and Muhammad Tahir as ‘persona non grata’ after they were found obtaining sensitive documents relating to movement of Indian Army troops from an Indian national, according to authorities here.Following their expulsion, Pakistani agencies started harassing a number of Indian High Commission officials in Islamabad, including charge d’affaires Gaurav Ahluwalia.Ahluwalia’s car was aggressively tailed by Pakistani agencies on at least two occasions following which India lodged a strong protest with the Pakistan Foreign Office.After the expulsion of the two Pakistani officials, it was expected that Pakistan would also resort to a tit-for-tat response, going by similar episodes in the past.India’s expulsion of the two Pakistani officials and subsequent harassment of Indian High Commission staffers in Islamabad by Pakistani agencies came in the midst of frayed ties between the two countries over the reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir by India.Pakistan had downgraded diplomatic ties by expelling the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad following India’s decision to withdraw special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year.

15-06-2020||Ajay Banerjee||India, China, Pak have increased nuclear arsenal in past one year||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 15An international think-tank on Monday said India and China have increased their nuclear arsenal over the past year. It also warned of how China was in the middle of "significant" modernistaion of its nuclear weaponry.Pakistan and China, it noted, possess more nuclear warheads than India.China had 290 warheads in January 2019 and increased these to 320 till January 2020. During the same period, India’s stock went up from an estimated 130-140 to touch 150.Unconnected to this, the two  neighbours are locked in a tense stand-off along the 3,488-km LAC since May.Indian arsenal despite the increase still is short of Pakistan’s 160 warheads. Islamabad had an estimated 150-160 warheads in January 2019 and now in January 2020, the number is 160. “ India and Pakistan are slowly increasing the size and diversity of their nuclear forces, says the report. The details of the report were released on Monday morning by Swedish think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).A statement said these were ‘findings of SIPRI Yearbook 2020’, which assesses the current state of armaments, disarmament and international security.* ‘Deployed warheads’ refers to warheads placed on missiles or located on bases with operational forces.** ‘Other warheads’ refers to stored or reserve warheads and retired warheads awaiting dismantlement.* The British Government has stated that the process to reduce the stockpile to 180 warheads is underway. Although some sources suggest that the stockpile remains at 215 warheads, it is possible that, under this process, the stockpile may have already been reduced.“A key finding is that despite an overall decrease in the number of nuclear warheads in 2019, all nuclear weapon-possessing states continue to modernise their nuclear arsenals,’ The SIPRI said.“China is in the middle of a significant modernisation of its nuclear arsenal. It is developing a so-called nuclear triad for the first time, made up of new land- and sea-based missiles and nuclear-capable aircraft," the SIPRI says on China’s modernisation.India has already cleared that it has the ‘triad’ ability – described as platforms which can launch a nuclear warhead from air, land or from under sea.A new nuclear arms race Talking about changes to the global order, the report says Russia and the USA have extensive and expensive programmes under way to replace and modernize their nuclear warheads, missile and aircraft delivery systems, and nuclear weapon production facilities. Both countries have also given new or expanded roles to nuclear weapons in their military plans and doctrines, which marks a significant reversal of the post-cold war trend towards the gradual marginalisation of nuclear weapons. The SIPRI termed this as an “unfolding crisis” of nuclear arms control that suffered further setbacks in 2019. “In these times of ever-increasing geopolitical tensions, the absence of adequate measures to monitor nuclear arsenals and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials is a particularly worrying development,” the SIPRI report quoted Shannon Kile, Director of SIPRI’s Nuclear Disarmament, Arms Control and Non-proliferation Programme.The loss of key channels of communication between Russia and the US that were intended to promote transparency and prevent misperceptions about their respective nuclear force postures and capabilities could potentially lead to a new nuclear arms race, the reports said.The US has disclosed important information about its stockpile and nuclear capabilities but in 2019, the US administration ended the practice. The governments of India and Pakistan make statements about some of their missile tests, but provide little information about the status or size of their arsenals. North Korea has acknowledged conducting nuclear weapon and missile tests but provides no information about its nuclear weapon capabilities. Israel has a long-standing policy of not commenting on its nuclear arsenal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-pak-have-increased-nuclear-arsenal-in-past-one-year-99445

15-06-2020||New Delhi||Expect mid-Nov peak, dearth of ICUs: Study||An ICMR taskforce on Covid research has projected mid-November disease peak in India while warning states to meet anticipated shortfalls in health systems.The Operational Research Group of the ICMR headed by medical specialist NK Arora however concluded that the eight-week lockdown and the health measures that were taken during the period would help India achieve 70 per cent reduction in Covid cases at the peak and 27 per cent reduction in the cumulative load.The researchers who evaluated the effectiveness of the lockdown also state in the findings that this single measure delayed the peak in India by 34 to 76 days and overall cases by 69 to 97 per cent. The estimations are based on a month-old data and will soon be published.At current levels, the researchers project the pandemic to cost India 6.2 per cent of its GDP.The most important finding in the research pertains to the availability of health infrastructure to manage the peak when it arrives in a staggered manner by mid- November. The country could then fall short of ventilators for the next 3.9 months, isolation beds for 5.4 months and ICU beds for 4.6 months.“But given the fact that the epidemic would not happen uniformly across the country and would happen in clusters, the effects of the projected lack of infrastructure would not be as debilitating as these could have been otherwise. Already the lockdown and the accompanying public health measures have helped boost the health infrastructure by delaying the peak by months,” one of the researchers said today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/expect-mid-nov-peak-dearth-of-icus-study-99272
15-06-2020||New Delhi||China turned down proposal to demarcate LAC for 174 yrs||On August 5 last year, when Parliament approved an amendment to Article 370 of the Constitution to carve out Ladakh as a separate Union Territory, China responded with angry statements.Beijing questioned the “changed status” of the “boundary”, whereas in reality there is no boundary and it never was and largely due to the Chinese, who have rejected every such proposal in 174 years, or since 1846. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a kind of loose understanding with several disputes and overlapping claims, especially along the 826 front in Ladakh.Since 1846, when the British took over J&K post the first Anglo-Sikh War, an attempt was made to have a boundary and was quickly followed up in 1847. In all, the British proposed boundaries — five separate ones in 1846-47, 1865, 1873, 1899 and 1914, China rejected each of them. Britain got China to send in troops during World War I and II, but the boundary remained undecided.Major Alexandar Cunnigham, who led the British attempt in 1847 to demarcate the boundary, details this in his 1854 book “Ladakh Physical, Statistical and Geographical”. He narrates “The settlement of this boundary (between Ladakh and Tibet) was of some importance”.In 1834, the Dogra Army, led by General Zorawar Singh, captured Ladakh. During the Sino-Sikh War (1841–42), the Qing Empire invaded Ladakh, but the Sino-Tibetan army was defeated and “a letter of agreement” was signed in 1842.Since August last year, China’s foreign affairs ministry has questioned the move on Article 370. At an informal session of the UN Security Council in August 2019, the Chinese Permanent Representative in the UN had argued that India’s decision to abrogate Article 370 challenged China’s sovereign interests and violated bilateral agreements on maintaining peace in the border area. In Ladakh, only two spots along the LAC are disputed.One is at Trig Heights in the north-eastern edge of Ladakh and the other is Demchok. Besides, both sides carry out patrolling in what they perceive as the boundary — at the northern edge of Pangong Tso, Sppangur Gap, Kongka La, Chumur, Mount Sajun, Hot Springs and Samar Lungpa. However, not a bullet has been fired since November 1962 in Ladakh.Sequence of events post Independence||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-turned-down-proposal-to-demarcate-lac-for-174-yrs-99268
