20-06-2020|| Sandeep Dikshit||India rejects China's Galwan Valley claim as ‘untenable, exaggerated’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 20India has accused China of advancing exaggerated and untenable claims with regard to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in response to Beijing laying ownership on the entire Galwan Valley where a bloody skirmish took place on June 16 resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian army personnel.Three days before Foreign Ministers of India and China will be joined by the Russian Foreign Minister for a video conference that will help in lowering temperatures, India and China agreed on early meetings at the level of military commanders and diplomats to further defuse tensions.At the same time, India maintained that the skirmish took place after Chinese troops entered its side of the LAC in Galwan Valley for the second time. Violence flared up when Indian troops resisted an attempt to put up structures, said the MEA in response to Chinese Foreign Ministry’s “step-by-step” version of the Galwan Valley incident.Refuting Chinese assertions that the Valley is located on the Chinese side of the LAC, the MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said “attempts by the Chinese side are not acceptable. They are not in accordance with China’s own position in the past”.However, India made no claims of its own with Srivastava simply stating that, “The position with regard to the Galwan Valley area has been historically clear.”Countering two other allegations, Srivastava said Indian troops had never undertaken any action across the LAC and that all infrastructure built for the purpose by India is “naturally on its own side”. He said for Chinese troops had been hindering India's normal, traditional patrolling pattern in this area for over a month. This led to a face-off which was addressed by the ground commanders.Earlier, Chinese attempts to cross the LAC in other areas of the Western Sector, too, were rebuffed, leading to talks between senior army commanders on June 6 which agreed on de-escalation and disengagement. But the Chinese side departed from this understanding and entered a second time to erect structures. Chinese troops turned violent action when this attempt was foiled, he said.The MEA spokesperson also said the External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had rejected his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi’s allegations that the Indian side was the first aggressor.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-rejects-chinas-galwan-valley-claim-as-untenable-exaggerated-101904
20-06-2020||Jaipur||Nadda hits out at Rahul Gandhi for his remarks on Ladakh standoff||BJP chief JP Nadda on Saturday targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his remarks on the Sino-India face-off in Ladakh, alleging he was lowering the morale of defence forces through his tweets.Addressing a virtual rally for Rajasthan, he said "some opposition leaders are demonstrating their limited knowledge" and "asking why soldiers went unarmed"."These leaders are lowering the morale of defence forces through their tweets when jawans are defending the country in Galwan on India-China border,” he said."Don't you know the international rules and agreements," Nadda added.Rahul Gandhi had raised questions on whether "unarmed soldiers" had to fight the Chinese Army and alleged that the Prime Minister had surrendered Indian territory to the Chinese aggression."The language used by an individual reflects the family's culture. Indian families do not have the culture of using such language as done by you," Nadda said."Forget about honouring Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you did not honour your PM. You tore his ordinance. People of the country and the world know this," the BJP chief said attacking Gandhi.He was referring to an incident when Rahul Gandhi had denounced an ordinance by the Manmohan Singh government in 2013 to nullify a Supreme Court order on disqualifying convicted lawmakers. During a press conference, Rahul Gandhi had termed the ordinance “complete nonsense” that should be “torn apart and thrown out”.The BJP president said there should be constructive opposition. "Sadly, we are facing an opposition which has no substance or direction," he said.Nadda also referred to Friday's all-party meeting with the Prime Minister, saying that everyone resolved to stand together but the Congress kept asking questions.He noted that the PM has said in his statement that "neither they (Chinese army) have intruded into our border nor has any post been taken over by them".            Indian defence forces are fully capable of securing borders of the country in water, land and air and they have been given a free hand, the BJP chief said in the Jan Samvad rally for party workers in Bikaner and Jodhpur division.Paying tributes to the soldiers who died in a violent clash with the Chinese army in Galwan Valley on Monday, Nadda said their martyrdom would not go in vain."I want to assure their families that their martyrdom will not go in vain. May God give strength to their families. They were not just the sons of their families, they were the sons of the country… I want to say that the whole country stands with them," he said.The virtual rallies are being organised by the BJP to mark the completion of the first year of the second term of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre."The Modi government has completed six decades of work in six years," Nadda said as he referred to various achievements of the government.

20-06-2020||Kathmandu||Nepal confident India, China will resolve differences through peaceful means||Nepal on Saturday said it was confident that both its "friendly neighbours" India and China would resolve their border stand-off at the Line of Actual Control through peaceful means, keeping in mind the stability of the region and world peace.The Himalayan nation, sandwiched between the two Asian giants, said it had always stood firmly for regional and world peace and expressed confidence that the differences between India and China would be resolved in the "spirit of good neighbourliness"."Nepal maintains that disputes between the countries should be resolved through peaceful means," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement, two days after the Nepal government completed the process of redrawing the country's political map through a Constitutional amendment, incorporating three strategically important Indian areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in a move that could severely jolt bilateral relations with New Delhi.The Foreign Ministry statement noted that Nepal had always stood firmly for regional and world peace."In the context of recent developments in the Galwan Valley area between our friendly neighbours India and China, Nepal is confident that both the neighbouring countries will resolve, in the spirit of good neighbourliness, their mutual differences through peaceful means in favour of bilateral, regional and world peace and stability," it said.Nepal's statement comes in the backdrop of clashes that have taken place between the forces of two countries in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh.Twenty Indian Army personnel, including a Colonel, were killed in the clash with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley on Monday night, the biggest military confrontation in over five decades that has significantly escalated the already volatile border standoff between the two countries.

20-06-2020||Beijing||Chinese social media sites delete PM Modi's speech on border crisis||Indian Embassy officials here have said the speech of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Chief Ministers on June 18 as well as the comments by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been deleted from two Chinese social media accounts, including Weibo.The move comes in the backdrop of the violent face-off between the Indian and Chinese armies in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on Monday in which 20 Indian military personnel were killed, significantly escalating the already volatile situation in the region.Indian Embassy officials said the transcript of the remarks of the MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava were found to have been removed from the Embassy's account of Sina Weibo on June 18.After that the Indian officials re-published the screen shots of Srivastava's comments on June 19.Sina Weibo which is similar to Twitter has millions of users and all embassies in Beijing, besides several world leaders including Prime Minister Modi, have opened their accounts to interact with the Chinese people.The MEA spokesperson's remarks have also been removed from the official WeChat account. A note on WeChat says, “Unable to view this content because it violates regulations.”In his comments, Srivastava had asked China to confine its activities to its side of the Line of Actual Control and that it must not take any unilateral action to alter it.Prime Minister Modi's remarks of June 18 about the Indian soldiers killed in the Galwan Valley clash has also become inaccessible on WeChat. The page says that the “content has been deleted by the author”, whereas the Embassy officials said they had not removed it.Emphasising that the sacrifice of Indian soldiers killed in the Galwan Valley clash in Ladakh will not go in vain, Modi said that India wants peace but was capable of giving a befitting reply, if instigated.Both the Weibo pages of the Indian Embassy and its WeChat group have thousands of followers.While the Weibo page was opened earlier, the WeChat group started in January this year.Modi opened an account in Weibo during his visit here in 2015 and continued to make use of it to interact with the Chinese people. No posts related to the recent military confrontation were posted on his page.Twenty Indian Army personnel, including a Colonel, were killed in the clashes with the Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on Monday night.While China has acknowledged casualties on their side, it has not specified the numbers. Beijing has not made any official statement on the casualties suffered by the People's Liberation Army during the face-off with the Indian Army.

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||As stand-off continues, troops from other parts mobilized for Ladakh frontier||Amidst continuing tension along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh, the Army has mobilized additional troops for the frontline.Several more formations from various parts of the country are now being moved to the Himalayan heights for countering the Chinese.While a large number of troops have already been deployed in the disputed region since Chinese incursions began in several areas a couple of months ago, additional force builds up is underway since the violent Galwan Valley face-off that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and China now staking claim to the entire valley.The present level of troops stationed now in Ladakh is about double than it was earlier.The highways to Leh have been closed to civilian traffic and heavy military movement is taking place along the two land routes Ladakh – one through the Srinagar-Leh axis and the other via the Manali axis.The highways, which remain closed through winters due to snow for about six months in a year, were re-opened by the Border Roads Organisation this year about 3-4 weeks earlier than usual.Besides additional infantry, artillery and engineer units, as well as support elements, are being moved to Ladakh from their peacetime locations.In addition to Ladakh, which has been a traditional hot-spot for Chinese incursions, other sectors like Himachal and Uttarakhand are also being reinforced.While Himachal, where the two districts of Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti share borders with China have remained largely dormant since 1962, there have been reported Chinese activity in this sector also.In April, two Chinese helicopters had violated Indian airspace over Himachal.The Indian Air Force too is heavily committed in the build-up along the Line of Control, with its transport fleet comprising the US made C-17 and Russian IL-76 heavy-lift aircraft as well as the AN-32 medium-lift aircraft undertaking more than usual sorties to forward areas for airlifting men and material from various places into Ladakh.Unlike as in the Kargil conflict of 1999, when the Soviet-origin Mi-26, which is the world’s heaviest helicopter, had played a vital role by airlifting artillery guns, weapon systems and other critical equipment to the war zone, this time they would not be seeing action.The fleet of three helicopters remains on the ground as they are long due for an overhaul, for which they have to be ferried to Ukraine.The newly requisitioned US helicopters, CH-47 Chinook as well as the AH-64 Apache have also been deployed in Ladakh.While Chinook, a heavy-lift helicopter based at Chandigarh is being used for tactical movement of troops and equipment, the attack helicopter Apache, based at Pathankot is being used for surveillance and aerial patrol.IAF bases, including those operating fighters and air defence systems, are in a high state of alert.The Navy too is part of the ongoing action, with its Boeing P-8 surveillance aircraft being used for aerial reconnaissance, map the area for troops locations and monitor the electromagnetic spectrum.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-stand-off-continues-troops-from-other-parts-mobilized-for-ladakh-frontier-101883

The regiment had fought with valour in the Second World War and has distinction of earning four battle honours and two military cross amongst other gallantry awards.The Indian team will participate in the parade alongside armed forces personnel from at least 11 countries including China.“The Indian participation in the victory day parade will be a mark of tribute to the great sacrifices made by Russia and other nations in the Second World War in which Indian soldiers also participated and made supreme sacrifice,” the ministry said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajnath-singh-to-pay-3-day-visit-to-russia-from-monday-to-attend-grand-parade-101858
20-06-2020||New Delhi||Media body calls FIR against journalist in UP an ‘act of intimidation’||A media body on Saturday described as “an act of intimidation” the filing of an FIR in Uttar Pradesh against a journalist over a report on the impact of the lockdown on a village, saying it was part of an “established pattern” of harassment of independent scribes.In a statement, the Media Foundation put on record its strong protest over the FIR filed by the Uttar Pradesh government against Supriya Sharma, executive editor of news portal Scroll.in.The case was filed against Sharma for allegedly misrepresenting facts in a report on the impact of the lockdown in a village adopted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, police sources had said on Thursday.The FIR against Sharma and the Scroll editor-in-chief is an “an act of intimidation and a case of abuse of process”, intended to discourage honest and critical reporting, the Media Foundation said.The Media Foundation was started in 1979 with the aim of upholding freedom of speech, expression and information.The FIR against Sharma is only the latest instance of similar coercive actions against professional journalists, part of “an established pattern of harassment and humiliation of independent journalists”, it said. “It is an unacceptable encroachment on press freedom,” said the foundation, whose chairperson is veteran journalist Harish Khare.The Media Foundation called upon the judiciary, and central and state governments to uphold the spirit of freedom of speech and expression as guaranteed in the Constitution.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/media-body-calls-fir-against-journalist-in-up-an-act-of-intimidation-101857
20-06-2020||New Delhi||NDA widens gap with Opposition in Rajya Sabha||With the latest round of biennial polls to the Rajya Sabha over, the BJP-led NDA has further widened its gap with the Opposition in the House, with the saffron party now having 86 seats and rival Congress merely 41.The National Democratic Alliance now has nearly 100 members in the 245-member House. If the support of friendly parties like the AIADMK (9), BJD (9), YSR Congress Party (6), and several allied nominated members and smaller parties is counted, the Modi government is unlikely to face any serious numerical challenge there.The BJP has relied on its strength in the assemblies coupled with defection from other parties--- especially the Congress---to boost its strength in the House, where its numerical disadvantage often hindered the Modi government’s legislative agenda in its first term.The Election Commission had announced biennial polls to 61 seats, including 55 in March, but the process was delayed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.With 42 members elected unopposed earlier, the Bharatiya Janata Party won eight, Congress and the YSR Congress four each and others three of the 19 seats that went to polls on Friday.The BJP won a couple of more seats than it could have on the strength of its numbers because of defection from several Congress legislators in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.In total, the BJP won 17, Congress nine, BJP ally JDU three, BJD and the TMC four each, AIADMK and DMK three each, NCP, RJD and the TRS two each, and others rest, official sources said.The crumbling strength of the Opposition, whose key pillars include the Congress, TMC and the Left, has been evident since last year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the BJP to its biggest ever victory as it bagged 303 seats in Lok Sabha election.It prompted a host of defections from the Opposition, including Rajya Sabha members of the Congress, TDP and the Samajwadi Party, to the BJP, and many non-NDA regional parties chose to back the government in Parliament on crucial issues.The Congress has accused the BJP of horse-trading, alleging that it had engineered defections from its ranks for political gains.The government managed big support in Parliament to its resolution to nullify Article 370 and key bills like the bifurcation of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into Union territories and criminal prosecution for instant divorce by Muslim men.The contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was also passed in both the Houses.Out of the 61 new members, 43 are first-timers, which include BJP’s Jyotiraditya Scindia and Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress. Both have been members of Lok Sabha, but lost in elections in 2019.Former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and former Lok Sabha deputy speaker M Thambi Durai have also been elected to Rajya Sabha.The legislative agenda of the Modi government in its first term was often hampered in Parliament due to the Opposition’s numerical superiority in the Upper House, and the Congress had more numbers than the BJP in first few years.However, the BJP’s impressive gains in the assembly elections, coupled with the Congress losing power in several states, resulted in slow but steady rise in the government’s numbers in the House.Though the below-par show of the BJP in state selections since 2018 has also meant that its goal of gaining a majority on its own in the Rajya Sabha remains far from being achieved.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nda-widens-gap-with-opposition-in-rajya-sabha-101851

20-06-2020||Satya Prakash||Plea seeks recall of SC order staying Lord Jagannath Rath Yatra||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 20Pattajoshi Mohapatra – the Hereditary Chief Servitor of Lord Jagannatha Temple, Puri – has moved the Supreme Court seeking recall of its June 18 order that stayed this year’s Rath Yatra scheduled to commence on June 23.Maintaining that an absolute bar on the performance of such an essential ritual was not necessary to protect public health, he urged the court to allow it with conditions such as social distancing and other COVID-19 norms to save “an essential, mandatory and unbroken religious tradition” of Lord Jagannatha Temple.The plea is likely to be taken up for hearing by a Vacation Bench at the earliest.The Puri Rath Yatra festival – which attracts a large number of Indian and foreign devotees and tourists – goes on for almost 20 days. Last year an estimated one million people took part in it.  Mohapatra also questioned the bona fides of Odisha Vikas Parishad – on whose petition the top court had stayed the Rath Yatra. “In fact, the very bona fides of the petitioner in the writ petition must be examined in view of the fact that the said petition was moved barely five days before the Rath Yatra despite the date of the Yatra having been in public domain for months,” said Mohapatra. Also read: SC stays Lord Jagganath's Rath Yatra due to CovidHe expressed shock and surprise over the abrupt position taken by the state government in favour of banning the Rath Yatra before the Supreme Court without notice to the primary stakeholders on a matter of an essential religious practice.He said it violated not just his right to religion but also fundamental rights of servitors, temple administrators and millions of devotees under Articles 25(1), 26 and 29 of the Constitution.Mohapatra who is the head of the Nijoga – the association of sevaks/sevayats recognised by the Shri Jagannath Temple Managing Committee under the Shri Jagannath Temple Act, 1955 – expressed surprise over the Odisha Government's decision to oppose the Rath Yatra before the Supreme Court."The state government cannot unilaterally take a position with respect to the religious practices of the temple without consulting the committee, the applicant and the Nijoga," said Mohapatra.He urged the top court to direct the temple and state authorities "to ensure the smooth and safe conduct of the Rath Yatra scheduled on June 23, 2020 in accordance with the Covid-19 guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs”.Mohapatra also suggested imposing curfew for a couple of days to have Rath Yatra without crowds."Imposition of a total curfew in the entire city of Puri for two days before the Rath Yatra and sealing of its borders to prevent outsiders from entering the city... Additional support from the CRPF can be taken for effective implementation of the curfew/lockdown," he submitted.If a curfew is imposed on the day of Rath Yatra and the Rathas are pulled with the help of earth movers, the entire journey of Lord Jagannatha from the Shri Jagannath Temple to Gundicha Mandir of around 2.8 km can be completed in less than one hour. Therefore, an absolute bar on the performance of such an essential ritual is not necessary to protect public health.The Supreme Court had on Thursday stayed the Rath Yatra in view of the rising number of COVID-19 patients."A procession of this magnitude cannot be permitted at the time of a pandemic... Lord Jagannath will not forgive us if we allow this to continue," a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had said while ordering a ban on all activities related to the Rath Yatra 2020.Mohapatra pointed out that as part of the said scaled-down and controlled preparations, the entire construction activity of the Rathas took place in a protected environment and after subjecting the 372 carpenters and other artisans to COVID-19 tests, which established they were Covid-negative. "The temple administration has been working tirelessly to ensure that all rituals are conducted in complete full compliance with the health-norms issued by the authorities. Steps have been taken to ensure that there is no gathering at the time of the Rath Yatra. No outside devotee has been allowed to enter Jagannath Temple from the beginning of lockdown till date," the recall application read."As of now, all four sides of Jagannath Mandir stand sealed and the entire town of Puri is proposed to be put on complete curfew until completion of the Rath Yatra with full cooperation from people of Puri," the applicant submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-seeks-recall-of-sc-order-staying-lord-jagannath-rath-yatra-101847

However, he was rearrested in Los Angeles 10 days back.A special court here had issued an arrest warrant against Rana on August 28, 2018.According to the federal prosecutors in the US, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana conspired with Headley, his childhood friend, and others located in Pakistan to assist the LeT and the Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US-designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks.The 2008 Mumbai attack was one of India’s most horrific terrorist attacks in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily- armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem.

What makes it worst is the kind of language you are using. It signifies the ‘sanskriti’ (culture) of your family. The language you are using is not a part of the Indian culture. But then when you could not respect your own Prime Minister (Manmohan Singh) how will you respect Narendra Modi,” he said in an apparent reference to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s strong remarks against the Prime Minister.“I want to assure that the martyrdom of the soldiers will not go in vain,” Nadda said addressing the first virtual rally after a gap of two days.“They were not only your sons but the sons of the entire country,” he told the families of the 20 Indian soldiers martyred on the LAC.After the attack, the BJP had cancelled all its political programmes, including virtual rallies, to honour the supreme sacrifice made by 20 Indian soldiers at the LAC for two days. The ruling party has been under attack for carrying out its political programmes despite the COVID-19 crisis and tension at the LAC.Nadda said the party needed to be kept activated despite the lockdown.“Can the party also go under lockdown? It has to be kept activated and galvanised,” he said appreciating all those behind the plan of holding virtual rallies to mark one year of the Narendra Modi government 2.0.Recounting the work done by the BJP-led government in the past six years, he said after late Lal Bahadur Shastri, Narendra Modi was the only Prime Minister on whose one call the entire country responded.Slamming the Congress for “doing petty politics at the time when the country is going through difficult times”, he said first they criticised the lockdown even when their own Chief Ministers supported the move, adding: “Then they criticised the opening up of the lockdown when their own CMs were pleading for it with the PM.”“Your own CMs are not listening to you,” Nadda saidNadda also said the BJP would return to power in Rajasthan, a state currently ruled by the Congress, at the first opportunity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-prez-nadda-reiterates-no-incursions-on-indian-soil-slams-irresponsible-opposition-doing-petty-politics-101839

She was sad and had stopped talking to the family members."Her family members said she went into her room and bolted it from inside. When she did not open the door despite repeated knocks, they broke it open to find her hanging from the ceiling," a police officer said.Police initially registered a case of death under suspicious circumstances. The subsequent investigations revealed that she was a die-hard fan of Sushant Singh and had been watching the videos of the actor ever since his suicide.An autopsy was conducted on the body and the investigations proved that it was a case of suicide, the police officer said.

They also wondered whether Modi gave a clean chit to China over the standoff.Also read: After Modi says no incursions, China claims Galwan Valley"The sacrifices of the soldiers of the 16 Bihar Regiment foiled the attempt of the Chinese side to erect structures and also cleared the attempted transgression at this point of the LAC on that day," the PMO said."The words of the prime minister 'those who tried to transgress our land were taught a befitting lesson by our brave sons of soil' succinctly summed up the ethos and the values of our armed forces," it said.The PMO said Modi assured that India's armed forces would leave no stone unturned to protect the country's borders."Attempts are being made in some quarters to give a mischievous interpretation to remarks by the prime minister at the all-party meeting on Friday," it said.

Yet minimum court etiquette in terms of what can be considered a decent dress, background, etc should be followed, given the public nature of the hearings,” the court said as it accepted the lawyer’s apology. In April this year, a similar incident had come to light when a lawyer had appeared in a bail hearing conducted through video-conferencing in a vest, drawing the ire of the Rajasthan High Court, which had pulled up the lawyer for not being properly dressed.The Supreme Court, high courts and district courts have been functioning in a restricted manner via video conferencing due to COVID-19 lockdown.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lawyer-appears-in-virtual-hearing-while-lying-on-bed-sc-says-minimum-court-etiquette-be-followed-101833

At a time when the entire nation is united, the Congress leader should also rise above petty politics and stand in solidarity with national interest,” Shah said.A brave armyman’s father speaks and he has a very clear message for Mr. Rahul Gandhi. At a time when the entire nation is united, Mr. Rahul Gandhi should also rise above petty politics and stand in solidarity with national interest. https://t.co/BwT4O0JOvl  “The Indian Army is a strong force and can defeat China. Rahul Gandhi, don’t indulge in politics in this...my son fought in the Army and will continue fighting in the Army,” the father can be seen saying in the video.On Friday, a day after BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra called Rahul the "most irresponsible politician” in the country, BJP vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe penned a letter to the Congress leader, ticking him off for calling India’s elected Prime Minister a “coward” and accusing him of "endangering" the unity of the country in a difficult time.“By making the most irresponsible and disgusting accusation of cowardice against an elected Prime Minister, you have endangered the unity of the country in a difficult time,” the senior BJP leader told Gandhi in his two-page letter.However, while the BJP leadership is quoting agreements between India and China that prohibit armies of both countries from using any weapon within two km of border to trash his statements, Gandhi is not the only person holding differing views in the debate regarding the standard-operating procedure in such circumstances.Some military experts say that under such circumstances even if a forward team went ahead for negotiations with the Chinese along the LAC, there was a laid-down response mechanism allowing the use of firearms in the face of enemy action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-quotes-injured-soldiers-father-to-blunt-rahul-attack-on-lac-killings-101832

What is the government’s answer to this claim? Will the Government of India reject this claim?” former minister and Congress veteran P Chidambaram asked.The Congress leader said the Chinese narrative is consistent with what they have been articulating for the past week, but PM Modi’s remarks have come as a shock.“The PM says there’s no intrusion in the Indian territory. The PM must then define what Indian territory is,” said Chidambaram.Urging the government to focus on the present and not on the past, Chidambaram said the Prime Minister’s concluding remarks on Friday had left practically everyone baffled and bewildered.Also read: After Modi says no incursions, China claims Galwan ValleyAlso read: Ready to counter any situation at LAC in Ladakh, says IAF chiefThe PM said, “No outsider was inside the Indian territory in Ladakh.”“It is quite obvious that the PM’s statement contradicts the earlier statements made by the Chief of Army Staff, the Defence Minister and the Foreign Minister. If the PM’s statement reflects the correct position, we would like to ask the government a few questions,” said Chidambaram.He said, “If no Chinese troops had crossed the LAC and are in Indian territory, what was the ‘face-off’ on May 5-6, 2020?  Between May 5 and June 6, what was the issue on which local Indian commanders were talking to their Chinese counterparts? What was the subject matter of the negotiations between the Corps Commanders of the two countries on June 6?The Congress leader said if no Chinese troops were inside the Indian territory, where did the clashes take place on June 15-16 and where were 20 Indian soldiers killed and 85 injured?“If no Chinese troops are in the Indian territory, why did Foreign Minister Jaishankar’s statement and other statements of MEA demand the “restoration of status quo ante”? What was the meaning of “status quo ante”? What was the meaning of the “disengagement” that the government said was “under way”?” asked Chidambaram.The Congress also asked what the PM meant when he said “sacrifice of our soldiers will not go in vain”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-govt-reject-chinese-claim-to-galwan-valley-asks-chidambaram-101828
20-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi LG’s reservations over home isolation resolved, home quarantine system to continue: Sisodia||Amid objections by the Kejriwal government to his order for mandatory five-day institutional quarantine for COVID-19 patients, Lt-Governor Anil Baijal on Saturday said it would be required for only those who do not need hospitalisation and do not have adequate facilities for home isolation.   The order of five-day mandatory institutional quarantine was opposed by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Deputy Manish Sisodia in a meeting of Delhi State Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Saturday.The Lt-Governor after the meeting said in a tweet, “Regarding institutional isolation, only those COVID positive cases which do not require hospitalisation on clinical assessment & do not have adequate facilities for home isolation would be required to undergo institutional isolation.”In another tweet, he said the DDMA approved recommendations of a high-level expert committee for fixing subsidised rates for COVID-19 treatment in private hospitals of Delhi.Sisodia said after the meeting that the LG’s reservations over home isolation were resolved in the SDMA meeting and the home quarantine system will continue.“The reservations of LG over home isolation were resolved in the SDMA meeting and the home isolation system will continue. We thank LG for this. Under the leadership of our Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, we will not let Delhi people have any inconvenience,” he tweeted.Earlier, opposing the Lt Governor’s order issued on Friday for mandatory five-day institutional quarantine, Sisodia had said, “Every day more than 3,000 patients are coming for COVID-19 treatment. According to the figures by the Health Department, by June 30 we will have one lakh patients, by July 15 , we will have 1.25 lakh patients,  and by July 31 we will have almost 5.25 lakh patients. This will be the scenario if we continue with the home isolation system.”Sisodia said the meeting also decided that 100 per cent COVID beds in private hospitals will be subsidised up to an upper limit of 60 per cent of total hospital capacity.“The Central government committee had recommended reducing rates of 60 per cent COVID beds in private hospitals, so less number of beds was available at lower rates. Now, 100 per cent beds will be available at lower rates,” he said in another tweet. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-lgs-reservations-over-home-isolation-resolved-home-quarantine-system-to-continue-sisodia-101823

These include 27 ‘Aspirational Districts’.The campaign will be implemented for 125 days with the possibility of its further extension.These districts are estimated to cover about two-thirds of the migrant workers in the country who were destabilised during the lockdown.The villages across 116 districts in six states participated in the programme through the Common Service Centres and Krishi Vigyan Kendras.The Abhiyaan will involve intensified and focused implementation of 25 different types of works to provide employment to the migrant workers on the one hand and create infrastructure in the rural regions of the country on the other, with a resource envelope of Rs 50,000 crore.The Abhiyaan will be a coordinated effort between 12 different ministries and departments, namely rural development, panchayati raj, road transport and highways, mines, drinking water and sanitation, environment, railways, petroleum and natural gas, new and renewable energy, border roads, telecom and agriculture.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-launches-garib-kalyan-rozgar-abhiyaan-to-generate-employment-for-migrants-101821

"In response to the strong demand of the Chinese side, India agreed to withdraw the personnel who crossed the LAC and demolish the facilities, and so they did.”On June 6, the border troops of both countries held a commander-level meeting and reached consensus on easing the situation. The Indian side, he said, promised that they would not cross the estuary of the Galwan river to patrol and build facilities and the two sides would discuss and decide phased withdrawal of troops through the meetings between commanders on the ground. Also read: Will govt reject Chinese claim to Galwan Valley, asks ChidambaramAlso read: Ready to counter any situation at LAC in Ladakh, says IAF chief"Shockingly, on the evening of June 15, India's front-line troops, in violation of the agreement reached at the commander-level meeting, once again crossed the Line of Actual Control for deliberate provocation when the situation in the Galwan Valley was already easing, and even violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went there for negotiation, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties." "The adventurous acts of the Indian Army have seriously undermined the stability of the border areas, threatened the lives of Chinese personnel, violated the agreements reached between the two countries on the border issue, and breached the basic norms governing international relations," the spokesperson said.Beijing, he said, hoped India would work with China, follow faithfully the important consensus reached between the two leaders, abide by the agreements reached between the two governments, and strengthen communication and coordination on properly managing the current situation through diplomatic and military channels, and jointly uphold peace and stability in the border areas.

20-06-2020||Vibha Sharma||BJP gained critical ground in Upper House but ‘fails to destabilise’ Congress-led Rajasthan govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 20Elections to the 19 Rajya Sabha seats on Friday saw the ruling BJP winning two in Madhya Pradesh and the rival Congress one. In Rajasthan, the fortunes reversed with the BJP bagging one seat and the Congress two.Overall, the ruling party managed to gain crucial ground in the Upper House, winning eight of the 19 seats in the first major electoral exercise since the COVID-19 outbreak, however, it failed to get that one extra seat from Rajasthan amid allegations of “poaching” by the Congress ahead of crucial polls.Earlier, it had won three seats unopposed.To say the BJP did not try a Madhya Pradesh or a Karnataka in Rajasthan to win one extra seat from Rajasthan is difficult to believe as much as its leaders may deny, observers say. Otherwise, why would it have fielded a second candidate knowing well it did not have the numbers?Its second candidate in Rajasthan lost on Friday.Interestingly, despite “rumours” of various shades and sorts, including that Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot “hobnobbing” with the BJP, the general consensus was that even if the saffron party was trying a Madhya Pradesh or a Karnataka in Rajasthan, it will not be as easy.The Congress had publicly made the allegations of attempts by the BJP to lure its MLAs and destabilise its government in Rajasthan on the lines of Madhya Pradesh.There could be many reasons why it may not have succeeded, observers say.One, Madhya Pradesh is the ‘garh’, the bastion, of the BJP and its ideological fountainhead, the RSS. The same cannot be said for Rajasthan.Then, the Congress Chief Minister in Rajasthan, Ashok Gehlot, is a “seasoned and shrewd” politician.  He has been a student leader, the state party president, MLA, Lok Sabha MP, Union Minister and is the CM for the third time in the state.“Gehlot is someone who has seen it all unlike Kamal Nath in Madhya Pradesh whose area of influence was limited to Chhindwara,” they say.Besides, unlike Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot was given important positions in the state by his Central leadership. He is the Deputy CM and also the president of the state Congress.Also, the gap between the BJP and the Congress is bigger in Rajasthan and the state unit is “not as divided” as it was in Madhya Pradesh which has least four different camps operating in it.The saffron party had challenged Gehlot to prove the allegations that it is trying to “destabilise his government and indulging in poaching” ahead of the Rajya Sabha poll. It had blamed his trouble on “internal differences” in the party.Observers, who claim that “signs of ‘Operation Lotus’ were all there in Rajasthan, say “it is possible that Gehlot may have been trying to increase his importance in eyes of the central leadership”.“He has good relations across the party lines,” they say.This even as BJP’s friend-turned-foe Shiv Sena also accused it of trying to destabilise the Rajasthan government during the pandemic.“There are also rumours that Sachin Pilot met the BJP bigwigs in Delhi. It may be wrong, but this is like a warning bell for the Congress camp,” Shiv Sena had warned in its mouthpiece Saamana.Meanwhile, the BJP-led NDA as taken its tally to 101 in the 245-member Upper House with the majority mark of 123.Elections to 24 seats in 10 states were initially scheduled for March 26, but they were deferred due to COVID-19 lockdown.Four candidates in Karnataka, including former PM HD Devegowda, and one in Arunachal Pradesh were elected unopposed.Polling of remaining seats was held on Friday. Altogether, the NDA won 11 of the 24 seats.Backed by parties such as the BJD, the ADMK and the YSR Congress Party, it can breach the halfway mark and push key legislations easily.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-gained-critical-ground-in-upper-house-but-fails-to-destabilise-congress-led-rajasthan-govt-101807

20-06-2020||Los Angeles||Mumbai 26/11 key conspirator arrested in LA; faces extradition to India||A Chicago businessman, who spent more than 10 years in prison for supporting terrorist groups, has been arrested in Los Angeles to face charges in India for Mumbai 26/11 attack in 2008 that killed more than 160 people, US prosecutors said Friday.Tahawwur Rana, a Pakistani-born Canadian, was convicted of a crime related to the Mumbai 26/11 killings that are sometimes called India’s 9/11, though the US prosecutors had failed to prove a terrorism charge that connected him directly to the three-day rampage during his 2011 trial.Rana, 59, was serving a 14-year sentence when he was granted early release from a Los Angeles federal prison last week because of poor health and a bout of COVID-19, prosecutors said. He was arrested two days later and remains in custody in LA because he faces extradition to India on murder conspiracy charges, prosecutors said.Also read: Rana’s extradition will throw light on ISI activities: Special public prosecutorRana was convicted in Chicago of providing support for the Pakistani terror group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, which planned the India attack, and for supporting a never-carried-out plot to attack a Danish newspaper that printed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in 2005. The cartoons angered many Muslims because pictures of the prophet are prohibited in Islam.Jurors cleared Rana of a more serious charge of providing support to the 10 men who carried out the attacks in Mumbai that killed 166, injured nearly 240 and caused $1.5 billion in damage.Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian told the court that the Indian government, as per the bilateral Extradition Treaty signed in 1997, has requested the arrest and detention of Rana with a view towards his extradition.Lulejian said India has informed the United States that Rana is being prosecuted for a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, in violation of Sections 120B and 302, and murder in violation of Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Rana has also been charged with conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating and conspiracy to use as genuine a forged document or electronic record.He made an initial court appearance on June 11.On Friday, US District Judge Jacqueline Chooljian in the US District Court, Central District of California, scheduled his bond hearing for June 30.His attorney has been asked to submit his plea by June 22 and the federal government’s response is due by June 26.Lulejian said that the offences for which Rana's arrest warrant was issued are covered by Article 2 of the India-US Extradition Treaty.An arrest warrant was issued against Rana in India by Poonam A Bamba, District and Sessions Judge, Special Court of India's premier investigation agency National Investigation Agency (NIA), on August 28, 2018.According to the federal prosecutors, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana conspired with his childhood friend David Coleman Headley, also known as “Daood Gilani”, and others located in Pakistan to assist Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US-designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks.Rana was first arrested in Chicago on October 18, 2009. Thereafter he went to trial in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois where Headley testified for the prosecution.The jury convicted him of one count of Conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism in Denmark, and one count of providing material support to LeT.The jury, however, acquitted Rana of one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism in India.Rana’s lawyer said he had been duped by his high school buddy, David Coleman Headley, an admitted terrorist who plotted the Mumbai attacks and the government’s chief witness who testified to avoid the death penalty. The defence called Headley a habitual liar and manipulator.Rana was accused of allowing Headley to open a branch of his Chicago-based immigration law business in Mumbai as a cover story and travel as a representative of the company in Denmark.Prosecutors said Rana knew Headley had trained as a terrorist. Headley shared information of the scouting missions he conducted in Mumbai and of the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, where gunmen later slaughtered dozens of people.Harry D Leinenweber, US District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sentenced Rana to a 168-month prison term.On May 7 this year, Rana filed a motion for compassionate release in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.In his motion, Rana claimed that he has tested positive for the COVID-19, and his precarious medical conditions put him at the extreme risk of life-threatening complications.Rana also asked the court to reduce his sentence and allow him to return to Canada.Headley, who was born in the US to a Pakistani father and American mother, said his hatred of India dated to his childhood when his school was bombed by Indian military planes during a war between the countries in 1971.His petition was rejected by Rebecca R Pallmeyer, Chief US District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois on May 18.He filed a second petition — Renewed Motion for Compassionate Release — on June 4. Five days later on June 9, Judge Leinenweber granted Rana’s motion, reduced his sentence to time served and ordered his immediate release, while leaving intact all other aspects of his criminal conviction.Rana was serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island in San Pedro, California.Given that he is a Canadian citizen, the Department of Homeland Security has filed an immigration detainer for him with the Bureau of Prisons.He was formally rearrested the very next day on June 10. The Bureau of Prisons is currently holding Rana at that facility pursuant to the immigration detainer.Luiejian told the court in his submission dated June 10 that a formal request for extradition from the Indian government, supported by the documents specified in the Treaty, will be presented and finalised within the time required under the Treaty.Months after the Mumbai 26/11 attacks, Headley, who did not take part in the attacks, told Rana he was “even with the Indians now,” according to a court document. Rana said they deserved it.Headley, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder, was sentenced to 35 years in prison. As part of his plea deal, he can’t be extradited to India.The 2008 Mumbai 26/11 attack was one of India’s most horrific terrorist attacks in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem in Mumbai on November 26, 2008.Pakistani national Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, was hanged to death on November 21, 2012. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-26-11-key-conspirator-arrested-in-la-faces-extradition-to-india-101805
20-06-2020||New Delhi||PM has surrendered Indian land to Chinese: Rahul||Opposition Congress today came down heavily on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his remarks that the Chinese were not on Indian territory and not an inch or Indian land had been lost.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi led the charge levelling direct charges on Prime Minister Narendra Modi accusing him of surrendering the Indian land to the Chinese.A day after the PM told an all party meeting of political party leaders that neither the Chinese have intruded on Indian land nor hold any posts here, Gandhi tweeted asking if that was the case why were Indian soldiers killed and where were they killed.“PM has surrendered Indian territory to Chinese aggression. If the land was Chinese: 1. Why were our soldiers killed? 2. Where were they killed?“ Gandhi tweeted on Saturday.Gandhi’s senior colleague and former Home Minister P Chidambaram also posed a series of questions to the PM over the latter’s assertions about the LAC situation.“PM said there is no foreigner (meaning Chinese) in Indian territory. If this is true, what was the fuss about May 5-6? Why was there a fight between troops on June 16-17? Why did India lose 20 lives?“ asked Chidambaram.The Congress veteran also said if there was no intrusion by Chinese troops at all, what did the Corps Commanders talk about on June 6?“Was it about the weather?If no Chinese troops had crossed the LAC into Indian territory, why did Foreign Minister Jaishankar’s statement refer to “restoration of status quo ante”?“ Chidambaram added.He said if there was no intrusion or violation of LAC, why was there so much talk about “disengagement” of troops by both sides?“Has PM given a clean chit to China? If so, what is there to negotiate with China? Why are the Major Generals negotiating and about what?” asked Chidambaram.Another Congress leader and former minister Jairam Ramesh also took to Twitter to call PM’s assertions shocking.“PM's statement last night is baffling, shocking and devastating. It has infuriated the armed forces and every Indian. If there was no incursion then what was it-an excursion? Geography and history seem to have been changed with these too-clever-by-half lines. Indians deserve the truth,” Ramesh said in indications that the Congress would step up its offensive on the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-has-surrendered-indian-land-to-chinese-rahul-101804

It has been brought to our notice that the advertisement issued by Hindustan Unilever for Lifebuoy Virus Fighter Cosmetic Soap in TV media, social media, has misleading claims of having prophylactic properties, hence prevents and mitigates viral infection in violation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act by showing pictorial depiction of Covid-19 virus suggesting Lifebuoy Virus Fighter is effective to destroy/prevent viral infection,” said the Drug controller, noting that the claims made by the product place it in the category of a drug which it is not.The drug regulator said Lifebuoy soap manufactured under a licence issued for cosmetics cannot make therapeutic claims under the law as it is not licensed as a drug.

It asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to speak to all states and UTs to ensure compliance with its order and to give it due publicity.The clarification from the top court came after some advocates alleged that its June 9 order was not being followed in letter and spirit.The Bench disapproval of the Karnataka High Court’s June 18 order that said the 15-day deadline set by the Supreme Court was not mandatory.“You must inform Karnataka that our order is mandatory,” the Bench told Mehta.In its June 9 order, the top court had asked all states/UTs to identify stranded migrant workers willing to return home and send them by train/bus in 15 days.It had also asked them to consider withdrawal of criminal cases lodged against migrant labourers for alleged violation of the lockdown.Central Vista projectThe Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay the ground work pertaining to Central Vista redevelopment project in Lutyens’ zone of the national capital.A Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar said it couldn’t restrain the authorities from acting as per law just because spade work for environmental clearance for the project has been questioned before it.However, it said, “If the government goes ahead when we are seized of this, it will be at its own risk and cost.”The top court asked the government to respond to Rajeev Suri’s petition challenging the project on the ground that there was an illegal change in land use.While posting the matter for further hearing on July 7, the Bench also allowed Suri to amend his petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/follow-15-day-deadline-on-sending-migrants-home-sc-asks-states-101490

For the first time in recent years, China’s tensions with India are openly figuring in American calculus for the region.‘PLA invaded same area in 2015 too’The PLA invaded this contested area deeper and longer in 2015, with more people, than ever before historically. We don’t have a lot of visibility and we don’t have a lot of open dialogue with our Chinese counterparts — David Stilwell, Senior US OfficialSpeaking on the India-China border clashes immediately after high-level talks between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Chinese Communist Party Politburo member Yang Jiechi, a senior US government official wondered whether the Chinese incursions into the Indian territory since 2015 were a negotiating tactic or “just a punch in the nose to demonstrate their superiority”.However, the US has clubbed China’s friction with India along with its other long-standing regional disputes such as South China Sea and Hong Kong issues to assert that “the actions that we’ve seen out of China have been not really constructive”, according to Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the US State Department David Stilwell.The US is watching the India-China border dispute “very closely” and finds the current activity at the Galwan valley and Pangong Tso as similar to the activity in the past on border disputes. In this respect, he mentioned Xi Jinping’s India visit in 2015 when the PLA invaded the same contested area “deeper and longer, with more people, than ever before historically. Then we saw the Doklam issue down near Bhutan, where we saw similar concerns”.“We don’t have a lot of visibility and we don’t have a lot of open dialogue with our Chinese counterparts, and honestly I’d like to see more of that if we can,” he added.For the most part India was however a footnote as the US-China dialogue in Honolulu revolved around safeguarding American interests, including full transparency to combat the ongoing pandemic, implementing phase one of the Indo-US trade deal, North Korea, Hong Kong, South China Sea and provocative behaviour around Taiwan.Stilwell described the US-China relationship overall as intense. “This is terra incognita for the Chinese. They never had a US government actually stand up and insist that they follow through on their commitments,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-becomes-a-factor-in-us-talks-with-china-101491

The video-conference meet came with its share of controversy with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party taking exception for not being there under a yardstick of limiting participation to parties with at least five MPs.The PM said the country had the capability and no one could dare to eye even an inch of India’s land. During the past few years priority was accorded to fortify the borders with special emphasis on infrastructure.It was because of this infrastructure that the capacity to patrol had increased, which in turn allowed increased vigil and knowledge about activities on the LAC. The Indian forces were now patrolling areas not possible earlier. The soldiers were carrying out confrontations in such areas, leading to rise in tension, he said. The boycott of Chinese goods, prevention of dumping of low-quality merchandise by China and a mood of intense anger against things Chinese were flagged by three participants with one suggesting Covid-19 as a possible biological weapon, sources privy to the discussions said.Hailing the bravery of armed forces, leaders of the political parties expressed commitment to the government stand. The meeting was not without its share of strong questions coming from the Congress, with Sonia Gandhi urging the PM to ensure status quo was restored and China moved back. She sought to know the way forward. Seeking to know the sequence of events leading to the loss of 20 Indian soldiers, she asked if the government thought of the development a failure of intelligence.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said her party stood strongly in solidarity with the government. Nitish Kumar said that there should be no differences amongst the leaders and parties should not allow any disunity which could be exploited by other nations. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) said the government should initiate talks so that steps were taken to clearly demarcate the LAC to maintain peace on the border. Party general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the party favoured extending support to the stand taken by India in talks between the two Foreign Ministers that neither side would take any action to escalate matters and instead ensure peace and tranquillity as per bilateral agreements and protocols.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-intrusion-no-post-under-occupation-pm-101533
