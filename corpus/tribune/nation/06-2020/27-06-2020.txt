I thank Radha Soami Satsang Beas and all others who helped to create this huge Covid care facility. This 10,000-bed centre would provide huge relief to the people of Delhi,” Shah tweeted after the visit.The home minister also applauded the “courageous” ITBP personnel, who would be operating the facility “during these trying times”.“Their commitment to serve nation and people of Delhi is unparalleled.

27-06-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi should condemn China publicly for incursions: Congress||The Congress on Saturday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to publicly condemn China for its “brazen incursions” into Indian territory and urged the government to take “strong and quick action” to resolve the Line of Actual Control (LAC) issue.Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said at a virtual press conference that the Prime Minister should address the nation and promise that anyone capturing Indian territory would be pushed back.He said the entire nation and the entire opposition would stand behind him and his promise.Alleging that the last six years have seen the biggest diplomatic failure under the Modi government, the former Union minister said “some quick action” should be taken to resolve the LAC issue with China.“Some quick action is required,” he said seeking early resolution of the border dispute with China, while noting that diplomacy and economic blockade with China would not work.“Yes, the action should be strong (against China). The quality, nature and the timing of that action has to be decided by the government,” he said when asked what “quick action” he was asking for. Sibal said it was for the government to decide and not the opposition.The Congress leader alleged that China has erected tents and structures near PP-14 in Galwan Valley, the place where 20 Indian soldiers sacrificed their lives. He added that satellite imagery also reflects construction of new black top roads by Chinese forces on the Galwan riverbed, erection of large numbers of military tents and presence of bulldozers and other heavy equipment.“What is our government doing about it? The PM must clear the air and condemn these brazen Chinese incursions,” he said.Asking why the Prime Minister does not openly and publicly condemn the “brazen acts of infiltrations, incursions and occupation” of Indian territory by China, he said, “I want the PM to publicly condemn China. We will support the prime minister.”             Sibal said the situation is such that the PM’s statement that nobody intruded into India is being used by the Chinese globally.“We want the prime minister to address the nation and promise that if anyone has captured Indian territory, we will push them back. If you say so, the public and the entire opposition will stand behind you and your promise,” he said.There has been a standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in the eastern Ladakh area for over a month and a bloody clash took place between them on the night of June 15 in the Galwan Valley, resulting in the death of 20 Indian soldiers.

27-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi government begins serological survey as COVID-19 cases cross 80,000-mark||Authorities in Delhi on Saturday started a mammoth task of conducting serological survey to comprehensively analyse the spread of COVID-19 as the number of cases in the national capital crossed the 80,000-mark.Addressing an online briefing, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said there was no shortage of beds for COVID-19 patients in Delhi for now, saying his government has significantly raised the number of beds in the past one month and diagnosis has been ramped up to 20,000 tests per day.He said “five weapons” are being used by his government in the fight against coronavirus besides ramping up number of beds---testing and isolation, providing oximeters and oxygen concentrators, plasma therapy, screening and survey.    Kejriwal and Union Home Minister Amit Shah also visited Radha Saomi Satsang, a 10,000-bed facility in south Delhi, and reviewed the centre, which will be maintained by the Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP).    The national capital recorded 2,948 fresh coronavirus cases in a 24-hour span since Friday, taking the total case count 80,188. The death toll went up to 2,588 with 66 more fatalities reported. There are 28,329 active cases in the national capital. After June 22, it was for the first time that the number of daily cases fell below the 3,000-mark in the city. As cases continued to rise, the Delhi Government and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) started serological survey in the national capital. Part of the revised Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), the survey has to be completed by July 10.Kejriwal said the survey will cover 20,000 people and determine the extent of coronavirus spread in Delhi. The survey started in the central district, officials said, adding that the response was good from the public and 450 blood samples were collected on the first day. The target for the day was to collect 700 samples, the official said, adding that the district has deployed 30 teams comprising ASHA workers and lab technicians for collecting samples. The survey also began at Kewal Park area in north Delhi, a north district official said. The official added that the emphasis was on putting logistics to the ground. The response of the people will be known in the next two-three days. Nine teams have been formed to complete the survey, the official said. In southwest district, the collection of samples commenced in some areas but will start in full swing from Sunday, an official said. According to an official from east district, the NCDC would train lab technicians on how to collect samples on Saturday and they were likely to commence the exercise from Monday. Similarly, in the Southeast district, the survey did not start on Saturday as logistics were being worked out. An official from northeast district said the survey had not yet begun there and will begin from Monday.Two house-to-house surveys---one in the containment zones and another across the national capital---are also being conducted by the Delhi government. In his online briefing, Kejriwal said the coronavirus spread faster than it was expected to do in Delhi, after lifting of lockdown restrictions, and death figures rose in initial days due to lack of required bed facility for infected patients. By May 15, coronavirus spread very rapidly and from first week of June, there was shortage of beds and testing. Since there was shortage of beds, the death figure also started rising, he said. “Earlier I received phone calls for beds late in the night. That has stopped now. Currently there is no shortage of beds for corona patients but we are still ramping up the beds that could be needed in future,” he said.The government had option to either continue lockdown or fight the virus and it chose the second after consulting people.On adding the number of beds, Kejriwal said the government took decision to attach hotels to hospitals, and created 3,500 beds in these hotels. At Radha Soami Satsang premises, arrangements for 2,000 beds are complete. Ten thousand beds will be arranged at the earliest, he said.Also, at Delhi government’s Burari hospital, 450 beds have been arranged, he said.        The Union Health Ministry said a 1,000-bed full-fledged hospital for COVID-19 patients in Delhi, developed by DRDO and to be manned by doctors and paramedical staff from the Army would be functional next week from an area near Dhaula Kuan.To bolster COVID-19 management efforts in the national capital, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has supplied diagnostic material for carrying out 4.7 lakh RT-PCR tests to the 12 functional labs in Delhi till date, the Health Ministry said.   It has provided 1.57 lakh RNA extraction kits essential for carrying out tests and 2.84 lakh VTMs (Viral Transport Medium) used for collecting and transporting swabs to laboratories, it added.

27-06-2020||Kathmandu||Nepal-India border issue figures during Nepal Communist Party’s high-level meeting||Nepal-India border dispute and a proposed USD 500 million US grant assistance to Kathmandu were among the major issues discussed during the ongoing meeting of the ruling Nepal Communist Party’s powerful Standing Committee here on Saturday, sources said.Nepal last week completed the process of redrawing the country’s political map through a Constitutional amendment, incorporating three strategically important Indian areas.India has termed as “untenable” the “artificial enlargement” of the territorial claims by Nepal after its Parliament unanimously approved the new political map of the country featuring Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura areas which India maintains belong to it.On Saturday, most of the speakers of the 48-member Standing Committee deliberated on the Nepal-India border issue and described the government’s recent move to redraw the country’s political map incorporating Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura through Constitution amendment as “measures to consolidating Nepal’s national unity and sovereignty”, according to sources.They, however, raised questions on the government’s inability to hold talks with India on the border issue.Speaking at the meeting, Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali claimed that India did not show any interest in holding a dialogue with Nepal on the border issue despite Kathmandu’s repeated efforts, according to senior leader of the NCP Ganesh Shah, who was also present at the meeting.“Nepal seeks to resolve the border dispute through political dialogue and will continuously initiate for talks to resolve the matter through dialogue,” Gyawali said. Even Indian television channels and print media are highlighting the border issue, he told the meeting.India has said that Nepal’s action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks.“This artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable. It is also violative of our current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues,” Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said earlier this month in New Delhi.The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.The Standing Committee will meet again on Tuesday, in which besides the border dispute other issues such as containing the coronavirus, the citizenship bill, US Millennium Challenge Corporation and evaluation of the government’s performance will mainly figure, Shah told PTI.Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, who faced criticism within his party for skipping the first and the second day of the Standing Committee meetings held at the Prime Minister’s official residence at Baluwatar, attended the meeting on Saturday, but briefly. His aides said that he could not attend the earlier meetings due to his other busy schedule and health reason.Oli briefly attended Saturday’s meeting and left the venue, citing health reason, the sources said, adding that he did not speak at the meeting.Prime Minister Oli’s absence in the first two days of the meetings showed the growing differences between him and party’s executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, a senior NCP leader said on condition of anonymity.Prachanda has time and again spoke about lack of coordination between the government and the party and he was pressing for one-man one position system to be followed by the NCP.The way the Oli government is handling the coronavirus outbreak is one of the key issues on which the two leaders have differences.Prime Minister Oli had turned deaf ear towards Prachanda’s advice to form an all-party committee to monitor the country’s COVID-19 situation and the government’s strategy to contain it.It is also learnt that Oli wants the Parliament to ratify the USD 500 million US Millennium Challenge Corporation agreement while the rival faction wants it to be ratified only after some amendments to the deal.

27-06-2020||---||BJP intensifies attack on Congress, Gandhis||New Delhi, June 27Intensifying attack against the Congress, particularly the Gandhis, BJP president Jagat Prakash Nadda, on Saturday asked the Opposition party and its interim president Sonia Gandhi 10 questions, including alleged links between the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) and China.Nadda said under the cover of border disputes with China and the coronavirus crisis, Sonia Gandhi should not shy away from the serious questions the nation wants to know.The nation is asking several questions of the Gandhi family. Gandhi family should answer for their sins, he said, asserting that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is safe and secure with its brave armed forces fully capable of protecting the country and its sovereignty. Alleging that national interest was “sacrificed” and donations into the family-run foundation were accepted, Nadda said the RGF, which is headed by Sonia Gandhi, continuously received donations from the Chinese embassy between 2005 and 09, from the "tax haven" of Luxemburg between 2006 and 09 and NGOs with commercial interests.Nadda asked the Congress party to come clean on its "links" with China, and the details of its MoU with the Communist Party of China. He said India's trade deficit with China soared to USD 36.2 billion in 2013-14 from USD 1.1 billion in 2004 and asked if it was "quid pro quo" from the Congress."Why did the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, headed by Sonia Gandhi, accept money from the Chinese government and Chinese Embassy? Isn’t it a shame, sacrificing national interest by accepting money from foreign powers for personal trusts?" he asked."What was the hurry for the East Asia FTA, which included China… later PM Modi came out of the RCEP. Correspondingly, India’s trade deficit with China was allowed to increase from an almost negligible $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to as much as $36.2 billion in 2013-14,” said Nadda.“Why did the Congress weaken India’s economic position? Was this the quid pro quo for accepting Chinese money by Rajiv Gandhi Foundation?" the BJP leader asked as he sought to know the exact relationship between the Congress party and the Communist Party of China.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-intensifies-attack-on-congress-gandhis-105313

27-06-2020||Satara||China grabbed 45,000 sq km of Indian land post-1962 war: Pawar||Amidst a war of words between the Congress and the BJP over the face-off with China, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday said national security matters shouldn’t be politicised and added one cannot forget China had captured about 45000 sq km of Indian land after the 1962 war.Pawar’s comments came in response to a query about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s charge that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had surrendered Indian territory to the Chinese aggression.Pawar also said the Galwan Valley incident in Ladakh cannot immediately be labelled as a failure of the Defence Minister, as Indian soldiers were alert during patrolling.Speaking to reporters here, the former Union Minister said the entire episode is “sensitive” in nature.It was China which played the provocateur in the Galwan Valley, he said.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash with their Chinese counterpart in eastern Ladakh on the night of June 15.The former Defence Minister further said India had been constructing a road in the Galwan valley within its limits meant for communication purposes.“What happened was they (the Chinese troops) tried to encroach on our road and were pushed physically. It was not somebody’s failure. If somebody comes (within your territory) while you are patrolling, they may come at any time. We cannot immediately say it is the failure of the Defence Minister sitting in Delhi,” Pawar said.Patrolling was on there. There was a scuffle, which means you were alert. Had you not been, you would not even have realised when they (Chinese troops) came and went.“Hence, I don’t think it is right to make such an allegation at this juncture,” he said.Responding to the allegation raised by Rahul Gandhi, Pawar said one cannot forget that China captured around 45,000 sq km of India’s land, after the 1962 war between the two countries.“That land is still with China. I don’t know if they (China) have encroached on some area now again. But when I make an allegation, I should also see what had happened when I was there (in power). If such big land was encroached upon then, it cannot be ignored. It is a matter of national security and it should not be politicised is what I feel,” he said.Pawar further hit out at the Centre over the rising prices of fuel, saying he had never seen the rates going up daily.He noted the people are already in trouble and the economy is in crisis due to the extended lockdown.The Centre should take decisions that will bring the economy back on track, he said.“The rise in fuel prices does have an impact on the economy. I think the Centre is taking this decision as there already is lockdown.“People are not speaking up during this period. Due to some other reason, there already is a feeling among the people to tolerate what is going on (and) they (the Centre) are taking disadvantage of this situation (to raise prices),” he said.Asked about BJP MLC Gopichand Padalkar’s recent remark against him, the NCP chief said the legislator was rejected by voters in the elections previously and there is no need to take note of his remark.Padalkar had said that “Pawar was a corona that has infected Maharashtra”.Pawar also made light of former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ claim that the NCP had wanted to join hands with the BJP two years ago.“Right now, he has a lot of time. Hence, he keeps something or the other for publicity,” Pawar quipped. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-grabbed-45-000-sq-km-of-indian-land-post-1962-war-pawar-105292

Hence, there was no reason to open this sensitive sector to private players.With active assistance from erstwhile USSR, he said, India's space scientists achieved unparalled success, including designing and launching the PSLV, GSLV satellites to Lunar, Mars, and other inter-planetary explorations."All these have been achieved with huge investments made from public money and enormous knowledge generated in various public sector national research institutes and IITs." "The unprecedented privatisation of national space institutions is nothing but part of neo-liberal economic reforms that run against the sentiments of self-reliance and sovereignty of our nation and hurt the self-respect of Indian science," Raja said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpi-chief-d-raja-asks-govt-to-roll-back-its-decision-on-space-sector-105285
27-06-2020||New Delhi||From 1 to 5 lakh COVID-19 cases in 39 days; medical experts point to increased testing||It took 110 days for coronavirus infections in the country to reach one lakh, while just 39 days more to go past the five lakh-mark.Medical experts have pointed to the ramped up COVID-19 testing, now available more extensively and at a reasonable price, as a big reason for the spike in cases recently.Six days after recording four lakh infections, India's COVID-19 tally went past the five lakh-mark on Saturday with the highest single-day surge of 18,552 cases, while the death toll climbed to 15,685, according to Union health ministry data.The COVID-19 caseload increased to 5,08,953, while 384 fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours, the updated figure at 8 am showed.This was the fourth consecutive day when coronavirus infection increased by more than 15,000, while there has been a surge of 3,18,418 infections from June 1 till 27.  Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh are the top contributors to the rising tally.It took 64 days for COVID-19 cases in India to touch the (May 19) one lakh-mark from 100 cases, and another fortnight to cross two lakh cases on June 3. It took 10 days for the tally to touch the three lakh-mark and another eight days for the cases to climb to four lakh. The nationwide lockdown was first imposed on March 25 for 21 days in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The lockdown was first extended till May 3 and then again till May 17.It was further extended till May 31.The lockdown is now restricted only in containment zones across the country and will continue till June 30. A large number of social, economic, religious and sports activities are currently allowed to function under what the Ministry of Home Affairs termed as 'Unlock 1'.After the government initiated the unlock procedure to make-up for the economic cost of the lockdown, the COVID-19 cases started to gallop.Dr. Monica Mahajan, Director, Internal Medicine, Max Healthcare, said it is important to understand the reason for the exponential rise in cases.The numbers are doubling at such a fast rate due to factors such as the high reproduction number of the virus (the number of cases, on average, an infected person will cause during their infectious period), she said. Also, with the lifting of lockdown norms people's behaviour has changed again as they are not acting as responsibly as before in terms of social distancing, and testing has become more liberal, Mahajan told PTI.She said the price of the test has come down and test kits are more easily available, so more cases are being detected.Noted city-based lung surgeon Dr Arvind Kumar said definitely a big reason for cases going up is increased testing.The percentage of people turning out to be positive from among those tested is also going up as due to lifting of the lockdown people have completely forgotten social distancing norms and are out on the streets with scant regard for the pandemic, said Kumar, who works at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a cumulative total of 79,96,707 samples have been tested up to June 26 with 2,20,479 samples being tested on Friday, the highest in a day since the beginning of the pandemic.The government has ramped up its testing infrastructure across the country significantly with the ICMR validating around 1,007 diagnostic labs, of which 734 are in the government sector and 273 private sector.The per day testing capacity which was around 1.4 lakh on May 25 has been increased to three lakh per day now.Starting with one single laboratory, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and having 100 laboratories in the beginning of the lockdown,  the ICMR on June 23 validated 1000th testing laboratory.The real-time RT-PCR is the gold standard test for detecting cases of COVID-19 and the average time taken is around 4-5 hours from receipt of sample to getting the result. It requires a specialised laboratory set-up because of which this test cannot be performed at every district-level lab which does not have molecular virology facilities, the ICMR said recently.Thus the TrueNat and the CBNAAT systems have also been deployed for diagnosis of COVID-19 in view of availability of customised cartridges.Besides, the ICMR recently also approved the use of rapid-antigen test for coronavirus infection that gives results in 30 minutes and has also advised carrying out rapid antibody tests only for surveillance purposes.India reported its first case of coronavirus infection on January 30 from Kerala.The number of active cases currently stands at 1,97,387 while 2,95,880 people have recovered and one patient has migrated."Thus, around 58.13 per cent patients have recovered so far," an official said.India is the fourth worst-hit nation by the pandemic after the US, Brazil and Russia.According to Johns Hopkins University, which has been compiling COVID-19 data from all over the world, India is at the eighth position in terms of the death toll.

27-06-2020||New Delhi||Eight states contribute 85 per cent Covid cases, 87 per cent deaths in India||Eight states — Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Telangana, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal — are contributing 85.5 per cent of active COVID-19 caseload in India and 87 per cent of total deaths. This information was shared with the Group of Ministers on COVID-19, which met for the 17th time on Saturday and asked states to ramp-up testing and reach full national testing capacity of three-lakh samples a day.Chaired by Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, the GOM was informed by ICMR chief Balram Bhargava that the samples tested in the last 24 hours have increased to 2,20,479 taking the total cumulative number of samples tested, as on date, to 79,96,707. Tests per day being conducted in India are, however, lesser than daily testing capacity of three-lakh samples.India now has 1,026 diagnostic labs dedicated to COVID-19. This includes 741 in the government sector and 285 private labs, but their capacity remains under used.The GOM was briefed on the current status of COVID-19 cases in the country, the recovery and mortality rates, doubling rate, ramped-up testing and strengthened healthcare infrastructure in the various states.  It was also informed that, as on date, 15 Central teams of public health experts, epidemiologists, clinicians and a senior Joint Secretary-level have been deployed to provide technical support to the states. Another Central team is currently visiting Gujarat, Maharashtra and Telangana to strengthen ongoing efforts for management of COVID-19. The Group of Ministers was told the key focus areas, which are continually communicated to the states and UTs are strict containment measures and surveillance; focus on monitoring of co-morbid and elderly population; predicting emerging hotspots leveraging digital tools such as Aarogya Setu; ensuring seamless patient admission processes; fatality mitigation by effective clinical management; focus on infrastructure preparedness (critical care beds, oxygen, ventilators and logistics); and ensuring that non-Covid healthcare services are not impacted.GoM was also apprised about the growing medical infrastructure in the country.In a detailed presentation by K. Shivaji, Chairman of the Empowered Group-10, the GoM was briefed that the stipulated redressal time on COVID-19 public grievances was brought down from the usual 60 days for normal public grievances to three days to prioritise their quick disposal. National Dashboard for 'COVID -19' was launched on April 1 for exclusive monitoring of COVID-19 public grievances. During the period from March 30 to June 24, the Empowered Group disposed 93.84 pc of the 77,307 grievances received for central Ministries and 63.11 per cent of the 53,130 grievances received pertaining to the state governments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eight-states-contribute-85-per-cent-covid-cases-87-per-cent-deaths-in-india-105267
27-06-2020||The Congress on Saturday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to publicly condemn China for its “brazen incursions” into the Indian territory and urged the government to take “strong and quick action” to resolve the Line of Actual Control (LAC) issue.||PM should condemn China publicly for incursions, take ‘strong, quick action’: Kapil Sibal||Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said at a virtual press conference that the Prime Minister should address the nation and promise that anyone capturing Indian territory would be pushed back.He said the entire nation and the entire opposition would stand behind him and his promise.Alleging that the last six years have seen the biggest diplomatic failure under the Modi government, the former Union Minister said “some quick action” should be taken to resolve the LAC issue with China.“Some quick action is required,” he said seeking early resolution of the border dispute with China, while noting that diplomacy and economic blockade with China would not work.“Yes, the action should be strong (against China). The quality, nature and the timing of that action has to be decided by the government,” he said when asked what “quick action” he was asking for. Sibal said it was for the government to decide and not the opposition.The Congress leader alleged that China had erected tents and structures near PP-14 in Galwan Valley, the place where 20 Indian soldiers sacrificed their lives. He added that satellite imagery also reflects the construction of new blacktop roads by Chinese forces on the Galwan riverbed, erection of large numbers of military tents and presence of bulldozers and other heavy equipment.“What is our government doing about it? The PM must clear the air and condemn these brazen Chinese incursions,” he said.Asking why the Prime Minister does not openly and publicly condemn the “brazen acts of infiltrations, incursions and occupation” of Indian territory by China, he said: “I want the PM to publicly condemn China. We will support the Prime Minister.”Sibal said the situation was such that the PM’s statement that nobody intruded into India was being used by the Chinese globally.“We want the prime minister to address the nation and promise that if anyone has captured Indian territory, we will push them back. If you say so, the public and the entire opposition will stand behind you and your promise,” he said.There has been a standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in the eastern Ladakh area for over a month and a bloody clash took place between them on the night of June 15 in the Galwan Valley, resulting in the death of 20 Indian soldiers.

27-06-2020||New Delhi||China will have to pay a heavy price for military misadventure in eastern Ladakh: Experts||China will have to pay a "heavy price" for decades for resorting to aggressive military behaviour towards India in eastern Ladakh as it will isolate the country globally, strategic affairs experts said on Saturday.They said the economic cost of China's misadventure in the last couple of months in eastern Ladakh and South China will be "massive" as it has "exposed" Beijing's "real face" when the entire world is fighting coronavirus.The experts have also referred to China's tariff war with the US, growing bickering with Australia on trade-related issues and the fast deteriorating situation in Hong Kong."China has made a huge mistake by resorting to aggressive military behaviour in eastern Ladakh. By triggering the standoff when the world is fighting the coronavirus pandemic, China has exposed itself globally," former Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Gurmit Singh said."The cost for China will be huge. It will be heavy. It will keep paying the cost for several decades for killing Indian soldiers in Galwan Valley on June 15. China has lost its goodwill in India and elsewhere," he added.Referring to the brutal attacks on Indian soldiers, he said the action had reinforced the view that China's People's Liberation Army is "just a political" force and that it does not conform to military standards.Former Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Subrata Saha said China is getting itself isolated by its unacceptable military aggression and the country will have to pay a heavy diplomatic and economic price for it."China is isolating itself by its aggressive conduct both militarily and diplomatically. So there will be a price for it. It is putting itself into a corner," he said.Lt Gen Saha said there would a significant economic price that China would have to pay for its "misadventure".He also referred to the growing international concerns about what is happening in Hong Kong, South China Sea as well as in East China Sea.Gen Saha talked about trade war between China and the US calling it a kind of "fight-to-finish" conflict. He also referred to China's deepening trade crisis with Australia.The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last six weeks, and the tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. Following the clashes, the Army has sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the Line of Actual Control in various sectors, including in Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Sikkim.The IAF has also moved a sizeable number of its frontline Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar, Mirage 2000 aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to several key air bases, including Leh and Srinagar, following the clashes.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.Prior to the clashes, both sides had been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it was necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

She will require long term care and specialised treatment along with other medical procedures like Laser Therapy, Hydrotherapy treatment, Digital Radiology, Thermal Imaging etc.Dr Pramod Rajput, Veterinarian at the Wildlife SOS Elephant Hospital said, "The elephant is suffering from severe handicap caused by arthritis and resulting in difficulty in bearing weight on forelimbs. We are monitoring her progress while we conduct some more health examinations." Raghunath Mishra, DFO Mathura said: "The elephant is in weak condition. She has been sent to the Wildlife SOS Elephant Hospital where she will get the best medical care possible."Geeta Seshamani, Co-founder & Secretary of Wildlife SOS said, "To see Zara suffering from such crippling injuries at such an early age is heartbreaking. One can only imagine the extent of physical and emotional stress she must have endured. Zara requires a stress-free environment and a lot of medical attention with round-the-clock care to help her on her path to recovery."Baiju Raj M.V, Director Conservation Projects, Wildlife SOS said: "The Elephant Hospital's goal is to provide specialised & critical care for elephants in distress.

27-06-2020||Mumbai||Can’t expect poor patients to give proof for free treatment: HC||The Bombay High Court observed that COVID-19 patients from poor and indigent sections cannot be expected to produce documentary proof to avail subsidised or free treatment while getting admitted to hospitals.The court on Friday was hearing a plea filed by seven residents of a slum rehabilitation building in Bandra, who had been charged Rs 12.5 lakh by KJ Somaiya Hospital for COVID-19 treatment between April 11 and April 28.The bench of Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and Madhav Jamdar directed the hospital to deposit Rs 10 lakh in the court.The petitioners had borrowed money and managed to pay Rs 10 lakh out of Rs 12.5 lakh that the hospital had demanded, after threatening to halt their discharge if they failed to clear the bill, counsel Vivek Shukla informed the court.According to the plea, the petitioners were also overcharged for PPE kits and unused services.On June 13, the court had directed the state charity commissioner to probe if the hospital had reserved 20 per cent beds for poor and indigent patients and provided free or subsidised treatment to them.Last week, the joint charity commissioner had informed the court that although the hospital had reserved such beds, it had treated only three poor or indigent persons since the lockdown.It was unfathomable that the hospital that claimed to have reserved 90 beds for poor and indigent patients had treated only three such persons during the pandemic, advocate Shukla said.He further argued that COVID-19 patients, who are in distress, cannot be expected to produce income certificate and such documents as proof.However, senior advocate Janak Dwarkadas, who represented the hospital, said the petitioners did not belong to economically weak or indigent categories and had not produced documents to prove the same.A person who is suffering from a disease like COVID-19 could not be expected to produce certificates from a tehsildar or social welfare officer before seeking admission in the hospital, the bench noted and asked the hospital to deposit Rs 10 lakh in court within two weeks.

Both these drugs are steroids with anti- inflammatory and immune-suppressants.“In patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators, rapid worsening on imaging and excessive activation of the body’s inflammatory response, glucocorticoids can be used for a short period of time (3 to 5 days). It is recommended that the dose should not exceed the equivalent of methylprednisolone 1-2mg/kg/day or dexamethasone 0.2-0.4 mg/kg/day. Note that a larger dose of glucocorticoid will delay the removal of coronavirus due to immunosuppressive effects,” the new guidelines say.Dexamethasone drug lowers fatality in those needing oxygen by 20 per cent and by 35 per cent in those on a ventilator. What’s more – it is an on-the-shelf medicine and can be easily accessed by anyone.UK’s RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy) trial results have generated hope in the ability of existing, repurposed drugs in mitigating Covid impact.Shekhar Mande, Director of India’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, says, “The results about dexamethasone are extremely promising for the critically ill Covid-19 patients and will help reduce deaths at the severe stage of the disease. It is a huge step forward. We are very excited and are looking forward to the detailed scientific study.”India is a bulk manufacturer of dexamethasone. A 20-tablet strip of 0.5 mg each by Zydus Cadila is available for Rs 6.38.With easy accessibility and affordability, dexamethasone could revolutionise critical Covid care globally and lower mortality.The RECOVERY trial began this March as a randomised clinical trial to test a range of potential treatments for Covid-19, including low-dose dexamethasone (a steroid treatment) and over 11,500 patients from 175 UK National Health Service hospitals were enrolled. In all, 2,104 patients were randomised to receive dexamethasone 6 mg once per day (either by mouth or by intravenous injection) for 10 days and were compared with 4,321 patients randomised to usual care alone.Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one third in ventilated patients and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only. Based on these results, one death would be prevented by treatment of around eight ventilated patients or around 25 patients requiring oxygen alone, study leader Peter Horby said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-revises-covid-19-management-protocol-allows-dexamethasone-use-105246
27-06-2020||New Delhi||ED questions Congress leader Ahmed Patel for 8 hours in money-laundering case||Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel was on Saturday questioned by an Enforcement Directorate (ED) team for about eight hours at his residence here in connection with the Sandesara brothers money-laundering case, officials said.The three-member team, along with few other officials of the central probe agency, reached Patel’s 23, Mother Teresa Crescent home, in the Lutyens zone of central Delhi around 11:30 am and left just before 9 pm.The team members were seen carrying files and wearing masks and gloves as precautionary measures against coronavirus spread.Patel was seen entering a guest room in the front portion of his official residence for the ED session.The officials said Patel’s statement was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) during the eight-hour-long questioning and his purported links with the Sandesara brothers are under the scanner.His questioning will continue and is expected that the next session will be held on June 30, they said.Patel spoke to reporters after the ED officials left and said the “guests” of the government had come and he replied to their questions.“I am surprised that instead of fighting China... coronavirus and unemployment, the government is fighting the Opposition,” he said.The law should be allowed to take its course and someone who has not done any wrong should not fear, he said.The ED had summoned Patel, 70, twice for questioning in the case but the Congress Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat later cited prevailing COVID-19 guidelines that advises senior citizens to stay indoors in order to remain safe from the pandemic.The agency then assured the Congress party treasurer that all care will be taken while he is questioned at its office but it was pointed out by his legal team that there are media reports about coronavirus cases being found in the ED headquarters too.The agency then told him that they are willing to visit his home anytime within a fortnight as taking the probe forward in the case was important.Subsequently, the time for home visit was fixed and the agency informed Patel that they will send the investigating officer of the case to him for questioning.This measure was only taken due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, officials in the agency said.Patel has earlier been the political secretary to UPA chairperson and Congress president Sonia Gandhi and considered one of the most powerful persons in the grand old party.This money-laundering case pertains to the alleged Rs 14,500-crore bank loan fraud that is said to have been perpetrated by the Vadodara-based pharma firm Sterling Biotech and its main promoters—Nitin Sandesara, Chetan Sandesara and Deepti Sandesara—all of whom are absconding. Nitin and Chetan are brothers.The agency has said that this is a bigger bank scam in volume than the PNB fraud involving diamantaires Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi.The total fraud amount pegged in the PNB case is about Rs 13,400 crore.The Sandesaras are also facing separate probes by the CBI and the Income Tax Department for their alleged nexus with some high-profile politicians and charges of corruption and tax evasion, respectively.At present, they are stated to be based in Nigeria, from where India is trying to extradite them.The ED registered a criminal case in connection with the alleged bank loan fraud on the basis of an FIR and a charge sheet filed by the CBI.The agency, last year, had questioned Patel’s son Faisal and son-in-law Irfan Ahmed Siddiqui in this case and recorded their statements.The two were questioned in context with the statement of one Sunil Yadav, an employee of the Sandesara group, who earlier recorded his statement before the agency.In his statement to the ED, Yadav had told the agency that he bore “expenses of Rs 10 lakh” for a party which was attended by Faisal, “arranged” entry in a night club for him and once delivered “Rs 5 lakh” to his driver in Khan Market on the instructions of Chetan Sandesara, one of the promoters of the pharma firm, sources had said.Yadav had told the ED that the cash was “meant for Faisal Patel”, the sources said.The agency was also told by Yadav that Siddiqui “occupied” a house in Vasant Vihar area of Delhi that reportedly belonged to Chetan Sandesara.The ED has made one of its largest PMLA attachments in this case and frozen assets worth over Rs 14,000 crore of the group in India and abroad, including oil rigs in Nigeria and ships registered in Panama.It is alleged that the company took loans of over Rs 5,383 crore from a domestic consortium led by Andhra Bank, which had turned into non-performing assets.

Please answer our questions on Chinese intrusion into Indian territory," Chidambaram said in another tweet.Nadda had alleged that the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund (PMNRF) had donated money to the "family-run" RGF when the Congress-led UPA was in power, claiming that it was a "brazen fraud" and big betrayal of the people of the country.The BJP chief had targeted the Congress and the Gandhi family on Thursday for the RGF allegedly accepting donations from the Chinese embassy.Chidambaram also shared two satellite images of May and June of the Galwan Valley showing the build-up of troops and structures along the river-bed."Spot the differences between May 22 and June 22, 2020 on the INDIA-CHINA border," he said.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala had on Friday night come out with a statement, saying the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) issue raised by the BJP government was a "manufactured charge" and "diversionary tactic" to deflect attention from the LAC crisis.He said the money the NGO received from China was used for the welfare of differently-abled people and research on the Sino-India relations."Diversion, disinformation and distraction are the diabolical hallmarks of the BJP and the Modi government when exposed and caught lying on issues of national security and territorial integrity," Surjewala had said.He said BJP president Nadda and the Modi government kept referring to a 2005 grant of Rs 1.45 crore received by the RGF from the Embassy of China for the purpose of a welfare programme for differently-abled people and research on Sino-India relations."This grant was used for the purposes specified. RGF accounts were duly audited and statutory returns filed under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA) to the Government of India. This grant has been duly reflected in all filings to the Income Tax department and home ministry and no authority has ever found any wrongdoing of any nature," Surjewala said.He said pursuant to the unprecedented tsunami in the last week of 2004, the foundation received a "modest" amount of Rs 20 lakh from the PMNRF in financial year 2005, which was duly utilised to undertake relief activities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

The Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in Pakistan’s Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. It is the final resting place of Sikh faith’s founder Guru Nanak Dev, who had spent the last 18 years of his life in Kartarpur.Indian pilgrims of all faiths are allowed to undertake round the year visa-free travel to the historic gurdwara.The Foreign Office said the Kartarpur Corridor wa a true symbol of peace and religious harmony and this landmark initiative by Pakistan had been immensely appreciated by the Sikh community all over the world, including India.The relations between India and Pakistan nosedived after India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5, 2019, and bifurcated it into two union territories. Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with India and expelled the Indian High Commissioner.On Tuesday, India told Pakistan to slash its embassy staff in New Delhi by half, saying it would do the same in Islamabad amidst the allegations of spying.

It can show results within 30 minutes and can be interpreted with a naked eye, according to the ICMR. The antigen test kit has been developed by a South Korean biotechnology firm SD Biosensor. Each kit will cost Rs450. The antigen test had been found to have a very high specificity with moderate sensitivity, ICMR quoted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nine-more-covid-19-fatalities-127-new-patients-reported-in-rajasthan-105235

And, their career path is not compromised through extension of maternity leave," Modi said.The Prime Minister asserted that the Government of India does not discriminate between faith, gender, caste, creed or language."We are guided by the desire to empower 130 crore Indians and our guiding light is the Constitution of India," he told the gathering.The prime minister said the government had brought the one nation-one ration card scheme to help the poor from wherever they are and for the middle class several initiatives have been introduced to boost the ease of living.On India's COVID-19 battle, Modi said the country was firmly fighting the pandemic."Earlier this year, some people had predicted that the impact of the virus in India would be very severe. But, due to lockdown and many initiatives taken by the government as well as a people-driven fight, India is much better placed than many other nations. India's recovery rate is rising," Modi said.India's death per million due to Covid is under 12 while the death rate in Italy was 574 per million, he said.India was much better placed than many other nations, Modi said and pointed that the figures in the United States, Spain, Britain and France were much higher than those of India.Lakhs of villages, home to almost 85 crore people remain almost untouched by the coronavirus, he said."The people-driven fight has given good results so far," Modi said, cautioning that people can't let their guards down yet."In fact, we have to be even more careful now. Wearing masks, following social distancing, avoiding crowded places remain important," he said.Pointing out that the coronavirus is not only a physical sickness but a threat to the lives of the people, he said, "It also takes our attention to unhealthy lifestyles. A global pandemic implies that humanity as a whole needs healing. Let's do everything possible for further harmony and happiness on our planet."Modi said the wheels of trade and commerce have to move even as the fight against the pandemic continues."At the same time, we have to focus on economic growth and prosperity for 130 crore Indians. The wheels of trade and commerce have to move. Agriculture has to flourish. In the last few weeks, the Government of India has addressed both short-term and long-term issues relating to the economy. From the sea to space, from the farms to the factories, people-friendly and growth-friendly decisions have been taken," the PM said.

27-06-2020||Washington||Mumbai attack convict Headley cannot be extradited to India; Rana faces extradition: US||Mumbai terrorist attack convict David Headley cannot be extradited to India, but Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman co-conspirator Tahawwur Rana faces extradition, a US attorney has told a federal court while opposing his bail plea.Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was recently rearrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He is a declared fugitive in India.According to the federal prosecutors, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana had conspired with Headley, also known as “Daood Gilani”, and others in Pakistan to assist the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US-designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks.Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.The US is yet to file India’s request for Rana’s extradition but is expected to do it soon. It is evident that the offences for which Rana was tried in the Illinois court will differ from the Indian offences mentioned in the complaint.Rana in his defence has argued that the US’ decision not to extradite his co-conspirator, Headley, to India was inconsistent and bars his extradition.However, Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian told a federal court in Los Angeles on Friday that unlike Rana, Headley immediately accepted responsibility for his conduct and pleaded guilty to all charges in the Superseding Indictment.“Because Headley fulfilled the required terms, the plea agreement established that Headley would not be extradited to India. Rana’s situation is different because he neither pleaded guilty nor cooperated with the United States. As a result, he is unable to avail himself of the benefits afforded to Headley through his negotiated plea. Thus, he cannot complain that he faces extradition, while his co-defendant does not,” the US attorney said.Rana’s bail application is due for hearing next week. Early this week, his attorney told the court that the 26/11 convict was not a flight risk and had proposed a $1.5 million bond for his release.“Rana should be released on a robust bond: secured by approximately $1.5 million in property pledged by family and friends and under the supervision of his daughter, Lemaan Rana, a matriculating medical student and PhD candidate,” Amy Karlin, the Interim Federal Public Defender, said in the court submission on behalf of Rana.India seeks his arrest on a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating, and murder under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He is sought for his role in the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.The US attorney urged the court to continue his detention pending the extradition proceedings to India. Describing Rana as a flight risk, the attorney said that no matter what bond package he offers, Rana poses an unacceptable flight risk.If the US extradites Rana to India and he is convicted of the charges, he may be eligible for the death penalty. Given what is at stake, Rana has an extreme incentive to flee and avoid facing these extradition proceedings, Lulejian said.“He could accomplish this by going into hiding within the US, but he has a particular incentive to go to another country that may not extradite him without assurances from India that it will not seek, impose or carry out the death penalty,” the attorney argued.If Rana were to flee to Canada, his extradition from Canada to the US would take years and would require substantial resources by the governments of both Canada and the United States, and there is no guarantee that Canada would ultimately grant that extradition request, he said.However, even if Canada granted the request from the US, the terms of the US-Canada extradition treaty would prohibit the US from extraditing Rana to a third country, such as India, unless Canada granted its consent to do so, Lulejian said.Not only does Rana have an incentive to flee, but he has numerous international connections who can help facilitate his flight, he told the court.Rana ran an international immigration business for many years in Chicago, which allowed him to develop professional and personal relationships around the world.“Moreover, he was convicted of plotting an attack with and providing material support to an international terrorist organisation based in Pakistan. These international connections enhance Rana's flight risk because they can provide the means to flee this jurisdiction and potentially avoid extradition to India,” Lulejian added.The 2008 Mumbai attack was one of India’s most horrific terrorist attacks in which 166 people were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem.Pakistani national Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, was hanged to death on November 21, 2012.

When the eyes are opened, the conjunctiva membrane is also exposed, making it an important but often overlooked entrance for viruses. The protective eyewear is ergonomically designed to provide full cover and efficient sealing to the eye area from hazardous aerosols as well as other suspended particles.A team of CSIO scientists led by Dr Vinod Karar, chief scientist and head, Optical Devices and Systems, had taken up the design and development of the safety goggles in consultation with various industries and stakeholders.These safety goggles are designed with a flexible frame to provide tighter sealing with the skin of the face and would cover the eyes and the surrounding areas and even accommodating for prescription eyeglasses. It consists of a sturdy polycarbonate lens and an adjustable elastic strap for ease of wearing.“The goggles comply to ANSI/SEA Z87.1-2010 standard with respect to see-through optical transmittance and can be used in varied environmental conditions without any fogging or fatigue,” said Dr Neha Khatri, senior scientist and Principal Investigator, CSIO, associated with the project.The team included Dr Vinod Karar, Dr Sanjeev Soni, Dr Amit L Sharma, Dr Mukesh Kumar and Vinod Mishra.Dr Surender S Saini, head, Business Initiatives and Project Planning, said apart from healthcare professionals, the safety goggles could also be useful for the general public in crowded areas as well as in public transport.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/csio-develops-precision-safety-goggles-to-prevent-infections-amid-covid-19-pandemic-105229

The intensity and impact varies from person to person," said Lt Col NT Rajan, director of Chennai-based Mastermind Foundation.The organisation is involved in free counselling throughout India ever since the first case of the deadly virus was reported in the country.The foundation's recommendation on not to deploy the vulnerable in the police force, especially those above 50 and women personnel with children below five for Covid-19 related duty, was accepted and implemented by the Punjab government.Psychiatrists feel that further worsening situations could lead to severe mental health issues, even triggering suicidal tendencies."Further worsening depression may lead to severe mental health issues and suicidal tendencies," said Dr S Senthil Kumar, a psychiatrist.However, not all of them require medicines, he added."The situation is serious. There should be counselling at three stages - on coping with the virus, how to face it if tested positive and how to face life once treated and discharged from the hospital," Rajan said.Awareness was of paramount importance, he said, and warned the pandemic could cause panic attacks while in hospital or drive them to the brink of suicide.Tamil Nadu, one of the worst-affected states with a virus count in excess of 74,000 as of Friday, has witnessed a few instances of suicides allegedly related to Covid-19.Hari Singh, owner of popular 'Iruttu Kadai' halwa shop in Tirunelveli, allegedly committed suicide on Thursday after testing positive for Covid-19. He was 80.Earlier in May, two Covid-19 patients in their 50s allegedly committed suicide in separate instances, at the government hospitals they were admitted to.In the city corporation limits, a three-member team comprising a psychiatrist, a counsellor and a social worker works for the respective zones."We direct certain sections of people like those with withdrawal symptoms and people requiring pills, to visit the doctor at their corporation zonal at a specific time, for medicines," a health worker of the civic body said.Health platform, Lybrate, reported an increase of 180 per cent in online patient consultations related to mental health on its platform between March 1 and June 20 across the country.The largest increase came from Mumbai and Delhi, followed by Pune, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Bengaluru.The biggest jump was witnessed in the age group of 25 to 45.

It demanded that Beijing stop its activities in eastern Ladakh.The only way to resolve the current military standoff along the LAC in eastern Ladakh was for Beijing to realise that trying to “change the status quo by resorting to force or coercion is not the right way forward,” said India’s Ambassador to China Vikram Misri.Asserting that actions taken by the Chinese forces on the ground have damaged “considerable trust” in the bilateral relationship, the Indian Ambassador added that it was entirely the responsibility of the Chinese side to take a careful view of the relations and to decide which direction the ties should move. Noting that maintenance of peace and tranquillity “on the border is sine qua non for progress in the rest of bilateral relationship between India and China,” Misri said: “The resolution of this issue is quite straight forward from our perspective. The Chinese side needs to stop creating obstruction and hindrances in the normal patrolling patterns of the Indian troops,” he said.He also rubbished China’s claim of sovereignty over the Galwan valley in Ladakh as “completely untenable”, and asserted that these kinds of exaggerated claims were not going to help the situation.“Whatever activities we may be carrying on have always been on our side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), so the Chinese need to stop activities to alter the status quo. It is very surprising that they should attempt to do so in a sector which has never before been a sector of concern.” he said. Emphasising that India is “very aware and very clear about the alignment of the LAC in the Galwan valley,” he said our troops have been patrolling up to these areas without any difficulty for a “very very long period of time”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bid-to-alter-status-quo-will-have-ripples-indian-envoy-105184

In these cases, Covid-19 must be captured as the underlying cause of death. Acute respiratory failure is a mode of dying.”The guidance adds that some patients may present with preexisting comorbidities like asthma, chronic bronchitis, ischemic heart disease, cancer and diabetes. “These conditions increase the risk of developing respiratory infections and may lead to severe disease in a Covid-19 positive individual. These conditions are not considered underlying causes of death as they have directly not caused death due to Covid,” the document notes, with some states auditing Covid deaths and attributing many to comorbidities.West Bengal tried such auditing, triggering a controversy over under reporting of mortality. The auditing was later revoked. Now Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is learnt to be auditing Covid deaths with potential risks of under reporting.NCDIR has also created India’s first online platform to record hospital deaths, including COVID deaths. The platform called e-MOR (e-Mortality Software) is a smart alternative to the existing paper-based death registration system in India, which is faulty.“In most death registrations, the causes of death are not accurately recorded. We learnt this when we tried to find the proportion of deaths caused by cancer. In 99 per cent registrations we checked, the cause of death was mentioned as cardio-respiratory failure or septic shock, not cancer despite cancer being the cause. So we developed e-MOR that contains all ICD-10 disease codes, including the COVID code and allows hospitals to electronically feed causes of death.  E-MOR will curb incomplete reporting as it does not let you proceed unless all information slots are filled. Death reporting includes description of the underlying cause, contributing cause and immediate cause. All three are key to epidemiological study,” says NCDIR Director Prashant Mathur.Karnataka on Friday became the first state to adopt e-MOR for better reporting of COVID deaths. Tamil Nadu and many other states are mulling the idea.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/icmr-moves-to-check-under-reporting-of-deaths-105067

Bhutan has been actually helping to clear the blockage,” Krishna said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhutan-junks-reports-on-blocking-water-to-assam-105069

27-06-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Beijing may be trying to ‘fix’ LAC  alignment as per its 1960 claim||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 26China, with its recent military activities along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, looks to be trying to ‘fix’ the LAC alignment as per its unilateral claim line proposed as a boundary with India during discussions in 1960.The claim line has been disputed by India which has overlapping claims eastwards of this 1960 cartographic belligerence by Beijing. Since 1960, there have been suggestions on demarcating the LAC on ground, but with no success. The buildup at ‘Finger-4’ north of the Pangong Tso to block Indian Army patrol teams from moving eastwards; the attempt to block patrol point 14 in the Galwan valley and the ensuing clash; the buildup at Gogra in Hot Springs area and the setting up of new radars and observation posts and stationing of tanks in the Depsang plains indicate at China’s attempts to ‘fix’ the LAC as per its 1960 claim line, a senior functionary said.Used often, the diplomatic phrase ‘troops patrolling in own claimed areas along the LAC’ refers to these disputed sections of the LAC whichare claimed by both sides. Various protocols and border management guidelines agreed upon since 1993 mention how the troops have to behave on coming face-to-face when patrolling in these disputed areas. The 1960 Chinese Claim Line (CCL), in areas facing Daulat Baig Oldie, Depsang plains, Murgo and the Chip Chap river, stretches several kilometres west of the 1956 claim line, originally proposed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai at talks with India. An additional 5,100 square km area was claimed in the cartographic aggression in 1960.The 1960 claim line and Nehru’s subsequent November 1961 ‘forward policy’ led to the 1962 war.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/beijing-may-be-trying-to-fix-lac-alignment-as-per-its-1960-claim-104962
