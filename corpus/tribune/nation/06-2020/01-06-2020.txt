The Finance Minister on May 15 has announced to cover 2.5 crore new farmers under the KCC scheme.This will provide an additional liquidity of Rs 5 lakh crore in the hands of farmers, who are suffering from the recent downturn of economy, according to the statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kisan-credit-cards-for-1-5-crore-dairy-farmers-92980

01-06-2020||Mumbai||Hackers claim BHIM users’ data vulnerable||A group of ethical hackers on Monday claimed to have discovered a vulnerability affecting millions of BHIM app users, a claim which was denied by the NPCI that operates the small value payments application.Vpnmentor, which claimed to be the largest virtual private networks review website offering a research lab that helps the online community defend itself against cyber threats, alleged that there had been a "data leak" discovered with respect to that of the users of the payments app.The group also said that an Indian Government website focused on pushing adoption of BHIM had exposed data of millions of users to potential fraud.The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) said there had been no data compromise at the BHIM App, which has over 136 million downloads."The developers of the CSC/BHIM website could have easily avoided exposing user data if they had taken some basic security measures to protect the data," Vpnmentor said in a statement.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has an initiative called CSC (Common Services Centre)-BHIM, which has a portal used by field agents as part of a campaign to push the adoption of the BHIM app, by merchants and also the general public.According to Vpnmentor, data from this campaign was being stored on a "misconfigured Amazon Web Services S3 bucket" and was publicly accessible, making it vulnerable to misuse for executing frauds, thefts and attack from hackers and cyber criminals.It also termed the scale of the exposed data as "extraordinary", and pegged the number of users exposed in "millions", adding that the 409 GB of data suspected to be breached has over 70 lakh records."We would like to clarify that there has been no data compromise at BHIM App and request everyone to not fall prey to such speculations. NPCI follows high level of security and an integrated approach to protect its infrastructure and continue to provide a robust payments ecosystem," the NPCI said in a statement.The app was launched in 2016.The breach was discovered on April 23 and the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team was contacted on April 28. The CERT-IN responded the very next day and May 22 has been noted as the date of action in Vpnmentor's report.Over 70 lakh users' data uploaded in February was exposed, the report said, adding the records which were exposed online included scans of Aadhaar cards, caste certificates, residence proofs, professional certificates and degrees, screenshots of fund transfers and PAN cards.The private personal user data within these documents gave a complete profile of individuals, their finances, and banking records, it noted.In the statement issued by Vpnmentor, its cyber security researchers Noam Rotem and Ran Locar said the sheer volume of sensitive, private data exposed, along with UPI IDs, document scans, and more, makes this breach deeply concerning."The exposure of BHIM user data is akin to a hacker gaining access to the entire data infrastructure of a bank, along with millions of its users' account information," they said in the statement.

01-06-2020||---||India makes last-ditch offer to avert Nepal map revision||New Delhi, June 1India is making a last-ditch effort to persuade Kathmandu from pushing ahead with a Constitutional amendment that will formalise the inclusion of territory claimed by India in its political map.Nepal has already issued a revised political map but a Constitutional amendment, if passed by its Parliament, will give finality to the process and allow the new contours of the border to be incorporated in its coat of arms.Sources said that India had attempted to convey to Nepal that it was ready for talks with the tactical aim of delaying the Parliamentary procedure.The new offer conveyed through the former’s security and diplomatic officials is a revision of the old offer to hold Foreign Secretary-level talks after the COVID-19 epidemic is over.The old offer of holding talks after the epidemic had riled the Nepalese political class and led to a hardening of stance.Baluwatar had argued that if Defence Minister Rajnath Singh could inaugurate a road running through disputed areas while the COVID-19 was raging, talks could also be held during the pandemic.While the Indian side has not officially acknowledged the feelers sent out to Nepal, Nepalese Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali said Kathmandu was in constant touch with New Delhi.“The date and modality of informal talks are not fixed yet, but we are in constant touch with the Indian side… We want to resolve the issue through diplomatic means,” he was reported as having briefed Nepal’s Parliamentary committee on foreign affairs.The last-minute Indian attempt is the same tactics in 2015 when S Jaishankar, the then Foreign Secretary, had landed in Kathmandu to block major legislative changes that had upset Madheshis living in the plains bordering India.By the time Jaishankar landed, the die had been cast and Nepal did not heed the Indian Foreign Secretary’s call, leading to an unacknowledged economic blockade.In the latest instance, the Nepal government has already tabled a bill to approve a new map which shows Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura — which also feature on India’s map — as part of its territory.India has rejected the map, calling the revision a “unilateral act” and “not based on historical facts and evidences”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-makes-last-ditch-offer-to-avert-nepal-map-revision-92970

The court said that in such a situation it had every right to intervene.It directed the state government to immediately release those Tablighi Jamaat members who had completed their period of quarantine and had tested negative.The court also ordered the setting up of a three-member committee to monitor the cases of quarantined persons in the districts.The committee is expected to ensure the release and arrangement for return of persons from quarantine centres to their homes after the completion of their terms.The committee will also hear and redress the grievances of those living in the state-run quarantine centres.Issuing the orders to the state chief secretary, the court has asked him to issue a circular in this regard.According to the UP Government’s affidavit presented in the court by the state Additional Advocate General Manish Goyal there were 3,001 Indian and 325 foreign Tablighi Jamaat members in the state quarantine centres.  Of these 21 Indians and 279 foreigners had been arrested and sent to jail under various charges. The state government claims that 2,979 Indians and 46 foreign nationals were released from the quarantine centres after they completed their quarantine and now none were in such centres.However, the figure given in court by the AAG is different from that shared with the media by the additional chief secretary and principal secretary home Avanish Awasthi on May 31.Awasthi said that 2,931 persons from Uttar Pradesh had participated in the Nizamuddin congregation by the Tablighi Jamaat of whom 2,690 persons have been quarantined. Another 241 have since gone to other districts and states.He had admitted that 326 foreigners who were present in the different districts of the state had been medically examined and were under quarantine.Awasthi had also claimed that 44 FIRs had been lodged against the foreigners and the passports of 259 persons had been seized. Of the foreigners, 66 were from Nepal.Meanwhile, a video tape has gone viral on the social media in which the principal of Kanpur’s Ganesh Shankar Vidhyarthi Medical College Dr Aarti Lalchandani is referring to the Tablighi Jamaat members as “terrorists” while charging CM Yogi of playing the politics of appeasement by providing them government health care.Later defending herself, principal of the Kanpur Medical College claimed the video had been morphed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allahabad-high-court-orders-immediate-release-of-tablighi-jamaat-members-from-quarantine-92964
01-06-2020||---||SC split on retirement, pensionary benefits for govt employee who joined as minor||New Delhi, June 1What should be the cut-off date for determining the date of retirement and calculating pensionary benefits of a government employee who joined the service as a minor — his actual date of joining or the date on which he turned major?A Division Bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Ajay Rastogi of the Supreme Court has delivered a split verdict on the issue. The matter has now been sent to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde for reference to a larger Bench.“Rule 73 of the Bihar Service Code does not prescribe any length of service as criteria for retirement. The prescribed age of retirement for employees of the category to which the Appellant belonged was 58 years, later increased to 60 years. “The decision of the Respondents to retire the Appellant before the attained the age of 60 years as per his actual date of birth, as recorded in the service records cannot be sustained”, Justice Banerjee said allowing the appeal of Gopal Prasad who had joined Bihar School Examination Board as a Calligraphist-cum-Assistant in 1970 at the age of 15.“The Appellant is entitled to a declaration that the Appellant was entitled to continue in service till 18th November, 2014, being the date on which he completed 60 years of age, as per his service records, and shall be entitled to all consequential benets, including arrears of pay, if any, pensionary benefits, etc,” Justice Banerjee said.However, disagreeing with her, Justice Rastogi said only the person who attained the age of majority would be competent to enter into a valid contract of service as per the Majority Act, 1875.“If the contentions of the Appellant were accepted, it will take us to a stage where a toddler or a minor of any given age can claim his eligibility to enter into public employment which is manifestly illogical and impermissible in law,” Justice Rastogi said.“When the Appellant entered service, the minimum age at the entry point in terms of the Pension Rules, 1950, is 18 years and maximum age prescribed for exit point is 60 years. “As a logical consequence, the total length of service which one could render in the Government service may not exceed 42 years and when there is an unambiguous self-explicit provision, anything contrary to or inconsistent with or incompatible to it, any circular or resolution or order, will not have any legal or valid effect,” Justice Rastogi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-split-on-retirement-pensionary-benefits-for-govt-employee-who-joined-as-minor-92963

It will also be a part of the party’s plan to mark completion of one year of the Narendra Modi government 2.0.In a world struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, the digital/virtual saffron rally will mark the commencement of the new form of electioneering and its campaign for crucial polls slated later this year.After Shah’s rally, expectedly on June 9, other senior BJP leaders such as party president JP Nadda will follow suit.While the BJP appears well prepared to handle the new situation and challenges it brings, rivals fear digital/virtual campaigns could end up favouring the saffron party given its well-oiled IT cell, social media teams and experience of high-tech electioneering in past.Going virtual and digital for the month-long activities to mark the completion of one year of the Narendra Modi government 2.0, the BJP will be relying majorly on new forms of ‘samvaad’ (communication) in its campaign for the Bihar elections.Giving details of the virtual rallies and meetings planned on the first anniversary of second Modi government in mind the COVID-19 restrictions, BJP General Secretary Bhupendra Yadav, in response to a question regarding Bihar polls recently, said it was for the Election Commission of India to decide when and how polls should be held.But so far as the BJP is concerned, the party had been preparing and would use new methods and technologies for campaigning and communicating with the people, he added.Sources indicate that the party had already started identifying prominent persons in constituencies who could spread the message to the grassroots in the times when large gatherings, rallies and corner meetings may no longer be the order of the say.‘Mandals’ had been asked to identify people who can act as a bridge and influence voters and with whom the leadership from the state and the national level could directly communicate to ascertain the ground situation, the sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-to-kick-off-bihar-campaign-with-virtual-rally-of-amit-shah-92961

The demand for such trains has tapered down from the states with most of these 321 trains are to terminate in West Bengal, they said.The Railways, which is running over 200 Shramik Special trains on an average, had the capacity to complete the demand of 321 trains in the next two days, the sources said.However, it has to run these services keeping in mind the requirements of the states, which are asking them to be sent in a staggered manner.On Sunday, the Railways operated only 69 such trains, officials said.Over 42.2 per cent of these trains have been received by Uttar Pradesh, followed by Bihar with 36.5 per cent, Jharkhand with 4.8 per cent, Odisha 3.2 per cent, West Bengal 2.3 per cent and received by the remaining states.Shramik Special trains are being operated primarily on the request of the states, which want to send migrant workers stranded due to the COVID-triggered lockdown to their native places.While the Indian Railways is bearing 85 per cent of the total cost of these trains, states are bearing 15 per cent of it in the form of fares.The nationwide lockdown has had a devastating impact on the economy as well as on the livelihoods of lakhs of migrant workers.The plight of migrant workers, who were walking from several urban centres to their villages hundreds of kilometres away, had grabbed headlines for almost two months.There have been incidents of many of them being killed in road accidents. A number of migrant labourers were even killed by a speeding train after they fell asleep on the tracks.On May 1, the Railways started the migrant special trains to facilitate the movement of such workers back to their home states.While on the first day, four such trains were operated, the maximum number of 279 trains were operated on May 20.

The US can be good partners with allies from India, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Brazil and Europe, he offered while stating that China’s threats, like the one on its border with India, have been happening “for an awfully long time”.  “They will certainly use a tactical situation on the ground to their advantage,” he said while answering a query during a TV interview on the aggressive Chinese behaviour on the Sino-India border and the South China Sea. “We can be good partners alongside them and ensure that the next century remains a Western one modelled on the freedoms that we have here in the US,” he added.India had earlier sidestepped US President Donald Trump’s offer to mediate on the LAC stand-off by pointing out that it would continue to rely on bilateralism.In Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Office also said the two countries are capable of resolving border issues through dialogue and negotiations at military and diplomatic levels. Both India and China have said there are committed to safeguarding national security and stability in along the LAC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-backs-india-in-lac-stand-off-with-china-92943

They have been asked to moor their boats inland in order to prevent them from being washed away. The administration has already prepared a list of people to be evacuated from low-lying areas,” said Kiran Mahajan, Deputy Collector, Palghar district.According to him, the administration is making arrangements for turning public buildings and schools into relief camps should the cyclone make landfall in the area.Some Covid-19 quarantine centres located in low-lying areas were also in the process of being moved to higher ground, the officials said.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a cyclone alert across Harihareshwar in Maharashtra’s Raigad district to the Union Territory of Daman.Palghar lies somewhere in between this wide arc.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is monitoring the progress of the cyclone, has asked officials to ensure that fishermen do not venture out into the seas.The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has moved nine teams in Maharashtra — three in Mumbai, two in Palghar and one each in Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg.The IMD, which had earlier issued a yellow alert, upgraded it to a red alert this afternoon, according to the officials here.As a result, district officials are expected to begin evacuation of people living in low-lying areas and arrange for relief works, officials here said.Weather bureau officials in Mumbai indicated that gusty winds of up to 125 kmph speeds may be expected to cause trees to be uprooted and the collapse of weak buildings.Mumbai and surrounding areas experienced rains early this morning which ceased later in the day. However, the skies remained overcast, met officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imd-upgrades-yellow-alert-to-red-ahead-of-cyclone-warning-92939
01-06-2020||Kolkata||Resignation by top Bengali daily editor triggers controversy||Summoning by the Kolkata police of journalist Anirban Chattopadhyay, editor of widely circulated Bengali daily Anandabazar Patrika, and Chattopadhyay’s subsequent resignation has triggered a controversy.Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and CPI(M) West Bengal unit secretary Surjya Kanta Misra have expressed the view that the summoning of the 62-year-old editor by police was an attempt to muzzle the press.Governor Dhankhar recently tweeted saying he had sought update from home secretary regarding summoning of Chattopadhyay at the Hare Street police station.“Press freedom is non-negotiable. It is spine of democracy and guaranteed by Constitution”, Dhankhar stated in the tweet.While the Governor tried to put the blame on the shoulder of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee (the tweet was marked to Banerjee and the Editors Guild of India), CPI(M) state unit secretary Mishra held Modi government responsible for Chattopadhyay’s ordeal.“Is it true that Anirban Chattopadhyay, Editor ABP, the highest circulated Bangla daily is sought to be arrested under certain fictitious but non-bailable charges? Is it dedicated to Modi’s first year 2nd term, meant to settle the score because of ABP upholding the secular values?” Mishra tweeted on Saturday.Independent sources confirmed that a notice under various sections of the IPC was served to Chattopadhyay at his office on May 25 asking him to appear at Hare Street police station for questioning.The notice, according to the sources, was prompted by a story on inadequate supply of PPEs to the staff of a hospital handling COVID-19 cases.Health Department took the view that the report was factually incorrect and wrote so to Home Department. This led to a complaint filed with the Hare Street police station.Chattopadhyay, instead of presenting himself before the police, wrote a letter to Officer-in-Charge of the police station saying he had moved the court for anticipatory bail. Moreover, being a senior citizen, he had been medically advised to avoid going to public places and expose himself to infection by the novel coronavirus.This correspondent has seen Chattopadhyay’s letter to Officer-in-Charge of Hare Street police station which was accompanied by medical certificate from his doctor.Till yesterday, Chattopadhyay’s name appeared as the editor. Following Chattopadhyay’s resignation, Ishani Datta Ray has become the new editor of the Bengali daily, which is also the flagship of the ABP group.A source said that Chattopadhyay, who took over as editor four years back, resigned owing to his disagreement over a move related to restructuring of the editorial staff.“Summon by police may not have much to do with Chattopadhyay’s exit,” the source said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/resignation-by-top-bengali-daily-editor-triggers-controversy-92935
01-06-2020||New Delhi||Factors like lockdown in metro cities need to be addressed before resuming int'l flights: Aviation Minister||Several factors such as the lockdown in metro cities and the ban imposed by various countries on the entry of foreigners needed to be addressed before resuming international passenger flights in India, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Monday.Domestic services were suspended in India due to the COVID-induced lockdown and were resumed after a gap of two months on May 25. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country.“Numerous citizens have been approaching us to restart international flights. Several factors need to be addressed. Many international destinations are not allowing incoming passenger traffic, except for their own citizens or diplomats,” Puri said on Twitter.Within India, most international flights operate from the metro cities, where travellers arrive from the neighbouring cities and states, he said.“Our metro cities were under various degrees of lockdown which are beginning to be lifted. Some of them are still allowing only limited flights to operate,” the minister noted.Airports in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana and Tamil Nadu have been allowed to handle a restricted number of daily flights as these states do not want a huge influx of flyers amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases.The minister said: “The MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) guidelines for lockdown 5.0 have further opened up inter and intra-state travel, and will facilitate calibrated reopening of the sector. As we move towards the critical mass of 50 to 60 per cent operation of domestic flights, our ability to resume international operations will also improve.”Indian carriers operated a total of 3,370 domestic passenger flights till May 31 — 428 on May 25, 445 on May 26, 460 on May 27, 494 on May 28, 513 on May 29 and 529 on May 30.During the pre-lockdown period, Indian airports handled around 3,000 daily domestic flights, aviation industry sources said.In February, around 4.12 lakh passengers travelled daily through domestic flights in India, according to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) data.

01-06-2020||New Delhi||SC denies bail to man accused of repeatedly raping his sister-in-law||The Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal filed by a man accused of repeatedly raping his sister-in-law with the alleged connivance of her husband and father-in-law, challenging the denial of bail to him in the case.The apex court refused to interfere with the February order of the Bombay High Court which had rejected the bail plea filed by the accused.A Bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao, hearing the matter through video-conferencing, was informed by the counsel representing the accused that the charge sheet has been filed in the case in December last year and the petitioner is in custody for nine months.“On an overall consideration of the facts of the case, we are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the high court,” said the Bench, also comprising Justices Krishna Murari and S Ravindra Bhat.“However, we give liberty to the petitioner to renew his bail application after the evidence of the prosecutrix (alleged victim) is recorded,” the Bench said in its May 26 order.The Bench noted that the petitioner is accused of committing offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including the one related to commission of repeated rape on the same woman and also under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.According to the police, the woman has alleged in her complaint that her brother-in-law had persistently raped her in the months of February and May 2019.In its February order, the high court noted that the woman alleged that she had disclosed about this to her husband and even her father-in-law but they “turned a blind eye”.An FIR was lodged by the woman in July last year.The counsel representing the man had claimed before the high court that allegations levelled against his client were not believable and there was delay in lodging the FIR.The lawyer had also argued in the high court that since the husband and father-in-law of the woman have already been granted bail in the case, the man should also be released on bail on merits as well as parity.In its order, the high court had referred to the woman’s school record and noted that she was below the age of 18 years when she was allegedly subjected to forcible sexual intercourse for the first time.

01-06-2020|| New Delhi||Cabinet approves stimulus package, new definition for MSMEs||The Union Cabinet on Monday formally approved all announcements relating to MSMEs as part of the Rs. 20-lakh Covid stimulus package.The Cabinet also approved changes in the definition of MSMEs which was further fine-tuned after being announced by Sitharaman on May 13."The Cabinet’s decisions will aid MSMEs to attract investments and create jobs,"’ said the Union Minister Nitin Gadkari at a joint press conference with his Cabinet colleagues Prakash Javadekar and Narendra Singh Tomar.ALSO READ: Cabinet approves increase of MSP for 14 kharif cropsThe Cabinet approved a Rs. 50,000 crore Distressed Assets’ Fund, with the Government’s share at Rs. 10,000 crore, in order to help two lakh MSMEs that have the potential but need a little hand-holding due to the Covid disruption. The government will backstop 85 per cent for loans up to Rs 5 lakh and 75 per cent for loans beyond Rs 5 lakh from financial institutions.The Cabinet also approved government’s equity of Rs 4,000 crore in another fund of Rs. 20,000 crore to assist stressed or NPA-categorised MSMEs. The central government will put up Rs. 4,000 crore in a special trust and banks will make up the rest to help about two lakhs MSMEs in a trust called "fund of fund".The third and largest component of the Rs. 3.70 lakh crore MSME stimulus package---Rs 3 lakh crore collateral-free loans---has already been launched.  It is targeted at 45 lakh units that were shut and hard-pressed to pay for wages and raw materials. The eligibility is for companies with up to Rs. 25 crore in outstanding loan or turnover of Rs 100 crore. These loans will have a four-year tenure and moratorium of one year with 100 per cent credit guarantee cover on principal and interest.

01-06-2020||Beijing||Situation at border with India ‘stable’, both sides have ‘unimpeded’ communication channels: China||China, on Monday, said the overall situation at the border with India was “stable and controllable”, and both the countries have “unimpeded” communication channels to resolve the issues through dialogue and consultations.The comments by Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian came in the backdrop of the continuing standoff between the militaries of India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The spokesman was responding to a question on Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s remarks that India would not let its “pride be hurt” in its latest border flare-up with China but is determined to settle the dispute through talks between the giant neighbours.“I want to assure the country that we will not let India's pride be hurt in any circumstances,” Singh said in an interview to a news channel on Sunday.“At times, situations arise with China. It has happened before,” Singh said while insisting that India was striving to make sure that the “tension does not escalate”.“Negotiations are ongoing between the two countries at the military and diplomatic levels,” he said.Responding to the Indian Defence Minister’s comments, Zhao said: “China has been implementing the consensus between the two countries’ leaders. We have been committed to upholding our national sovereignty, security as well as stability along the border.”“Now the overall situation in our border areas is stable and controllable. We have unimpeded communication channels and we hope and believe through dialogue and consultations we can properly resolve the relevant issue,” the spokesman told a media briefing here.India, on Wednesday, said it was engaged with China to peacefully resolve the border row.Also read Videos on Twitter may hamper LAC talks“We are engaged with the Chinese side to peacefully resolve it,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, replying to questions at an online media briefing.Both India and China have rejected US President Donald Trump’s offer to mediate to settle the current standoff between the military of the two countries.“The two sides have established mechanisms both at military and diplomatic levels to resolve situations which may arise in border areas peacefully through dialogue and continue to remain engaged through these channels,” he said.Troops of India and China were engaged in a major standoff for over three weeks in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh, in what is turning out to be the biggest confrontation between the two countries after the Doklam episode in 2017.The situation deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on the evening of May 5 in Pangong Tso which spilled over to the next day before the two sides agreed to “disengage”.However, the standoff continued.The trigger for the face-off was China’s stiff opposition to India laying a key road in the Finger area around the Pangong Tso besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.The latest tensions blew up on May 9 when nearly 150 Indian and Chinese military personnel were engaged in a face-off near Naku La Pass in the Sikkim sector. At least 10 soldiers from both sides sustained injuries.The troops of India and China were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction in 2017.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

There is nothing to show that no action is being taken by the concerned authorities in the matter. On this material, we do not find any ground to pass any order on an assumption that the authorities are not taking any action,” said a Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel.The tribunal granted liberty to the NGO, Centre for Wildlife and Environmental Litigation Foundation, to approach the concerned departments in case of a grievance.The plea filed by the NGO, through advocate Gaurav Bansal, had said that despite having the contingency plan several states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh are facing the locust swarm attack since February and the situation is getting worse in some of the areas.Gujarat and Maharashtra have also been impacted by the swarm of millions of insects which eat up crops in the field they attack, inflicting heavy crop damage.The Delhi Government issued an advisory on Tuesday on preventive measures to control the looming locust attack in the national capital.It asked the authorities to organise awareness among farmers, spraying of insecticide and not letting the swarms rest during the night.The plea had said: “The worst affected are the farmers of the said area, thus the applicant NGO seeks urgent intervention of this tribunal and seeks direction to submit status report on the implementation of plan prepared by Directorate of Plant Protection, Quarantine and Storage, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer Welfare, Union of India.”        The contingency plan is a guidance document for Locust Field Offices, state governments and other stake holders during the attack, said the plea filed by ‘Centre For Wildlife And Environmental Litigation Foundation’.According to the plea, the plan covers assistance required from different stakeholders, their contribution and role, activities, type of strategy to be adopted, formation of teams, available resources, short falls and ways and means of obtaining additional resources, and the deployment as also the actions that need to be taken.The plan also provides for use of aircraft with spraying kits for locust control purpose, it said.The NGO has sought the constitution of committees to control the locust swarm attack within their respective states.“Direct the Centre to evaluate the crop damage caused due to locust swarm attack and provide compensation to poor farmers affected by it,” it said.

Two days later, on May 16, the hospital informed us that he tested positive for coronavirus,” he said.He was shifted to KEM Hospital’s ward no. 20 from where he went missing on May 19, the son-in-law said.After being unable to trace the patient, his son-in-law approached former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya.Somaiya said he had taken up the matter with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), police and KEM Hospital, after the patient’s family members pursued it up with authorities in vain.According to a tweet posted by Somaiya, the patient, a resident of Lalbaug area, was admitted at KEM Hospital on May 14. But after his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to the ICU and put on ventilator support on May 18.“On (May) 19 Hospital inform Family Patient is Not Traceable. Family pursuing with KEM & Police for 10 days in vain. I took up matter with BMC & Police & KEM,” the BJP leader said in his tweet.KEM’s Dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh did not respond to queries in the matter.KEM is one of the major civic-run hospitals in the city having treatment facilities for both COVID-19 and non-COVID patients.Last Tuesday, the death of a health worker at the KEM Hospital triggered a protest by its employees, who alleged apathy by the BMC towards their working conditions during the COVID-19 crisis.In view of the rising number of deaths of COVID-19 patients, slots in the KEM Hospital’s mortuary are full and bodies of several victims keep lying in the corridor of the medical facility, a union leader of the hospital staff later said.

Australia is also ready to open talks on the supply of seven critical minerals to India that will reduce its dependence on China.This step will also help Australia emerge from its over-dependency on exporting a few select commodities in huge quantities to China.A strategy paper by Canberra on stepping up ties with India had suggested that Australia should be expanding the services relationship and develop a resources relationship that goes beyond raw materials exports. The critical materials sector would provide an ideal opportunity.About 30 raw minerals are said to be critical inputs for 21st century technologies, such as smart-phones, e-vehicles and life-saving health equipment and electric vehicles.  India has identified lithium, cobalt, nickel and rare earth metals as key to its future industrial plans and Australia is richly endowed with all of them.Australia’s trade with India has so far focused on metallurgical coal and gold.Speaking to the media via video-conference, the envoy said India-Australia ties were at a “historic high” with both committed to a free and prosperous Indo-Pacific.While the Modi hug will be missing in the virtual summit, O’Farrell hoped that the interaction would lead to bilateral ties scaling greater heights.“Strengthening relations at this time among like-minded leaders can only be the future of the world,” he observed.The Australian envoy also welcomed the US and the UK proposals to expand the G7 grouping to include Australia and India and felt the Quad grouping of US-India-Australia-Japan has been a useful form for like-minded democracies to share perspectives on the Covid crisis.The envoy though did not touch on India signing the RCEP, a 16-nation pact which would have opened up Australian dairy exports to India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-morrison-virtual-meet-to-break-new-ground-in-ind-aus-cooperation-barry-ofarrell-92901

But this was the only option as it was the question of a child's future, Nair told PTI.Transport minister A K Saseendran also supported the move, he said.Normally, the student has to take another boat to reach the embarkation point of the KSWTD.A five-member crew, which was entrusted the task of transporting the girl, took the boat to the nearest point from her home, and she walked about five km to reach this point, another official said.The boat dropped her, waited for the examination to be over and dropped her back home on both days, Nair, whose daughter also appeared for the plus one examination, said."I am also a parent and my daughter was also appearing for the examination. I can understand their situation," he said.Asked if it was a free trip, Nair said the basic fare for students was only charged from her.   Another girl, Sreedevi, walked seven km, took a motorcycle ride, and travelled in an ambulance to cover about 150 km from a remote tribal hamlet to reach her examination centre at Thrissur and appeared for the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination recently.The 10th standard student travelled from a tribal hamlet situated in the midst of a forest, near Malakkapara, 90 km from the Tamil Nadu-Valpara Pollachi border, to appear for the examination.

01-06-2020||New Delhi||Covid-19: PM says advancements nations make in health sector will matter more than ever||The world must unite and focus on "humanity-centric" aspects of development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday, noting that advancements nations make in the health sector will matter more than ever as countries battle the COVID-19 pandemic.Modi also sought discussion on advances in telemedicine, use of 'Make in India' products and IT tools in the medical sector for a healthier society.Addressing the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences in Bengaluru via video, he said today the world is facing one of the biggest crises since the two world wars.Like the world changed pre and post-World Wars, the same way the "pre and post COVID" world will be different, he said.In these times, Modi said, the world is looking up to doctors, nurses, medical staff and scientific community with hope and gratitude.   "The world seeks both care and cure from you," he said.Seeking a global approach to dealing with the health crisis, the prime minister said earlier, the debates on globalisation have focused on economic issues.  "Now, the world must unite and focus on humanity-centric aspects of development. Advancements nations make in the health sector will matter more than ever before," he told the gathering.He said there were three things on which he would urge "maximum discussion and participation" and these are telemedicines, Make in India products in the health sector and use of IT-based tools. He proposed work on new models that make telemedicine popular on a larger scale."The other is related to 'Make in India' in the health sector. The initial gains make me optimistic," he said. Domestic manufacturers have started production of personal protective equipment and have supplied about one crore PPEs to COVID warriors, he pointed out.He said similarly, manufacturers have supplied 1.2 crore 'Make in India' N-95 masks to all the states.He also referred to the Aarogya Setu app to drive home his point on the use of IT tools for healthier societies."Twelve crore health-conscious people have downloaded it. This has been very helpful in the fight against coronavirus," Modi said.The prime minister also referred to cases of violence against health care personnel, saying such behaviour is not acceptable."Due to mob mentality, those working on the front-lines, those on duty, be it doctors, nurses, safai workers, others are subject to violence. I want to state it clearly - violence, abuse and rude behaviour is not acceptable," he asserted.An ordinance was recently issued to punish those involved in such incidents.During the last six years, the government took various initiatives in health care and medical education, he said, adding that the work has been divided into "four pillars". He said preventive health care is the first pillar and it includes importance to yoga, ayurveda and general fitness.The second pillar relates to affordable health care and Ayushman Bharat - the world's largest healthcare scheme - is a fine example of it.In less than two years, one crore people have benefited from it. Women and those staying in villages are among the major beneficiaries of this scheme, he noted."The third pillar is improvements on the supply side. A nation like ours has to have proper medical infrastructure and medical education infrastructure. Work is under way to ensure a medical college or post-graduate medical institute in every district of the country," he said.The country, Modi said, has seen rapid progress in setting up of 22 more AIIMS. "Over the last five years, we have been able to add over thirty thousand seats in MBBS and fifteen thousand seats in post-graduation. This has been the largest increase in the five-year term of any government since Independence," he said.The fourth pillar, he said, is "mission mode implementation," of programmes.The central government has recently approved the introduction of a new law for expanding education of more than 50 different allied and health care professionals.This law, once passed, will address the shortage of  para-medical personnel in the country. It will also help India in supplying skilled resources to other countries, he said.

01-06-2020||New Delhi||India’s COVID-19 tally crosses 1.9 lakh; Unlocking begins in various parts||The nationwide tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases crossed 1.9 lakh on Monday after a record number of nearly 8,400 people tested positive, but recoveries also rose further to near 92,000.Several cities saw the lockdown restrictions being eased with even traffic snarls returning back on roads.The death toll rose to 5,394 after a record single-day spike of 230 fatalities in the 24 hours since Sunday 8 am, the Union Health Ministry said in its morning update. It showed the number of confirmed cases rising by 8,392 to 1,90,535.India is now the seventh worst hit nation by the COVID-19 pandemic after the US, Brazil, Russia, the UK, Spain and Italy, according to the WHO’s coronavirus tracker.Globally, close to 62 lakh people have tested positive for the dreaded virus infection ever since it was first reported in China last December, while more than 3.72 lakh have lost their lives. However, close to 27 lakh have recovered worldwide since then and many countries have exited or begun exiting their respective lockdowns to revive stalled economies and safeguard the livelihood of the people.In India, the number of active COVID-19 cases stands at 93,322 while 91,818 people have recovered, giving a recovery rate of 48.19 per cent, according to the latest health ministry data.Globally, close to 43 per cent people have recovered so far while nearly 6 per cent have succumbed to the virus.The health ministry said India’s COVID-19 recovery rate has been improving and the rate of fatality has seen a steady decline to reach 2.83 per cent.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the world must unite and focus on “humanity-centric” aspects of development.Addressing the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences in Bengaluru via video, he said the debates on globalisation have focused on economic issues so far, but now the advancements the nations make in the healthcare sector will matter more than ever before.Among various states, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh reported more cases even as measures continued to contain the spread and to beef up the medical infrastructure to treat those contracting the virus.A group of health experts, including doctors from the AIIMS and two members of an ICMR research group on COVID-19, has said that community transmission of the coronavirus infection has been well-established across large sections or sub-populations in the country.The government has, however, maintained that India has not yet reached the community transmission stage of the disease.A senior scientist at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also tested positive following which the entire ICMR building is being sanitised, sources said.The scientist, who is from Mumbai, had come to Delhi a few days ago and tested positive for the virus on Sunday morning.In the national capital, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced reopening of barber shops and salons, among various other relaxations, but said spas will remain closed for now. A complete lockdown in containment zones will continue till June 30.Kejriwal also said there will be no restrictions on the number of people travelling in four wheelers, two wheelers, auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws and other vehicles in the city.While all shops in markets have been permitted to function, they can be closed by authorities if social distancing guidelines are not followed, according to a government order.Fresh orders would be issued later for further relaxations from June 8 as per the guidelines issued by the Union Home Ministry over the weekend.While domestic flights have begun in a phased manner, the international flights would be allowed only in the third phase of unlocking, though no dates have been decided so far.Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said several factors like restrictions in metro cities and the ban imposed by various countries on the entry of foreigners need to be addressed before resuming international passenger flights.’ Aviation regulator DGCA separately asked airlines to keep middle seats vacant to the extent possible in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. If a flyer has been allotted the middle seat due to a high passenger load, then additional protective equipment like a wrap-around gown must be provided to the passenger in addition to a three-layered face mask and face shield, the DGCA said.Separately, several states also began allowing various activities that have been restricted since March 25, when the nationwide lockdown came into effect to fight the coronavirus pandemic.In Gujarat, life returned to near normal in many parts including in Ahmedabad, the state’s worst coronavirus-hit district, as several restrictions were eased.Roads bustled with traffic as people came out in large numbers to visit markets, which have been allowed to remain open till 7 PM in all areas except in containment and micro-containment zones.In Ahmedabad, a limited number of city buses also began plying with 50 per cent seating capacity to maintain social distancing, while auto rickshaws hit the roads for the first time in ten weeks.The Ahmedabad civic body has also identified ‘micro-containment zones’, thereby reducing the number of people covered in restricted areas to nearly 70,000 as compared to almost 13 lakh earlier.In Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, more than 100 doctors and nurses from Kerala will join the medical staff at some Mumbai hospitals to help them in the battle against COVID-19 pandemic.The state saw the number of cases rising by 2,361 on Monday to reach 70,013, while the death toll rose by 76 to 2,362, the state health department said.West Bengal reported eight more fatalities to take its death toll to 253, while the number of cases rose to 5,722 after 271 more people tested positive in the last 24 hours.In Kolkata, people came out on the streets in large numbers, while traffic snarl was noticed at many places following the lockdown relaxations.Some religious places also reopened for worship by the people, which was also the case in various other states.In neighbouring Odisha, the number of positive cases rose to 2,104 after a record number of 156 cases were detected during the day. Of these, 153 were detected at various quarantine centres, while three others were found positive during COVID-19 contact tracing.In Tamil Nadu, 11 more people died of COVID-19 to take the toll to 184, while a record number of 1,162 new cases were detected to take the state’s overall tally to 23,495.In Kerala, 57 new cases were reported, 55 of whom had come from abroad and other states, taking the state’s infection tally to 1,326. More than 1.39 lakh people are under observation in the state.Andhra Pradesh reported 105 new cases, while the virus infection hit the state government’s secretariat complex also with two government staff testing positive. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-19-tally-crosses-1-9-lakh-unlocking-begins-in-various-parts-92861

It said the incident was an attempt to escalate tensions to divert attention.The MEA said Pakistan’s Charge de Affaires was issued a demarche in which a strong protest was lodged with regard to the activities of these officials against India’s national security. The Pakistan's Cd’A was also asked to ensure that no member of its diplomatic mission should indulge in activities inimical to India or behave in a manner incompatible with their diplomatic status.The two have been declared persona non grata for "indulging in activities incompatible with their status as members of a diplomatic mission," it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-pak-high-commission-officials-caught-spying-told-to-leave-india-92856

However, he undertook a 2,400km road journey on his return after completing the treatment. “He was negative when he left from Delhi but has tested positive on his return to Manipur,” a source close to the bantamweight boxer was quoted as saying.The original date for his therapy session was shifted to 25 April for he was earlier forced to miss it due to the lockdown. Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju had then requested the Manipur government to take stock of his condition and extend all possible help for treatment. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/boxer-dingko-tests-positive-92836
01-06-2020||Finally the Supreme Court has intervened to alleviate the plight of millions of migrant workers stranded in various parts of India due to lockdown since March 25.||On Covid, SC caught between judicial activism & restraint||On May 26, a three-judge Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan took suo motu cognisance of the matter, saying this section of the society needed succour and help in these difficult times as there have been certain lapses on part of the Centre and states.Two days later, it ordered free food, shelter and travel for migrants to “redeem the situation”. Further, directions are expected on June 5 after the Centre, states and UTs file detailed replies to the court’s notice. However, its delayed intervention has invited criticism from certain activists, lawyers and former judges who felt it was too little too late.The timing of the Supreme Court’s intervention has exposed the dilemmas and confusion in judicial thinking at the top in responding to an unfolding crisis of unprecedented nature and scale.Often criticised for its activist stance, the SC has created an image of a saviour of the poor since 1980s when it started entertaining PILs. In many cases, it has entered into spheres supposedly reserved for the Legislature or the Executive under the constitutional scheme based on separation of powers. Besides taking the Executive to task for inaction, it has also filled legislative void by using its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution.This is not to suggest that the Supreme Court’s initial response to the migrant workers’ crisis was misplaced. In fact, it was right in being circumspect as primarily it remains the job of the Executive to deal with such situations. Second, the crisis was still unfolding and its enormity was unknown. But once it became clear that migrant workers were walking back home on foot with their families in large numbers, it should have changed its mind, particularly after many of them died midway. Some high courts made better assessments.There is a lesson to be learnt for the Supreme Court which has created a legitimate expectation among citizens that it would come to their rescue if the Executive falters. A court which tilts towards activism during normal times can’t have the luxury of exercising restraint when a large section of population is faced with an existential crisis in the midst of a pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-covid-sc-caught-between-judicial-activism-restraint-92818

The three states have raised concerns over the rising Covid cases as the reason behind their opposition to movement of trains and stoppages as planned. “The matter is being discussed with the states. Any further development in this regard will be intimated,” a railway spokesperson said.Meanwhile, the Central Information Commission (CIC) has pulled up an official of the office of Chief Labour Commissioner (CLC) for “callous and casual” response in denying data on stranded migrants under the RTI Act. The CIC has asked the Labour Ministry “to maintain a dynamic website as regards data on migrants as and when it is received from regional heads”. Activist Venkatesh Nayak had filed an RTI application seeking to know the state-wise names of districts from which data about the stranded migrants had been received.

Senior officials of G-7 countries are expected to discuss the expansion in the weeks leading to a rescheduled summit in the US in September.Trump for Russia too; move to isolate chinaUS President has suggested the inclusion of India, Australia, South Korea and Russia, while the UK proposal wants the G-7 to exclude Russia and include the three democracies of India, Australia and South Korea.Seeking the entry of four countries in the G-7 with the express purpose of isolating China, US President Donald Trump said he would invite leaders of these nations – India, Russia, Australia and South Korea – as special invitees to the rescheduled G-7 summit. Three of these countries, barring Russia, are already partnering the US in a “Quad” grouping that aims to counter Chinese assertion in South China Sea. After being isolated at the previous two summits, Trump has called the grouping “outdated”.’If the invites are sent, India will attend its second successive G-7 summit as a special invitee. Usually, special invitees, who also include chiefs of multilateral organisations, interact for about four hours with G-7 leaders over two sessions. Then PM Manmohan Singh along with then Chinese President Hu Jintao had attended five successive G-8 (Russia was then a member) summits from 2005 onwards as part of G-5, which also included Mexico, Brazil and South Africa.After just over a decade, India is the only survivor from that G-5 club. The other G-5 members — China, South Africa, Mexico and Brazil – do not appear to be eligible for the global high table. Trump has suggested the inclusion of India, Australia, South Korea and Russia while the UK proposal wants the G-7 to exclude Russia and include the three democracies of India, Australia and South Korea.When India hosted the BRICS summit, it had invited leaders from BIMSTEC countries instead of SAARC to keep out Pakistan.France, with its deep economic and security interests in Africa, has always invited several countries from that continent at all the summits it has hosted. Bangladesh is another country from the subcontinent that has earned several invites for G-7 summits in the past with PM Sheikh Hasina having attended two of them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-uk-want-india-in-expanded-g-7-92658
01-06-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Videos on Twitter may hamper LAC talks||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 31After the skirmishes between troops of India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, the ‘war’ now is on Twitter where a video and picture of each other’s troops being beaten up threatens to make the ongoing negotiations tough for either side.The new kind of ‘war’ emerged this morning with videos showing uniformed personnel, clearly Indian troops, along the bank of a lake attacking a Chinese military armoured vehicle. A soldier (possibly a Chinese trooper) is seen lying on the ground, injured. An Indian uniformed man is seen trying to kick him. Another man in uniform and a bullet-proof jacket protects the injured man.These videos, first circulating on WhatsApp, were later tweeted by India-based handles, chiding not just China but also its ally Pakistan. An Indian Army spokesperson said the contents of the video were not authenticated. “Attempts to link it to the situation in Ladakh are mala fide. No violence is happening,” he said.Also read Situation at border with India ‘stable’, both sides have ‘unimpeded’ communication channels: ChinaThe Army has requested the media not to air the visuals that are “likely to vitiate the current situation on the borders”.A senior functionary admitted that the videos could make it tough for the negotiators on either side.It did not stop Chinese Twitter handles, known to tweet for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China, from tweeting an image of badly beaten up and bleeding soldiers, who looked from the Indian Army. Some of them were lying on the ground while others seemed unconscious. Their hands and legs were bound with ropes. A blue boat visible in the picture suggested the location was Pangong Tso.This set off another reaction, this time from Pakistani Twitter handles, who supported the Chinese troops and chided the Indian Army. Another PLA handle @dafengcao justified the images saying “there seems to be some kind of consensus on both sides before, however, the Indian broke it first after releasing the footage”. Adding to the twist was a parody account of the PLA which was on tangent of its own. Attempts to conduct talks notwithstanding, troops strength and military posturing along the LAC is like before. Tanks, artillery and equipment besides air assets are lined up on either side, said sources. The Army has been told to hold ground. On Sunday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the existing mechanism to resolve such issues has been set in motion.Chinese have unilaterally stopped Indian troops from patrolling in crucial areas between ‘finger-2’ and ‘finger-4’ along the north bank of the Pangong Tso (a 135 km glacial melt lake). The Chinese have also intruded along the confluence of Shyok river and Galwan river in sub sector north (SSN) close to the 255 km Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Baig Oldie (DSDBO) road.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/videos-on-twitter-may-hamper-lac-talks-92774

It will be the second amendment to the Constitution.Nepal recently released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the strategically key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura.India reacted angrily to the move saying such “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims would not be acceptable and asked the neighbouring country to refrain from such “unjustified cartographic assertion”. The Bill seeks to amend the political map of Nepal included in Schedule 3 of the Constitution. After endorsement by both Houses of parliament, the President will order issuance of the Bill. The central committee of the Nepali Congress on Saturday decided to back the Bill.Last week, the proposed Bill was removed from the business schedule of parliament at the last minute at the request of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.The discussion on the Constitution amendment Bill was delayed as the Nepali Congress asked for more time to discuss the matter.The ties between India and Nepal came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim, asserting that the road lay completely within its territory. — PTIBorder row escalatesMEA WITHHOLDS COMMENTNEW DELHI: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) did not comment on the latest development in Nepal’s bid to include three areas in a revised map.

Their agony, their pain, their ordeal cannot be expressed in words. Who amongst us cannot understand and feel what they and their families are going through,” Modi said in his monthly “Mann ki Baat” radio address.The PM stressed the disease and its associated challenges were new and gigantic to the world community, including India, and the fight against the pandemic would be a long haul. He, however, commended the people of India for fighting the disease unitedly with fortitude and checking its spread. “The campaign against the disease is people-driven…. the world has taken note of India’s fight against the disease, and is anticipating innovative ways from it,” he said.Extolling the virtues of India’s ancient discipline of ayruveda, Modi said world leaders had been evincing interest in it in the search for antidote to Covid during his interactions with them.He said yoga has a suite of routine and postures to strengthen the respiratory and immune systems.In the context of the pandemic and health issues, he said “Ayushman Bharat” had benefited more than one crore people, 80 per cent of them being from the rural area, and saved a total of Rs 14,000 crore which would have been incurred on medical treatment. Appealing for the success of “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” campaign, he said there was a growing echo of “vocal for local”.He said the government had taken measures to make the country “self-reliant”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-poor-hit-hard-by-virus-their-pain-beyond-words-92659

Tomorrow marks a new beginning towards recovering the lost space and to rebound from long confinement. It should be handled with care and responsibility by all,” he said in a Facebook post. He observed that relaxations during Lockdown 4.0 resulted in the virus infection scaling a new peak almost every day since May 18 with Covid positive cases hitting a new daily peak of about 8,000 on the day Lockdown 5.0 along with Unlock-1 was announced. “This provided guidance for actions as the nation is set on the course of phased exit from confinement,” he said.

Centres of excellence in India must urgently conduct high-quality autopsy studies to unravel the pathophysiology of the Indian Covid-19. This will provide unique insights into how best to treat the infection that appears to lead to multi-system pathology involving other organs. Ideally, a multi-centre research collaborative should be formed for this priority so that clinically relevant comprehensive knowledge and insights are available in a matter of few weeks,” Paul said.The US, China, Italy, Germany and Austria have conducted several Covid-19 autopsies which have shown that though Covid-19 was earlier seen as a respiratory condition it is also damaging the thin layer of cells lining blood vessels in turn causing clotting complications, hypoxia and multi-organ failure.“There is now evidence that pneumonia linkage of Covid-19 may be lesser than believed. Thrombosis and brain stroke are new complications being seen. The virus is also damaging the nerves in the nostrils leading to the loss of sense of smell,” Paul added.“This is a golden opportunity for pathologists to advance the understanding of science.

Periodic sero surveys are useful to guide the policy makers,” the ICMR said to states.The survey in high risk or vulnerable populations (health care workers, frontline workers, immune-compromised individuals, individuals in containment zones) also helps to know who has been infected in the past and has now recovered and, therefore, has antibodies to the virus.The ICMR has recommended that states use the indigenous ELISA antibody year it has developed for the purpose.“The RTPCR test is useful only when performed in an acute stage of infection at less than seven days. For several viral infections, antibody tests are useful for disease detection after five to seven days of illness. Understanding related to antibody tests for Covid is evolving and several tests are being developed globally,” said the ICMR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-cases-rise-icmr-asks-states-to-do-sero-surveys-92666
