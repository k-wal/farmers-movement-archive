31-10-2020||New Delhi||India bond: When Sean Connery, wife spent their Valentine’s Day visiting Taj Mahal||Scottish star Sean Connery, who had a massive fan-following in India as the original James Bond, visited the country back in 2007 and spent his Valentine’s Day with wife Micheline Roquebrune at the Taj Mahal.The actor, who charmed everyone with his charismatic portrayal of author Ian Fleming’s British spy, died on Friday at the age of 90.He leaves behind an illustrious body of work that includes both cult-hit films like “The Man Who Would Be King”, “A Bridge Too Far” and “The Name of the Rose”, as well as commercial potboilers like his seven James Bond movies, “The Rock”, “Entrapment” and many more.Unlike his successor Roger Moore, who had famously shot his 1983 movie “Octopussy” in India, Connery’s tryst with the country happened only in 2007.The actor, who had officially retired from acting the previous year, had visited the country with his wife.What was supposed to be a smooth “business trip” for Connery, had turned into frenzy with fans lining up outside the five-star hotel where he was staying, according to reports at the time.The couple first visited the national capital and after a brief sojourn, Connery and Roquebrune left for Agra for a trip to Taj Mahal.It was February 14, 2007 and Connery spent the day with his wife at the world famous monument, which is often hailed as the symbol of love.“I shall never forget this day, when I spent Valentine’s Day in the company of my wife in the forecourt of Taj Mahal,” the Scottish star told reporters later that day.According to another report, an eager Connery, who was enamoured by the sheer beauty of Taj Mahal, kept enquiring about the monument from the local guides.Connery and Roquebrune had come to India as part of a batch of 39 tourists.After the visit to the two cities, the couple left the country, leaving behind memories that are still fresh for Connery’s fans, who are mourning his death. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-bond-when-sean-connery-wife-spent-their-valentines-day-visiting-taj-mahal-163959

31-10-2020||New Delhi||NMC notifies new norms for MBBS admissions, setting up of medical colleges||In a major move, the newly constituted National Medical Commission has removed the provision of requirement of minimum five acres of land for setting up a medical college and its affiliated teaching hospitals while making skills laboratories mandatory.The National Medical Commission (NMC), since its constitution on September 25, 2020, has come out with a detailed list of requirements applicable for setting a new medical college, and to the established medical colleges proposing to increase their annual MBBS intake from the academic year 2021-22, the health ministry said.The requirement for the number of beds in a medical college hospital has been reduced from 530 to 430 for a 100-seat college, and from 930 to 830 for a 200-seat college, according to the new regulations notified.The beds required in various departments of a teaching hospital have been rationalised to align with the annual student intake, teaching time to be spent in clinical specialties and the minimum clinical material required for undergraduate medical training which has resulted in about 10 per cent reduction in teaching bed needs compared to the earlier regulations. The human resource of teaching faculty has also been rationalised under the new regulations. Over and above the minimum prescribed faculty, the provision for ‘visiting faculty’ has been made to enhance the quality of training, the ministry said.The medical college and its affiliating teaching hospital should provide for proportionate additional beds, infrastructure, faculty and other human resource in any specialty depending upon the needs and patient load.The new standards have been defined keeping the functional requirements of the institution(s). These allow optimisation and flexibility in utilising available resources, and harnessing modern educational technology tools to facilitate moving towards quality education, even when resources are relatively scarce, the ministry said.“In a significant step towards affordable medical education, the National Medical Commission (NMC) has notified its first major regulation. Titled as ‘Minimum Requirements For Annual MBBS Admissions Regulations (2020)’, the notification issued today replaces the Minimum Standard Requirements for Medical Colleges, 1999 (for 50/100/150/200/250 Annual Admissions) of the erstwhile Medical Council of India (MCI),” the ministry said.The new regulation has deleted the quantum of land required for setting up a medical college and its affiliated teaching hospitals, it said.In tier 1 and tier 2 cities, hilly and north-east states and notified tribal areas, the campus could also be on two plots of land – one housing the teaching hospital and the other the medical college with hostels for students and interns, the notification stated.If the campus is housed in more than one plot of land, the distance between each one of these plots should be less than 10 km or less than that of 30 minutes travelling time.“Provided that where the government district hospital is being considered for use as the teaching hospital of a medical college, all constituents of the district hospital, even if they are on two plots of land, will be considered as the affiliated teaching hospital, provided that the main district hospital has at least 300 beds or in Hilly and North-East states has 250 beds,” it said.According to the new regulations, every medical institution shall have a skills laboratory where students can practice and improve skills pre-specified in the curriculum.The purpose of the skills laboratory is to provide a safe and non-threatening environment for students to learn, practice and be observed performing skills in a simulated environment thus mitigating the risks involved in direct patient exposure without adequate preparation and supervision.The skills laboratory shall have a total area of at least 600 sq m for intake up to 150 MBBS students annually and 800 sq m for intakes of 200 and 250 MBBS students annually, and should have trainers or mannequins required to achieve skills outlined in the competency based undergraduate curriculum document, the regulations added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nmc-notifies-new-norms-for-mbbs-admissions-setting-up-of-medical-colleges-163943

31-10-2020||Jaunpur / Deoria (UP) October 31||Ram Naam Satya journey will start if people don’t stop playing with honours of daughters, sisters: Yogi||Welcoming the Allahabad High Court ruling that declared the conversion for the sole purpose of marriage as null and void, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath on Saturday said his government would deal with “love jehad” with a firm hand.If the people do not stop “playing with honours of daughters and sisters” by concealing their identities, “the Ram Naam Satya journey will start”, said the chief minister.“The Allahabad High Court had yesterday said the conversion should not be resorted to solely for the marriage and it should not be given validity,” said Adityanath, adding his government is also “taking a decision to check love jehad sternly”.The chief minister made the remarks while addressing a rally for the November 3 byelections for the Malhani assembly seat in Jaunpur and that of Deoria.“We will bring an effective law. It is my warning to those who play with the honour and dignity of sisters and daughters by hiding their real names and identities, if they do not mend their ways, the Ram Naam Satya journey will start,” said Adityanath.“The posters of those involved in love jehad will be put on all road crossings,” he said     Referring to the Mission Shakti programme of his government, the chief minister said the programme is meant to ensure the safety, security and honour of women, but if anyone still dares to indulge in any misadventure, the Operation Shakti is underway.“The court’s verdict will be followed and the honour and dignity of women will be ensured,” he declared.In Deoria, he said, an attempt was made to illegally grab the ashram of renowned saint Devraha Baba following which he was forced to shift to Vrindavan.This has prompted the BJP government to start building a hospital there in his name, he said, adding the academic work too will start there from the next session and the people of the area will also get expert medical treatment.Claiming that the rule of mafia and goonda elements has come to an end in the state, the chief minister said the Samajwadi Party chief is today worried because he had sympathy for such elements but the government has launched a drive against them.Attacking the Congress, SP and Bahujan Samaj Party, the chief minister said their governments had worked on the basis of caste while the BJP government is working for all sections of the society with complete sincerity, honesty and devotion.The chief minister said seeing the massive support to his party, the Samajwadi Party, out of desperation, is conspiring to instigate riots in the state where no such incident has taken place for the past three and half years nor would it be allowed at any cost.Asserting that the government jobs are no longer up for sale in Uttar Pradesh, the chief minister said in three and half years during his governance, over 3.50 lakh youths have got government jobs.Those who try to sell jobs are now promptly sent to jail, he added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ram-naam-satya-journey-will-start-if-people-dont-stop-playing-with-honours-of-daughters-sisters-yogi-163928
31-10-2020||---||10 pc seats in Sainik Schools reserved for girls||Vijay MohanTribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 31Tweaking the admission policy for admission to Sainik Schools, which serve as feeder institutes for the National Defence Academy, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has reserved seats for girls in these institutes along with implementing reservation for other backward classes.“One seat per category for girls is to be ensured. Ten per cent of the strength of class-VI or 10 seats, whichever is higher, will be reserved for girls in any school,” a circular issued by MoD to principals of all Sainik School this month states.In October last year, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had approved a proposal for admission of girls to Sainik Schools in a phased manner from the 2021-22 academic session following a successful pilot project at Sainik School, Chhingchhip, in Mizoram two years ago.From the forthcoming session, for which the admission process has been initiated, all Sainik Schools are also required to reserved seats for other backward classes (non-creamy layer).According to the circular, the reservation would be 15 per cent for scheduled castes, 7 per cent for scheduled tribes and 27 per cent for other backward classes. Out of the balance seats, the defence category quota accounts for 25 per cent while the remaining seats would be for the general category.Opening up Sainik Schools for girls and introducing reservation for other backward classes are two major policy changes concerning admission to Sainik Schools within a span of about a year.The new reservation policy has also kicked up a debate on the social media. While some have termed additional caste-based reservation as a regressive step as it could have implications for the institution of the armed forces where no such provisions exist, some have said it is in line with the national policy governing education institutes.There are 33 Sainik Schools across the country that are managed by the Sainik School Society, an autonomous body under the aegis of the defence ministry. Funding for the schools are shared by the central and state governments. Some more schools are also in the pipeline in various states.As per the society’s mandate, 67 per cent of the seats in each Sainik School are earmarked for candidates from the state where the institute is located. The rest are for candidates from other states.According to the new circular, two lists in the order of merit are drawn up at the time of admission – one of candidates of the home state and the other of candidates from other states. Candidates in each list will be allotted seats in accordance with the aforementioned percentage of reservation.Sainik schools intake students at the level of class-VI after a competitive extranace examination and prepare them for entry into the armed forces through the National Defence Academy after completing class-XII. While alumni of these schools have reached the apex level in the armed forces, many have been equally successful in the civilian sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/10-pc-seats-in-sainik-schools-reserved-for-girls-163926

The Agriculture Ministry, which is keeping close tab on the ongoing operations, says of the total purchase of 197.19 LMT this season, Punjab has so far contributed 136.47 LMT – 69.21 per cent of total procurement across the country.In the ongoing Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2020-21, the government continues to procure Kharif 2020-21 crops at its MSP from farmers as per its existing MSP Schemes, as was done in previous seasons, according to the latest statement by the ministry.“Paddy procurement for Kharif 2020-21 is progressing fast in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Chandigarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala and Gujarat with purchase of over 197.19 LMTs of paddy up to October 30 against the last year's 159.76 LMT, an increase of 23.43 per cent over last year. About 16.62 lakh farmers have already been benefited from the ongoing KMS procurement operations with MSP value of Rs 37,230.35 crore,” read the statement.   Besides, based on the proposal from the states, approval was accorded for procurement of 45.10 LMT of pulses and oilseeds from states, including Haryana and Rajasthan, under Price Support Scheme (PSS)."Procurement of seed cotton (kapas) under MSP is going on smoothly in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. Till October 30, 6,03,711 cotton bales valuing Rs 1,76,068 lakh has been procured benefitting 1,14,376 farmers," it added.As farmers get ready to escalate protests, officials claim the intent behind the Central Acts is to ensure that “farmers have a greater choice in the agreements they enter into and can mutually finalise prices with buyers based on quality, variety, etc. in addition to continued access to MSP procurement by the government”.Expanding the ambit of farmers protests against the three Central Agriculture Acts, major organisations will be holding countrywide ‘chakka jam’ (road blockade) on November 5 and a ‘Dilli chalo abhiyaan’ later in the month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-fierce-stand-off-on-farm-laws-with-punjab-farmers-centre-says-paddy-cotton-procurement-at-msp-going-on-smoothly-in-state-163920

Kharif onion is highly perishable. If this onion is not purchased by traders due to the present cap on stock holding, farmers in Maharashtra will face huge losses," he added.In the last six months, onion farmers have already suffered due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the Chief Minister said, and urged that the stock limit be increased to 1,500 metric tonnes.Thackeray said the limit of 25 metric tonnes for wholesale traders and two metric tonnes for retailers had caused severe hardships to onion farmers as well as traders.Maharashtra is a leading producer of onion and it accounts for one third of the country's total production, he added."The state accounts for 80 per cent of the onion exports from India. In the last season, onion production was approximately 100 lakh metric tonnes," said Thackeray."This year, excess rainfall and flooding in major onion-producing states, including Maharashtra, damaged the standing kharif crop and led to increase in prices in September-October 2020," he said.

Further, no notice has been issued to the petitioner (Nath) with regard to the impugned order in complete violation of principles of natural injustice,” the plea, filed through advocate-on-record Varun Chopra, said.While a political party pays for expenditure of a star campaigner, the candidate pays for expenditure of other campaigners.Earlier in the day, senior lawyer and Congress Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha told PTI that the former chief minister has challenged the EC’s decision on various grounds and an urgent hearing on his plea would be sought.In his plea, Nath said that EC has passed the October 30 order and has revoked his name from the list of ‘star campaigners’ of the Indian National Congress on the “ground of repeated violation of model code of conduct (MCC) and advisories” of the poll panel.It alleged that the order is “completely unreasoned and passed without application of mind”.The plea said that MCC has been in force for 12 districts of Madhya Pradesh since September 29 when the schedule for by-elections to 28 seats in the state legislative assembly, which are to be held on November 3, was announced by the EC.In his plea, the former Union minister and nine-time Member of Parliament has claimed that leaders of the BJP have been “repeatedly making statements ex-facie in violation” of the model code during campaigning for the by-elections.“It is reiterated that despite use of such language in public view and blatant violation of the Model Code of Conduct, the Respondent No.1 (EC) has not taken any such action against any leaders of BJP or the party itself for allowing its leaders to repeatedly violate provisions of MCC,” it said.The plea has also raised several questions of law of public importance, including whether the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed to Nath has been abrogated by the EC.“Whether restriction on speech and expression, that too in a manner that is arbitrary and contrary to natural justice, restrains the free exchange of ideas to the voter for making an informed choice and thus negates the fundamental right of the petitioner (Nath) to have freedom of speech and expression and the fundamental right of voters to know?” said one of the questions of law in the plea.“Whether by revocation of petitioner from campaigning as star campaigner, the principle of free and fair and level playing field in elections have been impeded by the Respondent No.1 (EC),” it said.The plea said EC ought to have granted a hearing to Nath before taking the “drastic step” of revoking his status as a ‘star campaigner’.It said that for a vibrant democracy and for conduct of free and fair elections, it is necessary that voters, candidates, campaigners and workers are not unduly restrained from exercising their freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under the Constitution.The plea said that restriction on speech and expression, that too in a manner that is arbitrary and contrary to natural justice, restrains the free exchange of ideas to the voter for making an informed choice and thus, negates the fundamental right of Nath to have freedom of speech and expression and the fundamental right of voters to know.It said that to achieve freedom of expression guaranteed under the Constitution, elections should be transparent, inclusive, accountable and there must be equitable opportunities to compete in the elections.Besides the plea, an application has also been filed seeking a stay on the EC’s October 30 order until final disposal of the petition.In the order, the poll panel said, “For repeated violation of Model Code of Conduct and for completely disregarding the advisory issued to him, the Commission hereby revokes the status of leader of political party (Star Campaigner) of Kamal Nath, Ex-Chief Minister, Madhya Pradesh, with immediate effect for the current Bye-elections of Legislative Assembly of Madhya Pradesh”. The commission referred to his remarks against Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.He had used the words “mafia” and “milawat khor” against a political rival at a recent campaigning event.Last week, the EC had asked Nath not to use words like “item” in campaigning.He had used the jibe to hit out at state minister and BJP candidate Imarti Devi at a rally. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-madhya-pradesh-cm-kamal-nath-moves-sc-against-ecs-decision-163886

31-10-2020||New Delhi||ED arrests Sai Chandrasekhar under PMLA in Rs 750-cr bank loan fraud||The Enforcement Directorate has arrested a person in connection with a money laundering case linked to an alleged Rs 750-crore bank loan fraud committed by misusing credit facilities, the central probe agency said on Saturday.It said Sai Chandrasekhar was arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act on Friday following which a local court here sent him to seven days ED custody.The money laundering case against Chandrasekhar pertains to a probe initiated by the agency against Virkaran Awasty, Vinod Sirohi and KPMG India Private Limited, it said in a statement.The PMLA case was filed against them after studying an FIR registered by the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police on the basis of a complaint received from Hassad Netherlands BV.Hassad Netherlands BV, a subsidiary of Hassad Food Company, was “induced” by Virkaran Awasty and Ritika Awasty, Directors of Bush Foods Overseas Private Limited, to part with funds amounting to $120 million (about Rs 750 crore) by misrepresenting the level of stocks/inventory, the ED alleged.“On the basis of such misrepresentations, the accused persons induced Hassad Netherlands BV to provide a corporate guarantee for the outstanding amount of Rs 714 crore of credit facilities availed from a consortium of banks. Credit facilities were availed by Bush Foods Overseas Private Limited on the basis of non-existent stocks and inventory,” the agency claimed.The probe found, it said, Virkaran Awasty along with other directors created bogus stocks by inflating the inventory and fabricating financial statements of the company.“Bulk transactions of sales and purchases were generated so that Bush Foods could record increased turnover, profit margins and additional stock by generating approximately equal value of sales and purchases in a year. Artificial profit and artificial stock in the book value of inventory was recorded in the books by showing these bulk sales as domestic sales,” it alleged.Chandrasekhar, it said, was an employee of Hassad Foods Company and was part of the team which evaluated the transactions.The agency charged that Chandrasekhar “colluded and conspired” with Virkaran Awasty to “cheat” Hassad Netherlands.“Chandrasekhar had a pivotal role and responsibility in the business transactions between Bush Foods Overseas Private Limited and Hassad Netherlands BV. He also had a key role in negotiations, discussion and due diligence carried out by Hassad on Bush Foods,” it said.Chandrasekhar was paid “illegal gratification” of Rs 20.79 crore by Virkaran Awasty for manipulating the due diligence exercise in favour of Bush Foods Private Limited despite knowing that the credentials of the company were not genuine, the ED alleged.“Chandrasekhar acquired a property located at Indiranagar area of Bengaluru worth Rs 5.8 crore for which amount was transferred by Virkaran Awasty from his company V&R Overseas. Chandrasekhar also received Rs 1 crore proceeds of crime in the account of his father and mother from Virkaran Awasty which was spent for medical treatment of his father,” it said.Chandrasekhar also got Rs 13.79 crore from Virkaran Awasty in his Dubai-based company Harin Ventures Limited, it said.The agency said it has attached Chandrasekhar’s assets in Bengaluru and Mumbai and bank balances worth Rs 7 crore in the past.

31-10-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Museum trouble for Assam’s BJP government||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, October 31As if the proposal by Congress MLA Sherman Ali Ahmed for a museum dedicated to the immigrant Muslim community in Sankardev Kalakshetra is not enough, the BJP government in Assam has been saddled with a fresh request by a Bengali Congress MLA to have a museum on the Bengalis in the institution named after the medieval scholar-reformer.Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha, Congress MLA from Karimganj (located in Assam’s Bengali-speaking Barak Valley area), has written to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal for setting up a “Bengali Museum” in Sankardev Kalakshetra.In his letter dated October 30, Purkayastha wrote that Bengalis were an integral part of the composite culture of Assam. Stating that the Bengalis, the second-largest group in the state and form 30 per cent of its people, Purkayastha urged the Chief Minister to set up a Bengali Museum to preserve their art, culture and heritage.The state government is yet to respond to Purkayastha’s letter. Conceding to the Bengali MLA’s proposal is certain to make the BJP government in the state terribly unpopular among the Assamese.Congress MLA Sherman Ali Ahmed’s proposal for a museum dedicated to the “Miyas” (Muslim settlers from eastern Bengal who came to Assam before the partition are called “Miyas” in Assam) at Sankardev Kalakshetrsa was summarily rejected by the state’s high-profile finance, health and education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. This was despite the fact that the state assembly’s Departmentally Related Standing Committee (DRSC) on Education had made a recommendation for such a museum.Hafiz Ahmed, founder president of Char Chapori Sahitya Parishad, a cultural body of the “Miya” community, is of the view that dealing with the Bengali museum proposal would require tact from the state government since the Bengali Hindus vote for the BJP in a big way.In an article published in the popular Assamese daily “Asomiya Pratidin” on October 30, Ahmed reminded the readers about the crucial role played by the immigrant Muslims to ensure that the Assamese speakers emerged as the largest group of people in the state.Ahmed dug out the story of the 1951 census (first census of independent India) when immigrant Bengali Muslim community got themselves enrolled as Assamese speakers, thus pushing the percentage of Assamese speaking people in the state to 56.7 per cent from 31.4 per cent.Arijit Choudhury, a Kolkata-based researcher who follows political development in Assam, told the Tribune that if the immigrant Muslims stuck to their Bengali linguistic identity in 1951, it might not have been possible for the Assamese speakers to secure the tag of majority.“In the 1931 census, Bengalis had outnumbered the Assamese in Assam. There was no census in 1941 due to the war. However, it must also be added that the Bengali-speaking Sylhet district was part of Assam in 1931,” Choudhury said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/museum-trouble-for-assams-bjp-government-163871

31-10-2020||New Delhi||Nafed floats bids for supply of 15,000 tonnes of imported red onions by Nov 20||Cooperative Nafed on Saturday invited bids from importers for the supply of 15,000 tonnes of red onions by November 20 in order to boost the domestic availability and check price rise.The cooperative has asked bidders to supply 40 to 60 mm size of red onions from any country of origin at Rs 50 per kg by November 20. They can bid for a minimum quantity of 2,000 tonnes to be supplied in multiple lots of 500 tonnes, it said.The bidding will close on November 4 and received bids will be opened on the same day.The shipments were to be delivered at Jawaharlal Nehru Port and Kandla ports, it added.“We have floated tenders for the supply of 15,000 tonnes of imported red onions. This will help increase the domestic supply situation,” Nafed Additional Managing Director SK Singh told PTI.The bids would be evaluated based on volumes, quality and early date of shipment. Bidders have to supply fresh, well dried and cured onions, he added.Since the buffer stock of onion, which Nafed manages on behalf of the government, is gradually getting depleted, the cooperative has been asked to augment domestic supplies with imported onions to continue with the ongoing market intervention.Last year, Nafed had not only imported on its own some quantities but also distributed onions imported by state-run MMTC.This year, it wants to get the supplies from importers so that shipments could arrive fast and improve the domestic supply situation. Even the size of onion Nafed has specified for supply is what Indians normally consume.Last year, big size onions were imported but there were hardly any takers for that.So far, Nafed has offloaded around 37,000 tonnes of onion from the buffer stock of nearly 1 lakh tonnes in select mandis and retail markets so that to check retail prices which have skyrocketed to over Rs 80 per kg in some parts of the country due to damage to the Kharif crop in the wake of heavy rains in the key growing states.On October 30, Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal had said that private traders have already imported 7,000 tonnes of onion and another 25,000 tonnes are expected to arrive before Diwali.The government hopes that the several measures taken recently including a ban on the export of onion and stock limits on traders will help ease pressure on prices during the festival period.

You will be faced with two ways, one of comfort, name and fame, another of struggle, difficulties, problems. But I can tell you from my experience that you will face real difficulties when you choose an easy way out," he said."The turn at which the country stands today, the role of you bureaucrats is of minimum government, maximum governance. You have to ensure how to reduce your interference and also ensure empowerment of common people," he said."I would also request that whatever decision a civil servant takes should be in the national interest and meant to strengthen the unity and sovereignty of the country and keep India's constitutional spirit high," the PM said.

31-10-2020||Washington||US-India relationship has bipartisan support; important to any administration: US official||US-India relationship has bipartisan support in this country and it will be important to any administration as Americans fundamentally believe that the two nations are strong, more secure and prosperous when they are working together on global challenges like ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, a top US official has said ahead of the presidential election.In an interview to PTI, State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the US recognises that it cannot address the global challenges alone and needs partnership with countries like India to tackle them."For the first time in a while, I think that the world is really confronting, what it's like whenever other great powers have values that are counter to ours. You know, democracy isn't perfect by any means, but it does involve accountability, involves transparency,” she said."We know that in order to face the global challenges that we will face in the next five to 10 years, the US can't do it alone. We have to work with our partners. We know that as it relates to a myriad of challenges on the world stage, our global partnership with India is going to be so important because it's really all about the United States and India confronting these global challenges together," she said.Ortagus said the relationship between the US and India is definitely strong and it will remain so in the future.The US-India relationship "crosses across political party lines, and will be important to any administration,” she said, ahead of the November 3 presidential election where incumbent President Donald Trump, a Republican, is being challenged by former US vice president Joe Biden, a Democrat."The reason is because we know that fundamentally Americans believe that the United States and India are stronger, more secure, more prosperous, when we're working together towards things like a free and open Indo-Pacific, and more importantly, I think what's been really exciting for many Americans to watch is India's increased leadership role in the region and in the world,” she said, days after the conclusion of the third 2+2 ministerial between India and the US.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. During the Indo-US dialogue held in New Delhi, the two sides deliberated prominently upon the Sino-India border row and situation in the Indo-Pacific region.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark Esper had travelled to New Delhi for the ministerial with the External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.Observing that the world's oldest and largest democracies share common values, she underscored that these values are critical to the security and prosperity of the two countries.Responding to a question, Ortagus said the historic 'Howdy Modi' rally in Houston last year "was such a cool visual representation" of the US-India ties.“Obviously there's much more to it than just that, but, President (Donald) Trump has had a very successful relationship and partnership with Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi,” she said.While the focus remains on defence and security cooperation, the two countries are working even more together on things like COVID-19 and increasing economic ties, Ortagus noted."One of the things that I think is unique about the US-India bilateral relationships is our people-to-people ties. Indian culture has really permeated and become part of the American culture in so many ways. What's fascinating about being an American is having a good Indian restaurant in your neighbourhood is just as much a staple now is having a good pizza joint," she said.“I think that's really cool to show how far our cultural and people-to-people ties have come and how much Indian diaspora has been fully integrated culturally into American society,” said the State Department spokesperson.Ortagus said one of the most important things that the US is going to continue to focus on is free and open Indo-Pacific, freedom of navigation, freedom of the seas, and like-minded democracy standing up for their values.India and the US, she said, have expanded the interoperability of their forces through joint military exercises. “We are also pleased that Australia is going to join the 2020 Malabar Naval exercise that will be with the United States, India, Japan,” she said.India on October 19 announced Australia's participation in the upcoming Malabar exercise, effectively making it the first military-level engagement between the four-member nation grouping - the Quad.In November 2017, India, Japan, the US and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the "Quad" to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.Ortagus said India-US defence trade has increased significantly over the past two decades. The US has authorised over USD 20 billion in defence sales to India which is an incredibly significant number, she said.

31-10-2020||Kolkata||Amit Shah to visit West Bengal on November 5; Nadda's visit cancelled||Union Home Minister and BJP leader Amit Shah will be on a two-day visit to West Bengal from November 5 to take stock of the party's organisational matters ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections, party sources said on Friday night.In a late-night development, West Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu said the scheduled visit of BJP national president J P Nadda from November 6 stood cancelled."J P Nadda Ji's visit stands cancelled as of now. It has been decided that Amit Shah ji will be in West Bengal on a two-day visit from November 5."He is likely to visit Medinipur organisational district on November 5 and on the next day he will meet party leaders in the state. The schedule has not been finalised as of now," Basu said on Friday night.Shah, who had played a crucial role in the growth of the BJP's organisation in the state, will look into various aspects of the organisation and will discuss the party's strategy for the upcoming assembly elections, BJP national general secretary and in-charge of Bengal Kailash Vijayvargiya said."It will be more or less indoor programmes. There are chances that he might address a press conference in Kolkata," he said.During the visit, Shah, along with senior party leaders such as Vijayvargiya, vice-president Mukul Roy and party state president Dilip Ghosh, will interact with booth and district-level leaders, sources said.Although Shah had addressed a virtual rally for West Bengal earlier this year, this will be his first visit to the state after the coronavirus-induced Lockdown. Shah had last visited West Bengal on March 1.Shah's visit next week assumes immense significance as West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has been criticising the "worsening" law and order situation in the state. West Bengal BJP leaders have been demanding imposition of President's Rule in the state citing "breakdown of the rule of law".Dhankhar had on Thursday met Shah in New Delhi and discussed the "state of affairs and affairs of state".On the organisational front, Shah's visit comes just days after the party's state unit witnessed a major organisational change, as incumbent state general secretary (organisation) Subrata Chattopadhyay was removed and his deputy Amitava Chakraborty was elevated to the post by the central leadership.After having a limited presence in the politically polarised state for decades, the BJP has emerged as the main rival to the ruling Trinamool Congress, winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the 2019 General Election.With the BJP's strength increasing manifold in the state in the last few years, where it has never been in power, party leaders have exuded confidence that it will end Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's 10-year rule in the assembly elections due in April-May next year.

But for the Uzbek nominee, the others are formidable public figures in their own right.Sanjrani is the chairman of the Pakistan senate and has headed the international affairs committee. This means that as per protocol, he has interacted with all major figures who have visited Pakistan. Ataullahjan is a candidate reluctantly put up by the liberal Ottawa government, for she belongs to the conservative camp but has had long innings in public life. Pacheo is well versed with the politics in the IPU, Geneva, and has in the past headed the “12 plus geopolitical group” of the IPU. The term of the new president of the IPU will be from 2020-23.From India, a delegation led by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Poonamben Hematbhai Maadam (BJP, Lok Sabha) and Swapan Dasgupta (nominated in Rajya Sabha) will participate in the virtual session and cast their votes.

The latest is the US spanner in the election of Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the new Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).What would have been the first woman and the first African to lead the WTO has been stymied by the US although India along with the EU, Japan and China had opted for the Nigerian over her South Korean rival.However, this will not be the first time the WTO election has become politicised. In 1999, a similar stalemate led to the two candidates sharing three-year terms.The job is tough and will require perseverance and outstanding negotiating skills after the previous DG Robert Azevêdo quit the post prematurely because of the stalemate in talks to reform the WTO, said sources.Sources said Washington’s objection to her selection had led the WTO postpone the election to November 9.UK, Canada’s virtual meets to boost bizNew Delhi: The UK and Canada are utilising the virtual format to look for opportunities in India as it seeks to revive its economy after two quarters of poor growth.
