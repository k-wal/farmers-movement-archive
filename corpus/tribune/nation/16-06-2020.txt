Later in the night, an army statement said 17 more soldiers who "were were critically injured in the line of duty at the standoff location and exposed to sub-zero temperatures in the high altitude terrain have succumbed to their injuries, taking the total that were killed in action to 20".            "Indian and Chinese troops have disengaged at the Galwan area where they had earlier clashed on the night of 15/16 June 2020," it said, adding that the "Indian Army is firmly committed to protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the nation".Multiple sources in government and military establishments told PTI that the fierce clashes continued for several hours.

16-06-2020||Geneva||Pakistan should stop systematic persecution of its religious minorities: India at UNHRC||India, on Tuesday, described Pakistan as “epicentre of global terrorism” and asked Islamabad to exercise “good neighbourliness” and stop systematic persecution of its religious minorities.In India’s Right to Reply at the 43rd Session of UN Human Rights Council here, First Secretary at the Ministry of External Affairs, Vimarsh Aryan, said the pathetic situation of minorities in Pakistan is well known where the systematic misuse of blasphemy laws has condemned their lives utterly miserable.“A country that categorises its minority communities into second or third tiers of citizenship is evoked with sudden sympathy for minorities in other countries,” Aryan said as he rejected all the untenable and unsolicited remarks made by Pakistan against India.Noting that Pakistan set up a minority commission after more than 60 years of its existence, he said that no minorities can represent themselves in the so-called minority commission.Pakistan “should practise tolerance towards their minorities and good neighbourliness towards us so that the South-Asian region sees eternal peace the absence of which can mostly be attributed to Pakistani deep state,” he said.Referring to the death sentences meted out regularly under the blasphemy laws in Pakistan, he said the country has the distinction of having more cases under the controversial law than the rest of the world combined together in the last decade.“Systematic socio-economic discrimination, the onslaught against religious and ethnic minorities with the full state support are manifested in organized attacks on Churches in Punjab, denial of last rites for Hindu community in Sindh, religious apartheid against Ahmadis, burning of houses belonging to Hindu Bheel community in Sindh, abduction of minor Hindu girls for sexual exploitation in Sindh, abduction of a Christian girl in Lahore...,” he said.“One can only advise this country to stop looking others but rather rectify its ongoing structural discrimination and policies against its minorities,” the Indian diplomat said.“This epicentre of global terrorism very irresponsibly harps on self-determination of the already democratic Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.Aryan said India’s decision in Jammu and Kashmir is “within our sovereign right and is an internal matter of India. Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India.”Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5 and bifurcating it into two Union territories.India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.“Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and will continue to be an integral part of India, and Pakistan should cease to covet it,” he added.

The government has deposited Rs 16,000 crore in the Jan Dhan bank accounts from April 1 to May 15.“It is surprising to note that there has been little withdrawal from those deposits. This only shows that the level of distress is not to that extent,” Gurumurthy said.He added that in the post-COVID era, the world will shift from “multilateralism to bilateralism”, and revival of the Indian economy will be faster.

16-06-2020||New Delhi||Can’t award death penalty retrospectively for crime committed prior to provision in law: SC||The Supreme Court has refused to award death penalty to a convict, who committed rape and murder of a nine-year-old child last year in Telangana, nearly two months prior to the amendment of POCSO Act by Parliament prescribing extreme sentence for the heinous crime, saying that retrospective effect to the law cannot be granted.Telangana Government has moved the top court against the Hyderabad High Court order of November 12, last year by which it had commuted the death sentence of the 25-year-old youth, who committed the grave crime and awarded him life sentence till last breath.The youth, Polepaka Praveen alias Pawan, was awarded death penalty in a trial completed in record time of 48 days by the lower court after the commission of crime on June 18-19, last year.A Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and KM Joseph said that it is unable to persuade itself with the argument of the state government on the aspect of retrospective punishment of extreme sentence on the ground that a signal goes to the society by imposition of the death sentence.“Firstly, we fail to see how retrospective effect can be granted when the punishment is to operate prospectively and logically so. Even otherwise, the punishment of not being released till his last breath is punitive enough to send a signal to the society and it cannot be that only the death sentence can send a right signal,” the Bench said.The Bench said, “We are of the view that the High Court has deemed it appropriate to impose the life sentence till the last breath, this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India should not interfere only for conversion of the same into again a death sentence was imposed by the trial court.”During the hearing, counsel appearing for the state submitted that the imposition of death sentence was included in the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 with effect from August 6, 2019 and the offence was committed on June 18-19, 2019.The counsel submitted that keeping in mind the intent of the Parliament; it should be given retrospective effect even though the provision is prospective in nature.The Bench refused to agree with contention of the state government and dismissed the appeal against the High Court order.On August 8, last year, the trial court, in its verdict delivered within 48 days of the incident, had imposed death sentence to Praveen, who on June 18 kidnapped the infant, raped and murdered after lifting the baby from their house in Kumarpally in Hanamkonda.He was caught by the girl’s family within hours, but by then the child was murdered.

16-06-2020||---||PIL alleges bias against people with mental illness in insurance coverage; SC issues notice to Centre, IRDA||New Delhi, June 16The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, asked the Centre and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) to respond to a PIL alleging bias against people with mental illness in insurance coverage.A Bench headed by Justice RF Nariman issued notice to the Centre and the IRDA on the PIL filed by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, who sought a direction to all insurance companies to extend medical insurance for treatment of mental illness.Bansal contended that the insurance companies violated Section 21 of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, which talks of non-discrimination against persons with mental illness. The bias hampered the rehabilitation process of thousands of persons suffering from mental illness, he submitted.The law mandated that mental illness should be treated on a par with other kinds of illnesses for insurance coverage.“Despite having specific provisions under the law, the IRDA is reluctant in taking immediate action. The biased attitude of the IRDA is in itself discrimination against persons with mental illness and as such is causing immense hardship for persons with mental illness,” the petitioner submitted.Instead of taking action against the insurance companies, the IRDA was abdicating its responsibilities, Bansal alleged.Citing a 2019 RTI filed, the petitioner alleged that none of the insurance companies had complied with the IRDA circular asking them to act in accordance with the Mental Healthcare Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-alleges-bias-against-people-with-mental-illness-in-insurance-coverage-sc-issues-notice-to-centre-irda-100075

They were released only after strong intervention by the High Commission and the MEA. The two Indian officials were subjected to interrogation, torture and physical assault resulting in grievous injuries to them, the ministry said. They were video-graphed and coerced to accept a litany of fictitious allegations and concocted charges, the ministry said. The vehicle of the High Commission in which they were travelling was extensively damaged, the ministry said.“This premeditated, grave and provocative action on the part of the Pakistani authorities, preceded by intensified surveillance, harassment and intimidation of High Commission personnel over the past several days, was designed to obstruct and disrupt the normal functioning of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad. The attempt by Pakistani authorities to levy false accusations and concocted charges on the officials of the High Commission is rejected in entirety,” the statement said.The MEA said these actions by Pakistan not only constituted an egregious violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 as also the ‘Code of Conduct for treatment of Diplomatic / Consular Personnel’ that India and Pakistan signed in 1992 and reaffirmed in March 2018, but are also against all established norms and practices of diplomatic conduct.“Our grave concerns at the fact that the Pakistan agencies threatened to physically harm more officials of the Indian Mission have been shared. It has been highlighted that Pakistan is responsible for the safety and security of the Indian High Commission, its officials, staff members, their families and properties,” the ministry said.“Such continued unilateral actions by Pakistan, aimed at escalating tensions, will not succeed in diverting attention from the core issue of Pakistan’s continued hostile activities and sponsorship of cross-border terrorism against India,” said the statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-fears-more-attacks-on-islamabad-mission-staffers-100074

Subsequently, ground commanders had a series of meetings to implement the consensus reached at a higher level. While it was our expectation that this would unfold smoothly, the Chinese side departed from the consensus to respect the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Galwan Valley,’’ he said.Giving details about the incident the spokesperson said that on the late-evening and night of June 15,  a violent face-off happened as a result of an attempt by the Chinese side to unilaterally change the status quo there. ``Both sides suffered casualties that could have been avoided had the agreement at the higher level been scrupulously followed by the Chinese side.’’Given its responsible approach to border management, India is very clear that all its activities are always within the Indian side of the LAC. We expect the same of the Chinese side, he said.``We remain firmly convinced of the need for the maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas and the resolution of differences through dialogue. At the same time, we are also strongly committed to ensuring India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity," the spokesman reiterated.

The exercise was to be completed on Monday, but it later emerged that as many as 451 deaths were yet to be verified by the death audit committee comprising medical professionals set up by the civic body.Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis alleged that the mismatch between the number of deaths and the figures revealed by the authorities would be as much as 951 deaths in Mumbai. In a letter toChief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Fadnavis alleged that hospitals did not even report 500 fatalities to the death audit committee. He further alleged another 451 patients were declared to have died ofother causes by the committee.Citing the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the opposition BJP pointed out that death of any person testing positive for an infectious disease has to be reported as a fatality from that disease except in three cases---death due to an animal attack, accident/crime or suicide.Following the criticism from the opposition, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday said that death of anyone who tested positive for the coronavirus would be classified as a Covid-19 fatality.According to sources here, Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta has ordered action against officials if it was found that they had wilfully tried to hide any COVID-19 death in the state.As on Monday, the official death toll from COVID-19 in Mumbai stood at 2250.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bmc-officials-to-be-probed-for-underreporting-covid-deaths-in-mumbai-100054

16-06-2020||New Delhi||US hands over first shipment of 100 ventilators to India in COVID-19 assistance||The US, on Tuesday, handed over to India 100 ventilators, valued at about $1.2 million, as part of President Donald Trump’s offer of assistance to New Delhi in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.The US Ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, handed over the first shipment of 100 ventilators to the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) Secretary-General, RK Jain, at an event at the IRCS national headquarters here.The US government, through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), donated the first shipment of 100 brand-new, state-of-the-art ventilators to India to assist its fight against COVID-19, the American Embassy said in a statement.The ventilators, produced in the United States by Massachusetts-based Zoll Medical Corporation, reflect leading-edge technology, are compact and deployable, and provide India with flexibility in treating patients affected by the virus.The USAID is working closely with the Indian government’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Indian Red Cross Society, and other relevant stakeholders in India and the United States to assist in the delivery, transportation, and placement of ventilators in select health care facilities throughout the country.“The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented global health threat.  It is only through partnership and cooperation that we will be able to ensure a healthy future for people across the world,” Ambassador Juster said at the event.“In this spirit, the United States is pleased to provide the people of India with a donation of ventilators, made possible by the generosity of the American people and the innovation of American private industry,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.The 100 ventilator units were valued at almost $1.2 million, it said.The USAID is also funding a comprehensive package of support, which includes accompanying equipment and medical supplies, technical assistance, and service plans.This donation builds on the $9.5 million that the USAID and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have committed to India in response to the pandemic, and this is helping to strengthen clinical care, disseminate essential health messages, improve disease surveillance, and more.For decades, the United States has been the world’s largest provider of bilateral assistance in health, the statement said.Since 2009, American taxpayers have generously funded more than $100 billion in health assistance and nearly $70 billion in humanitarian assistance worldwide, it said.President Trump had announced in May that the US would donate ventilators to India to treat COVID-19 patients and help it fight the “invisible enemy”.The Indian Red Cross said it extended its heartfelt thanks to the US government for gifting the ventilators to assist India’s fight against COVID-19.This life-saving resource would benefit critically ill patients immensely during this pandemic, the IRCS said.The first tranche of ventilators to support India in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the country on Monday, the USAID said.“Great to see that this 1st shipment of 100 USAID-funded ventilators produced by @MedicalZoll has reached India, another country hit hard by COVID-19. @usaid_india is working with the Indian government to see that these ventilators reach those in need,” acting USAID Administrator John Barsa tweeted.An American official had said last month that the US government is planning to “donate” 200 ventilators to India as part of efforts to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

16-06-2020||New Delhi||Milking the Planet: How Big Dairy is heating up planet and hollowing out rural communities||A new study claims global corporations increased milk production by 8 per cent in 2015-17, pushing several family-owned farms out of business and left a significant carbon footprint.The report called ‘Milking the Planet: How big dairy is heating up the planet and hollowing rural communities" by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) says corporations have left several small dairy farmers with mounting debts and declining farm incomes in four major dairy producing regions---Europe, the US, New Zealand and India.“Farmers continue to be paid below the cost of production in these regions,” says lead author Shefali Sharma, European director at IATP. “The aim of the report is to drive home the point that the right farm and trade policies can also translate into the right climate policies,” Sharma says.The study attributes the dramatic crash in global dairy prices between 2015-16 to giant corporations increasing dairy production, dramatically affecting the chain of supply and demand and pushing down prices. As these companies expanded and profited, increasing milk production by 8 per cent from 2015 and 2017, thousands of small-scale and family farms around the globe went out of business.“With COVID-19 exacerbating the crisis rural communities face, the calls for supply management that enables fairer prices while curtailing overproduction have grown louder,” Sharma says.Additionally, they also contributed significantly to GHG gas emissions: the study says the total combined GHG emissions of 13 of the world’s largest dairy corporations---called the Big Dairy---rose by 11 per cent between 2015 and 2017. Some even reported an emission rise of 30 per cent, the study says."In 2017, these companies together emitted more GHGs than two of the top 20 fossil fuel emitters, BHP and ConocoPhillip," it says.The top 13 global dairy companies combined increased greenhouse gas emissions by 11% in two years, the study says.“Unlike growing public scrutiny on fossil fuel companies, little public pressure exists to hold global meat and dairy corporations accountable for their emissions,” Sharma says. “As governments ratchet up their climate goals, the rise of large-scale dairy and public incentives that further increase corporate dairy power, production and emissions must be stopped,” she said, adding “rural livelihoods and our planet’s future depend on it”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/milking-the-planet-how-big-dairy-is-heating-up-planet-and-hollowing-out-rural-communities-100043
16-06-2020||KV Prasad||Green shoots emerging in economy: PM Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 16Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Tuesday, said greens shoots of economic recovery could be seen as the country while cautioning that extreme vigil needs to be maintained in order not to lose the advantage of the lockdown to check the spread of COVID-19.In his opening remarks at the start of the two-day video-conference with the Chief Ministers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said indications were available to show that economic activity was picking up and suggested that the states could share experiences of the steps taken to restart the economy so that each could learn from others’ experience.In his first interaction with the Chief Ministers after 15 days of the Unlock 1.0, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the first indicator of economy restarting was the rise in power consumption, which had fallen during the last few months. The toll collections, too, have increased while the exports went up this month as well.The kharif crop sowing rose by 12 per cent to 15 per cent while the consumption of fertiliser doubled during May this year as compared to May 2019. In other sectors, he said, the production of two-wheeler had also risen by 70 per cent in comparison to the pre-lockdown period while retail and digital payments were almost at par with those in the period before the country went into lockdown on March 25.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said while he was eager to hear the experiences and the views of the Chief Ministers, all states should work together to set up value chains and step up economic activities providing assistance to take the country on the path of self-reliance. The Centre, he said, came up with several measures to unleash the potential.On India’s strategy to contain the spread of the virus, he said while every death was saddening, the death rate from the disease was the lowest in the country with the recovery rate being above 50 per cent. He said the timely measures taken by the governments helped in controlling the situation and prevented what happened in many countries.Today’s interaction was with 21 Chief Ministers and with the left 15 will take place tomorrow. Home Minister Amit Shah is conducting the proceedings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/green-shoots-emerging-in-economy-pm-modi-100042
16-06-2020||New Delhi||Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP reach agreement with pvt sector for affordable treatment||As part of efforts to provide reasonable healthcare to COVID-19 patients, some states namely Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh had reached an agreement with the private sector, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday.Amid the reports of a likely shortage of healthcare infrastructure, the Ministry had on Monday asked the states and the Union Territories to proactively engage with private healthcare providers to facilitate enhanced bed availability and critical care health facilities and to ensure fair and transparent charges for services provided.“Some states, namely Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh have already taken the initiative.“They have negotiated and reached an agreement with the private sector on reasonable rates and arrangements to provide critical care for in-patient COVID-19 admissions,” the Ministry said.States have also been asked to proactively engage with the private sector health providers and consider pooling in public and private healthcare facilities, as this will help in providing prompt, good quality and reasonable health care to COVID-19 patients.As the virus tally reached 3,43,091 on Tuesday and the death toll rose to 9,900, the Ministry also said the testing capacity for detecting COVID-19 was being continuously ramped up and it now had a capacity to test three lakh samples per day.A network of 907 labs — including 659 labs in the government sector and 248 in the private sector — have been created in the country as on date, the Ministry said, reiterating that the RT-PCR is the gold standard frontline test for diagnosis of COVID-19. These tests require specialised laboratory facilities and take at least two to five hours, including the time and the effort to transport the sample to these high-end labs. The TRUENAT and CB NAAT being portable can be and are being used in remote areas.A total of 59,21,069 samples had been tested for COVID-19 so far with 1,54,935 samples being tested in the last 24 hours, the Ministry said.Besides, in order to enhance the testing capacity in Delhi, each of the 11 districts would now have assigned labs for exclusively testing the samples from the respective districts, the Ministry said in the statement.The samples from each district are being sent to these labs to ensure timely testing and getting the results without any delay. Currently, there are 42 labs in Delhi with per day testing capacity of approximately 17,000. In its endeavour to make testing more affordable and increase the volume of testing without losing on reliability, sensitivity and specificity, the ICMR, on Monday, issued an advisory recommending the use of point-of-care Rapid Antigen Detection Test.The Rapid Antigen test may be used in containment zones and hospital settings under strict medical supervision. The Standard Q COVID-19 Ag detection kit takes 15 minutes to show results and, therefore, will help in early detection of the disease. The antigen test can be conducted at the site of sample collection in the healthcare setting within one hour of sample collection.Domestic manufacturing capacity of antigen test kits in the country currently is around 10 million in a month. In order to facilitate states to easily procure the Rapid Antigen test kits, the Centre is ensuring that the domestic manufactures are onboarded to the Government E-Marketplace (GEM) portal.

16-06-2020||Chandigarh||The strategic importance of Galwan Valley||The Galwan valley in eastern Ladakh that saw a violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops on the night of June 15 resulting in casualties on either side has strategic significance because of its proximity to the vital road link to Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO)---the world’s highest landing ground that lies close to the Line of Actual Control and serves as an important aerial supply line.This DBO area is known in the Army as Sub-Sector North. India is engaged in building up border infrastructure in this area, including the all weather 255 km Darbul-Shayok- DBO road. The road runs almost parallel---at places very close---to the LAC and extends up to the base of the Karakoram pass, which when complete, will reduce the travel time from Leh to DBO from the present two days to just six hours. Road and bridge construction works have recently been speeded up with a large number of labourers being ferried in. The Galwan valley connects with Shyok on the road under construction and lies between DBO and Chushul to the south near Pangon Tso, another hot spot, providing convenient access to Shyok and the areas beyond. Control of the ridgeline along the valley also allows domination of the road. Looking eastwards, control of the Galwan valley gives access to the Aksai Chin plateau, through which part of the Xinjiang-Tibet highway passes.While the road is highly prone to Chinese interdiction or long range artillery, it serves a vital peace time role in maintaining forward posts and building up reserves. An alternate route to DBO is being developed from a different axis in Ladakh that has adequate depth from the LAC. The Galwan river flows westwards from the disputed Aksai Chin region in to Ladakh after originating in Samzungling area on the eastern side of the Karakoram range and joins the Shyok River, one of the tributaries of the Indus. The fast flowing river runs for about 80 km.The river is named after Ghulam Rasool Galwan, a Ladakhi explorer from Leh, who first explored the course of the river. In 1899, he was part of a British expedition team that was exploring the areas to the north of the Chang Chenmo valley, when he is said to have run into this previously unknown river valley. It is said one of the rare instances where a major geographical feature is named after a native explorer.The Galwan river is to the west of China's 1956 claim line in Aksai Chin. However, in 1960 China advanced its claim line to the west of the river along the mountain ridge adjoining the Shyok river valley. India had established some military posts in this sector.During the 1962 Sino-Indian conflict, Indian posts in the Galwan Sector were attacked and overwhelmed by the Chinese, resulting in casualties and some prisoners-of-war. After the war, this sector largely remained dormant till the recent face-offs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/the-strategic-importance-of-galwan-valley-100037

As the news is unfolding, it has come out that the colonel (who succumbed to the injuries) fell down in the river. This implies that the Chinese have not withdrawn to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). They are still on the river line. They had come well prepared with gloves, nails etc and I think tempers do go high when an officer is killed. I believe the Chinese have also lost their people.”He said, “Knowing that it was an on-the-spot escalation, there is no deliberate attempt here. We should deescalate from here at the military and MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) level. It is best for both the countries.”Lt Gen HS Panag (retd), former Army Commander of Northern and Central Commands, in a tweet, described the incident as government’s Kong La moment. “At present, circumstances are not known. Whatever is being told to us is the official statement of the Army. There is no independent reporting. It is unusual for soldiers, that too an officer, to get killed like this. We have had a similar face-off in the first week of May too. But lies were being spread whereas situation on the ground was serious.”In another tweet, Lt Gen Panag said, “I am deeply anguished that we came to this pass despite clear warning of Chinese intentions for the last four weeks.”Defence expert Maj Gen Raj Mehta (retd) said, “The incident happened during withdrawal. No bullets were fired. The matter should be investigated. The good thing is that both countries are talking to each other. Galwan area is the neck of Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO). All supplies are made through DBO. It can’t be compromised.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/retired-army-officers-describe-violent-face-off-with-chinese-troops-as-unusual-call-for-de-escalation-100035

I came to know about the case of purchase of the girl for Rs 1.5 lakh on June 1. The girl is pregnant. As the issue is serious, I informed the NCPCR," Pandya said."The case was unearthed when she fled the man's house. On May 2, the man filed a missing complaint in Mandawa police station, claiming that his 'wife' had gone missing. Police traced her on May 4, but the teenager refused to go with the person and sought protection, leading to Jhunjhunu Sub-Divisional Magistrate to order her lodging at the Jhunjhunu shelter home," Pandya said.The Jhunjhunu SDM had also directed the Mandawa police to reinvestigate the matter while the Rajasthan State Commission of Protection of Child Rights directed the Child Welfare Committee to file an FIR against the accused under the Juvenile Justice Act, and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and anti-trafficking law.Tripura's Unakoti District Superintendent of Police Ratiranjan Debnath said that after the NCPCR ordered, he send a detail factual report to the panel on the case."The girl's family is extremely poor. Before sending the report, we talked to the family but they are not so serious to take her back. They never informed police about the girl going missing," the district police chief told IANS.When contacted, Tripura Commission for Protection of Child Rights Chairperson Nilima Ghosh told IANS that she is "not aware" of the matter and would talk to police and Child Welfare Committee in Unakoti.

The expectation was that just as the Doklam stand-off quickly de-accelerated because of an impending summit of BRICS nations in China, this stand-off may also end before Foreign Ministers from the three countries faced the cameras.“Indian troops crossed the border for illegal activities and launched provocative attacks against Chinese personnel, and the Chinese side has lodged a strong protest and solemn representation,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.Also read: Indian Army Colonel, 2 soldiers killed in clash with Chinese troops in Ladakh's Galwan ValleyA little later, the hawkish media outlet Global Times alleged that Indian troops had again crossed the line of actual control in the Galwan Valley region and “purposefully launched provocative attacks, leading to severe clashes and casualties”.China said it had lodged a solemn representation with the Indian side and urged it to strictly restrain its frontline troops from crossing the border or taking any unilateral action that may complicate the border situation.At the same time, it also reiterated the placatory statement it has made ever since the stand-off erupted about seven weeks back.“China and Indian side agreed to resolve the bilateral issues through dialogue to ease the border situation and maintain peace and tranquillity in border areas,” said the Ministry. Both Foreign Offices have been making similar statements since the stand-off began.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-poses-as-victims-after-clash-ric-foreign-ministers-meet-hangs-in-balance-100028

16-06-2020||New Delhi||20 Indian soldiers dead in clash with China||Fragile peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China was shattered last night. As many as 20 Indian Army soldiers, including, an officer, have been killed in action while battling the Chinese at Galwan valley in Ladakh.However, the count of those injured or missing in action is still not known.Till 10 pm on Tuesday the Indian Army had confirmed three dead, Col Subhash Babu, the Commanding officer of the 16th battalion of the Bihar regiment, Havildar K Palani and Sepoy Ojha.Also read: Face-off result of Chinese unilateral attempts to change status quo at LAC: MEAAuthoritative sources told the Tribune the count is 20 dead.More than 900 troops on each side were involved in a physical clash, which started Monday night, lasted several hours---in three phases---and ended on early hours of Tuesday.  Most of the deaths have occurred as soldiers fell-off cliffs during a physical fight in the narrow Galwan valley into the river at an altitude of 15,000 feet. Some died due to hypothermia and other due to injuries.Stones, Steel poles, bamboo poles with nails embed on them, were used by the Chinese, to attack the Indian troops. The Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) of China, have also suffered fatal casualties. There is no number to their casualties. Indian Army categorically said “no bullets were fired in clash”. The casualty would have been manifold had bullets been firedAlso read: Galwan valley clash: Suryapet cries for its martyred sonDetailing the incident, sources said it occurred as an altitude of almost 15,000 feet. The Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was in talks with Indian Army for both sides to withdraw from the forty---day long stand-off, had build a fresh post and set up arctic tents at vantage position on the south bank of the Galwan river. The post gave a clear view to Chinese of the vital 255 kms Darbuk Shayok Daulat Baig Oldie (DSDBO), India’s only link to Depsang, Murgo ad Karokaram pass. This was unacceptable to India. The post was some 5 km from the DSDBO road, the Galwan river flows  in an east-to-west direction and joins the river Shyok.Troops of the 16th battalion of the Bihar Regiment noticed this fresh military post near patrol point 14 and asked the Chinese to vacate. The number of Indian Troops was greater than the Chinese on the spot, a clash ensued. The PLA sent in reinforcements another clash ensued.The disengagement plan decided on June 6 at the meeting of Corps Commander-level was to ask both sides to withdraw from Galwan valley.However, on Tuesday PLA’s Western Theatre Command spokesperson Colonel Zhang Shuili made a fresh claim on Tuesday saying “China always owns sovereignty over the Galwan Valley region, and the Indian border defence troops are inconsistent with their words and seriously violated the agreements both countries have reached”.Until now the Indian side had maintained that there was no dispute at Galwan and the LAC, which is not demarcated on ground, matched the Chinese claim line (CCL) proposed in 1956.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/20-indian-soldiers-dead-in-clash-with-china-100018

Exactly what might compel a person to commit suicide?? I fear his death is just the tip of the iceberg just like the #metoo movement was for a much bigger malaise in Bollywood," wrote Kashyap."The death of Sushant Singh Rajput brings under scanner the role YRF talent Management Agency might have played in pushing him towards his suicide but that is for the authorities to investigate. These people don't make careers. They ruin your career and life."Also read: 'Can we cry in peace': Kriti Sanon's sister Nupur on 'harassment' for not posting on Sushant Singh Rajput's deathAlso read: On Sushant's death, Dharmendra says 'this beautiful, beloved show business is very cruel'Having suffered personally for a decade, he said he can confidently say every "Talent Manager and all Talent Management Agencies of Bollywood are a potential death Trap for Artists".Talking about his own experience, he said: "I have experienced exploitation and bullying first hand."Also read: Unable to bear loss, Sushant Singh Rajput's sister-in-law dies in BiharGoing back to his "Dabangg" days, he said: "The reason I moved out of making Dabangg 2 ten years ago is because Arbaaz Khan in collusion with Sohail Khan and family was trying to take control of my career by bullying me. Arbaaz Khan sabotaged my second project with Shree Ashtavinayak Films that I was signed up with by personally calling their head Mr. Raj Mehta and threatening him with dire consequences if they made a film with me. I had to return the signing money to Shree Ashtavinayak films and moved to Viacom Pictures. They did the same thing.""Only this time the sabotager was Sohail Khan, and he intimidated the then Viacom CEO Vikram Malhotra. My project was sabotaged, and I was made to return my signing fee of Rupees 7 Crores plus interest of Ninety odd lacs. Its only then that Reliance Entertainment came to my rescue, and we forged an enduring partnership for my film Besharam."Still, things didn't go smoothly with his career."Salman Khan and family sabotaged the release of the film and got their PROs to run a sustained negative smear campaign against me and my film BESHARAM before release. This scared the distributors from buying my film. Reliance Entertainment and I were capable and courageous enough to release the film ourselves but the battle had just begun. My enemies, which there were many ran a sustained negative Trolling and badmouthing campaign against the film till the Box Office of my film collapsed. But to their horror, Besharam had still netted 58 crores before it went out of theaters," he said about the film that had released in 2013."So they fought on... They sabotaged the Satellite release of the film that was pre-sold to Mr. Jayanti Lal Gada who was the main agregator for Zee Telefilms those days. With Reliances goodwill, they were able to re-negotiate the satellite rights sale with Gada for a much lesser price," he added.Also read: Mithun Chakraborty to skip birthday bash due to Sushant Singh Rajput's death and COVID-19Over the next few years, "all my projects and creative endeavors have been sabotaged and I have been repeatedly threatened with life and rape threats given to/for the female members of my family. The sustained gas lighting and bullying destroyed my mental health and that of my family and led to my divorce and breaking up of my family in 2017. They erred and sent some of these threats as texts, sent to me as sms from several numbers. Armed with evidence, I went to the police in 2017 to file an FIR which they refused to register but registered a non-cognizable complaint. When the threats continued, I forced the police to trace the numbers, but they couldn't be traced back to Sohail Khan (the suspected sender). My complaint remains open to date and I still have all the evidence".He says his enemies "sharp, cunning and always attack me from the back and stay Hidden. But the best part is after 10 years, I know who my enemies are. Let it be known that they are Salim Khan, Salman Khan, Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan. There are many other small fry's but Salman Khan family is the head of this venomous serpant. They use a clever mix of their ill-gotten money, political clout and connections with the underworld to intimidate anyone and everyone"."Unfortunately truth is on my side, and I am not going to give up like Sushant Singh Rajput. I refuse to cow down and will fight on till I see the end of either them or me. Enough tolerance. It's time to fight back."So this is not a threat, it's an open challenge. Sushant Singh Rajput has moved on and I hope he is happier wherever he is but I will make sure that no more innocent will kill himself over lack of work with dignity in Bollywood. I hope suffering actors and creative artists will share my post on various social media platforms as will the media and people who patronize the entertainment industry," he concluded with #metoo #BoycottSalmanKhan. — IANSA lot of people are showing concern about my safety.

16-06-2020||---||Sonia Gandhi seeks rollback of fuel price hike, writes to PM||New Delhi, June 16Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday wrote to PM Narendra Modi seeking rollback of fuel price hike saying the decision to raise fuel prices in Covid times was insensitive.“India has faced unprecedented public health, economic and social challenges during the ongoing battle against Covid-19. I am deeply distressed that in these exceedingly difficult times since the beginning of March, the Government has taken the wholly insensitive decision to increase petrol and diesel prices on no less than ten separate occasions,” Gandhi said.She said the Government is seeking to earn an additional revenue of nearly Rs 2,60,000 crore by these ill-advised hikes in excise duty and increases in petrol and diesel prices.“As it is, people across the board are facing unimaginable hardships what to say of widespread fear and insecurity. These price increases are saddling our people with an additional burden of this enormous magnitude that is neither justified nor appropriate. It is the duty and responsibility of the government to alleviate suffering, not put the people to still greater hardship,” noted Gandhi.Gandhi added she sees no logic in why the Government would even consider such a price increase at a time when the economic impact of Covid-19 is  depriving millions of jobs and livelihood, devastating business big and small, rapidly eroding the income of the middle class, even as farmers are struggling to sow the crop for the Kharif season.“Given that the international price of crude oil has fallen by approximate 9 per cent over the last week the Government is doing nothing short of profiteering off its people — when they are down and out. It is a matter of record that despite historically low oil prices over the last six years your government’s revenues have been massively enriched by the cumulative increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel on twelve different occasions (by an additional Rs 23.78 per litre on petrol and Rs 28.37 on diesel). This translates into a 258 percent increase in excise on petrol and 820 percent hike in excise duty on diesel yielding in these six years a staggering Rs 18,00,000 crores from excise collection on petrol and diesel alone,” said Gandhi.She said if ever there was a time to deploy these resources in the service of the people, it was now.I urge you to roll back these increases and pass on the benefit of low oil prices directly to the citizens of this country, she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-gandhi-seeks-rollback-of-fuel-price-hike-writes-to-pm-99984

16-06-2020|| Kolkata||Trams back on tracks in Kolkata||Electric trams, considered as integral a part of Kolkata landscape as the Victoria Memorial or the Howrah Bridge, are back on the tracks.Noting problems faced by the daily commuters—who are suffering in the absence of the metro service and inadequate availability of buses—the authorities have decided to allow passenger trams to resume operation. Like all other public transport, tram service too was stopped when the central government ordered the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Electric trams were first introduced by the British in the city in 1902 and never before have trams kept off tracks for such an extended period.“It is hard to get buses. So I decided to take the tram,” said one passenger waiting for a tram at the Tollygunge terminus. CTC (Calcutta Tramways Company) has decided to resume the service first on the busy Tollygunge—Ballygunge—Tollygunge route and then gradually restart operations on the remaining routes. Before a journey, the tram is sanitised by personnel of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. While the conductor wears his usual Khaki coat, the driver dons a PPE suite. Passengers must wear masks and only seated passengers are allowed to travel.The state government-run CTC ordinarily caters to approximately 70,000 commuters daily with an average revenue collection of Rs 2.5 to three lakhs every day.This reporter took a tram ride to travel from Tollygunge to Ballygunge. Powered by electricity, drawn from overhead cables via a pole rigged on the top of the vehicle, the tram hurtled through the track making incredible noise and covered the 5.5 km distance in about 50 minutes. The fair for the journey was seven rupees. The coach (the tram had two coaches) boarded by this reporter, though looked very old at first glance, turned out to be manufactured only 38 years back by Burn Standard Company (closed down in 2018) at its plant in Howrah. The “Dick-Kerr System” motor used for operating the electric vehicle, however, is much older and could date back to the days of the First World War. “Trams are a part and parcel of the culture and history of Kolkata. Although their numbers have come down, trams are still very much visible in the city and a visit to Kolkata remains incomplete without a tram car ride. Not only it is the only functional tram system in the country, but possibly the only one of its kind in entire Asia,” said Rangan Dutta, travel writer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trams-back-on-tracks-in-kolkata-99955

Everyone knows what is the positive and conducive atmosphere. It is up to the Nepal Government to do that. We have already reiterated our commitment on earlier occasions,” said highly placed sources.The observation comes a day before Nepal’s Upper House will consider a resolution to change the map on the coat of arms to include the areas claimed by India as well. The Indian stand with respect to Nepal is at variance with its attitude to resolving the stand-off with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) where it entered into talks with no preconditions.Charging Oli with unilateral changing Nepal’s political map, the sources said the fact that this was done without fact or evidence, points to domestic political agenda being the prime motivation behind the move.“We don’t know why PM Oli and his government did not tell the Nepalese people about our offer of talks. We keep hearing India has never offered a virtual conference between Foreign Secretaries,” said the sources, while pointing out that Nepal did not respond to the two offers for talks made over the past nine months.They however conceded that PM Narendra Modi has not spoken to Oli on the issue. At the same time, the sources said the dispute has not impaired cooperation in other areas. “Our cooperation is multifaceted. The Government of India has remained in the forefront of Covid assistance to Nepal,” they said.PM Oli’s virus spike claim ‘false’Sources reacted sharply to Nepal PM KP Oli’s claim that Nepalese returning from India had led to a spike in Covid cases. “This is false and distorted. So many Nepalese are coming from other countries, including China. To single out the name of one country (India) indicates the same political motivation of the current establishment,” they responded. Sources blame the Nepal Government’s inept handling of the epidemic as the reason for the spike.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/create-conditions-conducive-to-dialogue-india-asks-nepal-99655
