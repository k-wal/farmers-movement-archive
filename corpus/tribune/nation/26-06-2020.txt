All three patients are showing improvement in their clinical state, oxygen saturation and d-dimer levels,” Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College, said on Friday.“We have included these patients with progressive disease as shown by clinical findings and HRCT chest scoring system. All this is being done as per the protocol of the ICMR and with the permission of the DCGI. The dose required is 200 ml of plasma on two consecutive days,” Dr Bhandari, who led a team of doctors, claimed.SMS hospital was the first after the same team of doctors recovered an Italian tourist followed by many others in the beginning phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The doctors used mix medicines that proved to be successful in recovering the patients, he recalled.As per the ICMR protocol and only for patients who qualify for the treatment, the donors of plasma are the patients who have recovered after 21 to 28 days of their illness.Repeated RT-PCR testing was done on them and when found negative, they were found to be suitable donors. Antibody detection rapid test was also done that showed a positive response, meaning that the protective antibodies have formed in the recovered patients, following which their plasma was obtained for donation, which was then infused into the blood-group matched recipients suffering from active infection.The plasma is obtained through an online separation technique in which RBCs are transfused back to the donor, Dr Bhandari informed.He further added that convalescent plasma or immune globulins had been used as an adjunct therapy to improve the survival rate of patients with SARS or COVID-19, whose condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment with so-far known modalities.Meanwhile, Medical and Health Minister Raghu Sharma maintained that the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients in the state has touched a new mark of 79 per cent as 12,935 patients of the total 16,386 cases have recovered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-conducts-successful-plasma-therapy-on-three-covid-19-patients-104905
26-06-2020||New Delhi||Charges on RGF manufactured, Chinese money used for disabled, Sino-Indian ties research: Congress||The Congress on Friday night said the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation funding issue raised by BJP chief JP Nadda was a distraction and a manufactured controversy to divert national attention from the government’s failures to foil Chinese aggression on the Ladakh border.In a statement, Congress media head Randeep Surjewala said Rs 1.45 crores that RGF received from the Chinese Embassy in 2005 was for the purpose of the disabled welfare and research on Sino-Indian relations and was used for these purposes.“RGF accounts were duly audited and statutory returns were filed under Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA) to the Government of India. This grant has been reflected in all filings to the income tax and the Home Ministry and no authority has ever found any wrongdoing of any nature,” Surjewala said.The Congress also admitted RGF receiving money from the PM Relief Fund but said, “Pursuant to the unprecedented Tsunami in the last week of 2004, RGF received a modest amount of Rs 20 lakh from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund in the financial year 2005 which was duly utilised to undertake relief activities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.”Surjewala added PM Narendra Modi and BJP president JP Nadda‘s “total failure to protect national security and territorial integrity of India cannot be washed away in the cacophony of manufactured and desperate allegations vis-à-vis grants received by the RGF foundation which has been audited and reported both to the Income Tax and Home Ministry”.The Congress leader said, “Diversion, disinformation and distraction were the hallmark of the BJP government when exposed and caught lying on issues of national security and territorial integrity.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/charges-on-rgf-manufactured-chinese-money-used-for-disabled-sino-indian-ties-research-congress-104904
26-06-2020||New Delhi||Students from riots-hit northeast Delhi may be at a disadvantage in DU admission: Professors||Students hailing from northeast Delhi, where a communal violence in February this year forced postponement of board examinations, may be at a disadvantage in the Delhi University admission process, some professors have said and demanded a separate arrangement for them.The professors expressed their apprehensions after the CBSE said that results of the students from the area “will be declared based on performances in the appeared subjects and performance in internal, practical or project assessment”.One of the professors said the CBSE decision will put them at a disadvantage as “students usually do not take internals seriously”.According to a four-point assessment scheme announced by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), marks for the pending classes 10 and 12 exams, which have been cancelled in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be awarded on basis of marks scored by a student in his or her best performing subjects.Taking note of cancellation of a few exams in northeast Delhi in view of the communal violence in the area during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in February, the board has decided to take into account internal exams to assess performances.“There are very few students of class 12, mainly from Delhi, who have appeared in the examinations in only one or two subjects. Their results will be declared based on performances in the appeared subjects and performance in internal, practical or project assessment,” CBSE Exam Controller Sanyam Bhardwaj said.Pankaj Garg, a former member of Delhi University’s Academic Council, said that according to the datesheet issued for northeast Delhi students by the CBSE for exams between July 1 and 15,  the exams for all the science stream subjects were pending.“The CBSE cancelled the exams but what about students from northeast Delhi, and specially those from the Science stream, whose exams were pending. From the datesheet that the CBSE had released, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science and English exams were pending. They will be at a disadvantage since their marks will be calculated on the basis of internal assessment. Students usually do not take internals seriously,” he said.He said the university will have to keep a separate window for those who will take the exams at a later date.“From what the scenario looks like, the new session is unlikely to commence before October. The varsity might keep a window open for students who take the exams at a later stage and maybe say that those students whose marks meet the fifth cut-off will be eligible for admissions to the varsity,” he said.Executive Council member Rajesh Jha said that the cut-offs in the coveted colleges are unlikely to be affected, but added that students with certain kind of subject combinations or students who were relying on some subjects in the remaining exams to score well might suffer.“Changing the admission policy will not be the right thing to do at this time. But keeping a special window for students from northeast Delhi, who had to see exams being postponed first on account of the riots and then for coronavirus could be done. It was not their fault, so why should they suffer,” he said.Meanwhile, Hindu College principal Anju Srivastava said that the cut-offs will depend on the results that will be announced by the CBSE on July 15.“We keep the cut-offs because of the limited number of seats at our college. The second cut-off and the subsequent cut-offs will be decided on the basis of the admissions that happen after the first cut-off,” she said.DU’s Dean (Admissions) Shobha Bagai said the varsity will “wait and watch” the situation since there is time till July 15, when the Board will announce the results.“We will just wait and watch for a few days. The cut-offs will come into picture once the results are out. We will just have a look at it. For instance, the Computer Science paper was pending and the impact will be similar on all the students. We will like to wait and watch and then the committee will take a decision whether to go ahead with the same methodology or whether we need to make certain changes. Right now, it’s too early to say anything. We do have a window,” said Bagai.Every year, Delhi University receives the maximum number of applications from students of CBSE-affiliated schools. As many as 2,05,434 applicants for undergraduate courses were from CBSE schools, out of a total of 2,58,388 applicants last year.This year, there was a delay in the commencement of the admission registration process due to the coronavirus pandemic. The process of registration commenced on June 20 and will go on till July 4. The varsity has still not announced the tentative dates for announcement of cut-off in wake of the pending CBSE results.Till now, over 1.76 lakh students have registered on the admission portal, with over 68,000 of them making payments.

26-06-2020||---||Germany offers Covid aid to India||New Delhi, June 26Germany has become the second G-7 nation to offer emergency Covid aid to help the urban poor and vulnerable groups such as migrant workers in India following the Covid pandemic.Germany has committed an emergency support measure of 460 million Euros (Rs 3,893 crore) to support India’s move towards a systematic social protection scheme.The loan aims to develop systems and processes for coordinated action across ministries and states, balance social assistance and social insurance programmes and allow for portability of ‘ in kind benefits’ such as the “One Nation, One Ration Card’’ scheme.France had earlier committed 200 million Euros (about Rs 1,700 crore) to boost the PM Garib Kalyan Yojna.India has already borrowed $ 2.25 billion (about Rs 16,000 crore) from two China-led multilateral banks and about $ 2 billion (about Rs 14,000 crore) from the West-led World Bank and Asian Development Bank to provide relief to the vulnerable sections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/germany-offers-covid-aid-to-india-104901
26-06-2020||Beijing||China’s attempt to alter status quo can have ‘repercussions’: Indian envoy||India on Friday warned China that trying to alter the status quo on the ground by resorting to force will not just damage the peace that existed on the border areas but can also have “ripples and repercussions” in the broader bilateral relationship, and demanded that Beijing stop its activities in Eastern Ladakh.The only way to resolve the current military standoff along the LAC in eastern Ladakh was for Beijing to realise that trying to “change the status quo by resorting to force or coercion, is not the right way forward,” India’s ambassador to China Vikram Misri said in an interview to PTI.Asserting that actions taken by the Chinese forces on the ground have damaged “considerable trust” in the bilateral relationship, the Indian ambassador added that it was entirely the responsibility of the Chinese side to take a careful view of the relations and to decide which direction the ties should move.Noting that maintenance of peace and tranquillity “on the border is sine qua non for progress in the rest of bilateral relationship between India and China”, Misri said: “The resolution of this issue is quite straight forward from our perspective. The Chinese side needs to stop creating obstruction and hindrances in the normal patrolling patterns of the Indian troops,” he said. He also rubbished China’s claim of sovereignty over Galwan Valley in Ladakh as “completely untenable”, and asserted that these kinds of exaggerated claims are not going to help the situation.“Whatever activities we may be carrying on have always been on our side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), so the Chinese need to stop activities to alter the status quo. It is very surprising that they should attempt to do so in a sector which has never before been a sector of concern.” he said.Emphasising that India is “very aware and very clear about the alignment of the LAC in the Galwan Valley,” he said our troops have been patrolling up to these areas without any difficulty for a very, very long period of time.Misri’s strong comments came in response to the recent claims by the Chinese military and the foreign ministry of sovereignty over Galwan Valley.On the Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong’s assertion on Thursday that the onus is on India to deescalate tensions, Misri said, “I think we have been very clear, and very consistent in pointing out that it has been Chinese actions over an extended period of time, that are responsible for the current situation”.“In fact beginning with the time frame of April and May, I would say there were a number of Chinese actions along the LAC in the Ladakh sector in the western sector that interfered with and hindered with the normal patrolling activities of our troops in that sector. This led obviously to a few face-off situations,” he said.During an interview with PTI, Sun refused to reply to questions about China’s transgressions of the LAC. He was asked why China has not been allowing Indian patrols from Finger 4 to Finger 8 areas in Pangong Tso, even though the areas belonged in the Indian side of LAC. He was also asked why China has resorted to massive build up of troops in almost all areas of the 3500 km LAC. But Sun sidestepped the questions and remained mum.  Misri said he “would underline the remarks of our External Affairs Minister (S Jaishankar) when he spoke to Foreign Minister Wang Yi that these developments cannot but have an impact on the bilateral relationship.” “The bilateral relationship is of great value to the two countries. It is important not just for us but also regionally important”, he said.“So I think there should be a realisation on the Chinese side that there is no gain in trying to alter the status quo on the ground especially by resorting to force ... that will not just damage the peace and tranquillity that existed on the border but it can have ripples and repercussions in the broader bilateral relationship,” Misri said.“We have no wish and desire for that. Therefore, it is entirely the responsibility of the Chinese side to take a careful view of our bilateral relations and to decide which direction the bilateral relationship to move forward”, he said.“To my mind there is only one answer, I do very much hope that the Chinese side will also see it in that way”, he added.Noting that in the Galwan Valley especially there has never been any difference as to where the LAC lay, the Indian envoy said :”It is very surprising that they should have chosen to, in the context of these recent developments, to do this kind of thing in a sector which has never before been a sector of concern.”“So for China to now voice these kinds of claims is completely untenable. These kinds of exaggerated claims are not going to help the situation. The kind of language that has been used is not helpful to the resolution of this situation,” he said.                      In the ongoing meetings including at the military level that are going on “we hope that the Chinese side will realise its responsibility in de-escalation and disengagement”, he said.“That would be a true resolution of this issue”, he said.Misri’s comments came a day after the external affairs ministry said China has been amassing a large contingent of troops and armaments along the LAC in eastern Ladakh since early May, and warned that continuation of the current situation would only vitiate the atmosphere for the development of the relationship.

This has intensified in the wake of the ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement in the West.“The L’Oreal Group acknowledges the legitimate concerns about the terms used to describe skin even-ing products, and has therefore decided to remove the words white/whitening, fair/fairness, light/lightning from all its skin even-ing products,” the company said in a statement.L’Oreal is a big player in the personal care category and owns global brands like Garnier, L’Oreal Paris, Maybelline New York and NYX Professional Make Up.The FMCG major, Unilever, had on Thursday said it was withdrawing the word ‘Fair’ from its popular skincare brand ‘Fair & Lovely’.Several companies have been forced to reassess their products and branding following the ‘Black Lives Matter’ protests across the globe.Recently, US-based healthcare and FMCG giant Johnson & Johnson (J&J) stopped the sale of its skin-whitening creams globally, including in India.Kolkata-based FMCG firm Emami, which owns fairness cream brand Fair & Handsome, had said it was evaluating the current situation.“We, as responsible corporate citizens value consumer sentiments and take cognisance of the holistic approach that is required to be taken to address their needs. We are studying all implications currently and evaluating internally to decide our next course of action,” an Emami spokesperson had said.

The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.Prior to the clashes, both sides had been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it was necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

26-06-2020||Kolkata||100% FDI in coal sector contradicts spirit of self-reliance, Mamata writes to PM Modi||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reconsider the Centre’s decision to allow 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the coal sector, saying it contradicts the “very essence of an Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India)”.Expressing reservations about the move, Banerjee in a letter to Modi on Thursday night said it would send “a wrong message...and would also kill the vision of self-reliant policy that we have been following since beginning”.“I express my serious reservation on this policy announcement on cogent grounds. This policy can neither bring foreign direct investments nor can it bring technologies or knowhow which we are unable to access today,” Banerjee wrote in her letter to Modi on Thursday night.“The recent trend and empirical evidences clearly showcase the interest of global investors more in renewable energy projects as compared to the coal mining projects. In fact, research suggests that about 100 global financial institutions have divested their thermal coal investments. Therefore, FDI in thermal coal is a far cry,” she said.At a time when the world’s largest coal mining company, Coal India Limited (CIL), is producing 80 per cent of the country’s coal with a pre-tax profit of Rs 27,000 crore (2018-19) and holding a reserve of Rs 31,000 crore, “the decision...to relax FDI in coal for MNCs will carry a wrong message, it would contradict the very essence of Atmanirbhar Bharat and would also kill the vision of self-reliant policy that we have been following since beginning,” she said.“Further, it is observed that, in many under-developed and developed countries, there has been continuous resistance by the locals against any effort of their possible exploitation. As a result, it would create a great impact on the domestic economy in the long run,” Banerjee said.The chief minister also described the move of the coal ministry to shift the desk offices of four of its subsidiary companies from the state as an “abrupt decision” and requested the prime minister to intervene in the matter.“You are well aware that with 80 per cent coal availability is located in the eastern region of the country. That is why CIL, the major central public sector undertaking, has been functioning with its headquarters located in Kolkata. The recent abrupt decision to shift the desk offices of four of its subsidiary companies to their respective headquarters in other areas will be extremely detrimental to the interests of all stakeholders of coal sector including the employees,” she said.Banerjee requested the prime minister “to kindly reconsider the decision of allowing 100 per cent FDI in coal sector and also strongly urge your kind intervention for advising the ministry of coal not to go ahead with the decision of Coal India Ltd to wind up their subordinate offices from Kolkata”.

This is the first time in the history of the country that the price of diesel is more than petrol price. “The BJP, which made inflation an issue in 2014, is silent today. Farmers are unable to get right price for their produce, while the government is filling its coffers by imposing heavy taxes even under these adverse circumstances. Today about Rs 50 excise duty is being charged on diesel. The government is acting like a public limited company and doing business on oil and electricity,” he said.According to the BKU, it will stage demonstrations in protest against the increase in diesel and electricity prices, “huge challans” on vehicles and other issues.

26-06-2020||New Delhi||SC dismisses anticipatory bail plea of DHFL promoters in Yes Bank money laundering case||The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the anticipatory bail pleas of DHFL promoters Dheeraj Wadhawan and Kapil Wadhawan in a money laundering case of Yes Bank being probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).The Wadhawans, now arrested, have challenged the Bombay High Court’s May 12 order rejecting their plea for pre-arrest bail.A Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and BR Gavai dismissed a batch of four pleas after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Wadhawans, said that he was not pressing his prayer for relief.Rohatgi said that though he is not pressing for anticipatory bail there are some remarks made by the high court in its order which were unwarranted.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the ED said that both the accused have been arrested and hence their plea for anticipatory bail becomes infructous. “After some arguments, senior counsel for the petitioner(s), on instructions does not press for anticipatory bail but he is concerned by some observations made in the impugned order(s) qua the petitioner(s).“Needless to say, that any observations made in the impugned order(s) are for purposes of anticipatory bail and will not prejudice the case of the petitioner(s) in the trial or any other legal proceedings as may be available to them,” the Bench said in its order.The Bench dismissed the pleas of Wadhawans as withdrawn.The high court had refused to grant pre-arrest bail to DHFL promoters, noting that their custodial interrogation was required to unearth the conspiracy and modus operandi in the multi-crore scam.The Wadhawans are in jail after being earlier arrested by the CBI in a separate case related to the Yes Bank scam.They had moved the high court for anticipatory bail in the money laundering case and another case pertaining to alleged irregularities in the investment of employees’ provident fund of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL).The high court had noted in its order that the applicants were not co-operating with the process of law and that the ED had issued several summonses to both Kapil and Dheeraj seeking their presence for questioning in the cases.The court said although the Wadhawans responded to the summonses and notices issued to them by the ED, they evaded investigation by not appearing before the agency.The response to the summonses speaks of apathetic and an indifferent approach. The lackadaisical approach of the applicants can be well noted in their response to the prosecuting agency, the court had said.Wadhawans’ counsel had contended before the high court that no case has been made out for money laundering and the transactions in question were made in normal course of business.They had argued that there was no case for any arrest or arrest warrant at this stage for his clients in the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown in a matter of financial nature which is being investigated for the last six months.The Wadhawans have claimed they have been made “scapegoat of political quandary” in the state. The court, however, refused to accept the excuse of the COVID-19 pandemic and had said this shall not deter the ED from investigating a serious offence of money laundering which has shaken the economy of this country.According to the CBI FIR, the scam started taking shape between April and June 2018 when Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of the scam-hit DHFL.In return, the Wadhawans allegedly “paid kickbacks of Rs 600 crore” to former Yes Bank CEO Rana Kapoor and his family members in the form of loans to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd held by the wife and daughters of Kapoor, the CBI has claimed.

26-06-2020||New Delhi||Abducted Sikh's wife appeals to PM as Afghan gets more risky for minorities||The wife of a Sikh man abducted in Afghanistan has asked for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to have her husband freed and then granting Indian citizenship to her family of six.Attacks on Sikh minorities in Afghanistan have increased ever since India cast its lot with the Kabul regime in the ongoing peace talks with the Taliban.Another threat to the minorities has been the rise of an ISI-affiliated terrorist outfit. Security analysts believed it was behind the Gurdwara Har Rai Sahib massacre in Kabul to announce its presence.The abducted Sikh, Nidan Singh, is an Afghan who had moved to India for some years when the Taliban gained ascendancy in the early 90s and worked odd jobs here. It is still not clear how and by whom Nidan Singh was asked to return and man Gurdwara Tala Sahib in Afghanistan’s Paktia Province near the border with Pakistan. The wider region called “Loya Paktia” has been a Mujahideen and then Taliban\Haqqani Group stronghold since the early 1980s.Nidan Singh lived at the gurdwara where Guru Nanak was reported to have visited with his wife and children and was responsible for its upkeep, sources said.  Nidan Singh was abducted earlier this week.India and other countries are worried over the shrinking of space for Sikh and Hindu minorities ever since US-Taliban talks got into high gear and India excluded itself from establishing contacts with the insurgent group. India has condemned Nidan Singh’s abduction and the government hopes the Afghan government will be able to secure his safe and early release.Soon after the May 15 massacre at the Kabul Gurdwara, former US Vice-President Joe Biden had promised to raise the annual global refugee admissions cap to 1.25 lakhs if he won the November US Presidential elections. Implicit was the assurance that some of the quota would be for Afghanistan’s embattled Sikh community.The USCIRF, which frequently upbraids India for its treatment of minorities, had described the Kabul attack as a “terrible tragedy” for a “wonderful, peaceful religious group” that has been virtually decimated in Afghanistan with just a thousand left.Its chief Senator Sam Brownback was more guarded than Biden on the issue of citizenship but has mentioned the possibility of settling them in Canada, India or Pakistan. “We’ve been inquiring, as others have, of possible places for the remaining Sikhs in Afghanistan to go to be able to be safe. I don’t have anything publicly that I could say,” he had observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abducted-sikhs-wife-appeals-to-pm-as-afghan-gets-more-risky-for-minorities-104868

According to the land laws prevailing in Meghalaya, the state government or any of its agencies, including the Shillong Municipal Board (SMB), do not have any right over this land.Plenty of attempts have been made by the state government from time to time to evict the residents of Harijan Colony which is located close to Shillong’s two prime commercial districts – Police Bazaar and Burra Bazaar. However, all attempts had come undone in the court.According to Gurjit Singh, Dalit Sikhs from Gurdaspur in Punjab were allotted the land by the local Khasi tribal chief back in the middle of the 19th century.Violent tactics to intimidate the residents, including a recent terror threat preceded by a mob attack and even the murder of Lal Singh in 1995 by thugs masquerading as Khasi protesters, had failed to drive away the Sikhs from Harijan Colony.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/evidences-favouring-sikhs-frustrates-meghalaya-governments-eviction-plan-104866

If we conduct 1-2 lakh tests daily in the coming days, it is natural to observe a spike in the number of coronavirus cases,” he said.In LNJP Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital and GTB Hospital, the government is going to set up more ICU beds on a large scale, he said, adding the administration has already set up 3,500 beds for COVID-19 patients in hotels in the last 10 days.The chief minister also said COVID-19 patients under home isolation have been given pulse oximeters and that this will act as a “Suraksha Kawach” against the disease.He said the government has got permission to conduct plasma therapy on 200 patients and LNJP and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital will conduct the trials.Private hospitals have also sought permission to conduct plasma therapy, he said.He also played an audio clip of his conversation with a patient in home isolation.In the clip, the patient told the chief minister he was fine and had no symptoms. The patient said the Delhi Government medical team has been calling him every day to guide him through the home-isolation process.Kejriwal said his Cabinet held a meeting on Friday and a decision to set up 450 additional beds at Burari Hospital was taken, adding that funds were sanctioned for it.He said Delhi has largely reported mild cases over the past week and that’s why out of the total 13,500 beds in hospitals, only 6,000 have occupied.Even though there is no sudden requirement of beds in hospitals, the Delhi Government is working round-the-clock to ensure more beds are added in the foreseeable future, he said.

Thus, such student will be deprived of May 2020, attempt, as compared to other groups of students, who choose the opt-in option,” the plea said while seeking quashing of the announcement made in this regard on June 15.“The said ‘opt-out’ option discriminates between those underprivileged group of CA students/aspirants, who are living in remote areas of the country or living in the containment zones and thus are slated to lose one precious ‘examination attempt’ by choosing ‘opt-out’ option amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to that privileged group of students/aspirants, who are living in big cities/green zones and thus have no problem in appearing in the said examination,” it said.The petition has further sought an increase in the number of examination centres so as to ensure that at least one examination centre is there in every district of India.The petition said around 4.67 lakh aspirants were scheduled to appear in the examinations at about 259 examination centres in India and five centres abroad. It has also said free transportation and accommodation should be provided to the aspirants near their respective examination centres.It has further sought directions to the authorities to conduct mandatory free COVID-19 test of all aspirants and teachers and staffs deployed at the examination centres.

26-06-2020||New Delhi||Mild to medium colour blind people can now obtain driving licence||The central government said on Friday that those with mild to medium colour blindness could now obtain driving licence.The Road Transport and Highways Ministry has issued a notification in this regard for necessary amendments in required forms of motor vehicle norms.“The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has issued a notification for amendment to the Form 1 and Form 1A of the Central Motor Vehicles (CMV) Rules, 1989 for enabling the citizens with mild to medium colour blindness in obtaining the driving licence,” the ministry said in a statement.The MoRTH has been taking many measures to enable ‘divyangjan’ citizens to avail transport-related services and especially relating to the obtaining of the driving licence, it said.The advisories, the statement said, have been issued in this regard to facilitate driving licence to ‘divyangjan’ citizens. Further, an advisory for people with monocular vision has also been issued, it said.“The ministry received representations that the colour blind citizens are not able to have the driving licence made as restrictions through the requirements in the declaration about physical fitness (FORM 1) or the medical certificate (FORM 1A) makes it difficult,” the statement said.“The issue was taken up with medical expert institution and advice was sought. The recommendations received were to allow mild to medium colour blind citizens to be allowed to drive and put restrictions only on the severe colour blind citizens from driving,” the statement said.This is also allowed in other parts of the world.Earlier issuing a draft notification in March, the ministry had sought suggestions and comments from various stakeholders for an amendment in Motor Vehicle Rules for enabling such individuals obtain driving licence.“It was brought to the notice of the ministry that the colour blind citizens were not being able to get the driving licence made although they are able to perform all functions properly except from identifying colours. The matter was sympathetically examined consulting the medical experts,” the ministry had said earlier. It had been reported that the citizens with certain degree of colour blindness can be provided with driving licence and this is being done in many countries of the world, it had said.

The death toll in the entire region is 12, the Union Health Ministry said.The fight against the pandemic across the country had been a concerted and collective endeavour and the Centre has pro-actively and strongly supported the strengthening of the medical care infrastructure in the north-eastern states to fight COVID-19, it said.“A critical pillar which hampered the efforts of the north-eastern states in combating the COVID-19 outbreak was complete lack of testing facilities. But today, because of the focussed attention of the Centre through the Health Ministry, the region has 39 testing labs in the public sector and three in the private sector, totalling to 42 laboratories,” the Ministry said.Assam has 10 public and two private laboratories, while Meghalaya has six public and one private lab.

Government is in no mood for lock down. We want developmental works to happen along with the COVID management, as we don’t know when the pandemic will end,” Revenue Minister R Ashoka, who is also the in-charge of COVID management in the city, said.As of Thursday evening, a total of 1,791 COVID-19 cases, including 78 deaths and 505 discharges, had been reported in the city while the states tally stood at 10,560 compared to just 3,408 cases as on June 1.The Congress has been stressing on the need for a lockdown.Night curfew to continue in West Bengal till July 31In West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced that night curfew will remain in force between 10 pm and 5 am, instead of current 9 pm to 5 am, during the extended coronavirus lockdown till July 31.                       She also said she wants the metro services to resume from July 1, but only with 100 per cent seat occupancy, and no passenger standing.                     “We have decided that (from July 1) the night curfew hours will be from 10 pm to 5 am.

And voters of Bihar will be the first to benefit from the amended rules.In October 2019, the Law Ministry amended the Conduct of Election Rules to allow people with disabilities and those who are 80 years of age or above to opt for postal ballot during Lok Sabha and assembly elections.Now, on June 19, the Ministry notified a fresh change in the rules, allowing those aged 65 years and above to opt for postal ballot.While amending the rules on the suggestions of the Election Commission, the Ministry also allowed “COVID-19 suspect or affected persons” to use the postal ballot facility.The age limit was reduced as “people who are 65 and above are vulnerable” to COVID-19, explained an EC official.The EC had approached the government to tweak the rule as the pandemic could continue until the end of the year.As of now, people who come under the category of those allowed to use postal ballot have to fill form 12D to avail the facility.The election rules are amended after the Law Minister approves changes.

26-06-2020||Jaipur||Notice sent to Jaipur hospital for conducting trials of Patanjali drug on COVID-19 patients||Rajasthan's Health Department has served a notice to NIMS hospital here seeking an explanation on conducting trials of Patanjali Ayurved's drug Coronil on coronavirus patients, an official said on Friday."We served notice to the hospital on Wednesday evening seeking explanation in three days. The hospital did not inform the state government nor sought permission," Chief Medical and Health Officer, Jaipur, Dr Narottam Sharma said.He said the reply from National Institute of Medical Science (NIMS), Jaipur is awaited.The launch of the drug by yoga guru Ramdev on Tuesday triggered a debate after which the Ayush Ministry sought all information on its trial and put a ban on advertising it as a drug to cure coronavirus.The Rajasthan government has clarified that the drug cannot be not used as a medicine in the state without the permission of the Ministry of AYUSH.State Health Minister Raghu Sharma had said on Wednesday that strict action would be taken against the seller as per the rules in case of sale of any drug as a medicine to treat the coronavirus infection.At the Coronil launch, the company had claimed that its medicine can cure the contagious disease within seven days.It said Coronil, taken along with another product developed by it, had shown a 100 per cent success rate in clinical trials on infected patients, except those on life support.Ramdev said the medicines were developed by Patanjali Research Center, Haridwar in association with privately-owned National Institute of Medical Science (NIMS), Jaipur.The Uttarakhand government will serve a notice to Patanjali Ayurved for launching a drug claiming to be a cure for COVID-19 when it had only applied for a licence to manufacture an immunity booster against cough and fever.Apart from the notice from the Uttarakhand government, the Haridwar-based firm could also face litigation in Bihar. A complaint has been filed against it in a Muzaffarpur court over its claim.A complainant approached the court seeking the registration of an FIR against Ramdev and company chairman Acharya Balkrishna, alleging that they put at risk the lives of lakhs of people by claiming to have developed a COVID-19 cure.Chief Judicial Magistrate Mukesh Kumar posted the matter for hearing on June 30.

An appeal against the acquittal filed by Manaf's brother is pending in the Kerala High Court.In all, there were 26 accused, including Shafeek and his brother Sherif who also remained absconding along with two others.After the high court ordered police to issue a look out notice against them, the three surrendered before the court and were arrested.Airport sources said Shafeek was hopeful of sneaking out under the shadow of evacuation as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the immigration officials were alert enough to identify him when he landed on Tuesday night.He was later handed over to the Edavanna police, where the murder case has been registered, they said.Shafeek was produced before a Magistrate court which remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days.After the three surrendered, Shafeek was the only accused who had remained at large, Edavanna Circle Inspector Sibin said.

Will the Prime Minister take the nation into confidence on the matter,” asked Sonia Gandhi.In a video message put out as part of the Congress’ campaign to honour the soldiers who gave the supreme sacrifice in Ladakh, she asked why our soldiers were martyred when China had not captured any Indian territory, as claimed by the Prime Minister.The Congress chief asked if no land had been taken, then why were 20 Indian soldiers killed.“The nation wants to know if China has not transgressed into our land in Ladakh, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed, why were 20 soldiers martyred,” she asked.Assuring support to the government, Sonia Gandhi asked the PM: “When and how will the government retrieve Indian territory?”In a video posted few minutes after Sonia’s, Rahul Gandhi also questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pointed out to the satellite images and expert comments and said: “The Chinese have taken our land not at one point but at three points. The PM will have to speak the truth without fear and anxiety. If he says the land has not been taken and it has actually been taken China will stand to gain. We have to collectively fight China and push them out. So, speak the truth. Don’t be scared. Speak the truth that yes China has taken our land and we are going to act against them.”Rahul again asked who had sent the 20 martyred soldiers to the border without arms and why.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-china-hasnt-occupied-territory-why-were-our-20-soldiers-martyred-asks-sonia-104831

26-06-2020||---||PM Modi praises UP for turning 'disaster' into 'opportunity'||Lucknow, June 26Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday praised the Yogi Aditynath-led BJP government in Uttar Pradesh for turning an “aapda” (disaster) into an “avasar” (opportunity).In his 34-minute address to the nation after remotely inaugurating UP government’s ambitious Pradhan Mantri Gharib Kalyan Rozgaar Abhiyaan, Modi said that the campaign would go a long was to strengthen the central government’s vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.“When the rest of the country was grappling with the problems thrown up by the pandemic, the Uttar Pradesh government has managed to keep deaths to a little more than 600, arranged the return of more than 35 lakh out-of-work workers, successfully completed the skill mapping of 30.47 lakh workers who returned home and is now launching the Pradhan Mantri Gharib Kalyan Rozgaar Abhiyaan,” said Modi.Presenting Uttar Pradesh as an example of what courage and hard work could achieve, PM Modi said that UP’s population at 24 crore was equal to the combined  population of four developed European countries, namely United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy.“Despite their  better resources and medical infrastructure, these four European countries have collectively lost more than one lakh lives to the pandemic, while UP with much less resources has lost only 600 lives till date,” said PM Modi.Until now, UP has lost 634 lives to the pandemic.Earlier, PM Modi virtually interacted with six entrepreneurs who have benefitted from various employment schemes of the state and central governments and have managed to employ returning workers in their businesses.Siddharnagar’s Qurban Ali, a mason in Mumbai, told the PM that he had returned home along with his brother in May and has now managed to find work helping in the construction of state government’s community toilet project in his village.Similarly, Nagendra, who had returned to Gorakhpur from Ahmedabad, to the PM that he had managed Rs 1 lakh loan, bought a buffalo to start a dairy project. He said that at Rs 365 per day he was earning more than what he earned in Ahmedabad as a laborer in a stainless steel utensil factory.Under the Pradhan Mantri Gharib Kalyan Rozgaar Abhiyaan, the UP government proposes to combine all employment schemes to provide employment to 1.25 crore people.While over 35 lakh workers have returned to UP, there are 31 districts where over 35,000 workers from Mumbai, Delhi and other big cities have returned which is where the new employment programme is focused.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-praises-up-for-turning-disaster-into-opportunity-104819

The actual reason being the natural blockage of informal irrigation channels into Indian fields! Bhutan has been actually helping to clear the blockage,” Krishna said.According to the statement issued on Facebook by Bhutan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Assam's Baksa and Udalguri districts have been benefitting from the water sources in Bhutan for many decades and “they continue to do so even during the present difficult times when we are faced with the COVID-19 pandemic”.The people of Bhutan, especially those living along the borders of India, “deeply value their age-old ties of friendship and cooperation with the people of India, particularly their close neighbors across the borders in Assam and West Bengal”, it said, adding that such ties of friendship, cooperation and support must continue and be reinforced during these difficult times.Since the lockdown in India and the closure of Bhutan's borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Assamese farmers are unable to enter Bhutan to maintain the irrigation channels as was done in the past, it said.However, understanding the difficulty that would be faced by the farmers in Assam, the Samdrup Jongkhar district officials and the general public have taken the initiative to repair the irrigation channels whenever there are problems to ensure the smooth flow of water to Assam, it said.“The heavy monsoon rains and sudden rise in the water levels is posing serious challenges, but the Bhutanese authorities, including with heavy machinery, are on standby to clear any blockage and channel the water whenever there is a problem,” the statement said.Giving an assurance to the people of Assam, the ministry said that the Royal Government of Bhutan, particularly the Samdrup Jongkhar district authorities, will make every effort to ensure that the disruptions caused by the monsoon rains to the irrigation channels are addressed without delay and there is water available for the farmers in Assam.“Bhutan would like to request for the understanding of the farmers in Assam as sometimes there could be few delays in the flow of water due to disruptions caused by the heavy monsoon rains and the operational difficulties arising from the restrictions put in place by both the countries due to COVID-19,” it said.The Samdrup Jongkhar authorities maintain close contact with their counterparts in Baksa and Udalguri, the ministry added.

26-06-2020||Vibha Sharma||Monsoon covers entire country, 12 days ahead of normal schedule||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 26The Southwest Monsoon on Friday further advanced into the remaining parts of Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab, thus covering the entire country, around 12 days in advance, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The normal date for the event, according to the IMD, is July 8.Boosted by favourable conditions along with two low-pressure systems — one over southeast Arabian Sea that later turned into 'severe cyclone' Nisarga and another over Bay of Bengal — the monsoon progressed almost in “copybook style” this year.It kept its date with a normal onset over Kerala on June 1. The arrival over Gujarat was well ahead of time. Usually it reaches parts of Kutch around June 25 but this time it was almost 10 day early.Likewise, in the central and eastern parts of the country, either it is on time or slightly ahead by a day or two.Its arrival over the northwest, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, was also well ahead of the normal date.IMD Director General Mrityunjaya Mohapatra said the last time the monsoon advanced so early was in 2013 when it covered the entire country by June 16."The formation of a low pressure area over Bay of Bengal which moved west-northwestwards and another cyclonic circulation over central India basically helped in advance of monsoon," Mohapatra said.The rain so far has been quite good and well distributed with 31 out of 36 meteorological subdivisions getting normal to large excess rainfall during June, he said."Certainly, it is beneficial for sowing. June is the main sowing season for major parts of the country except some parts of Rajasthan, especially west Rajasthan," the IMD DG added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-covers-entire-country-12-days-ahead-of-normal-schedule-104813

26-06-2020||Washington||India making significant efforts towards eliminating human trafficking: US report||India made significant efforts towards the elimination of human trafficking in 2019 but did not fully meet the minimum standards, according to a US report.As such India remained on Tier 2 of the Congressional-mandated 2020 'Trafficking in Persons' report of the state department.Pakistan has been downgraded to the Tier 2 watch list because the government did not make overall increasing efforts, the report said.China, on the other hand, has remained on the lowest Tier 3 as it made no significant efforts to eliminate trafficking, according to the report released by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the presence of US President Donald Trump's daughter and top White House advisor Ivanka Trump.“The Communist Party of China (CPC) and its state-owned enterprises often force citizens to work in horrendous conditions on Belt and Road projects,” Pompeo told reporters while releasing the report on Thursday.Also read: Children as young as 14 are recruited by armed groups against govt in J-K: US report“India does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated overall increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore India remained on Tier 2,” the report said.These efforts included convicting traffickers and completing a high-profile investigation into a case that involved officials complicit in trafficking at a government-funded shelter home in Bihar, convicting 19 individuals in the case, including three state officials; an influential former legislator was among the 12 that received life sentences, it said.According to the report, the government also filed First Information Reports (FIRs) against other government-funded shelter homes in Bihar that allegedly abused residents, including trafficking victims. For the first time, the Madras High Court reversed an acquittal in a bonded labour case.The central government added investigation of inter-state and transnational trafficking cases to the mandate of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which began investigating inter-state trafficking. The government continued to work on its draft anti-trafficking bill and committed to devoting funding to expand its police anti-human trafficking units (AHTUs) to all 732 districts, it said.However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. The government did not make serious or sustained efforts to address its consistently large trafficking problem. Overall anti-trafficking efforts, especially against bonded labour, remained inadequate, the report said.India in the past has rejected the US State Department's annual report on trafficking in persons, which put India on a watch-list, terming it a “judgmental and prescriptive approach by a foreign government.” Observing that traffickers exploit millions of people in flesh trade in India, the report said that traffickers target Indian women and girls but also fraudulently recruit significant numbers of Nepali and Bangladeshi women and girls to India for sex trafficking.India, it said, is a source for child sex tourists and a destination for child sex tourism. Traffickers kidnap and force Indian and Nepali women and girls to work as “orchestra dancers” in India, especially in Bihar, where girls perform with dance groups until they have repaid fabricated debts. Traffickers exploit women and children in sex trafficking in religious pilgrimage centres and in tourist destinations, it said.According to the report, traffickers force many Indian migrants who willingly seek employment abroad into construction, domestic work, factories, and other low-skilled sectors in many regions, especially Gulf countries and Malaysia, often following recruitment fraud and exorbitant recruitment fees.“Indian female domestic workers in all Gulf countries, particularly Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, consistently report strong indicators of forced labour, including non-payment of wages, refusal to allow workers to leave upon completion of their contracts, and physical abuse,” it said.In the United Arab Emirates, labour traffickers bring Indian workers overseas on tourist visas, withhold their identity documents and wages, and force them to work, especially in construction. Authorities have recently identified Indian forced labour victims in Armenia, Portugal, Gabon, and Zambia, and Indian female sex trafficking victims in Kenya, it said.“Traffickers exploit Rohingya, Sri Lankan Tamil, and other refugee populations in sex and labour trafficking. Traffickers subject some boys from Assam, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh states to forced labour in Nepal,” the report added.

26-06-2020||Kolkata||During treatment at Kolkata hospital, woman finds out she is a man||For thirty years she led a normal life with no complications, until recently, when doctors, while treating her for abdominal pain, discovered that she was a ‘man’ suffering from testicular cancer.Surprisingly, her 28-year-old sister, who underwent necessary tests following the revelation, was also diagnosed with ‘Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome’—a condition in which a person is born genetically male, but has all physical traits of a woman.The 30-year-old Birbhum resident, married for the last nine years, had visited city-based Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Cancer Hospital with severe pain in lower abdomen a couple of months ago, following which clinical oncologist Dr Anupam Dutta and surgical oncologist Dr Soumen Das conducted her medical tests, and found out her “true identity”.“From her appearance, she is a woman. Starting from her voice, developed breasts, normal external genitalia, everything is that of a woman. However, uterus and ovaries have been absent since birth. She has also never experienced menstruation,” Dr Dutta told PTI.It’s a very rare condition, and can be found one in every 22,000 people, he said.After test reports suggested that the person has a “blind vagina”, doctors decided to conduct Karyotyping test, which revealed that her chromosome complement was ‘XY’ and not ‘XX’, as found in a woman.“We conducted clinical examinations, after she complained of abdominal pain, and found out she has testicles inside her body. A biopsy was conducted, following which she was diagnosed with testicular cancer, also called seminoma, Dr Dutta explained.Currently, she is undergoing chemotheraphy and her health condition is stable.“As her testicles remained undeveloped inside the body, there was no secretion of testosterone. Her female hormones, on the other hand, gave her the appearance of a woman,” Dr Dutta stated.Asked about her reaction to the revelation, he said, “The person has grown up to be a woman. She is married to man for almost a decade. Currently, we are counselling the patient and her husband, advising them to continue living life as they have been.”It was learnt, that the couple had tried for babies a number of times but failed.The patient’s two maternal aunts were also diagnosed with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome in the past, the oncologist said.“It’s probably in the genes. We have come to know that two of her aunts from the maternal side were also suffering from similar condition,” he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/during-treatment-at-kolkata-hospital-woman-finds-out-she-is-a-man-104802
26-06-2020||Satya Prakash||CBSE, ICSE results to be declared by July 15||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 26The Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE) and the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) on Friday told the Supreme Court that they would declare the results of Class 10 and 12 board examinations by July 15.This was aimed at enabling candidates so that they can apply and seek admissions in the Higher Education Institutions in India and abroad, the CBSE told the court.A Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar approved a CBSE scheme under which remaining examinations for Class 10 and Class 12, scheduled from July 1, stand cancelled.Under the assessment scheme approved by the Apex Court, for the students of both classes, who have completed all examinations, their results will be declared based on their performance in the examinations they have already appeared.Also read: CBSE Board Class 10th, 12th result: Here are the options before studentsFor students who have appeared in the examinations in more than three subjects, the average of the marks obtained in the best three performing subjects will be awarded in the subjects whose examinations have not been conducted.However, for students who have appeared in the examinations in only three subjects, the average of the marks obtained in the best two performing subjects will be awarded in the subjects whose examinations have not been conducted.The CBSE said: “There are very few students of Class 12, mainly from Delhi, who have appeared in the examinations in only one or two subjects. Their results will be declared based on the performance in the appeared subjects and performance in the internal/practical project assessment.These students will also be allowed to appear in the optional examinations conducted by the CBSE to improve their performance if they desire to do so. The result of these students will also be declared along with other students,” the CBSE said.Asking the CBSE to issue forthwith a notification in this regard, the top court disposed of all the petitions pending before it and high courts on the issue.The ICSE counsel told the Bench that it has agreed with the scheme framed by the CBSE in this regard. However, the ICSE will give the option to both Class 10 and 12 students to take examinations at a later stage when COVID-19 situation improves.The ICSE clarified that it would follow a slightly different assessment scheme than that of the CBSE for awarding marks to students, which would be released within a week.The ICSE said it might conduct optional exams even for Class 10 students as its marking criteria was slightly different from that of the CBSE.The top court said the CBSE might even decide in future not to hold the optional exams for Class 12.In terms of this order, all proceedings/petitions pertaining to the subject matter of conducting examinations for Class 10 and Class by the ICSE for the academic year 2019-20, pending in this court or any other court, shall be governed by this order and deemed to be disposed of accordingly.It turned down a suggestion to fix a deadline for students to decide whether or not to sit for the optional examinations.The order came on petitions filed by Col Amit Bathla, Poonam Singla, Charu Singh and Sunitha — whose children happen to be Class 12 students — seeking the scrapping of examinations for remaining papers in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.They had demanded that results should be declared “on the basis of examination already conducted and to calculate it on an average basis with the internal assessment marks of the remaining subject”.Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta said there should not be any deadline for students to decide since the decision is pro-students.“If exams are conducted at any time in future, let the students take a call at that point in time,” he said.Petitioners’ counsel Rishi Malhotra said the CBSE should give a timeline by when students can opt for examinations.“It is also possible that the CBSE may decide the situation is not conducive to hold exam at all,” the Bench noted.The CBSE had on Thursday told the court that it had decided to cancel the remaining Class 10 and Class 12 examinations scheduled to be conducted between July 1 and July 15 due to COVID-19 pandemic. The ICSE had decided to follow suit.However, the top had sought further clarifications from the CBSE on the option of examination for Class 12, date of publication of results, state board examinations and new academic year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-icse-results-to-be-declared-by-july-15-104796

And this duty is to put out the truth before them and not to put forth government propaganda. The UP government is wasting its time by threatening me through its various departments," Priyanka said in a tweet in Hindi on Friday.     "They can take whatever action they want, I will keep putting forth the truth. I am Indira Gandhi's granddaughter, not an undeclared BJP spokesperson like some of the opposition leaders," she said.Her remarks also come days after the Agra administration asked her to withdraw the claim of high coronavirus deaths in the district.The Congress general secretary in-charge UP East has accused the Yogi Adityanath government of indulging in propaganda instead of dealing with the pandemic.This week, Priyanka repeatedly targeted the Uttar Pradesh government over the "high" Covid-19 mortality rate in Agra and on other issues related to the state government's handling of the pandemic.

26-06-2020||Washington||Biden seeks restoration of people's rights in Kashmir; disappointed with NRC, CAA||Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden wants India to take necessary steps to restore rights of all Kashmiris, and has expressed disappointment over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the implementation of the NRC in Assam.“These measures are inconsistent with the country’s long tradition of secularism and with sustaining a multi-ethnic and multi-religious democracy,” according to the policy paper—‘Joe Biden’s agenda for Muslim American community’ posted recently on his campaign website.A group of Hindu Americans have reached out to the Biden campaign expressing their resentment to the language used against India and have urged them to reconsider their views. The group has also sought a similar policy paper on Hindu Americans.The Biden campaign did not respond to questions in this regard.Observing that Biden understands the pain Muslim-Americans feel towards what is happening in Muslim-majority countries and countries with significant Muslim populations, the policy paper clubbed together Kashmir and Assam in India with the forced detention of over a million Uyghur Muslims in western China, and discrimination and atrocities against Burma’s Rohingya Muslim minority.“In Kashmir, the Indian government should take all necessary steps to restore rights of all the people of Kashmir. Restrictions on dissent, such as preventing peaceful protests or shutting or slowing down the Internet, weakens democracy,” said the policy paper on Muslim Americans.“Joe Biden has been disappointed by the measures that the government of India has taken with the implementation and aftermath of the National Register of Citizens in Assam and the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act into law,” it said.Biden as United States Senator for decades and as vice president under President Barack Obama for eight years has been known as one of the best friends of India and Indian-Americans, it said. He played a key role in the passage of the India-US civilian nuclear deal, and as vice president, he advocated increasing the bilateral trade to USD500 billion per annum. Well connected with the Indian Americans, Biden regularly hosted Diwali at his vice-presidential residence, it said.“Biden understands the issues impacting India, issues  of cross border terrorism, influx of terrorism across borders in Kashmir, issue of Hindu minorities sufferings in Kashmir, issues in Indo Pacific region with China, and the rising  role of India as stronger US ally in all areas including economic growth, counter-terrorism, fight for human rights, climate change  and global security,” Biden supporter Ajay Jain Bhutoria told PTI.“There are groups within various elected officials groups in US pushing language and agenda’s highlighting misinformation and damaging facts on how India handled its own internal matter on Kashmir, Ladakh or immigration reforms related to NRC,” rued Bhutoria, who is also on the National Finance Committee for Biden. Bhutoria said US recently updated its immigration policy to block the H-1B and other visas for rest of the year to safeguard its own workers, which is completely questionable and will hurt the economy.India too has a right to define its own Immigration policy to support its population and economy, he said.“I grew up in Assam, Guwahati and I have seen the influx of people across the border and taking away important jobs, resources from local people in northeastern states,” he said.“The immigration reforms and NRC are welcome steps. Execution of these reforms and strategies need to be improved and India needs to do better in change management and rolling out of reforms,” Bhutoria said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biden-seeks-restoration-of-peoples-rights-in-kashmir-disappointed-with-nrc-caa-104770

Armed with “documentary proof”, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation received huge donations from China, which he said was the reason for sustained attack against the Prime Minister by senior leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi on issues related to the LAC faceoff.“They (Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi) are attacking the Modi government and supporting China because of these donations to the RGF,” Prasad said, also suggesting it to be the reason for the Congress push for comprehensive free trade agreement that led to “33 times increase” in trade deficit in favour of Beijing at the cost of India.Meanwhile, leading the BJP’s attack against the Congress, PM Modi paid homage to those who participated in the “struggle to protect democracy while withstanding all torture” during the Emergency. On this day, one family’s greed for power led to the imposition of Emergency. Overnight, the nation turned into a prison. The press, courts, free speech....all were trampled over,” Shah said.‘Secularism vital’"Secularism is a prerequisite to democracy, and vice-versa.

It’s time to set the record straight and expose the BJP’s hypocrisy. Former minister Anand Sharma asked the BJP to halt the disinformation campaign against Rahul Gandhi and asked, “Has Ram Madhav not travelled to China many times to meet CPC leadership? Did BJP president Amit Shah not receive Minister Wang Jiarui in February 2015 along with BJP general secretaries Ram Madhav, Ram Lal, Bhupendra Yadav and foreign department head? Did not Bhagat Singh Koshiyari, present Maharashtra Governor, lead a 13-member BJP parliamentary delegation to China in 2014 which met Minister Wang Jiarui and attended Chinese Communist party school in Beijing?”Sharma said Congress-led India’s freedom movement and questioning its patriotism is outrageous. “It’s time to set the record straight and expose the BJP’s hypocrisy and double standards,” he said.While former minister Ashwani Kumar said, “the ruling party was not voted to power to invent quid pro quos for questioning the nationalist credentials of their opponents.”Congress media head Randeep Surjewala asked the BJP to stop living in 2005 and answer the “reality of Chinese incursions on the LAC”.Meanwhile, The Congress cited media reports and defence expert views about reported Chinese buildup along the LAC and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi whether he misled the country.

But Hockey India wasn’t banned despite being served a notice for the same breach after M Mushtaque Ahmed’s election as president in 2018.Rahul Mehra, lawyer and sports clean-up activist, pointed this out in the High Court hearing after which the Sports Ministry was forced to derecognise several NSFs.“Take the case of the rowing federation, which was derecognised because it allowed three votes per affiliated units. But the fencing association has the same irregularity in its constitution and yet it has been recognised,” Mehra told The Tribune. “They (Sports Ministry) look at political affiliations, clout and apply different yardsticks.

It can also be part of interplanetary missions of ISRO. This is being planned to be done through announcement of opportunities,” Sivan said in an online briefing.He, however, added that ISRO’s activities are not going to reduce and it will continue to carry out space-based activities, including advanced research and development, inter-planetary and human space flight missions.The Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (In-Space) has been created under the Department of Space as a separate vertical for taking independent decisions with respect to permitting and regulating space activities of the private sector.He said the move will not only enable accelerated growth of the space sector, but will also help the Indian industry play a major role in the global space economy. “This is going to be a major system and reform in the Department of Space. In-Space will have its own directorates for technical, legal safety and security, activity promotion as well as for monitoring purposes so that they can take an independent decision,” Sivan said. The In-Space board will also have members of the industry, academia and the government.It will take six months for the system to take shape, butcompanies can submit applications to the Department of Space in the interim time. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isro-chief-pvt-sector-can-now-build-rockets-provide-launch-services-104634

The Centre sent more teams to Maharashtra, Gujarat and Telangana to help with containment efforts.Noting that SARS-CoV2 virus that caused Covid would normally run its course until the population reached herd immunity at which point 65 per cent people would be infected, Paul, Member-Health, Niti Aayog, said, “But we will not let the virus affect that many of us and that is the whole name of the game.” He was speaking at the virtual launch of a behavioural change campaign in the wake of Covid.The move came as deaths rose to 14,894 with 418 fatalities in 24 hours.

The area has seen two major standoffs in 2013 and 2014 besides dozens of faceoffs annually when troops come face-to-face while patrolling.The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China is gathered in big numbers at a place called “Bottleneck” which is 25 km southeast of the strategic airfield in Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO), located at 16,700 feet. The DBO is just 20 km south of the 18,176-ft-high Karakoram pass, which divides Ladakh and Xinjiang in China.The Indian Army has, in the past, war-gamed a scenario about the PLA making a westward thrust in Depsang plains. The defensive positions have been “militarily tailored” to hold back the PLA with tanks, artillery guns and the latest systems besides additional troops.On the Indian side, the PLA’s military objectives could be to threaten a section of the 255 km Darbuk-Shayok-DBO (DSDBO) road, attempt to cut off the DBO sector, which could restrict access to the Karakoram pass and a bid to seize the 20,000-ft-high Saser La, which is to the west of Depsang. It further opens a route to Sasoma and crucially the road to Siachen. All these attempts by the PLA can be thwarted for now, explained an official.The DSDBO road is a key stretch for this strategic northern-most corner of India – termed sub-sector north (SSN) by the military. The road runs through a treacherous terrain where oxygen is rare. The small village of Shayok, comprising just 25 families, is the last Indian village on this route.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/holding-back-pla-at-depsang-crucial-104609
26-06-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||For headway, reduce troop buildup: MEA||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 25India on Thursday said the “heart of the matter” behind the frequent incidents and faceoffs along the LAC was the massive armament and troop buildup by China in the area since May this year. This has been accompanied by Chinese forces behaving in complete disregard for all mutually agreed norms. Anurag Srivastava, MEA SpokespersonStick to 1993 pactThis buildup by both sides must be reduced in accordance with a 1993 treaty to keep forces in the areas along the LAC to a minimum level compatible with good neighbourly relations.Calling upon China to sincerely follow up on the understanding reached between the two Foreign Ministers to ensure speedy restoration of peace in border areas, India cautioned that a continuation of the current situation would only vitiate the atmosphere for the development of bilateral ties.Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the deployment of a large body of troops and changes in their behaviour had also been aggravated by unjustified and untenable claims. The recent shift in the Chinese position on the Galwan valley is one example, he said.Srivastava said the Chinese buildup had forced India to undertake counter deployments and the resulting tension had “thereafter expressed itself”. This buildup by both sides, he said, needed to be reduced in accordance with a 1993 treaty to keep military forces in the areas along the LAC to a minimum level compatible with friendly and good neighbourly relations between the two countries. In terms of cooling tensions, the MEA felt the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs after a gap of nearly a year was a “significant development’’.The MEA said neither the change in Chinese behaviour in recent years, which departed from a mutual understanding of set patterns of patrolling that avoided each other, nor the massive buildup on the border was in accordance with the provisions of several bilateral pacts, especially the key 1993 Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the LAC.It all began in early May, when Chinese troops hindered India’s normal, traditional patrolling pattern in the Galwan valley area. Though the ground commanders addressed this issue, the Chinese side sought to change the status quo in other areas of the Western Sector.Ready to fix row: Chinese envoyNew Delhi: Striking a conciliatory note, China on Thursday said it was ready to work with India to deal with the border standoff. Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidon said India and China were willing to properly manage their differences, and called upon New Delhi to avoid taking actions that might “complicate” the situation in Ladakh. PTITook up Chinese aggression: USWashington: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he had a very frank discussion with his Chinese counterpart Wang Jiechi about the “unprovoked aggression” by Beijing on a number of fronts. During the meeting in Hawaii, Pompeo said he also pressed for “more transparency” on the outbreak of virus.
