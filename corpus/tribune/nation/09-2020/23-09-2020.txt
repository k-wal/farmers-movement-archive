23-09-2020||New Delhi||Centre translated draft EIA 2020 in all 22 languages after HC deadline||The Centre translated the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) in all the 22 languages in the Eight Schedule of the Constitution but much after the deadline set by the Delhi High Court.An environmental conservationist on whose PIL a direction for translating the notification was issued told the high court that the draft EIA in all 22 languages were translated quite late.He informed that the translated draft EIA was published on the websites of Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, West Bengal Pollution Control Board, and Goa Pollution Control Board on August 19 after expiry of the August 11 deadline for receiving comments.A Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan on June 30 had directed the Environment Ministry to translate the draft EIA notification in all the 22 languages in the Eight Schedule of the Constitution within 10 days of the order and had also extended till August 11 the time for receiving remarks from the public.The order had come on the PIL by environmental conservationist Vikrant Tongad seeking publication of the notification in all vernacular languages and also extension of the time to receive public comments on it.The June 30 order was challenged by the ministry in the Supreme Court which allowed the government to withdraw its appeal and instead file a review before the high court.The apex court also put on hold the proceedings in the contempt plea filed by Tongad for non-compliance of the June 30 direction.Subsequently, the ministry filed a plea seeking review of the June 30 order on the ground that official documents are required to be published only in Hindi and English.It had also contended that the law does not require notifications to be published in local languages.Seeking dismissal of the review plea, Tongad in his reply has alleged that the ministry has “failed” to mention that the translations have been completed.Tongad also said in his reply that the ministry in its office memorandum of July 4 to all the states and union territories requested all of them to translate the draft EIA, but also said that the translations be not uploaded on their respective websites till they receive specific directions to do so from the central government.“This additional requirement of specific directions from the ministry is contrary to the express directions of this court to publish the translations on the website of the Ministry of Environment as well as on the websites of environment ministries of all the states and those of State Pollution Control Boards,” the reply, filed through advocates Srishti Agnihotri and Abishek Jebaraj, said.On publishing of the draft EIA on the websites of Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, West Bengal Pollution Control Board, and Goa Pollution Control Board on August 19 after expiry of the August 11 deadline for receiving comments, the reply said “Such uploading has become a mere formality since the deadline for receiving public comments has not been extended beyond August 11, 2020.“Thus, to ensure effective public consultation, the deadline for comments must be further extended,” it has further said.The court on Wednesday listed the matter for hearing on October 23 after the ministry sought time to respond to the reply filed by Tongad.The ministry, in its review plea, has claimed that the court was “misled” by the petitioner into passing the June 30 judgement.“The present petition is being preferred only to the extent that this court has directed the respondent/applicant (ministry) to make all arrangements for the translation of the draft EIA notification 2020 into various languages and at least the languages mentioned in the Eight Schedule to the Constitution,” the ministry has said in its petition.It has contended that notifications or draft notifications and other official documents are required to be issued only in Hindi and English and there is no mandate in law to issue them in any other vernacular or local languages.“Issuance of notifications in multiple languages would in any case result in translation and interpretation issues resulting in the meaning of the words being obfuscated and often even lost,” it has said.It has contended that the June 30 decision of the high court “suffers from error apparent on the face of the record”, as it did not consider that neither the Official Languages Act of 1963 nor the Environment Protection Rules require that the draft notifications have to be issued in any other languages other than English and Hindi.It has also claimed that till August 14, the ministry had received 19.8 lakh responses to the draft EIA from across the country and several of the comments were also in vernacular languages “which suggests that the objective with regard to wide publicity of draft EIA notification 2020 has been achieved by and large”.The draft EIA 2020, according to Tongad’s plea, provides for post facto approval of projects and does away with public consultation in some cases.The petition by Tongad had claimed that the draft EIA 2020 completely supersedes and replaces the existing environmental norms.“This draft notification proposes significant changes to the existing regime, including removing public consultation entirely in certain instances, reducing the time for public consultation from 45 days to 40 days, and allowing post facto approvals for projects,” it had said.

23-09-2020||Guwahati||Assam to cull 12,000 pigs as African swine fever spreads||Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Wednesday ordered to cull nearly 12,000 pigs in the areas affected by the deadly African swine fever and asked officials to compensate the owners adequately.So far, 18,000 pigs have died after contracting the virus across 14 districts of the state, a senior official of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department told PTI.“Chairing a meeting with department officials, the chief minister said that in compliance with the guidelines of the Centre and the state government, and adhering to experts’ opinion, culling of the infected swine population in all the affected districts should be completed before Durga Puja,” according to an official statement.The total number of pigs to be killed in this exercise will be around 12,000, it added.“As a result of the culling operation, the loss incurred by the farmers will be adequately compensated,” Sonowal said.The latest culling drive will be carried out within one kilometre radius of 30 epicentres across the 14 affected districts, the senior official said.“We will start the exercise immediately,” he added.When asked about the compensation, the official said the owners of the 12,000 pigs will get the money deposited in their bank accounts, while a proposal has been sent to the government for giving financial support to the owners of the 18,000 pigs that have died already.During the meeting, Sonowal informed that the Centre has already released the first instalment of the fund and the state government will immediately deposit its share for the compensation as well as for other measures to deal with the pestilence.He also asked the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department to sensitise the affected areas to avert transfer of infection to healthy animals and directed to conduct a survey on all the government farms across the state.The meeting also discussed the supply of pigs to Assam from different parts of the country.In the aftermath of the ASF outbreak, the supply of pigs from outside the state was put on hold as per the directions of the central government.Sonowal asked the senior officers of the department to ensure that no encumbrances creep in while transporting pigs to other states of the Northeast through Assam.To involve more youths in the piggery sector, the government farms may be operated and managed on public- private-partnership mode to encourage entrepreneurship, he added.According to a 2019 census by the department, the pig population in the state was 21 lakh, which has increased in recent times to around 30 lakh, Agriculture Minister Atul Bora had said.Bora had stated the disease was first detected in the state in February-end this year, but it started in April 2019 at a village in Xizang province in China, bordering Arunachal Pradesh.The African swine fever is a pig ailment, which was first reported in 1921 in Kenya and Ethiopia, and an outbreak is very rare in this part of the country.While swine flu can spread from animals to humans, swine fever does not, and therefore is not a public health threat.

23-09-2020||New Delhi||SC recues traders facing 200 per cent customs duty on imports from Pakistan post-Pulwama attack||The Supreme Court came on Wednesday to the rescue of certain traders who were asked to pay “enhanced custom duty of 200 per cent” on imported goods from Pakistan due to sudden increase in the tariff by the Centre following the 2019 Pulwama terror attack and ordered that they will have to pay the duty under the older tariff.The top court dismissed the appeal of the Centre against a Punjab and Haryana High Court judgement holding that it cannot levy enhanced custom duty from importers who had already presented “bills of entry for home consumption before the enhanced rate was notified’ in e-Gazette.As many as 40 Central Reserves Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed on February 14, 2019, in an audacious terror strike at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir. A Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist had rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a bus carrying the security personnel.Two days after the terror strike, the central government on February 16, last year had issued a notification under Section 8A of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 and introduced “a tariff entry by which all goods originating in or exported from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan were subjected to an enhanced customs duty of 200 per cent”.The notification allegedly led to huge financial burden to some exporters, who had already exported goods under the old custom rates, and had to get their imported goods re-assessed for the purposes of levy of custom duty at enhanced rate.     The consignments of import covered a diverse range of goods, ranging from dry dates to cement.The government’s notification was uploaded on the e-Gazette at around 8.46 PM on February 16, 2019 and the customs authorities at the land customs station at Attari in Punjab sought to enforce the enhanced rate of duty on importers who had already presented bills of entry for home consumption before the enhanced rate was notified in the e-Gazette and this led to filing of cases by traders in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the apex court noted in its judgement.The High Court, on August 26, 2019, had allowed the pleas of traders and had held “that since the importers, who had imported goods from Pakistan, had presented their bills of entry and completed the process of ‘self-assessment’ before the notification enhancing the rate of duty to 200 per cent was issued and uploaded, the enhanced rate of duty was not attracted.The High Court had also held that the importers were liable to pay the duty applicable at the time when the bills of entry for home consumption were filed under Section 46 of the Customs Act and had ordered the Centre “to release the goods within seven days on the payment of duty ‘as declared and assessed’ without applying the notification enhancing the rate of duty on goods originating in Pakistan.”           The Centre came in appeal against the High Court’s order which was dismissed by a bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and K M Joseph in two separate and concurring verdicts.Justice Chandrachud, writing the judgement for himself and Justice Malhotra, referred to various provisions of the Constitution and the Customs Tariff Act and held that the importers who had already got their imported goods self-assessed for the levy of customs duty cannot be asked to pay the higher duty.“The rate of duty was determined by the presentation of the bills of entry for home consumption in the electronic form under Section 46. Self-assessment was on the basis of rate of duty which was in force on the date and at the time of presentation of the bills of entry for home consumption. This could not have been altered in the purported exercise of the power of reassessment under Section 17 or at the time of the clearance of the goods for home consumption under Section 47.“The rate of duty which was applicable was crystallized at the time and on the date of the presentation of the bills of entry in terms of the provisions of Section 15,” Justice Chandrachud, who wrote 82-page judgement, said.Justice Joseph wrote a separate and concurring 94-page judgement in the case and dismissed the appeals against the High Court’s order. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-recues-traders-facing-200-per-cent-customs-duty-on-imports-from-pakistan-post-pulwama-attack-145510

Now the metro will function normally, the official of Jaipur metro rail corporation said.

While candidates are required to carry masks and sanitiser, use of gloves is optional,” CICSE Chief Executive and Secretary Gerry Arathoon said.The board announced results for class 10 and 12 exams in July but decided against bringing out a merit list this year because of “exceptional circumstances”.While the board recorded a pass percentage of 99.34 per cent for class 10 exams, up by 0.8 per cent from last year, the pass percentage for the class 12 exams stood at 96.84 per cent, recording a marginal increase.The board had to cancel its pending exams given the spike in COVID-19 cases and the result was calculated based on an alternate assessment scheme decided by it.Under the scheme, candidates were assessed based on the best three percentage marks obtained in subjects for which board exams were conducted. The marks of their internal assessment as well as project work were taken into account.The exams, which were earlier postponed due to the lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus, were scheduled to be conducted from July 1 to 14.The CICSE had later announced that class 10 and 12 students can choose not to appear for the pending board exams and be marked as per their performance in pre-board exams or internal assessment.However, the exams were cancelled given the spike in COVID-19 cases.

23-09-2020||New Delhi||Dassault Aviation, MBDA yet to fulfil offset obligations under Rafale deal: CAG||French aerospace major Dassault Aviation and European missile maker MBDA are yet to fulfil their offset obligations of offering high technology to India as part of the deal relating to procurement of 36 Rafale jets, the Comptroller and Auditor General said in a report released on Wednesday.The Dassault Aviation is the manufacturer of the Rafale jets, while the MBDA supplied the missile systems for the aircraft.In its report tabled in Parliament, the CAG also painted a grim picture of efficacy of India’s offset policy saying it did not find a single case of foreign vendors transferring high technology to the Indian industry, adding defence sector ranked 62nd out of 63 sectors receiving FDI.“In the offset contract relating to 36 Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), the vendors M/s Dassault Aviation and M/s MBDA initially proposed to discharge 30 per cent of their offset obligation by offering high technology to DRDO,” the CAG said.“DRDO wanted to obtain technical assistance for the indigenous development of engine (Kaveri) for the Light Combat Aircraft. Till date the vendor has not confirmed the transfer of this technology,” according to a press release issued by CAG.The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 aircraft at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore.Under India’s offset policy, foreign defence entities are mandated to spend at least 30 per cent of the total contract value in India through procurement of components or setting up of research and development facilities.The offset norms are applicable to all capital purchases above Rs 300 crore made through imports. The offset obligations can be made through Foreign Direct Investment, free transfer of technology to Indian firms and purchase of products manufactured by Indian firms.The auditor said though the vendors failed to keep up their offset commitments, there was no effective means of penalise them.“Non fulfillment of offset obligations by the vendor especially when the contract period of the main procurement is over, is a direct benefit to the vendor,” it said.The CAG said as the offset policy has not yielded the desired result, the defence ministry needs to review the policy and its implementation.It needs to identify the constraints faced by the foreign suppliers as well as the Indian industry in leveraging the offsets, and find solutions to overcome these constraints,” it said.The CAG said 48 offset contracts were signed with foreign vendors from 2005 to March 2018 with a total value of Rs 66,427 crore, and Rs 19,223 crore worth of offsets should have been discharged by the vendors by December 2018.But the amount discharged by them was only Rs 11,396 crore, which was only 59 per cent of the commitment.     “Further, only 48 per cent (Rs. 5,457 crore) of these offset claims submitted by the vendors were accepted by the Ministry. The rest were largely rejected as they were not compliant to the contractual conditions and the Defence Procurement Procedure.”       It said the remaining offset commitments of about Rs 55,000 crore would be due to be completed by 2024. “The rate at which the foreign vendors have been fulfilling their offset commitments was about Rs 1,300 crore per year. Given this situation, fulfilling the commitment of Rs 55,000 crore by the vendors in the next six years remains a major challenge,” the CAG said.The auditor found that of the total value of offsets, only 3.5 per cent was contracted to be discharged through FDI with Indian Offsets Partners or IOPs, adding it did not find a single case where the foreign vendor had transferred high technology to the Indian industry. “The defence sector is ranked 62nd out of the 63 sectors in India in terms of FDI. Similarly, there was hardly any equipment supplied ‘in kind’ to the Indian industry by the foreign vendor. Thus, the objectives of the offset policy remain largely unachieved,” the report said.The CAG said it undertook the performance audit of the offset policy after a decade of its roll out to assess the extent to which its objectives were met.

They must ensure that these lockdowns are not interrupting economic activity,” the PM said, announcing the Centre’s decision to enhance from 35 to 50 per cent the limit for fund use by states under the state disaster relief fund.He said the enhanced limit will help states with extra funds to fight COVID19.The PM defended the national lockdown in early days, adding that “it helped a lot and was praised worldwide”. He told the CMs, “We must now start micro containment in the 60 districts which account for maximum COVID load in India. These districts are in seven states. I urge CMs to ensure block level containment in these 60 districts,” PM Modi said.He stressed the need to universalise the use of masks, noting that several studies have pointed to the benefits of masks in preventing COVID transmission which, he admitted, was mostly  asymptomatic, leading to suspicions over testing and its efficacy.”We have to guard against rumours, like Punjab CM Amarinder Singh ji has said. Wearing masks may be a tough habit but we have to inculcate it. I agree with Uddhav Thackeray ji that it is like wearing spectacles,” the PM said, asking states to coordinate on the movement of life saving oxygen to save lives.”The national lockdown in initial days have helped a lot and it was praised worldwide but now we have to focus on micro containment zones to control COVID transmission and enable normal activity. States must analyse how effective are one- or two-day lockdowns to prevent transmission. Hope this is not preventing economic activity. States must think seriously along these lines and going forward ensure both COVID management and economic revival,” PM said, adding that the COVID-related infrastructure was helping in the fight against the disease which is concentrated in 60 districts, even when India has 700-plus districts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/focus-on-micro-covid-19-containment-zones-in-60-districts-pm-modi-to-cms-of-7-covid-hit-states-145499

He has been given 15 days to respond from the date of receiving the BCD notice. The BCD notice became public after Bhushan tweeted about it.As a state bar council, it’s the BCD which has issued licence to Bhushan authorising him to practise law.Invoking Section 24A (Disqualification for enrolment) and Section 35 of the Advocates Act, 1961, the BCD asked Bhushan to explain why disqualification proceedings “not initiated against you in view of your tweets in question and conviction under Suo motu Contempt Petition by the Supreme Court of India.”The Supreme Court had on August 31 ordered him to pay a fine of Re 1 by September 15 for contempt of court, failing which he will be sent to jail for three months and debarred from practising before it for three years.The Bar Council of India (BCI) -- which regulates the legal profession in India -- had earlier directed the BCD Bar to “examine” the Supreme Court’s decision convicting Bhushan of contempt of court and proceed as per law and rules “as expeditiously as possible”.He had paid the Re 1 fine on September 14 and filed a petition seeking review of the top court’s verdict convicting him of scandalising the judiciary by his controversial tweets.“Just because I’m paying the fine does not mean I have accepted the verdict,” Bhushan – who is also facing another criminal contempt case—had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bar-council-of-delhi-issues-notice-to-prashant-bhushan-145489

They have good safety and efficacy records, but not much research has been done with nasal delivery of these vaccines.“Our experience in viral vaccines, manufacturing capabilities, and distribution continue to be our strong suit in ensuring safe, efficacious, and affordable vaccines.It is prudent for Bharat to be involved in diverse but tenable projects to provide a much-needed vaccine against COVID-19 which reaches all citizens of the world,” Chairman and Managing Director of Bharat Biotech, Krishna Ella said.The company envisions to scale up this vaccine to one billion doses, translating to an equal number of individuals vaccinated receiving a single-dose regimen.An intranasal vaccine will not only be simple to administer but reduce the use of medical consumables such as needles, syringes, etc., significantly impacting the overall cost of a vaccination drive, it said.Director of Biologic Therapeutics Center and Professor of Radiation Oncology at Washington University School of Medicine and Precision Virologics Interim CEO, Dr David T Curiel said, “The ability to accomplish effective immunization with a single nasal dose is a major advantage, offering broader reach and easier administration.An effective nasal dose not only protects against COVID- 19, but it also prevents the spread of the disease by offering another kind of immunity that occurs primarily in the cells that line the nose and throat.Most other vaccine candidates currently under development cant do that.”This vaccine expands BBs portfolio of vaccines that are currently being developed and are in various stages of clinical development including Covaxin which is currently in Phase II human clinical trials in India, it said.

Mohan and Facebook have challenged the notice.On behalf of Mohan, senior advocate Harish Salve, however, contended parliamentary privilege didn’t extend to such an inquiry and the panel couldn’t have asked him to appear before it.Pointing out that the summons stated that Mohan's failure to be present would amount to breach of privilege, Salve said, "Privilege is something to be decided by the Assembly. A Committee can’t decide whether action on privilege can be taken or not…This is a serious threat,” he submitted.The Delhi Legislative Assembly counsel told the Bench that Mohan was summoned by the peace and harmony committee of the Delhi Legislative Assembly only as a witness to get the social networking site's suggestions on devising mechanisms to prevent misuse of the platform. No coercive action was intended against Facebook and that he was not summoned as an accused, said senior counsel AM Singhvi.Salve was supported by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Facebook, who said: "If he (Mohan) does not go before the Committee, it is not breach of privilege. I, personally as a lawyer, have been called by Parliament for giving opinions a number of times. You cannot compel and say non-appearance will be a breach of privilege.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-coercive-action-against-facebook-vp-till-october-15-sc-to-delhi-assembly-panel-145476
23-09-2020||New Delhi||Pandemics caused by new virus infect humans in multiple waves: Govt||Pandemics caused by a new virus have the propensity to infect human population in multiple waves and some countries which initially successfully contained the COVID-19 outbreak are now reporting a resurgence of cases, the Lok Sabha was told on Wednesday.The Government of India has accordingly advised states to upgrade health infrastructure based on the case growth trajectory in respective states and districts, besides taking stringent containment measures, Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey said in a written reply.He was responding to a question on whether the government has anticipated and is ready for the second wave of COVID-19 during the winter months in India.      “Pandemics caused by a new virus have the propensity to infect human population in multiple waves, each time affecting a cohort of susceptible population.              “Some countries, which had initially successfully contained the COVID-19 outbreak earlier are now reporting a resurgence of cases,” the minister said in his reply.Giving details of the steps taken by the government to provide funds and medical equipment for COVID-19 care management, Choubey said states and UTs are being provided required technical and financial assistance to manage the public health challenge.                 With public health and hospitals being a state subject, the primary responsibility of strengthening the healthcare system lies with respective state governments, the minister said.All the states and UTs are provided with necessary financial support under India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package.                  During FY 2020-21, Rs 4256.81 crore in funds were released to states and UTs.In addition, states are being supported in terms of supply of logistics. So far 1.42, crore PPE kits, 3.45 crore N-95 masks, 10.84 crore tablets of hydroxychloroquine, 30,841 ventilators and 1,02,400 oxygen cylinders have been supplied to states, UTs and central government hospitals (as reported on September, 20), the minister said.For appropriate management of COVID-19 cases, Government of India has advised state governments to set up three-tier arrangement of health facilities exclusively for COVID-19.              These are COVID Care Centres with isolation beds for mild or pre-symptomatic cases; Dedicated COVID Health Centre (DCHC) with oxygen-supported isolation beds for moderate cases and Dedicated COVID Hospitals (DCH) with ICU beds for severe cases.      DCHCs or DCHs may be full hospitals or a separate block in a hospital with preferably separate entry/exit/zoning. In addition, the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) has set up large dedicated COVID-19 field hospitals with capacity ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 isolation beds, the minister said.These temporary hospitals have been set up in Delhi, Bihar (Patna and Muzaffarpur).All states, including Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, have accordingly taken action to create such infrastructure, Choubey said on whether the Union government has any plans to start exclusive COVID-19 treatment and care blocks in states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu where a large number of people got infected.Hospital infrastructure in the country for managing coronavirus cases is being continuously monitored by the government. States have been advised to prepare for requisite surge capacities to manage cases in accordance with existing and projected growth rates, he said.

23-09-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Telangana farmers oppose new agriculture laws||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, September 23 The opposition to the farm legislations is growing in Telangana with the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leadership coming out on the road to protest the “anti-farmer” regulations. The political leadership of all parties is opposing the farm legislations – Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.As per reports, farmers across the state held protest  demonstrations against the legislations.A large number of farmers on tractors and bullock-carts staged a protest at Narsampet in Warangal district.While addressing the farmers, local MLA Peddi Sudarshan Reddy said the interest of the farmers was under serious threat as the new legislations would meddle with the benefits received by the state farmers. The Telangana Government led by Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) is working towards uplifting of the farmers, while the Centre is trying to hit them, various politicians have been saying in their addresses. Highlighting the scrapping of the entire agriculture market system, TRS politicians have said that this would also take away the minimum support price (MSP), hitting the farmers economically and would expose the farmers to exploitation by the middlemen and traders.The TRS has threatened to go to Delhi to protest if the Central Government did not scrap the new agricultural legislations. Telangana Finance Minister T Harish Rao, meanwhile, demanded immediate release of the pending Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) amounting Rs 2,461 crore as the state was facing a serious financial crunch.He put forth this demand in a video conference with the GST Council convenor and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushi Kumar Modi.Rao said this money was necessary for the state to continue its fight against COVID-19. He asked the Union Government to release the funds before the next GST council meeting, which is scheduled to be held on October 5.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-farmers-oppose-new-agriculture-laws-145468
23-09-2020||---||Ghulam Nabi Azad meets President Kovind; Opposition requests President not to give assent to contentious farm Bills||New Delhi, September 23The broader Opposition on Wednesday urged President Ram Nath Kovind to return the “unconstitutional” farm-related Bills, requesting him to reserve his assent on the legislations till the time these were reconsidered and taken up again through due process.In a meeting with the President on Wednesday evening, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, speaking for 18 non-NDA parties, alleged that the Bills were passed by the Rajya Sabha in violation of all parliamentary and constitutional rules and procedures with no voting or division allowed on the resolutions and motions moved by Opposition members.“All limits were crossed in the Rajya Sabha on Sunday and Constitutional rules, regulations and procedures were disregarded in the temple of democracy. The way Deputy Chairman passed the Bills, we moved the motion of no confidence against him.“We have urged the President not to sign the Bills as these are unconstitutional. The President should return the Bills, so that discussions can again take place and proper procedures can be followed besides taking up Opposition amendments to the Bills and a division allowed on our resolutions and motions. Only when the Bills come through proper route should the President grant his assent. Till then he should not sign and should return them,” Azad said after the meeting.The meeting was only granted to Azad in view of COVID norms.The Opposition featuring 18 party leaders had submitted a memorandum against farm Bills to the President earlier. The submission was followed up today with a meeting with the President.The President said he will look into our concerns, said Azad, apprising the President of the “manner in which the Bills were passed.”Azad said farmers were the backbone of India and filled the granaries.“This government should have struck a broad consensus on the Bills, spoken to all parties and farmer organisations before bringing a law. Then the law would have been. But sadly the government did not send the Bill either to a select committee or a standing committee,” the Congress veteran noted.Recalling Sunday events in the Rajya Sabha, Azad said five parties had moved resolutions and two had moved motions to send the Bills to a select or standing committee.That didn’t happen, he said, leading to a representation by the Opposition to the President.  Azad said the consensus on Sunday in the Rajya Sabha was to not extend the house sitting beyond 1 pm but the same was “disregarded.”“The Opposition is not responsible for the fracas that ensued in RS. The government is responsible. Unfortunately, the Deputy Chairman passed the Bills without hearing the Opposition. We didn’t know what was going on,” said Azad.Earlier today, Opposition MPs held a march from Mahatma Gandhi statue to Ambedkar statue inside Parliament House to protest farm Bills and labour Bills passed in the absence of the Opposition.Congress chief whip in the Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh said, “All MPs of the Congress and like-minded parties protested anti-farmers, anti-workers Bills that have been rubberstamped in Parliament in the most undemocratic manner by the Modi government."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ghulam-nabi-azad-meets-president-kovind-opposition-requests-president-not-to-give-assent-to-contentious-farm-bills-145466

23-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi may have 8 months of 32°C average temperature by 2100: WEF study||The national capital may have eight months a year with temperature averaging 32°C by 2100, up from six at present, a new study said on Wednesday cautioning against the worsening global warming scenario in the world.According to the new ‘EarthTime Visualisation’ report released at the World Economic Forum’s Sustainable Development Impact Summit, a record increase in temperature is expected in the US, India and across South Asia for longer periods of time.Such a future can be avoided from playing out only by limiting the worst impact of climate change by decreasing emissions and working towards the Sustainable Development Goals, the WEF said in its report while urging business and government leaders to fast-track solutions and act now to prevent such a scenario unfolding.“Climate-related impacts such as the wildfires in the western United States will only become more severe if we allow the worst-case scenario to unfold by 2100,” it said.The WEF said it used data from the Climate Impact Lab, Climate Central, the Washington Post, and NASA satellites to create a visualisation of this worst-case scenario.The data model shows that by 2100, average June-August temperatures will reach 38°C (100.4°F) for many parts of the world.Besides, New Delhi will have eight months a year with temperatures averaging 32ºC (89.6°F) up from six, the model shows.At the same time, Phoenix, Arizona, may have nearly 200 days a year of temperatures hitting at least 32ºC (89.6°F), while regions of southern Europe will have average June-August temperatures of 30°C (86°F).Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia’s June-August temperatures will average more than 30°C (86°F), while Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, can disappear under water due to rising sea levels.“Longer-term trends can often seem abstract and intangible. Visualising the effects of these trends, based on the latest scientific data, can help people take action and work towards shared goals,” said Stephan Mergenthaler, head of strategic intelligence at WEF.Effective climate policies, fighting efforts to discredit legitimate science, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or offsetting it by planting new forests, and upgrading transportation and energy systems can all be part of the solution, the WEF said.

After former President (and now PM) Mahinda Rajyapaksa’s younger brother easily won the presidential polls, the family’s party swept the parliamentary polls.With the family in absolute political control, Mahinda as PM has been playing both India and China.At stake is India’s East Container Terminal (ECT) project in Colombo that was approved by the previous India-friendly Srisena government. Although 70 per cent of the traffic will be with India and Japan is also a partner, the project has faced opposition.President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has set up a committee to examine the concerns raised about ECT as well as Jaya Container Terminal (JCT).But the equations have slightly altered after COVID-19 and in the midst of a fragile financial situation due to the pandemic, Sri Lanka has to pay back big loans this year.In an earlier phone call with PM Modi, Gotabaya had sought a special $1.1-billion currency swap facility.A MEA release confirming the virtual bilateral summit said it will give an opportunity to the two leaders to “comprehensively review the broad framework of the bilateral relationship” soon after the parliamentary elections in Sri Lank.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-to-hold-virtual-bilateral-summit-with-sri-lankas-mahinda-rajapaksa-145455

These would run under the aegis of the Directorate General of Resettlement (DGR), which already runs several schemes for the rehabilitation of veterans.“Consequent to optimisation of station workshops, there is requirement of a dependable and reliable engineering support eco-system for undertaking repair of vehicles and equipment of units and establishments functioning on peace establishment.“Creation of ex-servicemen run workshops is one such viable option, which can not only provide a one stop solution for maintenance and repair of equipment of non-field force, but also offer a second career to skilled ex-servicemen of the armed forces,” stated a concept paper floated by the Army.Recommendations of the Shekatkar Committee on reforming the armed forces included restructuring of repair echelons in the Army, which covered base workshops, advance base workshops and static or station workshops that are run by the Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers.While some smaller workshops are to be closed down, the large establishments like Army Base Workshops are to be handed over to private contractors for functioning under the ‘Government Owned Contractor Operated’ model.The proposal initially envisages repair and maintenance of vehicles of the armed forces, and thereafter expand the scope of activities to cover a wide range of other equipment such as generators, electronic, computer hardware, air conditioners, cellular phones etc.To make the venture financially viable, the facilities of the workshops can be extended to other government organisations and the workshops would also be allowed to cater to private clientele.The Army is now seeking the view and opinions of interested ex-servicemen to identify their aspirations and outline the modalities of such ventures.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-its-workshops-close-down-army-looks-at-supporting-ventures-by-ex-servicemen-to-meet-its-needs-145451

The programme had alleged Muslims were “infiltrating” civil services in a planned manner.The top court noted that if it had not stopped telecast, all 10 episodes of the programme would have been telecast by now.It wanted the Centre to hear the petitioner along with Sudarshan News. “If a complaint is made... you hear the complainant. Principles of natural justice call for you to hear them. Will it be illegal to hear the petitioner?” wondered Justice KM Joseph who is part of the Bench.“If ten thousand complaints are recieved then we cannot hear them all...I would not like to concede to it. You may examine this after the ministry passes an order,” Mehta said.As several counsel wanted to be heard by the Government, the Bench said at least the petitioner should be heard.“We can’t, My Lords.

They were passed by Lok Sabha on Tuesday and these will now be sent to the President for his assent.The Bills pertain to the three remaining labour codes on industrial relations, social security and occupational safety.Replying to the debate on the three labour reforms Bills, Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said, “The purpose of labour reforms is to provide a transparent system to suit the changed business environment”.Gangwar also told the House that as many as 16 states have already increased the threshold for closure, lay off and retrenchment in firms with up to 300 workers without government permission. He said that the increase in threshold would result in job creation and encourage employers to hire.The Minister said these Bills would safeguard the interest of workers and provide universal social security to workers by expanding the ambit of Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation and Employees’ State Corporation of India. He also said that there would be a social security fund to cover around 40 crore unorganised sector workers.Over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and one (Code on Wages Bill, 2019) of them has already been passed, the minister said.The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, will consolidate and amend the laws regulating the occupational safety, health and working conditions of persons employed in an establishment and related matters.The Industrial Relations Code, 2020, seeks to consolidate and amend laws relating to trade unions, conditions of employment in industrial establishments or undertaking, investigation and settlement of industrial disputes.The Code on Social Security, 2020, will amend and consolidate laws relating to social security with the goal to extend social security to all employees and workers either in the organised sector or the unorganised sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-passes-three-remaining-labour-code-bills-145443
23-09-2020||New Delhi||Parliament passes Foreign Contribution Regulation Act amendment Bill||With Rajya Sabha giving its nod, Parliament on Wednesday passed a bill to amend the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act-FCRA to make furnishing of Aadhaar numbers by office bearers of NGOs mandatory for registration besides other provisions.The government on its part claimed, that the changes in the law are aimed only to bring transparency and not cripple the functioning of any NGO.The bill was passed unanimously with a voice to vote amid Opposition boycott of proceedings over the suspension of eight members of Rajya Sabha.It was passed in Lok Sabha on Monday, and will be sent to the President for his assent.Replying to a debate on the bill, Minister of State (MoS), Home Nityanand Rai said the legislation was not against any NGO and is an effort to bring in transparency in the functioning of organizations receiving foreign funds as a donation for specific purposes.This amendment is in the interest of good NGOs which want to do good work in the country, he added.The Minister added: “This is certainly a bill to bring transparency. It is not against NGOs in any case. But only those NGOs which do not adhere to transparency may feel bad. This bill is in the interest of NGOs and transparency.”About making mandatory the furnishing of Aadhaar number by members of NGOs, Reddy told the House, that as per the apex court order, the government can bring law to use Aadhaar to identify the certain category of people.The minister said the bill provides for a reduction in administrative expenses of any NGO receiving foreign funding, from 50 per cent to 20 per cent of annual funds to ensure spending on their main objectives.Among other provisions, the bill proposes to enable the Centre to allow an NGO or association to surrender its FCRA certificate. The bill also seeks to bar public servants from receiving funds from abroad.The minister was of the view that this bill was necessary for the context of internal security of the country as there are earlier instances where NGOs did not disclose their foreign funding and also did not furnish proper audit of their expenditure.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-passes-foreign-contribution-regulation-act-amendment-bill-145442

23-09-2020||New Delhi||Fake news, rumours used to label 2008 Batla House encounter staged: ex-IPS officer Karnal Singh||Fake news and "street rumours" were picked up by a section of politicians, activists and media to paint the 2008 Batla House encounter of IM terrorists as staged, retired IPS officer and the then chief of the Delhi Police special cell Karnal Singh has said.The 1984-batch officer of the Union Territories cadre has come out with a book -- Batla House: An Encounter that Shook the Nation -- on the police operation on September 19, 2008, at house number L-18 in the Batla House locality of Jamia Nagar in south Delhi.The book has been published by Rupa Publications.The officer was spearheading a probe into the 2008 Delhi blasts as the head or joint commissioner of police of the elite special cell that was raised specifically to undertake counterterrorism operations. Leads from the blast probe led the special cell to Batla House where Indian Mujahideen terrorists were holed-up. A gunbattle broke between the policemen, who went for reconnaissance, and the terrorists in which special cell Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma lost his life, while two terrorists were eliminated. Singh, who retired in 2018 as the Director of the Enforcement Directorate, spoke to PTI on the operation, seen as one of the most politicised police encounters of the country."There was a perception built around the Batla House encounter by disseminating fake news,” Singh said.  “Many politicians, activists and media houses picked up street rumours without any fact-checking."  "For example, some alleged that Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma died due to three bullets fired at his back by his teammates and they also alleged that the terrorist did not fire at all. The post-mortem report clearly stated that Mohan had got two bullet injuries from the front and not back," he said. Doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences conducted the post-mortem of the two terrorists also and collected their hand wash and sent it to the forensic science laboratory for dermal nitrate test to conclude if they had fired or not, Singh said. "The test for the terrorists came out to be positive indicating clearly that both the terrorists had fired on the police team," he said."Fake news circulation did create an obstacle but only for a short while. All the facts, evidences and investigations proved the authenticity of the encounter.""This case has been through multiple scrutiny from diverse and independent agencies and the truth has stood strong through the test of time, patience and adverse perceptions. Our turning point was when a few people who had earlier believed in fake news were open to factual accounts," the officer said, replying to a question on the upheavals they faced after the encounter. Singh, who also headed the Financial Intelligence Unit of the country for a brief period, said media reportage of sensitive investigations is a very responsible job."The communication between the investigating agencies and the media about the ongoing investigation is a very delicate issue...transparent communication has to be followed with responsibility and accountability towards the nation and its citizens," he said.Asked about the motivation of the IM terrorists to perpetrate multiple blasts in the country, Singh said their probe found the terrorists were inspired by Osama bin Laden and that they would talk about religion at length."Through the evidence, we found on their electronic devices, we know that they were inspired by Osama Bin Laden's speeches. We found presentations, motivational songs and videos calling out to more people to join their mission."  "There were photographs of bombs placed in the shape of IM. We learnt that most of them were introduced to IM through their friends or acquaintances," he said.They (the IM terrorists) would discuss religion at length. Over time, they were radicalised and recruited through the belief that they had to avenge the alleged atrocities on Muslims by the rest of the world, Singh said. He added that "a few IM terrorists escaped to Pakistan and Dubai after the Batla House encounter."  "There is no information about them if they are alive or dead.”“Terror-related investigations are difficult and intricate as pieces of evidence are not easily available and connecting each dot takes a tremendous amount of work by the entire team.""The toughest thing to do is to find that one definitive lead that unravels the tracks which are meticulously covered by the terrorists. We could find that lead due to relentless investigative work done by my team, cooperation and knowledge sharing with Gujarat Police, Mumbai Police, Intelligence Bureau and testimonies of two eyewitnesses of the bomb blasts," he said.He said the family members of the policemen, especially those who work in units like a special cell, make huge personal sacrifices and contribution so that they can "bring their best" to work every day.The officer said there should be a political consensus in the country to deal with internal security and terrorism, and guidelines should be framed for the conduct of every person during such a situation."There should be guidelines for security and investigative agencies, citizens, politicians and media persons that highlight the roles and responsibilities which need to be adhered to during an active investigation and after it is concluded.The book details as to why the police team that raided Batla House did not wear bulletproof jackets and also mentions how the then prime minister Manmohan Singh praised Singh and his team for doing a good job. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fake-news-rumours-used-to-label-2008-batla-house-encounter-staged-ex-ips-officer-karnal-singh-145427

23-09-2020||Mumbai||Procured drugs in small quantities for Sushant Rajput, Rhea Chakraborty says in her bail plea||Actor Rhea Chakraborty, arrested in a drugs case related to actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death, has said in her bail plea filed in the Bombay High Court that she is innocent and the NCB is "deliberately" trying to invoke stringent charges against her and her family.She said she had been subjected to a "witchhunt".In her bail application filed in the court on Tuesday, Chakraborty said she is just 28, and besides the probe by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), she had been subjected to three more investigations by police and central agencies, and a "simultaneous media trial".These probes refer to the ones conducted into Rajput's death by the Mumbai police, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate.Chakraborty said all of this had taken a "severe toll on her mental health and well-being".Any further custody would worsen her mental health, she said in her plea filed through her counsel Satish Maneshinde.Her bail plea was scheduled to be heard by a bench presided over by Justice Sarang Kotwal on Wednesday.However, since the High Court suspended the day's hearings owing to heavy rain in the city, the plea is likely to be heard on Thursday.Chakraborty said in her plea that Rajput had been in the habit of consuming drugs, particularly "ganja" since even before she got into a relationship with him.While she would sometimes procure drugs for him in "small quantities", and would also "occasionally pay for them herself," she was in no way part of any drugs syndicate.She said Rajput is the only one who was consuming the said drugs."The applicant (Chakraborty) is innocent and has not committed any crime whatsoever," the plea said.She said in her plea that she had been subjected to a "witchhunt," and after the CBI and the ED failed to gather any evidence against her, the NCB was "brought in to somehow implicate her and her family".Chakraborty has been booked by the NCB on several charges, including financing illicit trafficking of drugs under Section 27-A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.Section 27-A brings along a bar on the grant of bail to an accused.The actor said she had been wrongly booked under Section 27-A of the NDPS.Besides, since no drugs were seized from her possession and since the NCB had managed to seize only 59 gm of drugs from all the accused, the bar on the grant of bail could not be applied to her, she said in the plea.The actor said a bar on the grant of bail could come into play only if the drugs seized were in commercial quantities.Chakraborty said that at best, she could be accused of having procured drugs in small amounts for her boyfriend.However, she was trying her best to wean Rajput off the habit, she said.Besides, if Rajput was alive today, he would have been charged merely for the consumption of drugs and would have invited a maximum sentence of just one year, while she had been charged under sections imposing a maximum sentence of up to 20 years, Chakraborty said in the plea.She is currently lodged in the Byculla women's prison in the city.Rajput (34) was found hanging at his home in suburban Bandra on June 14.

23-09-2020||The opposition leaders are boycotting Parliament proceedings and have laid down conditions for return to the Houses||Ahead of their meeting with President, opposition MPs take out march against farm Bills||Aditi TandonTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 23Ahead of the 5 pm meeting of the opposition delegation with President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday, the MPs of Congress and like-minded parties took out a protest march on the Parliament premises to protest against the passage of “anti-farmer and anti-labour bills” in the “absence of discussions”.“All MPs of the Congress and like-minded parties are marching from Gandhi statue to Ambedkar statue in Parliament protesting against the anti-farmer, anti-worker Bills that have been rubberstamped in Parliament in the most undemocratic manner by the  Modi government,” party chief whip Jairam Ramesh said.The opposition leaders are boycotting Parliament proceedings and have laid down conditions for return to the Houses. The conditions include a stand-alone bill guaranteeing MSP for farmers’ produce and an assurance that such MSP would be applicable to private trade as well.The opposition MPs earlier on Wednesday met and signed another memorandum to be submitted to the President. The memorandum alleges that the government is riding roughshod in Parliament and pushing bills without any semblance of debate or discussion.Jairam Ramesh also slammed the passage by Parliament of the Essential Commodities Amendment Bill, 2020, saying, “Amendment passed to the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, erodes constitutional rights of states. It’s a highly centralising Act and will be rendered ineffective when the nation goes through a time of crisis.”Explaining the reasons for the Congress opposition to the Bill, Ramesh said, “There are two clauses. Under clause (a), supply may be regulated only in the case of war, famine, extraordinary price rise or natural calamity of a grave nature. Under clause (b), stock limits may be imposed only if certain price levels are triggered. The manner of reckoning or calculating the ‘stock limits’ attracts the first proviso and the explanation. Reading the two together, it appears that the stock can be cleverly distributed among different value chain participants and, in practical terms, there will be no case of violating stock limits at all.”Ramesh said there could also be some states where menace of hoarding is so rampant that the state government may wish to regulate and place stock limits.“Hence, respecting the principle of federalism, the Amendments must apply only if the state government, by notification, applies the Amendment Act in that state. It gives an opportunity for the hoarders and black-marketeers for speculation. In such a diverse country as ours where the situation may differ from district to district within a state such a centralised law would make it very difficult for the states to check black-marketing of goods,” said the Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-their-meeting-with-president-opposition-mps-take-out-march-against-farm-bills-145418

23-09-2020||Washington||India, US share strong interest in rules-based Indo-Pacific region: Biden||Asserting that India and the US share a strong interest in a rules-based Indo-Pacific region where no country, including China, threatens, Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday said the two nations could undeniably shape the region for a much better future."The US and India share a strong interest in a rules-based Indo-Pacific region, where no country, including China, threatens its neighbours with impunity," Biden said in his address to a virtual fundraiser for Indian Americans.In his first ever virtual fundraiser as a presidential candidate for Indian Americans that was attended by 268 people, Biden alleged that President Donald Trump is ceding space to China just when the country is looking to undercut its neighbours and the American leadership in the Pacific."We can undeniably shape the Indo-Pacific order for a much better, better future. We can get it right. This election is going to determine our future," Biden said during the fundraiser in a conversation with Dr Vivek Murthy, former surgeon general.Referring to his long-standing ties with India and the work that he has done over the past several decades, first as the US senator from Delaware and then as the country's vice president, Biden said his administration is going to continue to value this relationship."It is not about photo ops or handshakes, it is about getting things done," he said without elaborating any further.Fifteen years ago, Biden told the Indian Americans that he was leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with a Republican, Senator Richard Lugar, and they approved the historic India-US civil nuclear deal."At the time, I said when India and the United States became close friends the world would be a much safer place. Seven years ago, as vice president, I told a business owner in Mumbai that the US-India partnership was the defining relationship in the 21st century," he said."I am not just saying it now, I said it then and I mean it," the former vice president said while asserting that he would continue to believe this as the president. "I will work to make sure it occurs," he said.Biden said he had long called for standing with Indians confronting terrorism in the region, strengthening India's defence capabilities, expanding trade between the two countries and tackling global challenges like climate change and global health.

23-09-2020||United Nations||Amid Covid impact, Indian economy forecast to contract 5.4 per cent this year: UN||Impacted by disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, India's economy is forecast to contract by 5.9 per cent in 2020, the UN has said in a report, warning that while growth will rebound next year, the contraction is likely to translate into a permanent income loss.The Trade and Development Report 2020 by UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said on Tuesday that the world economy is experiencing a deep recession amid a still-unchecked pandemic.It said the global economy would contract by an estimated 4.3 per cent this year, leaving global output by year's end over USD 6 trillion short (in current US dollars) of what economists had expected it to be before the coronavirus began to spread."In short, the world is grappling with the equivalent of a complete wipe-out of the Brazilian, Indian and Mexican economies. And as domestic activity contracts, so goes the international economy; trade will shrink by around one-fifth this year, foreign direct investment flows by up to 40 per cent and remittances will drop by over USD 100 billion," the UNCTAD report said, painting a grim picture of the global economic scenario.UNCTAD expects South Asia to contract 4.8 per cent in 2020 and recover to 3.9 per cent in 2021. India's GDP is forecast to contract 5.9 per cent in 2020 and recover to 3.9 per cent next year, the report said."In the case of India, the baseline scenario is a sharp recession in 2020 as strict lockdown measures to stem the virus' spread brought many productive activities to a halt across the country," it said.The report said that while UNCTAD expects a rebound in India's GDP growth in 2021 in line with the growth rates of the Indian economy in recent years, "the contraction registered in 2020 is likely to translate into a permanent income loss".In the US, UNCTAD expects GDP to fall 5.4 per cent in 2020 and recover 2.8 per cent in 2021. China is expected to register an economic growth of 1.3 per cent this year and a whopping 8.1 per cent in 2021, the report said, recording the highest economic growth rate in the world."This year is shaping up to be a very difficult year for the global economy. With many countries unprepared to respond to a health pandemic, lockdown seemed to be the only plausible way to protect lives and preserve health systems. Doing so triggered an economic crisis that spread as quickly as the virus itself," the UN trade agency added.Data for the first two quarters of this year show output contracted more sharply than in 2008-2009, and in some cases registering the steepest drop on record.Estimates for the year point to a generalised global recession matching the Great Depression of the 1930s, it said.While 2021 will likely see a rebound, it will be uneven within and across countries and uncertainty will persist, the report said, warning that unemployment will be on an upward trend, more and more companies will be facing the threat of bankruptcy; supply chains will be fragile; confidence will be shaken and demand will be weak."Debt levels across the world, in both the public and private sectors, will have risen significantly from the historically high levels registered before the crisis. In this condition, the wrong policy steps – and ignoring the experience of the last decade – could trigger further shocks which would not only derail recovery but could usher in a lost decade," the report said.It said that the biggest absolute falls in output will be in the developed world, with some countries set to register a double-digit decline over the year."But the greatest economic and social damage will be in the developing world, where levels of informality are high, commodities and tourism major sources of foreign exchange, and fiscal space has been squeezed under a mountain of debt," it said.Between 90 million and 120 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in the developing world, with close to 300 million facing food insecurity, it said.UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said building a better world requires smart actions."The lives of future generations, indeed of the planet itself, will depend on the choices we all take over the coming months,” Kituyi said.The report also said that even if economic activity continues to bounce back and advanced country governments continue with the current mix of fiscal and monetary measures, employment will not fully recover, and many countries will remain in debt distress and income gaps will widen."Forecasters' talk of a V-shaped recovery can easily mislead. Such a recovery would require double-digit global growth next year, which is out of the question,” said Richard Kozul-Wright, UNCTAD's director of the division on globalisation and development strategies.The report asserted that a global recovery plan must be both bold and comprehensive, built around a coordinated macroeconomic expansion focused on job creation and higher wages and supported by a big public investment push into cleaner energy, environmental protection and sustainable transport systems.

23-09-2020||New Delhi||Turkish President Erdogan’s remarks on J-K at UNGA ‘completely unacceptable’: India||India and Turkey clashed for the second year running at the UN General Assembly’s high level session after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described Kashmir as a “burning issue”.Speaking at the high level segment of the UNGA, Erdogan did not name India but criticised the situation in Kashmir after the August 5, 2019, change in status and the lockdown.India’s Permanent Representative in the UN TS Tirumurti hit back by describing his remarks as “gross interference in India’s internal affairs” and said they were “completely unacceptable”.Turkey, he said, should learn to respect the sovereignty of other nations and reflect on its own policies more deeply.Turkey under Erdogan has been engaged in a brutal crackdown on the minority Kurds, denies the Armenian genocide and recently converted a museum into a mosque, drawing condemnation from around the world. Erdogan had even hinted at a plebiscite which is a red rag to India by observing that “we are in favour of solving this issue through dialogue within the framework of UN resolutions, especially in line with the expectations of the people of Kashmir”.However, the relevant UNSC resolution asks Pakistan to first remove its troops and personnel from the region.Erdogan rubbed a few more countries the wrong way in his speech and in case of Armenia and Azerbaijan, even named them. Last year at the same event Pakistan and Malaysian prime ministers besides Erdogan had touched on the Kashmir issue.Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed United Nations the mirror and urged it to take a long, hard look at its “crisis of confidence” while ratcheting up the call for a new template of multilateralism that “reflects today’s realities” on Day One of the United Nations high-level week being live-streamed to the world from the UN headquarters in New York City.Meanwhile, PM Modi renewed his call for reforming the UN’s structures during a four-minute video address.“We cannot fight today’s challenges with outdated structures and without comprehensive reforms. The UN faces a crisis of confidence,” he said in a pre-recorded message.“For today’s interconnected world, we need a reformed multilateralism that reflects today’s realities, gives voice to all stakeholders, addresses contemporary challenges and focuses on human welfare,” he added.The PM was speaking at a special session to commemorate UNGA’s 75th anniversary. He will make a substantial address at the UNGA on Saturday.The high level segment of the UNGA will see a record number of world leaders delivering their addresses via pre-recorded video tapes. In normal times, many of them would have deputed their Permanent Representatives at the UN or ministers to speak on their nation’s behalf.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/turkish-president-erdogans-remarks-on-j-k-at-unga-completely-unacceptable-india-145389

We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero sum game,” Xi said in a video statement to the virtual gathering of world leaders. Reuters“We cannot fight today’s challenges with outdated structures without comprehensive reforms. The UN faces a crisis of confidence,” Modi said in a pre-recorded message.“For today’s interconnected world, we need a reformed multilateralism that reflects today’s realities, gives voice to all stakeholders, addresses contemporary challenges and focuses on human welfare,” Modi said.On Monday, the United Nations General Assembly committed itself to put “new life” into the stalled reform of the Security Council.Modi came in at number 104 in a line of more than 180 other country leaders who are turning up in set-piece frames to deliver more than 700 minutes of content.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump used the UN General Assembly on Tuesday to attack China’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying it must be held accountable for having “unleashed this plague onto the world”. By contrast, China's President Xi Jinping struck a conciliatory tone in his pre-recorded virtual address to the General Assembly, calling for enhanced cooperation over the pandemic. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-un-faces-confidence-crisis-must-fix-outdated-structures-145309

23-09-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Post-Doklam, Chinese LAC infra ‘doubled’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 22China’s rapid expansion of military infrastructure along the disputed boundary with India over the past two years points towards Beijing’s intention of engaging for a wider timeframe than the current or the recent standoffs between the two countries.This is the assessment of leading US-based think tank “Stratfor”. It released its report “A military drive spells out China’s intent along the Indian border” today. It talks about the threat of “sustained conflict”.“China’s intensified development of military infrastructure along the Indian border suggests a shift in Beijing’s approach to territorial disputes,” says the report, citing the 20-week-old standoff in Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).China appears to have shifted its strategic air objectives and doubled its number of airbases, air-defence positions and helicopter ports near the Indian border.A graphic, which forms part of the report, shows how Beijing’s expansion drive peaked in 2019 and 2020. After the Doklam crisis in June-August 2017, China started constructing at least 13 new military positions along the LAC, including three airbases, five permanent air-defence positions and five helicopter bases, four of the copter-bases have been constructed after the onset of the current Ladakh crisis in May.The Chinese military is building four air-defence positions (including additional runways and aircraft shelters) at existing airbases and other facilities. More air-defence systems and fighter jets have been added.This will force New Delhi to shape its future defence posturing around long-term outlook of China’s growing capabilities, the report says.“China’s strategy aims at confronting India with an insurmountable challenge in territorial disputes. Such an approach is similar to China’s strategy in the disputed South China Sea,” the report says.By forcing India to respond in kind, China’s aggressive strategy is leading to greater concentration of military assets in heavily disputed areas along the LAC and could raise the risk of potential escalations and sustained conflict.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-doklam-chinese-lac-infra-doubled-145311

23-09-2020||---||Opposition boycotts Parliament over farm Bills||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 22The Congress-led Opposition today intensified its agitation against the three farm-related Bills passed by Parliament and announced to boycott proceedings in both Houses till their demands were met.The TMC, AAP, Left, NC, NCP, BSP and TRS joined the Congress in boycott. They are demanding legal guarantee for the minimum support price (MSP) regime and assurance that the state agencies will honour MSP and the support prices will be determined in line with the MS Swaminathan committee report.With the Opposition deciding to boycott House proceedings, the eight suspended MPs on Tuesday ended their overnight sit-in inside the Parliament House complex and said they would now take their fight against the farm Bills to the streets.Although Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad had initially listed revocation of eight MPs’ suspension among the conditions to end boycott, he later said this was a request.Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, however, said the revocation of suspension could be considered if they regretted “their behaviour with House Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh”, who observed a daylong fast over the unsavoury developments.The Opposition boycott comes ahead of the September 25 Bharat Bandh call given by over 250 farmer outfits under the banner of All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Most parties have already planned to hold agitations to express solidarity with farmers. The Congress will get a petition against the Bills signed by 2 crore farmers and submit it to the President on November 14.“The government must bring a Bill declaring it illegal for private players to buy foodgrains below MSP and to say that the state agencies will honour the MSP besides declaring fixation of MSPs on the Swaminathan committee’s recommendations. We will boycott proceedings till these three conditions are met,” Azad said. The Congress added if presidential assent to the Bill comes through, an assurance from the PM or the Agriculture Minister should be made in Parliament about no private player being allowed to buy agricultural produce below MSP. The Congress is also mulling legal options over the manner in which the Bills were got passed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-boycotts-parliament-over-farm-bills-145259

The government has drafted four labour codes of which one — Code on Wages — has already become a law. There were 44 central labour laws in all, of which the government has repealed some.The codes propose minimum wages, social security and pay parity. A concern around the codes is these allow employers of units with less than 300 workers to terminate employment without prior notice. The threshold limit earlier was 100 workers.The RS, meanwhile, passed seven key Bills, including one that removes cereals, pulses and onion from the essential commodities’ list. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-clears-3-labour-codes-rajya-sabha-7-bills-145262
23-09-2020||There has been no let-up in the protests against the three farm Bills. It is the first time that the Narendra Modi-led NDA government has faced such resistance to any of its decisions. In an exclusive interview with Vibha Sharma of The Tribune||‘Oppn out to mislead, new laws will empower farmers’||Farmers say the Centre is leaving them at the mercy of corporates.The law is not against the APMC or traders/ arhtiyas. Farmers will have the freedom to sell the produce anywhere they want, likewise arhtiyas too can trade anywhere in the country using their PAN card. The law gives alternatives and freedom to both farmers and traders. It is a myth the Congress and Opposition are propagating to mislead them. The Farmers Empowerment and Protection Bill has the provision of an agreement at the time of sowing for deciding the price. The farmer will have the freedom to walk out of the agreement any time. The government, through the legislative route, is creating a framework that will not only open up more avenues for farmers to sell their produce but will also protect their interests.What if the buyer decides the produce is not up to the mark, and refuses to buy?He cannot do that. Rather the objection should come from corporates that while farmers are getting all the freedom, they are being tied up in law.Why is the government cutting out arhtiyas, who are considered the lifeline of rural economy?The law is not against the APMC or traders/arhtiyas. Farmers will have the freedom to sell the produce anywhere, likewise arhtiyas too can trade anywhere in the country without a licence and just by using their PAN card.Farmers say of the listed 23 crops, MSP is paid only on wheat, paddy and cotton.On Monday, we announced the MSP for six rabi crops, including wheat. The BJP-led NDA has given Rs 7 lakh crore in the past six years. We increased the MSP by one and a half times, which the UPA never did.What was the hurry to bring in new legislations?Reforms that happen today will benefit farmers from today, reforms that happen after a year will start showing results after a year. What we have done was recommended by MS Swaminathan, Sharad Joshi (late farm leader), Sharad Pawar (ex-Agriculture Minister) and the Congress.Farmers claim they were not involved in decision-making.If our intentions were wrong, there would have been the need to lobby. If we are making trade tax-free, why should anyone object? There is 8.5 per cent tax in Punjab mandis and we are giving the option of tax-free trade.Farmers fear power and fertiliser subsidies will be taken away.I want to assure farmers that no subsidy will be stopped. The government wants to ensure farmers’ income doubles by 2022. The MSP will remain, APMC will be alive, ‘inspector raj’ will go.Then why has SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur resigned? Was she and other stakeholders not consulted?These steps were not announced yesterday. They were taken after due deliberation. Everyone was well aware of the roadmap in freeing farmers from regulatory red tape.Do you feel Akali Dal left you at a time it should have stood by you?I want to tell all political parties that there should be no politics on issues related to farmers. We will talk to farmers to dispel misinformation.Should not there be a separate legislation for MSP?Why is there no separate law on MSP till date despite Congress ruling for 50 years. These laws are not about MSP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oppn-out-to-mislead-new-laws-will-empower-farmers-145264
