Six IAF personnel on board the chopper and a civilian on the ground were killed in the crash.The helicopter crashed in Budgam at around 10 am on February 27 when Indian and Pakistani fighter jets were engaged in fierce aerial combat in Nowshera, a day after India’s air strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot in Pakistan.The helicopter went down around 10 minutes after taking off.“Both the officers had challenged the court of inquiry as well as its findings on the grounds of violation of rule 156 sub clause two of air force rules,” Chibber said, adding they also questioned composition of the Court of Inquiry.He said the tribunal headed by Lt Gen Philip Campose (retd) and Justice Rajendra Menon found violations in formation of the CoI and directed that no action should be taken against the two officers. The next date of hearing in the case September 30.The probe had found that the ‘Identification of Friend or Foe’ (IFF) system on-board the helicopter was switched off and there were “vital gaps” in communication and coordination between the ground staff and the crew of the chopper.It also found violations of standard operating procedures. The IFF helps air defence radars identify whether an aircraft or helicopter is friendly or hostile.At his annual press conference on October 4 last year, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria had called the incident a “big mistake” and promised action against those found guilty.Following the incident, the IAF transferred the Air Officer Commanding (AOC) of Srinagar base to ensure a thorough probe into the incident. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shooting-down-of-mi-17-chopper-tribunal-stays-action-against-2-iaf-officers-141221
14-09-2020||New Delhi||Overall situation at friction points in eastern Ladakh unchanged, continues to be tense: Sources||The overall situation at friction points in eastern Ladakh remains unchanged and continues to be tense, four days after foreign ministers of India and China agreed on a five-point plan to resolve the prolonged border standoff, government sources said on Monday.The sources also said both the Indian and Chinese troops are firmly holding onto their respective positions at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).They said while the situation in the region continues to be tense no fresh movement of Chinese troops was witnessed.The Indian Army will not lower its guard and will maintain the current state of very high-level of combat readiness in eastern Ladakh till there are visible changes in the ground situation, the sources added.The sources said the date for the much-anticipated Corps commander-level talks between the two armies is yet to be firmed up but it is likely to take place in the next few days.The military talks are expected to focus on implementation of certain provisions of the five-point consensus to ease tensions.India and China reached an agreement to resolve their border row at a meeting between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow last Thursday on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet.The agreement included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.It also mentioned that the two sides should expedite work to conclude “new confidence building measures” to enhance peace and tranquillity in the border areas. However, the agreement has not mentioned any timeline for disengagement of troops.Meanwhile, Chinese envoy Sun Weidong, referring to consensus reached during previous talks between leaders of the two countries, said both sides should “pursue win-win cooperation” instead of “zero-sum game”.“I hope and believe that as long as the two sides earnestly implement the consensus reached by the two foreign ministers to the front-line troops and adhere to the correct means of dialogue and negotiation, the two sides will find a way to overcome the current difficulties,” Sun was quoted as saying by the Chinese embassy. He was commenting on the Jaishankar-Wang talks.The envoy further said: “As long as the two sides keep moving the relationship in the right direction building on the previous achievements, there will be no difficulty or challenge that can’t be overcome.”The five-point consensus at the Jaishankar-Wang talks came days after a fresh confrontation between the two armies early last week in eastern Ladakh that triggered a massive military build-up by both sides in almost all friction points along the LAC.The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have been locked in a tense standoff in multiple areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh since early May. Shots were fired across the LAC on Monday last for the first time in 45 years with the two sides accusing each other of firing in the air.In the five rounds of the Corps commander-level talks, the Indian side has been insisting on immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to April. The face-off in eastern Ladakh erupted on May 6.At the Jaishankar-Wang talks, the Indian delegation highlighted its strong concern over amassing of troops and military equipment by China along the LAC besides referring to “provocative behaviour” by Chinese army personnel at numerous incidents of friction.The Indian side clearly conveyed that it expected full adherence to all agreements on management of border areas and would not countenance any attempt to change the status quo unilaterally, according to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).Last week, the Army further bolstered its dominance over a number of strategic heights overlooking key Chinese-held positions around the Pangong lake area in eastern Ladakh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/overall-situation-at-friction-points-in-eastern-ladakh-unchanged-continues-to-be-tense-sources-141219

Places other than where idols will be kept should be left open from the top.“We have accepted their proposal and during the meeting with puja committees on September 25, we will hold further discussions,” Banerjee told reporters at the state secretariat.She said the board, headed by Nobel laureate Abhijeet Vinayak Banerjee, during a virtual meeting on Monday, lauded the state government for the way in which it has dealt with the pandemic.“It has expressed satisfaction on various grounds, including the increase in the number of COVID-19 beds and the rising number of sample tests,” Banerjee said.The board has also advised against reopening educational institutions in the state.The chief minister claimed that the coronavirus death rate in West Bengal has reduced to 1.94 per cent and her government is making efforts to lower it even more.“Out of the total deaths, 86 per cent are because of comorbidities. The death rate in our state has come down to 1.94 per cent (from around 9 per cent). We have to bring it down further and we will do it for sure,” she said.Banerjee also said the positivity rate in the state is 8.21 per cent, whereas it is 8.53 per cent across the country, while the discharge rate is 86.40 per cent against the national figure of around 77 per cent.

The video, which came from a security camera nearby, does not show the live wire, which is presumably covered by a puddle, but shows the woman stop and bend down to pick up something, and fall to the ground a minute later. She was killed instantly, the report said.The News Minute report quoted locals as having made several complaints to Tamil Nadu Electricity Board to have the snapped wire repaired, but they say nothing was done.“The wire snapped 25 days ago and the electricity was passing through the water. The EB is simply telling us to call other departments. There are 16 members in our apartment and even a small child got an electric shock recently,” the News Minute quoted a resident as saying.The portal also quotes another resident accusing the electricity board of taking calls made to inform them of the incident very casually. “We called the department and told them that a lady succumbed due to an electric shock and there was no proper response from there. Even the ambulance arrived only two hours later,” the resident told News Minute.   A 35-year-old woman died due to electrocution in Chennai's Pulianthope area due to an underground live wire that was snapped. Local residents say they had complained to EB several times but no action was taken.

14-09-2020||New Delhi||Former civil servants move SC against Sudershan TV show||Seven former civil servants have moved the Supreme Court to become parties to a pending plea seeking stay of telecast of Sudarshan TV’s ‘Bindas Bol’ programme on alleged “infiltration” of Muslim into bureaucracy.The Delhi High Court, on September 11, had declined to stay the telecast of the series of programmes, whose promo had claimed that the channel would show the ‘big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service’.Prior to this, the top court on August 28, had refused to restrain pre-broadcast ban on the channel from telecasting the programme while hearing a plea of lawyer Firoz Iqbal Khan.The former civil servants, including Amitabha Pande and Navrekha Sharma, have made an informal collective “Constitutional Conduct Group” and have filed the plea seeking to intervene in the pending petition of Khan.They said the apex court should lay down an authoritative pronouncement on “hate speech” in view of the fact that it had expressed an intention to consider the balance between free speech and other constitutional values in the instant case.The scope and meaning of hate speech should be decided so that the citizens, law enforcement authorities, and the courts have clarity on speech which is protected and the speech which falls outside such protection.“There is no bright line between hate speech and offensive speech. Each case requires the application of judicial mind,” it said.Earlier, the bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and K M Joseph had said it has to first “circumspect in imposing a prior restraint on publication or the airing of views”.“At this stage, we have desisted from imposing a pre-broadcast interlocutory injunction on the basis of an unverified transcript of a forty-nine seconds clip. The Court has to be circumspect in imposing a prior restraint on publication or the airing of views. We note that under statutory provisions, competent authorities are vested with powers to ensure compliance with law, including provisions of the criminal law intended to ensure social harmony and the peaceful coexistence of all communities,” the bench had said.The apex court had issued notices to the Centre, Press Council of India, News Broadcasters Association and Sudarshan News on a plea filed by advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan against the programme.The top court, which has posted hearing on September 15, had said that it will consider appointing amicus curiae to assist it towards a resolution which advances the protection of constitutional rights.The Delhi High Court is hearing a separate plea filed by former and present students of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) University challenging the nod given by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to Sudarshan News and its Editor-in-Chief Suresh Chavhanke to air the show.The High Court has also issued notices to the Centre and others on the petition.The High Court on August 28 had stayed the telecast of the programme which was scheduled the same evening.On August 29, it had disposed of the plea with a direction to the ministry to take a decision on the prohibition of the proposed Show pursuant to its August 28 show-cause notice.Later, the government and the High Court allowed the telecast. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-civil-servants-move-sc-against-sudershan-tv-show-141205

My heartfelt greetings to all linguists working for the language’s growth,” he said in a tweet.Hindi Diwas is observed on this day annually to commemorate the adoption of Hindi as one of the country’s official languages.Noting that Mahatma Gandhi had founded the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha in 1918, the vice president emphasised that Hindi and other Indian languages should be seen as complementary to each other.Naidu suggested that students from non-Hindi speaking states should learn the language and those from Hindi speaking states should learn one more Indian language such as Tamil, Telugu or Kannada so as to increase goodwill, love and affection among the citizens.Expressing happiness over the importance given to mother tongue in the New Education Policy-2020, the vice president called for providing education in mother tongue for inclusive learning.“This helps the children in learning and understanding the subject better and they are able to express themselves better,” he said.Noting that education in mother tongue would necessitate the easy availability of good books in Hindi and other Indian languages, Naidu  said publishing houses will have an important role in this.Underlining the need for all Indian languages to grow together, Naidu called upon the publishers and educators to work for enhancing dialogue between languages.

It is an insult to womenfolk”, though Roy kept insisting that he had not said anything unparliamentary.The government withdrew the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020, to add few things to give the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) a chance to be able to restructure distressed cooperative banks.  Meanwhile, Joshi introduced in Lok Sabha a bill that seeks to reduce for one year the salaries of Members of Parliament by 30 per cent “to meet the exigencies arising out of COVID-19 pandemic”. Speaking during the Zero Hour, actor-turned-politician Ravi Kishan demanded strict action against drug abusers in film world. “Conspiracy is being hatched to destroy country’s youth, our neighbouring countries are contributing.

14-09-2020||Hyderabad||Telangana brings new law doing away with approvals for construction||Residents of Telangana will no longer need any permission from municipal corporations and other urban bodies in urban areas for starting construction activity henceforth.The state Legislative Assembly on Monday passed revolutionary legislation that eliminates the need for permissions and waiting for approval of building plans after a self-certification that the activity would be in accordance with the permissible norms.The Telangana State Building Permission Approval and Self Certification System (TS-bPASS) Bill was passed by the Telangana House unanimously, ending decades of cumbersome procedures and corrupt practices.The Bill was introduced by Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao and was immediately passed without any objections.The minister said the TS-bPASS was a self-certification system to make citizens responsible and ensure that they adhere to the building and layout permission rules of the state government.As per the new law, people constructing a building within 75 square yards land need not obtain any permission from the authorities concerned. However, they must register with the urban local body using TS-bPASS. The citizens can also obtain instant permission for constructions on 75 square yards to 600 square yards through self-certification under TS-bPASS and commence their construction work without the need to pay bribes to get maps and building plans approved.However, for construction in lots of a size bigger than 600 square yards, the authorities concerned will examine the applications seeking permissions and issue necessary permissions within 21 days. In case of shortfall of any documents, the same will be intimated to the applicant within 10 days.Under the new Act, all municipalities including GHMC are mandated to clear all the building permit applications within the stipulated 21 days failing which the permission is deemed to have been approved.“Further, an automated certificate will be issued to the applicant with the signatures of relevant authorities including the municipal commissioner and the town planning officer on behalf of the municipality concerned, to enable them to obtain bank loans or other financial assistance,” Rao said.The occupancy certificates also will be issued within 15 days upon submitting relevant documents.According to the government, the objective of the new law is to “to reduce human interference and bring transparency in issuing building permissions as well as make citizens more responsible”.The authorities concerned were empowered to reject the application, in case of shortfall of documents or any irregularities. As a check, the new law empowers authorities to demolish the structure without any prior notice if the construction is unauthorised or illegal in any manner that includes construction on someone else’s land.Four Bills were introduced in the House today. Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) introduced the Telangana Rights in Land and Pattadar Passbooks Bill 2020 and the Telangana Abolition of the Posts of Village Revenue Officers Bill 2020.Earlier the Municipal Administration Minister had introduced the Telangana Municipal Laws Amendment Bill 2020. The Panchayat Raj Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao introduced the Telangana Panchayat Raj Amendment Bill 2020 in the Assembly.The objective of the Revenue Bill, KCR said was that it will help to achieve corruption less, hassle-free registration and mutation through Dharani Portal.“The VROs lost their relevance. They have misused their power and we can’t be mute spectators. But there are people who say that we are bringing the Act for few landlords. But there are no lands; there are only 0.11 per cent farmers who have more than 50 acres of lands that too in the form of orchards etc. Over 98.38 per cent of farmers have landholdings less than 10 acres,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-brings-new-law-doing-away-with-approvals-for-construction-141191

14-09-2020||New Delhi||MSP will stay, farmers will get investment, technology, Centre on farm sector Bills||The Centre on Monday introduced three Bills in Lok Sabha on farm sector with Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar asserting that they will help farmers get a remunerative price for their produce as well as private investments and technology.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar introduced The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, which will replace ordinances promulgated by the government earlier.He said the proposed laws will enable barrier-free trade in agricultural produce, and also empower farmers to engage with investors of their choice.The minister said that these steps are only the latest in a series of measures taken by the government as part of its continuous commitment to championing the cause of welfare of the farmers of India.Tomar said that almost 86 per cent of farmers have agricultural land of less than two hectares and they are often unable to benefit from minimum support price (MSPs).He, however, assured the House that the MSP will stay.The Congress and other parties have been opposing the legislations, alleging it will undermine the safety net provided to the farmers by the MSP system and will lead to their exploitation by big companies.Tomar said the bill will help the farmers as they are unable to invest much in their farm and do not attract investments from others.He also rejected the criticism that it was beyond the remit of the union government to legislate on these issues, saying opposition members should trust the Centre.The Opposition has accused the Centre of having brought in the laws without consulting the states under whose domain ‘agriculture’ and ‘mandis’ come.The minister asked the opposition members to study the content of the bills deeply before “running to oppose them”.He stressed that farmers will get a lot of benefit from these laws as they can enter into an agreement with private traders for selling their produce.These agreements will be about the produce and not the farmland, he asserted, rebutting suggestions that farmers may lose ownership of their land.Opposing the bills, the leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said constitutional provisions are very clear that agriculture is a subject on the State List.“Such a law can only be brought by state governments.... Through this bill, the centre will nullify Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) law enacted by various state governments,” Chowdhury said.The central government is not competent to make such a law, he asserted, adding,”This is a case of legislative overreach and a direct attack on the federal structure of the Constitution.” Chowdhury pointed out that farmers of Punjab and Haryana are protesting against these bills.TMC member Saugata Roy claimed that farming will move into the hands of capitalists due to these legislations.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said the bill violates the basic tenets of federalism enshrined in India’s Constitution.“It is beyond the legislative competence of this house to enact any law on agriculture, which is a domain of the state governments,” Tharoor said   The bill endangers the right to food of the countrymen, he added.The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, bars state governments from imposing taxes on sale and purchase of farm produce undertaken outside the mandis and give farmers the freedom to sell their produce at remunerative prices.Besides, any conflicts arising from the transactions will be dealt with exclusively by the Sub Division Magistrate (SDM) and District Collectorate within 30 days and not in the jurisdiction of civil courts.At present, farmers are allowed to sell their agriculture produce at 6,900-odd APMC (Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees) mandis spread across the nation. There are restrictions for farmers in selling agri-produce outside the mandis.The ordinances were promulgated on June 5, 2020. However, the Union Agriculture Ministry notified them on July 20.

14-09-2020||Patna||Lalu missing from poster, 'yuva' Tejashwi lords over party||Visitors to the RJD headquarters in Bihar capital feel intrigued by a new election poster put up in front of the premises, gigantic in dimensions but without an image of its larger than life founding president Lalu Prasad.Prasad’s younger son and heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav, who will be leading the opposition Grand Alliance as its chief ministerial candidate, finds a pride of place on the huge rectangular sheet with a yellow background which promises nayi soch, naya Bihar (a new Bihar with a new vision).He features in the poster alone.The poster has Tejashwi Yadav’s photograph, looking resolute with arms across the chest, as a blue-coloured map of Bihar forms the background.The second line of the election slogan coined by the party, ‘yuva sarkar, abki baar’, is shorn of the earthy imaginativeness that was characteristic of Prasad.It also sounds like a straight lift from the slogan ‘abki baar, Modi sarkaar’ of 2014, which had caught the natio’ns attention and helped the BJP achieve unprecedented electoral success.Old-timers, however, seem not impressed with the idea of dropping from the RJD poster its jailed supremo who is acknowledged, across party lines, as the biggest crowd puller ever seen in Bihar’s political arena.Lalu floated RJD as a splinter group of the Janata Dal he was heading in 1997. Since then the party has been synonymous with his persona.“All members of his family, be it his wife Rabri Devi, whose tenure as chief minister was longer than that of her husband, or their sons....they are nothing more than a pale shadow of the party chief who is, ironically, the party’s biggest asset as well as liability,” said an old associate of Prasad, lodged in judicial custody in Ranchi, told PTI.Wanting not to be named, he pointed out how the once powerful RJD drew a blank in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when Prasad was behind bars in Jharkhand capital after his conviction in fodder scam cases.NDA leaders also scoffed at the “belated” attempt by the RJD at an “image makeover” by leaving Prasad out of the poster.They also said if Prasad came out of jail, it will benefit the NDA more than the RJD.The NDA, which rules the Centre as well as Bihar, has often been accused of trying to hinder Lalu Prasad’s release from jail ahead of the assembly polls. “While this betrays the RJD’s complete ignorance of, and disrespect for, legal processes, let me also add that if he comes out during elections, it is us and not they who will stand to gain,” Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi had said.The Deputy CM thereafter went on to recount the lawlessness, corruption and economic stagnation that the 15-year-long Lalu-Rabri rule had come to symbolise, and asserted that memories of those days were alive like festering wounds in the state’s collective psyche.With Lalu out in the open, people will automatically recoil in horror and come rushing towards the NDA as nobody wants that dark era to return, he had told a party meeting a few days ago that was also attended by BJP national president J P Nadda.Die-hard Lalu loyalists, however, still feel that the party supremo’s charisma matters.They fondly recollect how the RJD clinched 80 of the state’s 243 assembly seats while contesting the 2015 polls in alliance with Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), the Congress and some other smaller parties. Lalu was then not in jail and had extensively campaigned for the Grand Alliance.With Lalu Prasad in jail and a key satrap like Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, a former union minister and an influential Rajput leader, dead, it remains to be seen if Tejashwi, as projected in the poster, can steer the party out of the woods in the state elections that are likely in October-November.

BJP has one RS MP from the state.The BJD had in 2018 too supported Singh in the election for Rajya Sabha deputy chairman post. Singh had then defected Congress’s BK Hariprasad and became the RS deputy chairman.The post, however, fell vacant after Singh’s term in the Rajya Sabha expired in April, 2020. He has now been re-elected to it and is contesting again for the same post.Opposition Congress has criticised the BJD for its support to Singh. BJD’s real face has again been revealed after it declared support to the NDA candidate for the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman election.BJD has been supporting BJP in all issues and they are one party, Odisha PCC president Niranjan Patnaik said in a video message.He accused the regional party of misleading the people of Odisha and said, “The BJD has all along been supporting BJP even though it talks about maintaining equal distance from both the BJP and the Congress.In fact, there is no difference between the BJD and the BJP, the OPCC president asserted.

14-09-2020||New Delhi||Centre introduces farm sector reform Bills in Parliament amid protests||Lok Sabha on Monday decided to do away with Question Hour and private members' business during the Monsoon session, inviting strong criticism from opposition members who accused the government of stifling democracy.The first day of the Monsoon Session on Monday saw Opposition leaders challenging the government on many issues in the Lok Sabha, including the scrapping of the Question Hour and the introduction of the three agriculture related legislations to replace the Ordinances promulgated amid the Covid-lockdown in June. The lower house adopted the motion to suspend Question Hour, with the government maintaining that it is not running away from discussion and will reply to all questions raised by the opposition.During the four-hour plus Session, which included an adjournment of an hour following obituary references to former President Pranab Mukherjee and other sitting and former MPs and Pandit Jasraj who passed away recently, the Lok Sabha also cleared two Bills---the National Commission for Homeopathy Bill, 2020, and the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine Bill, 2020. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi, who moved the motionto suspend question hour, maintained that the government was "not running away will reply to all questions raised by the Opposition". “There are so many ways to question the government," Joshi said, adding that before arriving at this decision deputy leader in the Lok Sabha and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had spoke to leaders of all parties and majority had agreed. “I would like to tell leaders who questioned the suspension of Question Hour that all state assemblies including Punjab, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, have run sessions for a day or two and passed several bills. We (Government of India) have decided to run Parliament for 18 days and hold discussion on bills,” Joshi said. He also added that in past five years 60 per cent of Question Hour in Rajya Sabha and 40 per cent in Lok Sabha was wasted. The house also debated three farm Bills---the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution Raosaheb Patil Danve the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020---that Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar introduced in the Lok Sabha to replace exist ordinancess. Responding to accusations that through these measures the government was planning to do away with the Minimum Support Price (MSP), Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the support price will stay “now and forever” and added that on the contrary the measures will enable barrier-free trade and empower farmers to engage with investors of their choice. The development came on a day farmers organisations registered protests on the streets and also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to withdraw the three “anti-farmer” Ordinances.Several members of the opposition, including Congress leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari and Jalandhar MP Santokh Singh Choudhary protested the Bill. The opposition also accuses the government of "destroying the federal structure and farmers by giving the agriculture sector into the hands of a few corporates and doing away with the support price completely”.The measures seek to creation an ecosystem where the farmers and traders enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale and purchase of farmers' produce, the Agriculture Minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-introduces-farm-sector-reform-bills-in-parliament-amid-protests-141156

Following this, several reports suggested that the brother-sister duo was planning to apply in High Court today. Their lawyer has now set the record straight by issuing a statement.“Even if we get a copy of the order today, we are not in a hurry and moving immediately. We will study the order, its implications and developments in the case at the NCB level and then decide. There’s no room for speculation. Once it is filed, we will share a copy of the bail application,” said Maneshinde.Rhea, who was Sushant Singh Rajput’s girlfriend, has been held by the NCB after being charged under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act for her alleged role in the drugs angle that has emerged during an investigation into the June 14 death of Sushant.Rhea, in her earlier bail plea, had alleged that she was “coerced” into making “self-incriminating confessions” during her interrogations by the NCB for three days this week and maintained that she had not committed any crime whatsoever but had been falsely framed in the case.Retracting her “self-incriminating confessions”, she termed her arrest as “unwarranted, without any justification” and one that “arbitrarily curtailed her liberty”. She added that she faced death and rape threats and that there were no female officers present during her interrogation, which took place from September 6 to 8 with her arrest coming on the final day.

14-09-2020||New Delhi||Same-sex marriages not recognised by our laws, society and our values: Centre to Delhi HC||The Centre on Monday told the Delhi High Court that marriage between same-sex couples was “not permissible” as it is not recognised by “our laws, legal system, society and our values”.The submission was made before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan by Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta during the hearing of a PIL seeking a declaration that same-sex marriages be recognised under the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) and the Special Marriage Act.The Delhi High Court on Monday posted a petition seeking allowance of registration of same-sex marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act on October 21 while directing the petitioner to make certain amendments to the plea.File a civil miscellaneous application by the next date of hearing in order to amend the petition. The matter is adjourned on October 21,” said a division bench of the high court presided by Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan while hearing a petition filed by Abhijit Iyer Mitra.It asked the lawyer appearing for the petitioner, Abhijit Iyer Mitra, to give details of the persons who were not permitted to register their same-sex marriage.During the course of hearing, Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, while opposing the petition, said the Hindu Marriage Act requires are ‘man’ and a ‘woman’ for the marriage. However, the arguments of the counsel of the petitioner were that the said gender specification isn’t there in the said Act.The Solicitor-General while clarifying that it was his personal stand said that same-sex marriage wasn’t permitted in our culture, however, stated that he was yet to receive adequate instructions regarding the said petition from the government.“The Solicitor-General only de-criminalised homosexuality nothing more or less,” the petitioner said further.Mehta opposed the relief sought in the petition saying “our laws, our legal system, our society and our values do not recognise a marriage, which is a sacrament, between same-sex couples”.He said the plea to grant recognition to or permit registration of such marriages was “not permissible” for two reasons — firstly, the petition was asking the court to legislate and secondly, any relief granted “would run contrary to various statutory provisions”.“Unless court does violence to various laws, this cannot be done,” he added.Mehta also said under the HMA, the various provisions regulating marriages or prohibited relationships talk of husband and wife and therefore, who would be assigned these roles where a same-sex couple was concerned.The bench observed that worldover things were changing but it may or may not be applicable to India.It, however, questioned the need for a PIL in the instant case, saying the people who claim to be affected are well educated and can themselves approach the court.“Why should we entertain the PIL,” it added.The counsel for the petitioner stated that the affected people were not coming forward themselves as they feared reprisals and therefore, a PIL was preferred.With the direction to place these factual aspects before the court, the bench listed the matter for further hearing on October 21.The petition has contended that despite the Supreme Court decriminalising consensual homosexual acts, marriages between same-sex couples was still not possible.The PIL said nothing in the Hindu Marriage Act mandated that a marriage take place only between a Hindu man and a Hindu woman. It further pointed out that in 2018, the Supreme Court read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised homosexuality.“The non-recognition of the rights of gay couples, especially when their sexuality has been recognised as such as valid by the Honourable Supreme Court of India is violative of various provisions of the Constitution of India as well as various conventions that India as a sovereign state is a signatory to,” the petition stated.“...the denial of this right to homosexual couples is also against the mandate of various international conventions that India is a signatory to. Finally, the eponymous Golden Rule of Interpretation also states that plain meaning has to be imparted to words in a statute unless such interpretation were to lead to an absurdity,” it said further.

14-09-2020||Patna||Rare archives unravel Patna Collectorate link to landmark World War II event||Prayers were offered in temples, mosques and churches, and the poor were fed in the campus of the historic Patna Collectorate as part of events held in the city in September 1943 to celebrate the surrender of Italy during the World War II, according to archival documents.On September 8, 1943, US Army Gen. Dwight Eisenhower had publicly announced the surrender of Italy to the Allies. Indian soldiers had played a critical role in both World Wars.According to the archival documents, the Patna District War Committee had organised a host of events on September 11 to mark this landmark event in history, from morning till evening.Going by the rare private collection of the Jalan family of the legendary Quila House in Patna City, the programme for the celebrations of the victory of the United Nations (Allied powers) over Italy began with prayers offered in "temples, mosques and churches" and flags hoisted on all public buildings from 7.30-8.30 am.This was followed by "feeding of the poor in the Patna Collectorate Compound from 10 am to 12 noon".Ironically, the historic Patna Collectorate complex -- Dutch-era Record Room and Old District Engineer's Office and British-era DM Office Building and District Board Patna Building -- is planned to be soon demolished by the Bihar government after the Patna High Court in a judgement lifted the interim stay on demolition of the buildings imposed by a bench of the court in September last year.Delhi-based Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) had filed two PILs on August 30 last year, seeking revoking of the demolition order originally proposed in 2016 and constitution of the Bihar Urban Arts and Heritage Commission, pending since 2012.The heritage commission set up on the directions of the court had recommended demolition of this centuries-old landmark despite opposition from heritage experts and a large number of citizens.The Patna High Court verdict has come as a big jolt to historians, conservation architects and many other heritage lovers and experts who have been pleading the Bihar government to not demolish the historic Collectorate, and preserve and restore it as a "rare signpost of history" while linking it to the heritage tourism circuit in the state.Aditya Jalan, 43, the current scion of the Jalan family, said this hitherto unknown connection of the Patna Collectorate to the World War II has come to light thanks to a rare invitation card of 1943 addressed to his great grandfather Dewan Bahadur Radha Krishna Jalan, he accidentally found while going through his family archives recently."It is interesting, we found the documents related to a WW2 event when its 77th anniversary just happened," he said.Aditya said he wants to share these "nuggets of history" with people and on August 15 had launched a page on Facebook and Instagram to make history more appealing to them.Scotland-based researcher Paula Gonzaga de Sa, who curates the posts on the page, said finding the Patna Collectorate's link to the WW2 was such a "priceless find" and it unravelled an "important piece of history" of the city."This same week, 77 years ago, there were celebrations in Patna following the surrender of the fascist government of Italy during a turning point in World War II. It is touching to see that one of the highlights of these celebrations was a feeding of the poor in the Patna Collectorate compound," she told PTI.There is another archival document (letter), from August 10, 1917 - another time of war (World War I) - telling about the Patna Collectorate's staff being intensely involved in organising and distributing food supplies for people affected by monsoon floods in the area, Paula said.The letter was written by then Patna Collector J F Gruning, to R K Jalan, a well-known personality, she said."This all points to the important role that the Patna Collectorate, whatever maybe its other functions, played in the community and social fabric of Patna throughout its history.This is a heritage of social participation and inclusiveness that it is fitting to preserve, share, highlight and make available for present and future generations," Paula said.An important historical link and a piece of history will be lost forever if it is demolished, she rued.Describing more about the rare 1943 invitation card issued by "J. A. Walmsley, Chairman" of the Patna District War Committee, she said the public meeting was held in the evening that day at 7.30 pm at Sinha Institute (Sinha Library campus).The meeting was to be addressed by Sir Sultan Ahmad, a noted barrister, and Member of Information and Broadcasting in the Governor-General's Executive Council, and other speakers.There was a Police Parade at Bankipore Maidan (now Gandhi Maidan) in the evening preceded by "procession of Boy Scouts, Civic Guards, and A. R. P. workers" to the maidan, the invite said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rare-archives-unravel-patna-collectorate-link-to-landmark-world-war-ii-event-141115

The Hindi language was first adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the official language on this day in 1949. Hindi is spoken by around 258 million people and is recognised as the fourth ‘most spoken’ language in the world.On Hindi Diwas, Prime Minister Modi took to Twitter and wished the people. “...Hearty congratulations to all the linguists who contributed to the development of Hindi...,” the Prime Minister wrote in Hindi.हिन्दी दिवस पर आप सभी को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं। इस अवसर पर हिन्दी के विकास में योगदान दे रहे सभी भाषाविदों को मेरा हार्दिक अभिनंदन।  Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday said India’s linguistic diversity is its strength as well as a symbol of unity and the new education policy provides for parallel development of Hindi and other Indian languages.In a series of tweets and a video message in Hindi, on the occasion of Hindi Divas, Shah said Hindi was an unbreakable part of Indian culture and it had been an effective and powerful medium of national unity and identity since the freedom struggle.“Today, on the occasion of Hindi Divas, I salute all those who have contributed to its empowerment. I also call upon the countrymen to take a pledge to contribute more in the protection and promotion of Hindi along with their mother tongue.

He was 85.Mahato, known for taking the centuries-old folk dance form of Purulia district to the world, died at his Belgara village on Sunday evening, they said.He is survived by his wife and son, who is also a Chhau dancer.Popularly known as Dhunda Mahato, he had established a unique Chhau dance form combining different elements like aggression and surrender, joy and sorrow into one single composition.Mahato inherited the passion for Chhau dance from his father Pelaram Mahato.He dropped out of school and started practising Chhau at the age of 13.Mahato followed the classical form of Chhau dance, using accompanying musical instruments such as dhamsa and shenai during his seven decades-long career.He believed using the acoustic effects of instruments like synthesizer will dilute the ‘earthiness’ of his art.Mahato had received awards from the Adivasi Lok Sanskriti Bikash Parishad, West Bengal Veterinary Association and Manbhum Dalit Sahitya o Sanskriti Akademi.He, however, had not received any major recognition from the West Bengal and Central Governments despite being a household name in the Chhau circles in the state and elsewhere.

He died on Sunday morning.Digambar was "brought dead" to the hospital on August 12, it said.The Sion Hospital conducted postmortem of both on Sunday and the bodies were kept in the medical facility's mortuary, the BMC said in a release.Sarvade's family members had informed that they will collect the body around 4 pm. In the meantime, Digambar's family members identified Sarvade's body like his and collected it with "police signature" following all due procedures, the civic body said.The error came to light when Sarvade's relatives came to collect his body. By that time, Digamber's family had performed the last rites of Sarvade, it said.Later, Sarvade's angry family members created ruckus in the hospital, but police intervened and brought the situation under control, the civic body said.

SP’s Mulayam Singh was also absent.In the second row sat NC patron Farooq Abdullah, his first Lok Sabha visit since release from home detention in Kashmir.MPs sporting masks of varied descriptions added colour to the otherwise staid surroundings but the trademark energy of the lower house was missing after Speaker Om Birla declared the proceedings open.He too wore a mask, removing it only to pay condolences to Pranab Mukherjee, doyen of Indian classical music Pt Jasraj, sitting MP A Vasanth Kumar and 13 former MPs, including Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal’s father Gurdas Badal, a former member of the Lok Sabha.The commencement of the proceedings was sombre with the house remembering its old members, especially Pranab Mukherjee whose photographic memory and encyclopaedic knowledge of Indian political history was part of Om Birla’s glowing tributes to the late leader.As per recent practice initiated by the ruling NDA of not adjourning the house for the day after obituary references, the Speaker adjourned the proceedings for an hour after which two health-related bills are expected to be taken up in the Lok Sabha.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan was in the Lok Sabha and was seen making preparations to pilot the bills.Among prominent absentees on day one were Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi, both away to the US.Most Punjab MPs were present, including the newly appointed Congress whip in Lok Sabha Ravneet Bittu, Manish Tewari, Santokh Choudhry, Gurjit Aujla and Amar Singh.Some new Lok Sabha MPs watched the house proceedings from the visitors’ galleries on the first floor where they were seated to maintain the mandatory social distance in the Lok Sabha chamber.Overall, Parliament wore a deserted look on day one with sparsely visited compounds and galleries bearing witness to these unprecedented times.A few MPs did seem to break the two-yard distance rule inside the chamber for some time to catch up on old times when the Speaker adjourned the house for an hour.That apart, physical distance was the flavour of the day as Parliament proceedings rolled on.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/masks-shields-distance-new-look-lok-sabha-meets-under-looming-covid-shadow-141091

14-09-2020||Washington||Trump claims Modi told him he had done a great job in Covid testing||US President Donald Trump has claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised him for doing a great job in coronavirus testing, as he continued to slam his Democratic opponent Joe Biden for being a complete disaster in handling the swine flu during the previous administration."By far, we've tested more people than India, than many, many big countries put together. India is second (in coronavirus testing after the US). We're 44 million tests ahead of India. They have 1.5 billion people. And Prime Minister Modi calls me and says, what a job you've done with testing," Trump said at an election rally in Reno, Nevada.Trump is currently making a swing of some of the key states in the West Coast and has been spending a considerable amount of time in Nevada. The President said that Modi's comment on testing being done by the US needed to be explained to the media, which is after him over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic."I said, explain that to these dishonest people (media people) back (at the election rally). Biden's record demonstrates that if he had been in charge, when the China virus arrived, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. As vice president, he presided over the worst and the weakest and the slowest economic recovery, since the great depression,” Trump said.Trump said it was the most pathetic recovery, since the depression. “No state was hit harder by Biden's failure than Nevada. This is not the guy you want,” he said.Trump said that he had spent the last four years bringing jobs back to America, securing borders, rebuilding the military and standing up to China, like never before."Nobody had ever stood up to China like we have stood up to China and you haven't seen the last of it,” he said.Biden, if he wins, would be controlled by the left radicals. “Now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins,” Trump said. “If Biden wins the rioters win, the anarchists win, the flag burners, the anarchists...they all win,” he alleged.Alleging that this is a rigged election, Trump said that this is the only way he could be defeated. “But I'll tell you what, he (Biden) is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. He doesn't know he's alive. He doesn't know he's alive,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trump-claims-modi-told-him-he-had-done-a-great-job-in-covid-testing-141086

Women and children were made to block the roads under the Jafrabad metro station on February 23 to create tension amidst the neighbourhood people, FIR said.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

It can set the course for peace or the ongoing hostilities will continue.As Lt General-level talks are set to resume anytime this week, the two sides will literally start from scratch as the previous five meetings between June 6 and August 2 ended in failure. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China backtracked on agreements to de-escalate and disengage on the LAC.S Jaishankar Foreign MinisterAccept multipolarityThe key to more settled Sino-Indian ties is acceptance by both nations of multipolarity and mutuality.In these six weeks, since August 2, dynamics have changed on multiple counts. Firstly, bullets were fired on September 7, the first time in Ladakh since November 1962. Secondly, there have been fresh areas of confrontation like the 70-km stretch along the southern part of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake. Thirdly, a lack of trust has crept in. The Indian Army will opt for a wait-and-watch strategy while assessing the PLA motives.There are other flashpoints along the 826-km-LAC in Ladakh —- Depsang plains, north bank of Pangong Tso and Patrolling Point 17-A (in Gogra). Meanwhile, at the South Block, the Army headquarters, the process to cater to the logistics— accommodation, provisions, clothing— has been set in motion.Even if the two sides agree on peace, India cannot pull back its 45,000 force from Ladakh immediately. In case of fresh confrontation, there will be a problem as the Manali and Srinagar routes will for four months from October onwards. While Zoji La (11,500 feet) on the Srinagar route may be closed to traffic by October-end or early November, Rohtang Pass (13,000 feet) on the Manali route may see snow before that. Other high passes between Rohtang and Leh may also see early closure.Once the passes close, the only option is to fly out men and supplies from the logistics hub in Chandigarh or Hindon. Also it takes two weeks to acclimatise for battle at those heights, so it will be better to retain the troops in Ladakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-dynamics-altered-coming-talks-crucial-for-winter-strategy-140975

Road projects were frowned upon and people used to ask what do these have to offer those who walk on foot and do not have vehicles, Modi said in a veiled reference to Lalu Prasad, who used to project himself as a luddite.The Prime Minister said Nitish’s efforts would take Bihar and East India on the path of development.He inaugurated the 193-km extension of the LPG pipeline from Durgapur in West Bengal to Banka in Bihar and two LPG bottling plants in Banka and in East Champaran’s HarsiddhiLast week, the Prime Minister launched the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana, e-Gopala app and several initiatives linked to research in fisheries production, dairy, animal husbandry and agriculture in the poll-bound state.2 bottling plants inauguratedPM Narendra Modi inaugurated the 193-km extension of the LPG pipeline from Durgapur in West Bengal to Banka in Bihar and two LPG bottling plants in Banka and in East Champaran’s Harsiddhi.Without naming the opposition RJD or its leader Lalu Prasad, and the party’s ally — the Congress — Modi blamed the states backwardness on a mindset which made them sneer at economic progress and thought lip-service was enough when it came to the betterment of the poor.Infrastructure has improved. New medical and engineering colleges, law institutes and polytechnics have come up. Nitish Kumar has a very important role to play in ensuring that the process continues, he said.Referring to the Covid pandemic and the large-scale return of migrants that took place during the lockdown, Modi said: “The crisis gave us opportunities. We can think of new employment generation avenues by setting in motion rapid economic activity.”The BJP has declared it will contest the assembly polls in Bihar with Kumar as the coalition's chief ministerial face.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pms-largesse-projects-worth-rs-900-cr-for-poll-bound-bihar-141001

A grassroots leader, he had a unique ability to understand the needs of the poor.The brains behind the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA), Raghuvanshbabu, passed away on Sunday after prolonged illness. The five-time Lok Sabha MP was admitted to AIIMS for post-Covid care, but had to be put on ventilator after his condition deteriorated on Saturday.Raghuvanshbabu represented the Vaishali constituency in Bihar for five consecutive terms, losing his last two elections in 2014 and 2019 after the Modi-led NDA swept the state twice.He is widely credited for the success of MGNREGA, which for the Congress proved an electoral plank in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections.UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi always held him in high esteem, as party insiders say she had even offered him to become the PCC president in Bihar, which he turned down, saying he had spent all his life in the RJD and would prefer to remain with it.In UPA-I, MGNREGA was first given to the Labour Ministry to formulate and implement. But even after a year, nothing was done, while the North Block and the Yojana Bhavan argued against the initiative.But the UPA chairperson wanted it to happen, and so she roped in Raghuvanshbabu, who in one of the Union Cabinet meetings had suggested that the scheme be given to the Rural Development Ministry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/the-man-behind-mgnrega-141002

The village is around 80 km from Gaya city and is surrounded by a forest area.20-year toilVishnupat Bhokta, village headIn August 2001, Loungi Bhuiyan decided to dig a canal from a natural water source. He did a survey of the land and earmarked the canal route. The administration has named it Loungi Canal.Since there were no job avenues except agriculture, a large number of village youths migrated to bigger cities in search of livelihood. Bhuiya was unhappy that mostly women and children were left behind in his village.Village head Vishnupat Bhokta said, “In August 2001, he decided to dig a canal from a natural water source in Bagetha Sahwasi forest to the village. Bhuiyan knew the water source was enough to irrigate the agricultural land of villagers. However, it was a great challenge to bring water into the village.” “Bhuiyan did a survey of the land and earmarked the canal route. After working relentlessly for 20 years, he managed to dig the canal, which is 4-ft wide and 3-ft deep,” said Bhokta. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-man-digs-5-km-canal-to-bring-water-to-his-village-141007
