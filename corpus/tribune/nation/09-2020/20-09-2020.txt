It seems people have misunderstood unlock processes with and have become relaxed thinking everything is fine. They must remember that COVID appropriate conduct is important. Hands must be kept away from the face. Masks are a must and so is physical distance. I appeal to MPs to help launch a campaign for public awareness regarding COVID appropriate behaviour and to enforce the same in their respective constituencies. If we can end laxity in our behaviour, the fight against COVID can be won quickly. We have to break the chain of COVID transmission,” said Vardhan replying to a nearly five-hour debate in Lok Sabha on COVID-19.The minister said the national lockdown was helpful as five independent studies have shown.“Lockdown prevented cases and deaths at a time when the situation was critical,” he said.Vardhan also said 145 COVID vaccine candidates worldwide were in pre clinical evaluation and 35 in clinical stage. “In India, 30 vaccines have been supported and of these three are in advanced human trials stages and more than four are in pre clinical stages. India has planned ahead for vaccine distribution as and when it is available.”The minister added that India was now conducting 12 lask tests a day and has developed the capacity to produce 10 lakh test kits daily.“We have evaluated 870 kits and recommended 420 and 308 are in use,” Vardhan said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/societys-irresponsible-behaviour-behind-rapid-covid-spread-harsh-vardhan-144083
20-09-2020||New Delhi||Hong Kong bars Air India flights till Oct 3 after passengers test positive for COVID-19||Hong Kong has banned Air India flights from Sunday to October 3 after a few passengers on its flight on Friday tested positive for COVID-19 post arrival, a senior government official said on Sunday.Air India passenger flights were barred from landing in Hong Kong between August 18 and August 31 after 14 passengers on its Delhi-Hong Kong flight of August 14 tested positive for COVID-19 post arrival.Passengers from India can arrive in Hong Kong only if they have a COVID-19 negative certificate from a test done within 72 hours prior to the journey, according to rules issued by the Hong Kong government in July.Moreover, all international passengers are required to undergo a post-flight COVID-19 test at the Hong Kong airport.A spokesperson of the national carrier confirmed the recent order, saying, “Hong Kong has prohibited Air India for two weeks—September 20 to October 3”.“There is only one flight scheduled in the two weeks—the Delhi-Hong Kong flight of September 21. That flight is cancelled and the passengers have been informed,” the spokesperson added.Air India Express had on Friday said its flights were suspended for 24 hours by the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) for bringing two passengers with COVID-positive certificates on August 28 and September 4.Air India Express, which is a subsidiary of Air India, resumed its Dubai flights on Saturday.According to rules in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), every passenger travelling from India is required to bring an original COVID-negative certificate of an RT-PCR test done within 96 hours prior to the journey.“A few passengers on a September 18 Delhi-Hong Kong flight tested positive for COVID-19 post arrival,” the senior government official said.“As a result, Air India’s flights have been banned from September 20 to October 3 by the Hong Kong government,” the official added.Besides India, a pre-flight COVID-19 negative certificate is mandatory for all passengers from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa and the US, according to the Hong Kong government’s rules.An airline operating a flight to Hong Kong from any of these nine countries has to submit a form before departure, stating that all passengers on board have COVID-19 negative certificates.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic.However, special international flights have been operating with the approval of aviation regulator DGCA.Air India has been operating special international flights since May 6 under the Vande Bharat Mission to help stranded people reach their destinations.Since July, India has established separate bilateral air bubble arrangements with countries such as the US, Germany, France, the UAE, the UK and the Maldives for international flight operations.Under a bilateral air bubble pact, the airlines of both countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions.

20-09-2020||New Delhi||Findings of serosurvey in containment zones in 10 cities communicated to states for further actions: ICMR||The findings of a serosurvey in dynamic containment zones in 10 cities to assess the extent of COVID-19 transmission have been communicated to the respective states for further action, the ICMR said on Sunday and added that the second round of a countrywide serosurvey has been successfully completed.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) comment comes following media reports of health researchers, apparently under instructions from senior ICMR officials, alleging that they were not allowed to include data from containment zones in 10 hotspot cities in the first national serosurvey study paper published recently.“ICMR has been continuously communicating with the respective state authorities. The findings of the previous survey from the dynamic containment zones were communicated to the states for further action,” the apex health research body tweeted on Sunday.“The second round of countrywide serosurvey led by ICMR has been successfully completed. The final phase analysis of the survey is now underway and will offer a comparison with the results of the first survey,” it said in an another tweet.To further aid in developing state intervention plans, following the nationwide survey, states have also conducted their zone/city-specific surveys, the ICMR said.According to media reports, 15 to 48 per cent of the populations sampled in containment zones in 10 hotspot cities had been exposed to the coronavirus infection, with Ahmedabad’s containment zone having the highest seropositivity level, several researchers involved in the survey said.The findings of the first national serosurvey conducted by ICMR, published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research earlier this month, indicated that 0.73 per cent of adults in India were exposed to SARS-CoV-2, amounting to 6.4 million infections in total by early May.

It rose to 25,55,007 on Sunday.The case positivity rate during the last 24 hours was 7.27 per cent while the cumulative positivity rate was 9.66 per cent.The number of active cases increased by over 190 percent in the city since mid-August. There were 11,068 active COVID-19 cases on August 18 which increased to 32,097 on Sunday.

20-09-2020||New Delhi||Health Ministry ‘mulls’ gathering data on suspected COVID-19 re-infection cases||Taking note of instances of suspected COVID-19 re-infection reported from Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Delhi and Maharashtra, the Union Health Ministry is considering gathering data of such cases to ascertain their veracity, sources said.They said it needs to be confirmed whether these cases are indeed distinct second infection and not just lingering effects of the first one.This can be done only by genetic sequence analysis to see if it is the same strain of the virus which had caused the first infection or a different one.For gathering data on suspected cases of COVID-19 reinfection, the health ministry may also issue guidelines and a format based on which database of all such cases is to be maintained by the State Surveillance Units (SSUs) and District Surveillance Units (DSUs), sources said.Worldwide, there isn’t sufficient evidence on re-infection. Most scientists describe the recurrence as shedding of the residual virus which may happen for up to three months since the first infection is diagnosed, Dr Neeraj Nischal, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at AIIMS, said.During such a time their RT-PCR test may come positive, he said.“The second possibility is that it could be a different strain which is causing the infection. To know whether it is reinfection or active infection, one can do viral culture, sub-genomic RNA analysis or compare the genome of the two samples—that of the first infection and the supposed recurrence.  But these methods are technically demanding and not easily available,” Dr Nischal explained.ICMR Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava had last week said reinfection of COVID-19 is possible, even though it is a “very rare” occurrence. He, however, stressed that it is not a matter of serious concern.“We have seen someone gets measles and is supposed to be protected all his life because he generates certain antibodies. But then, we have seen reinfection occurring in measles as well.“Similarly, we can have COVID-19 reinfection as has been described by the case in Hong Kong. But, it is not a matter of serious concern. It has been noted that whenever reinfection occurs, both the infections have been mild,” Bhargava said.He had earlier said there is a need to find out how long immunity lasts.Suspected cases of COVID-19 reinfection have also triggered concerns regarding the effectiveness of vaccines being developed.According to some researches, immunity to coronavirus probably lasts at least three months or even longer, but it has not been scientifically established yet how long immunity lasts.“Understanding how our immune system responds to the virus is an important step towards vaccine development,” Dr Sanjay Rai, a professor in the department of community medicine at AIIMS said.“What should be of concern is whether the virus is mutating very fast and to find out if the magnitude of mutation is very large. Then the vaccine developed against the virus may not act on this mutant variety. We don’t have evidence to suggest drastic mutations in strains of SARS-CoV-2 in India till now,” he said.The concept of immunity after an infection is important because if immunity wears off it could pose a challenge for vaccines, another researcher said, adding that booster shots may be needed.It is also unclear whether reinfected people would be able to spread the virus. That’s another reason why scientists say people should continue to wear masks, practise social distancing and good hygiene, experts said.Instances of coronavirus reinfection have been reported from Hong Kong, Belgium and the Netherlands raising concerns that herd immunity may not be enough to curb the pandemic.However, scientists in India and elsewhere said more studies are needed for reliable inference.

20-09-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: People letting their guard down is worrying, say experts||Careless attitude of people in wearing masks and following social distancing norms is leading to a surge in coronavirus cases in the national capital, experts said on Sunday.Dr Upali Nanda of Medeor Hospital in the Qutab Institutional Area here said, “Reopening of all places, including restaurants and weekly markets, has led to an increase in traffic and intermingling of population.”She said even if people are putting on masks, they are wearing it improperly. “It keeps hanging below their nose or below their chin. They keep touching the front of their masks. The purpose of wearing masks has been defeated,” she said.People are not carrying a bottle of sanitiser and one is not even seen wearing gloves. Poor mask discipline, not following social distancing norms and people letting their guard down owing to fatigue that has grown during the pandemic are leading to a surge in the positive cases.Dr BL Sherwal, the Medical Director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, said, “Testing has been increased and the cases have gone up, but they should come down. In my view, we are going to have a slowdown maybe in a week or so.”                  However, he said people letting their guard down are a worrying part and people need to be told that “we are still in the coronavirus phase”.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain has repeatedly said COVID-19 cases have seen a surge in Delhi as there has been an increase in the number of tests being conducted on a daily basis. He has said that the situation will soon be under control.“The COVID-19 situation will be soon under control. We are testing more than 60,000 people every day. There is no need to panic, but people should be cautious and use face mask and follow other measures to prevent spread of the virus,” Jain had said while addressing a one-day session of the Delhi Assembly.According to a spokesperson of Dr. Lal PathLabs Ltd, as more and more activities are allowed and people start moving out, “we may have to be ready for some increase in COVID-19 cases”.The number of rapid antigen tests conducted on a daily basis is almost five times the number of RT-PCR tests. Delhi has a capacity of conducting 14,000 RT-PCR tests, but the tests are not being conducted to full capacity, the spokesperson said.Nanda said rapid antigen tests can have a lot of false positive and a lot of asymptomatic patients are coming positive on a daily basis and that could also be the reason for the high number of cases on a daily basis.Dr Alpana Razdaan, Lab Head, Genestrings Lab, said, “RT-PCR tests are not happening in full capacity. Despite there being a limit of 14,000 tests daily, the number of RT-PCR tests being conducted is less. The government has to push for more tests. We have not received any guidelines from the government on increasing RT-PCR tests. The testing has to be more efficient.”             “Last month, 10-20 per cent of the samples were testing positive but now 30 to 40 per cent of the samples tested are positive on a daily basis. We do not know whether it is due to the positivity rate going up or due to more testing being conducted.”        The spokesperson of Dr. Lal PathLabs, however, said they haven’t observed any drop or irregularity in the number of RT-PCR test requests.Hospital admissions have also seen a surge due to the increase in the cases.Dr Sherwal of Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital said they were down to 44 patients a day at one time but now the number of patients has gone up to 200 on a daily basis. He also said that a good number of patients from outside Delhi are availing treatment facilities here.Dr Suresh Kumar, the Medical Director of LNJP Hospital, said their hospital was having 40-50 patients at one time but now admissions have doubled and they are seeing 100 patients every day.“Our hospital has 740 patients currently. People are coming from outside. Interstate mobility has increased and people from outside Delhi are coming here for better treatment facilities due to plasma therapy being available here,” he added.Kumar said that the infection rate may slow down in 15-20 days.The Delhi government has significantly ramped up testing in the past few days.The number of tests conducted and corresponding fresh cases reported from September 1-19 in that order are: 24,198 (2,312); 28,835 (2,509); 32,834 (2,737); 36,219 (2,914); 38,895 (2,973); 36,046 (3,256); 22,954 (2,077); 45,797 (3,609); 54,517 (4,039); 58,340 (4,308); 60,580 (4,266); 60,076 (4,321); 56,656 (4,235); 44,884 (3,229); 62,669 (4,263); 62,593 (4,473); 60,014 (4,432); 61,037 (4,127); and 61,973 (4,071).

20-09-2020||New Delhi||No significant SARS CoV-2 mutation in India; ICMR exploring saliva-based COVID-19 test: Vardhan||The ICMR is actively exploring saliva-based test for detection of COVID-19, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday and asserted that no significant or drastic mutation in strains of SARS-CoV-2 has been found in India till now.During an interaction with his social media followers, Vardhan informed them the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been conducting large-scale sequencing of nationally representative strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus collected for several months over different time-points.Detailed results on mutations and evolution of the virus will be available in early October, he said.Replying to queries during the ‘Sunday Samvad’ platform, Vardhan further said enough oxygen is being produced in the country and the health ministry is closely monitoring the situation.According to a health ministry statement, he reminded everyone that the ministry had dispatched oxygen concentrators to rural parts of the country, to avert the logistic issues that have come to light.About saliva-based test for COVID-19, Vardhan noted that the ICMR has validated a few tests, but no reliable test has been found and companies with tests approved by US-FDA have still not approached the Government of India.He added that the country’s apex health research body is actively exploring this test method and will inform as soon as reliable options are available.Regarding the Centre’s achievement of engineering polio eradication in India, he reminded the audience that coronavirus is a novel pathogen and unlike polio, literature for it is absent.India’s handling of disease outbreaks in the past such as SARS, Ebola and plague will play a major role in containing coronavirus, Vardhan said.“The minister assured another (social media) follower that no significant or drastic mutations have been found in strains of SARS-CoV-2 in India (available in GISAID, global database), till now,” according to the health ministry statement.Vardhan said 155 families of COVID Warriors have claimed relief under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package: Insurance Scheme for Health Workers Fighting COVID-19. These include 64 doctors, 32 auxiliary nurse midwives and multipurpose healthcare workers, 14 ASHA workers and 45 other frontline workers who lost their lives.He also noted that it would take a substantive amount of time for developing herd immunity to be able to cover about 70 per cent of the population. Hence the focus of the government is primarily towards putting together a strategy that combines containment and hospital management, the minister said.Being a doctor himself, Vardhan answered questions on the clinical management of COVID-19 in great detail dispelling myths surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine and plasma therapy in treating coronavirus patients. He also explained to his audience how coronavirus becomes fatal for the elderly and those with comorbidity.He also sought to dispel fears caused by the suspension of trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, saying vaccine development is a complex process and trials have restarted only after an independent investigative expert committee permitted them to proceed.“He explained the difference between various vaccines under clinical trial in India and that since formulations, doses, route of administration are different for the vaccines, their mechanisms of action are also different.“However, the desirable outcome of each vaccine is much the same, that is ensuring healthy individuals with immunity against the novel coronavirus,” the statement said.During the ‘Sunday Samvad’, he shared several tips for the mental wellbeing of senior citizens.About concrete measures planned to handle public health emergencies in the future, Vardhan said, the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ will strengthen the nation to an extent where “we will be able to overcome any eventuality including another pandemic”.The health minister said ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ underlines the government’s commitment towards increased investments in public health and other health reforms to prepare India for future pandemics.A major proposal under consideration at the Expenditure Finance Committee level includes strengthening surveillance of infectious diseases and outbreak response including that for points of entry, the establishment of dedicated infectious disease management hospital blocks in district hospitals and Integrated Public Health Laboratories, he added.Vardhan also spoke on the role of traditional medicine in the present context and informed those who attended the ‘Samvad’ event that the AYUSH Ministry has developed research protocols for validating claims of various Ayush practitioners for COVID-19 solutions although no formulation has been validated as a specific drug.Vardhan also answered queries regarding India’s plan to divert human resources to science and the role of government policy in achieving a clean environment witnessed during the coronavirus-induced lockdown. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-significant-sars-cov-2-mutation-in-india-icmr-exploring-saliva-based-covid-19-test-vardhan-144059
20-09-2020||Mumbai||11-kg tumour extracted from 55-year-old Mumbai woman's abdomen||Doctors in Mumbai have extracted a gigantic 11-kg tumour from the abdomen of a 55-year-old woman after a marathon nine-hour surgery.A team of medicos headed by oncologist Dr Tanveer A. Majeed, urologist Dr Santosh Palkar and Dr Shilpa Deshmukh performed the complicated surgery at the Zen Multispeciality Hospital in Chembur.The patient Sujata Sinha (name changed) is a housewife who noticed her abdomen growing daily accompanied by breathing difficulties.At the height of lockdown in June, she consulted a local doctor who confirmed the presence of a tumour with ultrasound and CT scan.However, owing to the lockdown she did not take any further steps or medicines, even as the tumour continued to grow rapidly, making her look obese.Finally, she was referred to the ZMH and Dr Majeed checked her condition on September 8 to find she was weighing around 80 kgs, and suffered from diabetes and hypertension.Further, tests revealed the huge abdominal tumour encroaching the right half of the abdomen, pushing the right kidney to the left side, duodenum, liver, small intestine and colon to the left side, besides her major blood vessels supplying to the heart.After further clinical diagnosis, the patient was advised surgery by Dr Majeed as it indicated a rare cancer of connective tissues that resemble fat cells under a microscope."After opening the abdomen, we found a huge tumour which had displaced all the other body organs to the left side. It weighed 11 kgs and had dimensions of 55 cm x 40 cm x 35 cm, and the patient lost around one litre of blood during the nine-hour operation," said Dr Majeed.The patient is recuperating well at the hospital now, has started an oral liquid diet, can breathe normally, and will be required for a follow-up after three months."We delayed treatment due to the pandemic lockdown. But I am fortunate to be operated at ZMH where the doctors saved my life. I feel much lighter now, can eat and breathe properly and resume normal life," said the patient gratefully.Prior to this, a team of doctors at the Global Hospital, Parel, had extracted a massive 12-kg tumour from a woman's abdomen in December 2014.

20-09-2020||Hyderabad||Two important Maoist leaders shot in encounter||The Telangana Police gunned down two suspected Maoists in an alleged encounter at the Kadamba forest near Kagaznagar in Telangana’s Komaram Bheem Asifabad district.This is the third encounter in less than a month between the outlawed CPI (Maoist) party and state police.  According to sources, the area is still being scanned for any more hiding Maoists and the operation is being supervised by Asifabad in-charge Superintendent of Police (SP) and Ramagundam Commissioner of Police Sathyanarayana along with other senior officials.  The SP told media persons that led by Mailarapu Adellu alias Bhaskar from the Mancherial- Asifabad Divisional Committee of the CPI (Maoist) some people had been moving around the area and had escaped the police three times in the last five days. “On the evening of September 18 Maoists were spotted in the fields but forces had restrained themselves as there were children and other locals around. So the police tried to chase them after which eight Greyhounds personnel and six special party teams carried out combing operations” The group led by Bhaskar was spotted and they were asked to surrender, but the Maoists fired back and in the exchange of fire that took place for over an hour, two persons died. But their bodies were only found later in the morning during a search at the scene.  One deceased was identified as Chukkalu, a core member of the Mancherial-Asifabad action team, hailing from Chhattisgarh, while the other is still unidentified. This is the third exchange of fire incident in northern Telangana in less than a month. The police also recovered two weapons and revolutionary literature from the spot of the encounter.  The Telangana Police had also alerted the police in neighbouring Maharashtra so that an escape into the neighbouring state by the Maoists could be foiled. Telangana DGP Mahendar Reddy had visited the area earlier this month to assess the situation after an increase in Maoist activity. Police said about 400 police personnel from various wings of the force including Greyhounds that specialise in anti-Maoist operations were involved in the operation in the forests and around Chilatiguda village of Asifabad mandal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-important-maoist-leaders-shot-in-encounter-144052
20-09-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||India, US to coexist in Indian Ocean for keeping out China||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 20India on Sunday handed over emergency financial aid of $250 million to the Maldives, 10 days after the US signed an agreement with the island nation to develop military ties.India has gone the extra mile to help the Maldives whose economy is projected to contact by 8 per cent this year. The RBI raised Treasury Bonds which were sold to the State Bank of India (SBI), Male, for handover to the Maldives government, the Indian Embassy said in a statement.Sources said the two recent developments by US and India in this critical Indian Ocean island country will be the shape of things to come in India’s neighbourhood to match Chinese deep pockets.This was a reversal of the situation in 2013 when India fought tooth and nail to keep away the US from entering into a security partnership with the Maldives. The UPA government had then assessed that American entry would give rise to misgivings at a time when it thought India and China could co-exist in the Indian Ocean.Earlier in 1983, the Indira Gandhi government had kicked up a row when the US sought to renew lease on a Sri Lankan transmitter. Located in Trincomalee, New Delhi thought the CIA also used it for intelligence gathering. India was in an unfavourable situation in the Maldives after the 2013 elections when China began muscling in. The situation changed after an India-friendly regime won back power in 2018. But it was after the Galwan Valley clash that India tilted in favour of permitting the US to counter China with a defence framework agreement with the Maldives which will be fleshed out in due course, said the sources.India has had an extra sympathetic attitude towards the Maldives during the pandemic. A medical team reached Male in March to help with Covid-preparedness, and nearly 12 lakh tonnes of medicines and 580 tonnes of food aid was provided.Now, with the intention to deny space to China which has embarked on a worldwide Covid diplomacy, medical teams will be sent to the Maldives on short-term contracts to reinforce the health system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-to-coexist-in-indian-ocean-for-keeping-out-china-144051
20-09-2020||Guwahati||Assam Police recruitment question paper leaked, CM orders probe||The question paper of the written exam for 597 posts of sub-inspector in the Assam Police was leaked and authorities cancelled the test on Sunday minutes after it had commenced across the state, officials said.Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal was immediately informed about the question paper being leaked and he ordered cancellation of the examination. He also asked the director general of police (DGP) to inquire into the matter, they said.The question paper was under strict possession of district police forces, the officials said.“The question paper had four different sets with corresponding answer keys. Around 11.50 am, I got a WhatsApp message containing one set. I immediately checked it and unfortunately, it happened to be one set,” State Level Police Recruitment Board (SLPRB) Chairman Pradeep Kumar told PTI.Several district superintendents of police informed that the examination, which had started at 12 pm, had been stopped immediately after instructions from the SLPRB, he said.Kumar said the chief minister and the DGP were informed about the question paper leak immediately and Sonowal directed cancellation of the examination.“There were around 66,000 candidates for 597 unarmed sub-inspector posts. Within a month, we will announce new dates for the written examination. It will be followed by physical tests and computer knowledge,” the SLPRB chairman said.Asked about the possible source of the leak, Kumar said the papers were taken from Guwahati by all district police with proper escorts and these were under their custody till the examination started this afternoon.“A proper investigation will detect the source and find the culprits. The case has been handed over to the CID already. The IG (inspector general) of the Special Branch will do a separate inquiry. Also, the Karbi Anglong police will register a case as the WhatsApp message was anticipated to have originated from there,” he said.                               Chief Minister Sonowal has instructed the DGP to apprehend the culprits involved in the leaking of the question paper for the recruitment of police officials.“The CM instructed the DGP to identify the nexus, which conspired to spoil the recruitment process, and give strict punishment as soon as possible,” a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office said.On September 12, the SLPRB chairman had issued a notice cautioning candidates against touts after an audio clip went viral that promised sub-inspector jobs against payment of money.“The candidates need not pay any money anywhere during the entire process of recruitment.

20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Stubble burning can exacerbate COVID situation in north India: Expert||The stubble burning which is likely to start later this month ahead of the Rabi crop sowing season can exacerbate the Coronavirus crisis, an agricultural-cum-environment expert has cautioned.“If alternate arrangements to stubble burning are not made, pollutants like particulate matters and toxic gases like Carbon Monoxide and Methane could give rise to severe respiratory problems, which will further worsen the COVID 19 situation, as the Coronavirus also impacts the respiratory tract,” Sanjeev Nagpal, also an adviser to the Union and the Punjab governments on the crop residue management, told PTI on Sunday.“Last year, nearly 50,000 cases of stubble burning were reported in Punjab. Stubble burning contributes about 18 to 40 per cent of particulate matter to atmosphere in northern plains. It also emits large amounts of toxic pollutants like Methane, Carbon Monoxide and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,” said Nagpal, also the MD of Sampurn Agri Ventures Pvt Ltd (SAVPL).Last year’s stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana had contributed to 44 per cent of the pollution in NCR Delhi, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Ministry of Earth Science.Nagpal said stubble burning causes not only massive air pollution but also affects the soil health, which is already in a bad shape in Punjab.The practice of stubble burning combined with excessive use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers over the years has resulted in the decrease of soluble silica, carbon and other essential nutrients in the soil, he said.“Silicon (Si) is one of the most prevalent soil macro-elements, performing an essential function in healing plants in response to environmental stress. The loss of soluble silica in the soil has given rise to silica deficiency in humans exposing people to a greater threat of COVID 19 and other diseases,” Nagpal said.“Insufficient amounts of silica in humans reduce their immune response towards viruses and pathogens,” he added.Punjab alone produces over 55 metric tons of crop residues each year out of which over 40 per cent have been found surplus, he said.Nagpal said the resolution lies in large scale collection of crop residue from farmers at a price by various plants and state governments, its storage, and then using technology for its conversion into organic manure and also biogas.Nagpal’s SAVPL project in Punjab’s Fazilka has devised this technology in association with IIT and PAU, Ludhiana. The project had purchased about 10,000 MTs of paddy straw last year which benefitted around 500 farmers, he claimed.The plant is making 8 MTs of silica manure per day now against a total capacity of 25 MTs per day, he said, adding the capacity of the project is to process 15,000 MTs of crop residue every year.“Our concept is to process stubble to make silica-rich manure that will improve soil health and food quality thereby improving people’s health. We want the Punjab government to give a fillip to the model of ‘crop residue management through its conversion into manure so that it is replicated across the state,” said Nagpal.“This will not only solve the stubble burning problem but will also help produce healthy food thereby helping farmers get better prices for quality food and consumers a chance to buy directly from farmers at a reasonable price,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stubble-burning-can-exacerbate-covid-situation-in-north-india-expert-144044

20-09-2020||Lucknow||Mosque in Ayodhya may be square-shaped like Kaaba: Trust official||The mosque to come up in Ayodhya pursuant to the Supreme Court verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi case may be square-shaped like the Kaaba Sharif in Mecca and will not be named after any emperor or king.Secretary and spokesperson of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) Athar Hussain told PTI on Sunday, “A mosque measuring 15,000 square feet will be built in Dhannipur village. It will be of the same size as that of the Babri mosque. The shape of the mosque may be completely different from that of other mosques. It may be square-shaped like the Kaaba Sharif in Mecca, as hinted by architect SM Akhtar.”To a question on whether the mosque will have no domes or minarets like the Kaaba Sharif, Hussain said it could be a possibility.He said the architect has been given a free hand in this regard.“The mosque will not be named Babri Masjid. It will not be named after any king or emperor. My personal opinion is that it should be called the Dhannipur Masjid,” Hussain said.He also informed that the trust is making its portal so that people can donate for the mosque and the museum, hospital and research centre which will be built inside the complex. Write-ups by national and international Islamic scholars will also appear on the portal.He said some work on the portal is yet to be completed and hence, donation is yet to begin.The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board has formed the IICF, a trust, for the construction of the mosque on a 5-acre plot.The state government has allotted the 5-acre plot in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur for the construction of the mosque on the directive of the apex court.After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court, on November 9 last year, ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.The Babri mosque in Ayodhya was demolished on December 6, 1992 by “kar sevaks”, who claimed that an ancient Ram temple stood at the same site. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mosque-in-ayodhya-may-be-square-shaped-like-kaaba-trust-official-144040

BJP condemns their act,” he said, adding that the agriculture bills are “capable of bringing about comprehensive reforms in the agriculture sector and boost income of the farmers”.The BJP President called as “irresponsible” Opposition behaviour in Rajya Sabha during the passage of the bills. “The irresponsible act of Opposition is unfortunate. They violated the health protocols and norms of process of the House. The democratic system should function smoothly,” he added.Nadda said the Minimum Support Price (MSP) is in force now and will remain in future. “The system of APMC will also be maintained. Prime Minister Modi, while showing foresight, has taken these steps for the better future of farmers, which will play an important role in doubling the income of farmers,” he said. Attacking Congress party, Nadda said the Congress, in its manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha election, had talked about repealing the APMC system. “The Modi government is making better alternatives available to farmers. Why do Rahul Gandhi and Congress party grudge farmers’ being empowered,” he questioned.“Farmer will be his own boss, he can make his own decisions. The new legislations empower farmers and give him alternative marketing channels. Farmers can receive more remuneration prices and related farm services. All his farm related problems can be resolved at his doorstep,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-congratulates-pm-for-empowering-agriculture-freeing-farmers-from-injustice-of-70-years-144038
20-09-2020||New Delhi||Man impersonating student to board flight to Canada held at Delhi airport||A 23-year-old man’s desire to fly to Canada for a so called better life and job opportunities was cut short after he was caught by the immigration officials at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here on suspicion of impersonation and handed over to police, officials said on Sunday.Mehtab Singh, who hails from Rawana Ghasi village in Rampur district of Uttar Pradesh, was travelling on the passport and student visa of someone else, police said, adding he has been arrested and taken into two-day police remand for further investigation.Police said Singh was caught travelling on the original passport and student visa of one Aaditya Singh, a resident of Udham Singh Nagar district in Uttarakhand.The incident took place on the intervening night of September 17-18 when Singh was intercepted at Terminal-3 of the Indira Gandhi International Airport here while he intended to depart to Toronto, Canada.But during checking, the immigration officials found his activities suspicious and on cross-checking, his appearance did not exactly match with the photo on the original passport as shown by him, a senior police officer said.Though Singh looked similar to the man whose photo appeared on the passport with the kind of moustache and beard, but when the officials asked him to remove his face mask, he was caught and handed over to the police on suspicion of impersonation.On the complaint received from the immigration officials, Deputy Commissioner of Police (IGI Airport) Rajeev Ranjan said a case was registered under section 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120 B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections.The officer said the accused was arrested during the course of investigation for impersonating as someone else by travelling on his passport and student visa.During interrogation, initially Singh did not disclose his real identity and claimed he was going to Canada to pursue his further studies but when confronted with passport and other documents, he disclosed his real identity as Mehtab Singh and revealed that he intended to go abroad in search of a better life and job opportunities, an investigating officer said.When asked about his source of documents, Singh disclosed that while pursuing his final year course in Bachelor of Arts from a university in Uttarakhand, he came in contact with an agent named Balwant Singh who promised to send him abroad illegally, the officer said.The accused fixed a deal with Balwant who arranged him an original passport and student visa in the name of one Aaditya Singh, who is a resident of Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand, he added.As per their deal, accused Singh was supposed to give Rs 20 lakh to the agent after he landed in Canada, the officer said.                  Police said the accused has been taken in two days police remand and will be further interrogated to verify and ascertain the claims made by him.Further investigation is underway and the passports and other documents being carried by the accused have been seized, they said.The agent—Balwant Singh—has been absconding, police said, adding efforts are being made to trace him.Last year in September, a 32-year-old Gujarati man was arrested after he was caught by CISF personnel at the Delhi airport for allegedly impersonating an octogenarian passenger by issuing a fake passport.Also in September last year, a 68-year-old man disguised as an octogenarian was caught at the Delhi airport after he landed from Hong Kong with a fake passport.Gurdip Singh, a resident of Moga in Punjab, had used the fake passport and a fake name—Karnail Singh—to get the Permanent Residence ID of Hong Kong.

20-09-2020||Ravi S Singh||Punjab, Haryana feature prominently during discussion on agri Bills in Rajya Sabha||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 20Punjab and Haryana featured prominently during heated discussion on two farm reform related Bills in Rajya Sabha on Sunday.Ongoing agitation of farmers from the two states was the dominating references by the speakers, both from the BJP and the opposition parties.The stand out was the sharp exchanges by Congress’ MP from Punjab Partap Singh Bajwa, who initiated the discussion on the Bills from the Opposition and Bhupender Singh Yadav of the BJP, who is a native of Haryana but elected to the House from Rajasthan.Yadav was the first speaker from the BJP immediately after Bajwa’s turn.Flaunting his credentials as a speaker on agriculture related issues, Bajwa said he is a son of a farmer and hence, was conversant with grievances of farming community. He said farmers of Haryana, Punjab and western UP are agitated against the Bills and see them as an “attack on their conscience”.Yadav countered Bajwa through his opening salvo saying he has dyed-in-the-wool “kisan” parentage, and a native of Haryana.Referring to Bajwa’s reference to agitation of farmers of Punjab regarding the Bills, he said a similar bogey was raised in the seventies in the state against the iconic Bhakra Dam, which emerged as the life-line of the state.“Bogey was raised that electricity would be squeezed out of water from Punjab’s river from the dam to sap it of its power,” Yadav said.He said the Congress is in the habit of indulging doublespeak and spreading negativity, and in this context he referred to anti-CAA agitation.He further said a high-powered committee was constituted by the Manmohan Singh government with the then Haryana Chief Minister BS Hooda to recommend measures to enhance farmers’ income.The committee had also recommended measures to allow farmers to sell produce outside the mandis.BJP member from UP Surendra Nagar said the Bills will allow farmers to sell their produce at any place in the country.Due to the present restrictions the farmers of Haryana cannot sell their jaggery in the markets of Bihar where their produce will fetch a better price, Nagar said, pitching in with his hereditary association with agriculture.Naresh Gujral of the SAD said his party opposed the Bills as they were against the interest of farmers  of the state, who have contributed to the progress and food security of the country.SS Dhindsa, who floated a new Akali Dal after parting ways with Badals-led SAD, said jawans from Punjab who fought for the country’s security at the borders were sons of farmers.AAP member Sushil Gupta also pitched himself as a native of Haryana. He cautioned the government that the farmers of the state will not forgive it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-haryana-feature-prominently-during-discussion-on-agri-bills-in-rajya-sabha-144035
20-09-2020||New Delhi||Sudharshan TV: Our ‘code of ethics’ should be made part of rules, binding on all news channels, NBA tells SC||The News Broadcasters Association (NBA) has suggested to the Supreme Court that its “code of ethics” should be made part of statutory rules on cable TV by the central government to ensure it becomes binding on member and non-member news channels alike.Taking note of the NBA’s alleged inadequacy in regulating “hurtful” and “communal” contents in television programmes of news channels, the top court on September 18 had sought suggestions from it and the Centre to strengthen the association’s self-regulatory powers.A Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud has been hearing a case of a lawyer seeking granting of pre-telecast ban on a programme called ‘UPSC Jehad’ of Sudarshan TV and it will hear the case on Monday again.At present, the court has stayed the telecast of episodes that deal with alleged infiltration of Muslims in bureaucracy.Annie Joseph, secretary general of the NBA, has filed the affidavit in pursuance of the court’s direction asking it to give suggestions as to how the self-regulatory mechanism of the NBA could be strengthened and made more effective in regard to the electronic media.The NBA said its code of ethics should be given a statutory recognition by making it a part of the Programme Code under the Cable TV Rules so that these codes become binding on all news channels.The move will give official recognition and power to the regulatory body.“This court may grant recognition to NBSA (News Broadcasting Standard Association) the ‘independent self-regulatory mechanism’ so that complaints against all news broadcasters, whether members of NBA or not, may be entertained by the NBSA and the orders passed by the NBSA would be binding and enforceable on all news broadcasters,” Joseph said in her affidavit.“Recognition to the NBSA would also strengthen the News Broadcasting Standard Regulation and the penalties mentioned therein could be made more stringent,” the affidavit stated .The self-regulatory body said that amenability to the NBSA mechanism should be made a term of the “uplinking/downlinking permission for news channels, and the orders made, if any, against any news broadcaster may be considered by the (information and broadcasting) ministry at the time of grant and renewal of such permissions”.The NBSA is currently headed by retired Supreme Court judge AK Sikri.Earlier, the Bench had said it was against the practice of courts granting pre-telecast injunctions on shows and that such orders are a “nuclear missile” and hence, the self-regulatory mechanism needed to be strengthened.It had also questioned Sudarshan TV over its ‘Bindas Bol’ programme, the promo of which had claimed that the channel would show the “big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service”.The Bench had asked whether media can be allowed to “target whole set of communities”.Simultaneously, it had taken note of alleged inadequacy of self-regulatory mechanism of the NBA and had observed: “The NBA says that Sudarshan TV is not its member so it cannot do anything”. “NBA says they have a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge. They can impose a maximum fine of Rs one lakh and this shows how toothless they are. But, the NBA is only for members, so Sudarshan News not being a member is not governed by the NBA,” the Bench had observed.Sudharshan TV wants stay liftedSudarshan TV meanwhile has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift the stay on the telecast of remaining episodes of the controversial ‘Bindas Bol’ programme saying the channel would abide by all laws while airing them.In an additional affidavit filed in the top court, Editor-in-Chief of Sudarshan News Suresh Chavhanke has said the channel would “abide and comply” by the programming code and directions of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting strictly. “I will strictly comply with all laws while airing the remaining episodes of ‘Bindas Bol’ program series on the subject of UPSC Jihad,” Chavhanke said in the affidavit, filed through advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain. “The answering respondent further states that he we will abide and comply by the programming code and directions of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting strictly,” the affidavit said. It further said, “In light of what has been submitted in my previous affidavit dated September, 2020 and hereinabove, this court may be pleased to vacate the injunction on the telecast of the remaining episodes of the programme series.”      It said the channel has already broadcast four episodes of the programme series ‘Bindas Bol’ from September 11 to September 14 and there are six remaining episodes. The affidavit also referred to the September 2008 and August 2010 broadcasts by an English news channel and said that in one of these progammes, a Hindu cultural gathering was shown in saffron colour clothes.The apex court is scheduled to hear the matter on Monday. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sudharshan-tv-our-code-of-ethics-should-be-made-part-of-rules-binding-on-all-news-channels-nba-tells-sc-144034

Ministers are learnt to have briefed the Prime Minister on the issue.The motion could seek to name or censure opposition MPs including TMC’s Derek O Brien who was caught on camera trying to pull off chairman’s mics and tearing the rule book. Many opposition MPs later sat in dharna in the house even after it had been adjourned.The opposition notice signed by top opposition leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ahmed Patel, O Brien, Ram Gopal Yadav among others accuses RS Deputy Chairman of “violating all cannons of law, precedence, Parliamentary practice and fair play.”It alleges that the Deputy Chairman did not allow points or order to be raised, didn’t allow many MPs opposing the “anti farmer bills” to even speak; and purported to extend the RS beyond 1 pm without seeking sense of the house.“The House functions by consensus but the Deputy Chairman did not attempt to generate a consensus, he didn’t allow RS members in LS to even participate; attempted to have bills passed in haste and without application of mind, circumvented all demands for proper voting by division and violated all COVID 19 norms.”Parliament sources however said a 14 day notice period was required for a no confidence matter to be take up, and the current session was set to be curtailed next week.Opposition numbers in RS are also not enough to carry the motion with many seeing the move as symbolic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oppn-gives-no-confidence-notice-against-rs-dy-chairman-govt-mulls-counter-motion-against-errant-mps-144032

Later, he was arrested and shifted to the Samaypur Badli police station where he was found hanging, police said on Sunday.According to police, the man was in jailed on murder charge but was out on parole since March. His parole was extended because of the coronavirus pandemic.The police said that a case under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act was registered at the Swaroop Nagar police station after Dharmendra allegedly sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl in Swaroop Nagar while her parents were away on Saturday.Police claimed that he fled the crime spot and hid at a relative’s house.

20-09-2020||Gaya (Bihar)||Bihar's 'canal man' Loungi Bhuiyan gifted tractor||Loungi Bhuiyan, Bihar's own 'Canal Man' who single-handedly cut out a 5-km canal to bring water to his native village Kolithwa, has won all-round applause for his toil of 20 years, with the Mahindra Group now gifting him a tractor.Siddharth, an authorised distributor of Mahindra tractors in Gaya, and Managing Director of Mahindra Tractors Siddhanath presented Loungi a tractor from the company's showroom on Saturday. Abhay Mani, Bihar Regional Manager of the tractor company, was also present on the occasion.Mahindra's Bihar state head Ashish Srivastava told reporters: "Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra in a tweet had promised to deliver the tractor to Loungi, which was immediately fulfilled. We are fortunate that a warrior like him will now use a Mahindra tractor to complete the remaining task."  He said a hardworking person like Loungi was an inspiration for the society. A visibly happy Loungi said the widening of the canal can now be done easily and fast with the help of the tractor.Loungi, whose village falls in Bihar's Gaya district, dug up the 5-km-long canal. The feat of Loungi, whose Kolithwa village is situated on the border of Imamganj and Bankebazar blocks, makes one recall the toil of 'Mountain Man' Dashrath Manjhi, another native of Bihar who cut a road through a hill near his village in 22 years.Loungi said he was pained by the migration of youths from Kolithwa, which was drought-prone as it did not get to retain sufficient rainwater for irrigation due to its geographical location. The village is around 80 km from Gaya city, surrounded by forest area.Since there were no job avenues except agriculture, a large number of village's youths migrated to bigger cities in search of livelihood. Bhuiyan was unhappy that mostly women and children were left behind in his village.In August 2001, he decided to dig a canal (Paain in local language) from a natural water source in Bagetha Sahwasi forest to the village. The villagers took their cattle generally to that source for watering, which also provided sustenance to the animals living in the forest area.Loungi knew that the water source was enough to irrigate the agricultural land of the villagers. However, it was a great challenge to bring water into the village. After working relentlessly for 20 years, he managed to dig the canal that is four-feet wide and three-feet deep.Dashrath Manjhi cut out a road in the middle of mountain in his native village Gehlaur with just a hammer and chisel in 22 years from 1960 to 1982. Due to his untiring efforts, the distance between Gahlaur and Wazirganj was reduced from 55 km to just 15 km. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihars-canal-man-loungi-bhuiyan-gifted-tractor-144026
20-09-2020||New Delhi||Record over 12 lakh COVID-19 tests conducted in 24 hours: Health ministry||Crossing a crucial milestone in the battle against COVID-19, a record number of over 12 lakh tests were conducted in the country for the detection of the disease in a span of 24 hours, taking the total number of such tests performed so far to more than 6.36 crore (6,36,61,060), the Centre said on Sunday.This strongly demonstrates a substantial strengthening of the COVID-19 testing infrastructure in the country, the health ministry said, underlining that India's daily testing numbers are among the highest in the world.From conducting merely 10,000 tests per day on April 8, the average daily number has crossed 12 lakh with 12,06,806 tests conducted on Saturday.The last one crore tests were conducted in merely nine days and the Tests Per Million (TPM) have been boosted to 46,131, the ministry highlighted."Higher testing leads to early identification of positive cases and a timely and effective treatment. This eventually leads to a lower mortality rate," it said.As evidence has revealed, higher numbers of testing also result in a lowered positivity rate, it added.The sharp decline in the daily positivity rate has demonstrated that the rate of spread of the infection is being contained, the ministry underscored.Higher testing forms an integral part of the "chase the virus" strategy, which aims to catch every missing person to curb the spread of the infection, it said, adding that the states have been advised that all symptomatic negatives of rapid-antigen tests should mandatorily be subjected to RT-PCR testing.The Centre's policies in the context of COVID-19 are continuously evolving. Following several measures to facilitate a wider testing by people, the government has recently provided "testing on demand" for the first time, the ministry said.The states and Union territories have also been given wider flexibilities to simplify the modalities in order to enable higher levels of testing.The government has also allowed COVID-19 tests to be conducted on the prescription of any registered medical practitioner and not exclusively a government doctor.The Centre has strongly advised the states and Union territories to take immediate steps to facilitate testing at the earliest by enabling all qualified medical practitioners, including private practitioners, to prescribe COVID tests to any individual fulfilling the criteria for testing in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Expanding the network of diagnostic laboratories and facilitating easy testing across the country have given a sharp boost to the enhanced testing numbers.The country has performed remarkably on fulfilling the World Health Organization's (WHO) advice of 140 tests per day per 10-lakh population, the ministry said.In its Guidance Note on "Public Health Criteria to Adjust Public Health and Social Measures in the Context of COVID-19", the WHO has advised this strategy.  "In another row of achievements, 35 states and Union territories have crossed the advised number of tests," the ministry said.A prominent determinant of the strengthened testing numbers is the steadily widening diagnostic laboratory network in the country.

20-09-2020||New Delhi||Heated debate on farm Bills in RS; Opposition members tear papers, heckle presiding officer||Some Opposition members led by the TMC climbed on to the Chairman’s podium, tore official papers, and heckled the presiding officer as they opposed the government’s push to pass two contentious farm bills on Sunday without considering their demand for sending the proposed legislations to a house committee.Ruckus prevailed after Deputy Chairman Harivansh overruled Opposition pleas for postponing Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s reply to the debate on the two Bills till Monday as the scheduled sitting time of the House was over.As slogan-shouting Opposition members rushed into the Well, Harivansh put motions by Congress, TMC, DMK and CPM members for sending the bills to a select committee of Rajya Sabha for greater scrutiny, for the vote.He declared the motions have been negated by voice vote even as movers of the motion sought division of votes.As the Chair took clause-by-clause passage of the Bills, Derek O’Brien of the TMC and some other Opposition members climbed on to the podium showing the rule book to Harivansh.Some members tore official papers.Slogan-shouting members tried to heckle the presiding officer who was protected by House marshals.As unruly scenes prevailed, mikes installed in the House were muted and a few minutes later the proceedings were adjourned for around 15 minutes.When the House re-assembled, the Opposition members were again in the Well chanting slogans. At least one of them climbed on the table of officials.Harivansh said a division of vote cannot be sought from the Well of the House and insisted they should first return to their seats.As per procedure lobbies have to be cleared for enabling electronic voting on a legislation.Amid the uproar and slogan-shouting, the Deputy Chairman put the two Bills --  Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 -- for approval through voice vote.With government having numbers of its favour the Bills were passed. This completes parliamentary approval process for legislation of the Bills.Now, they would be sent to the President of India for his assent. Once the President gives assent, they will become law. 'No confidence'Twelve Opposition parties later gave a notice for a no-confidence motion against Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh over the manner in which the two farm Bills were passed.The parties that have submitted the notice include the Congress, All India Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, Telangana Rashtra Samithi, CPI, CPM, Nationalist Congress Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, National Conference, DMK and the Aam Aadmi Party.Congress leader Ahmed Patel said 12 parties have given a notice of no-confidence against the deputy chairman, as the manner in which the Bills were passed is a “murder” of democracy.“Our demand for adjourning the House and division of votes was disallowed,” he said. “We gave a no-confidence against the attitude of Deputy Chairman and the manner in which the Bills were passed.”         JD(U) leader Harivansh was re-elected as the Deputy Chairman of the Upper House on September 14, the first day of the ongoing Monsoon Session.Patel said the Deputy Chairman should have “safeguarded democratic traditions but harmed them instead”.The protesting members sat in Rajya Sabha after the House was adjourned following the passage of the Bills.TMC MP Derek O’Brien also accused the government of “murdering” the Parliamentary system and democracy.“The government did not allow the Opposition a vote on the farmers’ bills. It is a sad day for the Parliamentary democracy,” he said.The TMC MP alleged that the government knew that it did not have the numbers and that is why they did not allow a division of votes.“Today, the BJP tried to break the back of yet another great institution of our democracy: Parliament. The basic rights of MPs guaranteed by the Constitution are snatched. No vote allowed in RS on farmers bills. Today’s day will be written in black letters,” he said.

20-09-2020||New Delhi||Espionage case against journalist Rajeev Sharma 'false', 'evidence planted': Lawyer||The espionage case lodged against arrested freelance journalist Rajeev Sharma under the Official Secrets Act is "false" and the "evidence was planted" by the Delhi police, his lawyer claimed on Sunday.The Delhi Police on Saturday said Sharma, a resident of Pitampura, was allegedly passing sensitive information about India's border strategy, Army's deployment and procurement, and foreign policy to Chinese intelligence agencies.He was arrested by the Special Cell of the Delhi Police in connection with a case under the Official Secrets Act as he was allegedly found in possession of defence-related classified documents.Senior advocate Adish Aggarwala, who is representing the journalist, alleged that the police's claim of finding incriminating evidence from his possession was "not true"."We are not denying that he was working for a Chinese news organisation. The only dispute is the police's claim that they have found incriminating evidence, which is not true."The evidence was planted later on. On September 14, when the police took him in custody, they searched his house that night and no incriminating evidence was found. He is being framed in a false case. He has not committed any of offence," Aggarwala told PTI.The advocate said the police could have informed the media on the day of the arrest itself, but they did not "as nothing incriminating was found"."Once they (police) analysed and could not find any anything incriminating, they planted the evidence," he further alleged."They are not interrogating any official from the Defence Ministry. He must have found the documents from someone. It isn't that he printed them at his home," he claimed.Aggarwala also alleged that Sharma's family was not allowed access to him, nor was any information regarding the allegations furnished to them. "No copy of the FIR is uploaded online. Despite multiple requests, the police have not furnished a copy of the FIR. He was not given access to a lawyer when he was produced before a judge through video conferencing," he said and termed it "illegal".The lawyer said the only thing the police had was that Sharma was working with a Chinese media organisation."Our country has not stopped business with China. A lot of people from China are working here and a lot many Indians are working there. There's nothing wrong in that," he said.Sharma's counsel has filed a bail application which is scheduled to come up for hearing on September 22 before a Delhi court. In the application, the counsel has said that there is "no risk of him running away from the process of justice"."The applicant has deep roots in society and is a respected senior journalist. His wife is also Associate Professor at Venkateswara College, Delhi University. Therefore, there is no risk of him running away from the process of justice."There is no chance of influencing any witness or tampering with any evidence. The investigation would no longer require custodial interrogation of the applicant, and he can join the investigation as and when directed," the application stated.It added the accused was of 61-years-old and was "suffering from an acute case of sinus problems, and requires constant treatment from a nebulizer"."He has also undergone two surgeries for the same. Due to the same, he stands to be high risk to COVID-19. He is also a patient of high blood pressure, and taking medication for the same for the past decade," it said.The journalist had sent several documents in the form of reports to Chinese intelligence officers and got a handsome remuneration in return, police alleged.

20-09-2020||New Delhi||Bill in Lok Sabha to make receipt, use of foreign funds stringent||The government on Sunday said, that all the religious organisations could receive foreign contributions, as long as, they used these funds for states purposes, and not for 'undermining internal security'.Minister of State for Home, Nityanand Rai made this statement in the Lok Sabha before the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act Amendment Bill 2020 was introduced through a voice note—negating objections from opposition Congress and TMC.The Bill had made it mandatory for office bearers of the organisations seeking FCRA approvals to submit their Aadhar details, besides prohibiting public servants, and corporations owned and controlled by the government from receiving foreign funds.So far only legislators, journalists, judges, and election candidates were prohibited.The Bill provides the government powers to stop the utilisation of foreign funds through a domestic NGO after conducting a summary trial on complaints of misutilisation of funds.Also, through another change to the original 1976 Act, the government has allowed itself the power to suspend FCRA certificate beyond the 180 days provided in the present law, which has been amended twice in the past, starting 2010.Opposing the introduction of the bill, Congress’ Manish Tewari said, that while the statement of objects of the draft legislation say, that the government has cancelled FCRA licences of 19,000 organisations between 2010 and 2019, “the bill is silent on how many criminal investigations led to convictions.”Tewari questioned the bar on some including public servants from receiving foreign contribution terming it a violation of Article 14 of the constitution.He also flagged “unbridled power of harassment the government has given itself through the bill” by stopping fund use by summary trial and by increasing suspension period for FCRA licences from 180 to 365 days and said FCRA provisions should have been relaxed rather than be made stringent.The minister allayed apprehensions of Congress’ Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and TMC’s Saugata Roy regarding submission of Aadhar details of NGO directors saying the provision was in line with the spirit of Supreme Court’s order on Aadhar.Rai said the foreign contribution by any organisation can only be received in a dedicated FCRA account with the SBI, New Delhi account but “documents for such registration can be submitted at the local SBI branch.”Seeking to amend the FCRA Act, the amendment bill says: “The annual inflow of foreign contribution has almost doubled between the years 2010 and 2019, but many recipients of foreign contribution have not utilised the same, for the purpose for which they were registered or granted prior permission under the said Act. Many of them were also found wanting in ensuring basic statutory compliances such as submission of annual returns and maintenance of proper accounts. This has led to a situation where the Central Government had to cancel certificates of registration of more than 19,000 recipient organisations, including NGOs, between 2011 and 2019. The criminal investigations also had to be initiated against dozens of such NGOs which indulged in outright misappropriation or misutilisation of foreign contribution.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bill-in-lok-sabha%C2%A0to-make-receipt-use-of-foreign-funds-stringent-144005

India’s Neighbourhood First policy and the Maldives’ India First policy have worked in tandem during the COVID-19 pandemic to safeguard the well-being of our peoples. Today is another milestone in our historic ties that have expanded in scope and risen in ambition in the recent past,” it said.India had provided substantial and continued assistance to the Maldives during the COVID-19 pandemic.A team of doctors and specialists visited the Maldives in March to assist in COVID-preparedness. A consignment of 5.5 tonnes of essential medicines was donated in April, another consignment of 6.2 tonnes of medicines was airlifted from 4 Indian cities to Male by the Indian Air Force, and 580 tonnes of food aid was provided in May.India continuously lifted export restrictions on medical consumables, respiratory apparatus, and testing kits and reagents throughout the pandemic to assist Maldives in its battle against COVID-19.On the request of the Government of Maldives, India will also send doctors and nurses recruited on short-term contracts to reinforce the health system in the Maldives in the battle against COVID-19.Tourism constitutes a third of the Maldives’ national revenue.Neeza Imad, Minister of State for Economic Development of Maldives, has said COVID-19 had had a “devastating impact” on the country’s economy, particularly to SMEs that account for most of the tourism-related employment.As a result of the ongoing crisis, the International Monetary Fund has projected that the country's economy will contract by 8.1 per cent in 2020.

20-09-2020||New Delhi||Left parties want CMP as condition for alliance with Congress||The left parties are optimistic of an alliance with the Congress for the coming Assembly election in West Bengal but want the tie-up to be based on a Common Minimum Programme (CMP).The Left wants to reclaim its stature in national politics by a strong electoral performance in West Bengal which it had ruled for more than three decades at stretch.Although the election in the state is due in April-May next year, the issue of Left-Congress has got currency with the possibility of fire-brand Leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury being made head of the state.He has publicly expressed an inclination to do business with the Left.Positioning Chowdhury, who is a known critic of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, is seen as a strong political intent by Congress leadership.With BJP on the ascent in West Bengal, and the ruling TMC reportedly launching a drive to connect with voters, the Left wants to bang the bush regarding its strategy so as not to be left behind."Unlike the last assembly election, there will be no ambiguity for the coming assembly election," a Left leader said.A section of Left leaders rue their failure to send a clear-cut message in the last assembly election which cost them.Due to contradictions within the CPI(M), which heads the Left Front in West Bengal, the Left's electoral tie-up with the Congress was passed off as "understanding".While party leaders from Kerala were dead-set against the party doing any business with the Congress, the majority of party leaders from West Bengal thought otherwise.A modus vivendi, which was a compromise of sorts, was worked out through an "understanding".In the analysis of leaders of Left parties, while their cadre ensured transference of votes to Congress nominees, the same was not reciprocated.On the other hand, BJP has reportedly launched a drive to micro-manage voters."Mamata Banerjee will be ousted by voters," Arvind Menon, a BJP co-in-charge of West Bengal said."The TMC government is wide-ranging anti-incumbency, and the Left and Congress are discredited and spent-force in West Bengal," BJP West Bengal president Dilip Gosh said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-parties-want-cmp-as-condition-for-alliance-with-congress-143978
20-09-2020||Washington||China using aggression to stop India from building defence infra in border areas: US Congressman||China has adopted an aggressive posture against India to stop New Delhi from building defence infrastructure along the border, the absence of which gives Beijing a strategic advantage, a top Indian-American lawmaker has said.The Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have been locked in a tense standoff in multiple areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh since early May.“This is a serious situation. It all started when basically, the Indian government-built infrastructure entirely on its own side of the border to shore up defences in this area, bordering China. The Chinese apparently took offence of that and then made very provocative moves at that point in the Galwan area,” Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi told PTI in an interview.Krishnamoorthi, who is seeking his third-consecutive election to the House of Representatives from Illinois, is the first and only Indian-American lawmaker in the powerful House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.The committee last week had a classified briefing on China’s aggression against India and the border situation.Krishnamoorthi refused to divulge details of the briefing but expressed serious concern over the Chinese actions.“What is ironic about this situation is that the Chinese had already built up infrastructure on their side of the border previously. And so, what I’m very concerned about is that the Chinese making yet another series of provocative moves on the heels of having done similar things with regard to border disputes, or other tensions with Taiwan, Japan Vietnam and the Philippines in the South China Sea,” he said.Tensions have escalated manifold along the LAC in eastern Ladakh after the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details.“China,” Krishnamoorthi said, “was not acting like a good neighbour.” He said it was time for China’s neighbours to join hands.“I think the neighbourhood association, so to speak, the countries in the region, along with others, need to make it very clear that the Chinese government cannot use military measures to try to get their way when diplomacy should always be the mode of settling differences,” he said.Krishnamoorthi said the neighbouring countries of China are increasingly having a dialogue about how to create a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific region.“That is why the United States, India, Australia, Japan and others have come together to discuss how to avoid aggression or military moves that could really disrupt the region,” he said.To China’s motive behind stopping India from building defence infrastructure, Krishnamoorthi said Beijing did not want to handover strategic advantage. “They feel that they had an advantage when only they had the requisite infrastructure whether it was airfields or roads or railways on their side, and India did not.”“I think it’s entirely within a sovereign nations prerogative to shore up its own defences wherever it perceives them to be short of what they need to counter aggression,” he added.Observing that the United States and India have a deep and growing relationship, Krishnamoorthi said the US should make it very clear to whoever would violate international norms or rules and conventions that they are going to stand with those who abide by those same rules and norms and conventions, such as India, in this situation.Krishnamoorthi has introduced a bipartisan resolution against China and in support of India. The resolution, in the form of an amendment to the National Defence Authorisation Act, was passed by the House with overwhelming support.“I think it’s really important that we resolve this diplomatically as soon as possible,” he said.Krishnamoorthi said the Chinese move did not seem to be in response to India revoking Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August last year.Amidst the tense situation in eastern Ladakh, India and China reached an agreement to resolve their border row at a meeting between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet.The agreement included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.

An order issued by CAPF canteens in May restricting procurement of items from some multi-nationals was later withdrawn.With its outlets in every military station and most units across the country, including remote locations, CSD is the largest and most profitable retail chain in India, having annual sales in excess of Rs 17,000 crore over the past many years.These sell thousands of products from groceries and household items to cars, electronics and liquor. Most of the products sold through the CSD are of Indian origin barring some house hold items and certain brands of liquor. The prices are lower than market rates because some taxes are exempted.According to official data, CSD sales amounted to Rs 17,190.98 crore in 2017-18, Rs 18,917.23 crore in 2018-19 and Rs 17,588.27 crore in 2019-20. Till August 2020, the sales were Rs 3,693.10 crore, which so far is about 21 per cent of last year’s sales.CSD sales took a hit during the lockdown period due to the COVID-19 pandemic as the outlets remained closed and the supply chain remained disrupted. Even after the canteens reopened, the footfall was about half of what it was earlier. A series of safety and precautionary measures, including Aarogya Setu linked online appointments and staggering time for different categories of clients were introduced.In addition to serving members of the armed forces as well as ex-servicemen and their surviving next of kin, CSD facilities are also extended to civilian employees in Defence Ministry establishments who are paid out of the defence estimates. Recently, this benefit was also extended to retired defence civilians.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-decision-on-banning-imported-products-from-military-canteens-says-mod-143967
20-09-2020||New Delhi||Why is govt ‘running away’ from giving legal responsibility for MSP, asks Congress||As agriculture-related bills were tabled in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress on Sunday stepped up its attack on the Centre over the issue and accused it of “running away” from giving legal responsibility for the Minimum Support Price (MSP).Days after their passage in the Lok Sabha, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar introduced the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, in the Rajya Sabha.Tomar said minimum price or MSP based procurement of agriculture crops from farmers will continue and is not related to the farm bills that seek to give cultivators freedom to market their produce.Also read: Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar moves crucial farm Bills in Rajya SabhaKejriwal urges non-BJP parties to vote against farm bills in Rajya SabhaLIVE: Farmers across Haryana protest agricultural ordinances, block roadsHouse passes Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce Bill by voice vote amidst protestCongress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the Modi government would get the “three black bills” passed in the Rajya Sabha through whip. “But no answer — how will the 15.5 crore farmers’ land get MSP, who will give?” Surjewala said.“Why is the government running away from giving legal responsibility for MSP? Who will take the responsibility for MSP outside the ‘mandi’?” he asked.The bills are also facing staunch opposition from farmer bodies as well as from within the ruling coalition. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the food processing minister from the Shiromani Akali Dal party, resigned from the government last week.'Will not sign death warrant of farmers'Opposition parties led by the Congress criticised the farm bills tabled in Rajya Sabha on Sunday, saying they would not sign on the “death warrant” of farmers.The Opposition charged that the two Bills were aimed at benefitting big corporates and ending the minimum price based procurement by the government.The Rajya Sabha took up the discussion on The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill that have already been passed by Lok Sabha.KK Ragesh (CPI-M), Derek O’Brien (TMC), Trichi Siva (DMK) and KC Venugopal (Congress) moved resolutions for sending the two bills to a select committee of the House for consideration before they are taken up for passage.Initiating the discussion on these two bills, Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa, who hails from Punjab, described the proposed laws as “ill-conceived and ill-timed” and said his party “completely rejects” them.He said the bills were against landowners across the country, especially those of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh.“We will not sign on death warrants of farmers,” he said.With agriculture being a state subject, he said the bills are against the federal cooperative spirit.“We do not want any tinkering in the APMC and the minimum support price (MSP),” he said and wondered what was the need to bring these bills during COVID-19.Bajwa said farmers were on streets to protest against these two bills. “Those whom you want to benefit are on the streets.”The Congress leader said the BJP’s alliance partner Akali Dal has already opposed the Bills and Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union Cabinet.Bajwa said the bills have been brought with an “intention of ending the MSP (minimum support price) operations”.“Slowly, the government will come out of this and then Ambani, Adani and big corporate houses will enter (market),” he alleged.The Congress leader said the two bills were against the economic interest of Punjab, which has contributed a lot in making India self-sufficient in foodgrain production.Defending the two Bills, Bhupender Yadav of the BJP charged that the Congress was doing politics over this issue and misleading farmers.

20-09-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal urges non-BJP parties to vote against farm bills in Rajya Sabha||National convener of AAP and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday appealed to all non-BJP parties to vote against three agriculture-related bills in the Rajya Sabha, saying farmers in the country wished so.Earlier, Kejriwal had said his party will vote against the three bills and termed them "anti-farmer"."Farmers all over the country are watching the Rajya Sabha today. The BJP is in minority in the Rajya Sabha. I appeal to all the non-BJP parties to defeat these bills, this is what farmers in the country wish," Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.He on Thursday had demanded that the Centre should withdraw the three bills and said his party MPs will vote against them in Parliament.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has three Rajya Sabha and one Lok Sabha MPs.The Centre had on Monday introduced 'The Farmers' Produce Trade And Commerce (Promotion And Facilitation) Bill', 'The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill', and 'The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill' to replace the ordinances promulgated earlier.These bills seek to provide barrier-free trade for farmers' produce outside notified farm mandis, and empower farmers to enter into farming agreements with private players prior to production for sale of agri-produce.

MSP is the government’s administrative decision and not linked to the bills. MSP based procurement was there in the country, is there, and will continue,” he said.Under MSP, the government guarantees the procurement of crops such as wheat and paddy at minimum prices from farmers.The Opposition parties, as well as the SAD, feel the bills are the first step toward removing the MSP which will force the farmers to make distress sales to private companies.“Union Government wants to help corporates”In the opening burst of a heated debate on the Bills, Congress MP from Punjab Partap Singh Bajwa said the Union government wanted to help the corporates at the cost of farmers through these bills.The farmers of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh will be most affected, negatively, he added.The government was going ahead with the bills in spite of farmers of Punjab and Haryana having hit the streets against them.CPI's Ragesh said the country was witnessing massive agitation by farmers over the bills. “I request the minister and the government to see the wrath of farmers and withdraw these orders and bills.”Opponents of the bills see them as an attempt to dilute the country’s public procurement system and lead to exploitation by private companies.Manoj Jha of the RJD also opposed the Bills.SS Dhindsa, who had broken away from the SAD of in Punjab and floated a new party, also opposed the Bills.He demanded referring them to the Select Committee for wider consultation with farmers to allay their apprehension and remove the infirmities in the legislation.He said: “The farmers of Haryana and Punjab feel let down.”Refer Bills to House's Select CommitteeNaresh Gujral of the SAD demanded referral of the Bills to House’s Select Committee.“The people of Punjab have historically stood against injustices, including against the Congress, and will continue to do so against unfair treatment in future,” he said, urging Tomar to not allow the embers against the Bills in Haryana and Punjab to turn into a conflagration.Gujral also resented for being allotted only two minutes time in the discussion to put his party’s points.The same farmers of Punjab, who enriched the food bowl of the country, felt that their interest was being “sold” to corporates, he added.Gujral, however, lauded the NDA government for having taken measures for agriculture and farmers in the past six years than the preceding 10-year rule of the UPA.BJP comes in support of the BillsIn a counter, Bhupender Singh Yadav of the BJP, who is a Member of the House from Rajasthan, but a native of Haryana, tore into Congress asking why farmers’ income had not increased in the past 73 years.JD(U), an ally of the NDA, supported the Bills.Coming in defence of government regarding the Bills, Surendra Nagar of the BJP said presently the farmers of Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh were not able to sell ‘jagari’ — agro-related produce — in Bihar where they could get a better price.Lashing at the Congress, he added that although it ruled for long, it never empowered the farmers. He also charged it of indulging in hypocrisy by opposing the Bills.He also questioned the Left parties as to why the APMC Act was not prevalent in Kerala if they were concerned about farmers.Former prime minister HD Devegowda said there was apprehension regarding the MSP. He also raised questions on the need for the Bills at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.The proposed reforms in the bills were also the recommendations of an agriculture-related committee during Manmohan Singh-led UPA government. The Committee was headed by the then chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda.Tongue-in-cheek, Yadav said criticism of the Congress of these progressive bills was reminiscent of the bogey raised in some quarters in Punjab in the 1970s against the Bhakra Dam that it would take away power from water of the rivers.While Bajwa claimed credential on subject agriculture, saying he was a son of a farmer from Punjab, Yadav hit out saying he was farmer’s son from Haryana.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, seeks to give freedom to farmers to sell their produce outside the notified APMC market yards (mandis). This, the government says, is aimed at facilitating remunerative prices through competitive alternative trading channels.Farmers will not be charged any cess or levy for sale of their produceFarmers will not be charged any cess or levy for sale of their produce under this Act, according to the government.It will open more choices for farmers, reduce marketing costs, and help them get better prices. It will also help farmers of regions with surplus produce to get better prices and consumers in areas with shortages at lower prices.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, seeks to give farmers the right to enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters, or large retailers for the sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price.It seeks to transfer the risk of market unpredictability from farmers to sponsors.Tomar said this legislation guaranteed cultivators price they negotiate at the time of sowing itself.A third bill, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, that seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion, and potatoes from the list of essential commodities and will do away with the imposition of stock holding limits, is to be moved separately.Rajya Sabha breaks into pandemoniumThe Rajya Sabha breaks into pandemonium at the time of process for voting on the Bills following reply by Agriculture Minister Tomar.Opposition members walked into the Well and also tried to use force to tamper with the public address system at the Chair’s Desk.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-not-sign-death-warrant-of-farmers-congress-in-rajya-sabha-on-farm-bills-143954

The Congress and Left parties have demanded that these be sent to the standing committee on labour.‘Provision discriminatory’The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, does not have specific provisions to safeguard the interests of the unorganised sector. Also, there is no exclusive chapter on interstate migrant workers. The Bill is discriminatory as there is no specific provision on women’s welfare.RsShashi Tharoor, Congress MPLabour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar introduced the Bills, including the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, and the Code on Social Security, 2020. He also withdrew the three Bills that were introduced last year. He said it had been done as the standing committee, in its report, had given wide-ranging recommendations. Out of the 233 suggestions of the panel, 174 were accepted, the minister said. Gangwar said 29 labour laws had been merged into four codes and one of them had already been passed. The Code on Wages Bill, 2019, was passed by Parliament last year.Congress leaders Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor opposed the Bills. Tewari noted that the three Bills were the fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms. They urged the minister to withdraw these and hold wider consultations before taking any decision. “These Bills are a blow to the rights of workers,” said Tewari.Regarding the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, Tharoor said it did not have specific provisions to safeguard the interests of the unorganised sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/three-bills-on-labour-reforms-tabled-in-lok-sabha-143840
20-09-2020||New Delhi||Rajya Sabha approves amendments to insolvency & bankruptcy code||The Rajya Sabha on Saturday passed amendments to the insolvency law for suspension of fresh insolvency proceedings for at least six months starting March 25 amid the Covid pandemic, with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman saying a decision on extending the suspension of relevant provisions will be taken next week.Keeping firms goingThe intention of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is to keep companies a ‘going concern’, and not liquidate them. The Bill mandates that a default on repayments from March 25, the day when the nationwide lockdown began, would not be considered for initiating insolvency proceedings for at least six months. —Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance MinisterIn the wake of the Covid-19 situation, the government decided to suspend the provisions starting from March 25 for six months by promulgating an ordinance in June.Default on repayments from March 25, the day when the nationwide lockdown began to curb the Covid infection, would not be considered for initiating insolvency proceedings for at least six months. The six-month period is ending next week. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill (IBC), 2020, seeks to replace the ordinance issued in June, was passed by a voice vote after a brief discussion. Replying to the debate, Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the suspension of provisions will end next week."At the moment, amendment to the code gives me a provision to only extend till one year. If at all, because it is coming to an end on September 25 this year, September 24 itself we have to make an announcement about what is going to happen. But even if I do, it means by March it should be ending...," the minister said. The minister also clarified that insolvency proceedings against corporates defaulting on loans prior to March 25 will continue and the amendment will not stall those cases. A majority of opposition parties supported the bill and also urged the government to provide interest waiver on loans to farmers and poor people suffering due to the Covid-19 crisis.During the debate on the Bill, many members expressed fears over its possible misuse by corporates even as they hoped that it will help in reviving the economy. On the members' queries regarding liability of personal guarantors in the IBC, Sitharaman said the corporate debtor often has guarantors."So, for comprehensive corporate insolvency resolution and liquidation we felt it was necessary that the insolvency of the corporate debtor as well as its guarantors are considered together to whatever extent it is possible," Sitharaman said.On queries about the urgency to bring the ordinance in the first place, Sitharaman said that "between sessions if there is a need for ordinance because the ground situation demands it, I would think a responsive government's duty is to at least use the ordinance to show that we are there with the people of India." "So to that extent, I am sure the House will appreciate that as and when the government decides for ordinance it is because of that, and whenever the next session happens we come back," she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-approves-amendments-to-insolvency-bankruptcy-code-143841

Such rotation will take place in the 3rd, 4th or 5th semester of the postgraduate programme. It will be called the District Residency Programme," the new notification says.Satisfactory completion of the district residency will be an essential condition before the candidate is allowed to appear in the final exam of the respective PG course.Since a quarter of the PG batch will be away at all times once the programme starts, medical colleges will be allowed to apply for extra seats to compensate for reduced student presence on the campus."Medical colleges may send an application to the MCI BOG for the enhancement of seats, as hospital work may be affected due to out-posting of students. Colleges can apply for it after one year of the implementation of the District Residency Programme," says the notification.A certificate of satisfactory performance will be issued by District Residency Programme coordinator. They will be appointed across all district hospitals as part of the new module."Since the programme will be implemented with the batch joining this year, the first set of students will be posted in districts starting September 2021. Postings will be effected in the second or third year of study. Once the scheme kicks in, we expect every district hospital to have four to eight specialist residents at any point in time. This will be a game changer in strengthening the district health system, which is the backbone of the public health apparatus. Communities will benefit from trained PG students. Students will learn better from the mine of the clinical material available in districts. It is a win-win for all," said VK Paul, MCI BOG chairman.District Residency Programme||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/3-month-dist-posting-must-for-pg-medical-students-143846

India does not enjoy good diplomatic ties with these countries and would prefer other regional players like Thailand, Egypt, Uzbekistan or Afghanistan to step in.Anticipating a rise in prices domestically, the government had banned onion exports except for cut, sliced and powdered due to excessive rainfall hitting its crop in some southern states.As a result, prices have trebled in Bhutan and shown a steady rising trend that threatens to worsen in Bangladesh and Nepal. Sources said a multi-ministry effort supervised by the Ministry of External Affairs led to the release and transportation of onion consignments that were deemed to have been sold with the opening of LCs.India has emerged as an unreliable exporter for the second year running. It had banned onion exports last year as well, impacting neighbours like Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh that are near-totally dependent on Indian onions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-releases-onions-to-stop-pak-china-from-filling-void-143788
