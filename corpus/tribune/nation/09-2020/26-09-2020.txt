26-09-2020||New Delhi||We need to have trust in our armed forces’ ability to secure our interests: Jaishankar||Amid the border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said it was an ongoing issue and “we need to have trust in our armed forces and their ability to secure our interests”.Jaishankar said there was also a need to have trust in the ability of the system — both military commanders and the diplomatic channels — in negotiating with the Chinese.Asked about the situation at the border in eastern Ladakh, Jaishankar told Times Now in an interview: “You know this is going to play out. There will be things which China has done. There will be responses that India has made...There are actually negotiations on the way.”“I understand the compulsions on media to know everything yesterday, unfortunately, real life is a little bit different. So, this is about national security. This is a very complicated ground situation out there,” he said.“We need to have trust in our armed forces and their ability to secure our interests, and frankly in the ability of the system, I mean both military commanders and the diplomatic channels, in negotiating with the Chinese,” he said.“Don’t call out a match… before it is halfway through,” the external affairs minister added.During the interview, Jaishankar also extensively discussed his recently released book ‘The India Way’.The situation in eastern Ladakh escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in clashes in the Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side acknowledged suffering casualties, but it is yet to divulge details.The situation further deteriorated following at least three attempts by soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to "intimidate" Indian troops along the northern and southern banks of the Pangong lake area in the last three weeks where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in 45 years.As the tensions escalated further, Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi held talks on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meet in Moscow on September 10 where they reached a five-point agreement to defuse the situation in eastern Ladakh.The agreement was the basis for the sixth round of Corps commander-level talks on Monday which was also attended for the first time by a joint secretary from the Ministry of External Affairs.The agreement that aimed at ending the tense standoff included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.

26-09-2020||New Delhi||Ladakh autonomous body's polls boycott call may end after influential group’s meeting with Amit Shah||An influential organisation from Ladakh, which had threatened to boycott the upcoming elections to the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) Leh, is likely to participate in the poll process after its meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah here on Saturday, sources said.A formal announcement to this effect is likely to be made by the People’s Movement for Sixth Schedule for Ladakh and representatives of the Union Government on Sunday, they said.After the delegation’s meeting, the Home Minister’s Office tweeted: “Home Minister @AmitShah met with former MP Thupstan Chhewang, former MP Thiksay Rinpoche, former minister Chering Dorjay Lakrook & other public representatives of Union Territory of Ladakh in New Delhi.”However, there has been no official word about the issues discussed at the meeting.A Home Ministry official said several issues and demands were discussed in the meeting. On September 22, the recently floated People’s Movement for Sixth Schedule for Ladakh, a powerful platform representing various politicians, religious and social organisations, announced the boycott of the upcoming elections to the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) Leh.The LAHDC Leh is scheduled to go to polls on October 16 — the first such exercise in the region after Ladakh was carved out from Jammu and Kashmir and granted the Union Territory status on August 5 last year following the abrogation of special status to the erstwhile state.The organisation had said it would boycott the LAHDC Leh elections till such time the constitutional safeguard under sixth schedule on the lines of Bodo Territorial Council is not extended to the UT Ladakh and its people, a veteran politician and former Lok Sabha MP Thupstan Chhewang said.Saturday’s meeting was also attended by Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju, Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla and Director of Intelligence Bureau Arvind Kumar.Highlighting the demand for legislative assembly, the group had said that the two existing Autonomous Hill Development Councils in Leh and Kargil districts should be sufficiently empowered to make necessary legislations and rules for areas under their jurisdiction with elected representatives having the final say.When the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two Union Territories after abrogation of Article 370, it was announced that the UT of Jammu and Kashmir would have a legislative assembly but UT of Ladakh would not have any legislature.

26-09-2020||New Delhi||Withdraw farm bills, guarantee MSP: Rahul to Centre||Stepping up its attack on the Centre over the farm bills passed by Parliament, the Congress Saturday ran a social media campaign, “Speak up for farmers”, with Rahul Gandhi demanding the government withdraw the proposed legislations and give a guarantee on MSP.The three bills were passed by both houses of Parliament during the Monsoon Session and are awaiting presidential assent.In a video message as part of the Congress’ ‘Speak up for farmers’ campaign, Gandhi told farmers they were being persistently “attacked”.जायज़ माँगे हैं किसानों की,देश की आवाज़ सुनो, मोदी जी।जय किसान, जय हिंदुस्तान।#SpeakUpForFarmers pic.twitter.com/wrKLbwkvhJ  “First demonetisation, then GST, then you were not given a single rupee at the time of coronavirus, attempt was being made to kill you (farmers), you are being made a slave of corporates, and now these three deadly Bills,” Gandhi said in his video message.These bills are aimed at finishing off farmers and hurt them, he alleged.“We are standing with you (farmers) and together we will stop these Bills,” Gandhi said.“I want to say to the government — you have made a very big mistake. If farmers hit the streets, it will result in tremendous damage. Don’t waste time, withdraw these laws immediately and give guarantee on MSP (minimum support price) to farmers,” the former Congress chief said.As part of the Congress’ ‘Speak up for farmers’ campaign on social media, several party leaders such as Priyanka Gandhi, KC Venugopal, P Chidambaram, Ahmed Patel, Salman Khurshid, Tariq Anwar, Sachin Pilot and Shashi Tharoor, posted videos expressing support for farmers and calling for the withdrawal of the bills.The video messages of various Congress leaders were posted on the party’s official Twitter handle with a hashtag ‘SpeakUpForFarmers’.Farmers from all over the country are unitedly raising their voices against the new agricultural bills, Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.“No provision of MSP in the bills, contract farming and mandi system being ended is like hitting the hard work of the farmers with an axe. Today, the whole of India is united against this injustice,” Priyanka Gandhi said.पूरे देश के किसान एकजुट होकर नए कृषि कानूनों के खिलाफ आवाज उठा रहे हैं।बिलों में एमएसपी का प्रावधान न होना, कॉन्ट्रैक्ट फार्मिंग और मंडी व्यवस्था का खात्मा किसानों की मेहनत पर कुल्हाड़ी चलाने जैसा है।इस अन्याय के विरूद्ध आज सारा भारत एकजुट है।#SpeakUpForFarmers pic.twitter.com/zSa0eiWPu5  “The hurry in passing these bills is only to favour the BJP’s crony capitalist friends... The Congress party is taking this agitation throughout the country to support our farmers,” said Venugopal, the Congress’ general secretary organisation.Chidambaram, in his remarks, said: “The APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) Act today is a safety net for a large section of farmers. The MSP is a price signal & the market takes a signal from MSP. These two Bills will eliminate MSP as a price signal & in the course of time the APMCs will wither & vanish.”Tharoor said the fact was that the farmers of the country were in a state of agitation and concern as the three bills had been “bulldozed” through Parliament by the BJP government.My words as part of ⁦@INCIndia⁩’s #SpeakUpForFarmers campaign: pic.twitter.com/wRRD2fC5Zq  In an earlier tweet, Gandhi said: “Let us raise our voices together against the atrocities and exploitation of farmers by the Modi government. Join the Speak Up For Farmers campaign through your video,” he said, tagging a video in which the party called for the withdrawal of the bills.मोदी सरकार द्वारा किसानों पर किए जा रहे अत्याचार और शोषण के ख़िलाफ़, आइये साथ मिलकर आवाज़ उठाएँ।अपने वीडियो के माध्यम से #SpeakUpForFarmers campaign से जुड़िए। pic.twitter.com/WyMfcVb1iP  The Congress, through its official Twitter handle, alleged the agriculture bills passed by the government in a “highly undemocratic manner are nothing but an attack on our farmers and an attempt to transform agriculture into another revenue stream for their crony capitalist friends”.Along with many other opposition parties, the Congress has claimed that the bills — Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 — will harm the interest of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government.The Centre has asserted the bills will be beneficial for farmers and increase their income.

This is my first meeting with you since I became the Prime Minister,” Rajapaksa said.“Even though we are not meeting face to face our historical friendship would continue to grow,” he said, adding that as the leader of the SAARC, India had taken the lead in fostering regional cooperation.“Prime Minister @narendramodi and I held a very successful Virtual Summit today to exchange views on the #SriLanka – #India bilateral cooperation.

26-09-2020||New Delhi/Seoul||PUBG mobile may remain banned in India despite Tencent licence withdrawal||India is unlikely to revoke a ban on PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) following PUBG Corp's decision to withdraw the mobile game's publishing rights in the country from China's Tencent, a senior government official said on Friday.PUBG, a popular online multiplayer battle game, was among 118 Chinese-origin mobile applications banned by New Delhi earlier this month.That led PUBG Corp, the unit of a South Korean firm behind the game, to announce it would no longer give Tencent Games the rights to publish the game in India. It also said it was exploring ways to provide gaming experiences to Indian users in the future.The new ownership structure is, however, unlikely to change things immediately, said the source, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media."The violent nature of the game has been the cause of many complaints from all quarters," the source said. "That does not change with the change in ownership rights." A spokeswoman for PUBG Corp in South Korea said the company was closely reviewing India's concerns and that it was ready to work on anything that needed improvement.The company has also been in talks with Jio Platforms, the digital unit of Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries, to bring the game back in its biggest market by users."We had initial talks with Jio Platforms to seek for cooperation opportunities, but nothing has been decided yet," the PUBG spokeswoman told Reuters.Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.While officially New Delhi says it has banned the apps because they collect user data and pose a threat to national security, the move is widely seen as a way to pressure Chinese tech companies following a months-long stand-off between India and China along a disputed Himalayan border. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pubg-mobile-may-remain-banned-in-india-despite-tencent-licence-withdrawal-146977

The US for instance has tried to commandeer supplies from all over the world only for its population while Russia has adopted a purely mercantilist approach based on the ability to pay. Speaking in Hindi via videoconferencing as the first speaker of the day, the Prime Minister eschewed confrontational issues, in marked contrast to the belligerent and vitriolic speeches by Pakistan PM Imran Khan and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Rather than responding to Imran Khan’s diatribes, PM Modi left that job to junior diplomats while exercising India’s right to reply.Once again making a case for India’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council, the PM adopted a tone of weariness on the same lines of the Palestinian delegate on Friday.  “How long would a country have to wait particularly when transformative changes in that country affect a large part of the world,” asked Modi.“Today people of India are concerned whether this reform process will ever reach its logical conclusion? For how long will India be kept out of the decision making process?” he reiterated.Indirectly contrasting India’s behaviour with that of some new rising powers, Modi said, “When we were strong we were never a threat to the world. When we were weak, we never became a burden on the world.”Pointing out that the world of 1945 was significantly different from today’s world, PM Modi said the form and the composition of UN at that time was in accordance with the prevailing situation of those times. But today the world is in a completely different era, where the requirements and challenges are vastly different from those of the past.“Therefore the international community today is faced with a very important question. Is the 1945 character of the institution even relevant today,” he asked while cautioning that “if we don’t change then the drive needed to bring change will also get weakened”.“One could say that we have successfully avoided a third world war but we cannot deny that there have been several wars and many more civil wars. Several terrorist attacks have completely shaken the world and rivers of blood have continued to flow by,” he pointed out.“Can we suggest that the efforts of the UN to tackle these issues are sufficient? For the last 8-9 months, the whole world has battled the pandemic. Where is the UN in this joint fight against the pandemic? Where is its effective response,” asked the Prime Minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-promises-to-share-covid-vaccine-with-rest-of-world-146971
26-09-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||A gentler proponent of laissez faire in economic policy||Isher Judge Ahluwalia’s biography, ‘Breaking Through — A Memoir’, will be read with more than a touch of poignancy as the author passed away within a month of its release.There is an added poignancy to the passing away of a brilliant economist in the midst of the country’s worst-ever economic crises and to not having been consulted by the powers that be.In her brilliant saris, coiffured hair and her presence at high visibility events, Isher Judge may have seemed to be the epitome of the Harvard-bred Khan Market Gang that the current regime deigns to shun.But as her book reveals, it was the hard work of this number nine of eleven children of a Punjabi pickle maker that propelled her with distinction through Presidency College, Delhi School of Economics and, finally MIT. Her mentors along the way: Bimal Jalan, Amartya Sen, Manmohan Singh and Paul Samuelson.A gentler proponent of laissez faire in economic policy Isher Ahluwalia was one of India’s distinguished economists, and author of an influential book ‘Industrial Growth in India’. She built up ICRIER, a fine economic think tank.Jairam RameshShe was among the young turks of economic liberalisation who along with her husband positioned themselves against the status quoits crowd of the licence-quota-permit-raj early on in her career.She was a distinguished economist whose life, work and contribution to economics are beautifully captured in her recently published autobiography, a must read for every student of economics. P ChidambaramThough the central governments of Congress persuasion absorbed the homilies that came from Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), an institution she built herself, her home state Punjab saw fit to requisition her services only in 2005 when Amarinder Singh was the Chief Minister.It is also a tribute to her mite in building up ICRIER that when she stepped down as Chairman on August 11, she was unanimously made its first Chairman-emeritus, never mind that this may not have been to the current regime’s liking.As was the case with her husband, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, there was just no doubt where they stood in the politics of economic development. But like their common guru Manmohan Singh, they never pushed the envelope of economic reforms too hard. There was always an acknowledgement from them that the other side’s story also has merit and needs to be listened to.Theirs was not a case of the converted preaching the gospel without the help of the bible. After speaking on outdated economic ideas being pushed in Indian universities, her book in 1985 on the mis-delivery of economic growth had marked her out as someone not afraid of speaking her mind while the more accomplished economists like Manmohan Singh refrained from showing the mirror to the then reigning economic czars.Her high noon of being involved in the government’s policy formulating circles lasted for a quarter of a century. With the advent of the BJP government, Isher Judge focused on ICRIER, encouraging her wards to keep pushing the boundaries of economic thought. Her recent co-authored series on economic possibilities in waste management were as much a gentle rap on the government’s knuckles as suggestive of the possibilities of monetising the Swachh Bharat concept.Though Isher Judge would have been supportive of all of PM Modi’s move to privatise the economy, one wonders if she would have approved its current ramrodding while lives have already been upended by Covid? Isher Judge also sought a similar end where the private sector occupies the commanding heights. But her means to achieving that aim were always gentler, gradual and persuasive.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-gentler-proponent-of-laissez-faire-in-economic-policy-146970

26-09-2020||Mumbai||Fear of second coronavirus wave as people moving out: Maha CM Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday expressed apprehensions of a "second wave" of coronavirus transmission as more people are moving out for work, and called for stricter compliance with norms.Speaking at a virtual meeting with ministers and officials of Marathwada and Nashik divisions on the COVID-19 situation, the CM expressed concerns over asymptomatic patients, allowed to remain at home, stepping out without proper precautions and infecting others.He said the focus should be on reducing the mortality rate.Thackeray directed officials to ensure that people follow health norms like wearing masks, and that violators be fined.Maharashtra's COVID-19 caseload stood at 13,00,757 as on September 25 while the cumulative death toll reached 34,761, as per the state health department."In Britain, asymptomatic positive patients are treated at home, but they are checked every day. They are shifted to hospitals, if needed. We are allowing asymptomatic patients to remain under home quarantine, but they are moving out and infecting others," the chief minister said."There is fear of a second wave (of coronavirus transmission) since more people are now moving out for work.There is a danger of senior citizens getting infected at their homes," he said.During his interaction with officials, Thackeray stressed the need to increase mass awareness, and tracing and testing."'My family, My Responsibility' is an important initiative in this regard. The campaign should become a health movement not just in our country but in the entire world," Thackeray said.He said proper protocol should be followed in treating COVID-19 patients, "and only medical prescription should be followed".He asked district-level task force comprising medical experts to remain in regular touch with the state-level task force.The CM called for roping in folk artists for spreading the message of awareness in various dialects.Thackeray said the number of RT-PCR tests needs to be increased."If results of antigen tests (for any person) return negative and symptoms prevail, then RT-PCR test is required and two swab samples need to be taken," he added.The COVID-19 RT-PCR test is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory specimens.The Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) directly detects the presence or absence of coronavirus antigen in the patient's body within 30 minutes.

26-09-2020||New Delhi||Indian 'Highway Men' wrap up travel series on just iPhone, iPad||Imagine shooting an entire travel vlogging series on an iPhone, edit it on an iPad Pro and you are done to showcase your digital masterpiece to the world which would have otherwise cost you a bomb, involving several crew members, specialised cameras, audio and video, fancy gimbals and more.Rocky Singh and Mayur Sharma, the acclaimed travellers and foodies whom we know as 'Highway Men,' took the daunting task to shoot a unique, digital-exclusive travel vlogging series titled #RoadTrippinWithRnM, with just an iPhone 11 Pro Max and an iPad Pro (for editing) in their kitty post-lockdown.They got behind the wheels for the 14-day road-trip across Rajasthan (with only a cameraperson), churning out over 60 minutes of content daily at over eight locations. They drove over 200 kms daily for a 16-hour-long day in the 40 degree Celsius heat, keeping the social distancing norms in mind."You won't believe this but no one has ever done this before. The entire #roadtrippinwithrnm journey was shot and edited only on an iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPad Pro. We had to maintain social distancing, so we found this the best way to go out in a vehicle and shoot," Mayur told IANS.According to Rocky, the whole digital experience was so awesome that they did not miss the hustle and bustle of being part of a TV show or long post-production hours."We never thought that just two Apple devices will be enough to produce such a wonderful series. It was seamless to work on these devices at your leisure and produce such a wonderful content. This is the future of creative content production for TV and cinema," Rocky said.The triple-camera system on iPhone 11 Pro Max takes Portrait mode to a new level with the ability to choose Wide and Telephoto framing, enabling Portrait mode with a wider field of view, great for taking portraits of multiple people.The next-generation Smart HDR uses advanced Machine Learning to recognise subjects in the frame and intelligently relight them for more natural-looking images with greater detail.While the new "True Tone" flash is over 30 per cent brighter. Deep Fusion is a new image processing system enabled by the Neural Engine of A13 Bionic chip.Deep Fusion uses advanced machine learning to do pixel-by-pixel processing of photos, optimizing for texture, details and noise in every part of the photo."We were able to control the shoot and edit on the two Apple devices and the final output was so superb that you will be left thrilled," Rocky said.The iPad Pro packs creative apps from Adobe, Autodesk and Procreate.For creative professionals, there is a high-performance USB-C connector that brings a whole new set of capabilities. They can connect iPad Pro to cameras, musical instruments, external monitors, even docks, and get data transfer done in a jiffy.Improvements to Photo Import and support for native RAW image editing give photographers efficient ways to work on the device."For us, it was like going back to the basics. This gives up hope at a time when the TV and film industry is suffering in the pandemic times," Rocky noted.The duo, who came to prominence with their TV show 'Highway on My Plate,' posted daily vlogs, pictures and engaged in Live Q&A sessions on social media while going through the 14-day road shooting trip.Result: Over 5.5 crore organic impressions and 16 million views in 14 days.The organic impressions are now nearing almost 10 crore."We are now looking to replicate the experience with exploring more such highways, like in Uttaranchal or Himachal Pradesh, hoping for more brands to relive the fantastic journey with us," Mayur said.

Jeyaraj and J. Benniks.A CBI spokesperson said that the agency filed the chargesheet against 9 then police officials—S. Sridhar, then Inspector and SHO, K. Balakrishnan, then SI, P. Raghuganesh, then SI, AS. Murugan, then HC, A. Samadurai, then HC, AM. Muthuraja, then Constable, S. Chelladurai, then Constable, X. Thomas Francis, then Constable and S. Veilumuthu, then Constable—all from Sathankulam Police Station in Tamil Nadu. The agency filed the chargesheet in a Madurai court under several sections of the Indian Penal Code.According to the CBI official one accused, then a Sub Inspector, died during investigation. The CBI registered two cases on July 7 related to the allegations of custodial death of the father-son duo of traders in Tamil Nadu’s Kovilpatti on the request of the Tamil Nadu government and further notification by the Centre.After registering the case, a CBI team camped continuously at Madurai and worked on the cases even through the Covid-19 pandemic.“CBI investigation revealed that the father-son duo were arrested in the evening of June 19 and allegedly tortured at the Sathankulam Police Station by the accused in the evening as well as in the intervening night, consequent to which both of them succumbed to the injuries and died in the intervening night of June 22-23,” the official said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-files-chargesheet-against-9-for-custodial-death-of-father-son-146948
26-09-2020||Patna||Ex-DGP of Bihar meets Nitish; speculations of joining politics intensify||Former Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar here on Saturday, lending credence to speculations that the IPS officer’s sudden move of taking VRS was propelled by the intention to join politics.Pandey, who stepped down as the state police chief less than a week ago, however, insisted that he had walked down to the state headquarters of the JD(U), headed by the Chief Minister, to “thank” Kumar for the trust reposed in him by the latter.“I discussed nothing political with the Chief Minister. I have worked with him for long and, after retirement, I just wanted to thank him for his support. If and when I decide to join any political party, I will make it known to all, Pandey told a posse of journalists waiting outside the JD(U) office at Birchand Patel Marg.Although the IPS officer, who took VRS less than half a year before he was scheduled to superannuate, has chosen to keep his cards close to the rest, the grapevine has it that he is all set to join the JD(U) and get a ticket from one of the assembly segments in his native district of Buxar.Reports in a section of the media also say that Pandey might be considered for the Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha seat where a by-poll has been necessitated by the death of sitting JD(U) MP Baidyanath Mahto.The JD(U) draws its support, largely, from among non-Yadav OBCs and Pasmanda Muslims. The party hopes that with the induction of Pandey it may be able to reach out to the Brahmins, traditionally supporters of the Congress who have gravitated towards the BJP of late.Pandey had hit the headlines recently for his vocal condemnation of the non-cooperation meted out to the Bihar police team that had visited Mumbai to probe the death by suicide of Patna-born actor Sushant Singh Rajput.With a candour that is usually not associated with bureaucrats, Pandey had lashed out at the municipal authourities in Mumbai when they had forcibly quarantined Vinay Tiwari, a young IPS officer from Patna who heading the investigating team until the probe was handed over to the CBI upon a request to the effect from the deceased actor’s father.Pandey’s comment, while he was still the DGP, that actress Rhea Chakraborty  accused of abetment to suicide by Rajput’s father did not have the ‘aukaat’ (standing) to make any snide remarks against Nitish Kumar was also much talked about.The Shiv Sena, which heads the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, had accused Pandey of acting as a political pawn of the ruling dispensation in Bihar ahead of the assembly elections.Shiv Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut on the former DGP’s VRS said he was running a political agenda with his statements on the Mumbai case and now he is going to receive his award.Maharashtra Home minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh Friday said that Pandey’s quitting the job confirmed his doubts that in Rajput’s death case he was making comments not as a DGP but as a BJP leader.Pandey has earlier brushed aside criticism from the Shiv Sena, saying “they keep saying many things, I don’t give much credence to it.”Pandey had resigned from service in 2009 to contest the Lok Sabha elections held that year. His resignation letter was, however, intriguingly not forwarded and he was reinstated into service a few months later.Earlier, on Tuesday, decks seemed to have been cleared for Pandey’s future move as his application for VRS received an expeditious approval from Governor Fagu Chauhan and an exception was made in his case with the waiver of a mandatory three-monthlong cooling off period for government servants. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-dgp-of-bihar-meets-nitish-speculations-of-joining-politics-intensify-146941
26-09-2020||New Delhi||Stubble burning: Kejriwal writes to Javadekar, suggests scaling up Indian Agri Research Inst's tech||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday wrote to Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, recommending scaling up the use of a low-cost technology developed by scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) here to deal with stubble burning.“IARI scientists have developed a chemical that decomposes stubble and turns it into manure. There is no need for farmers to burn stubble,” Kejriwal said.Experts at the institute have developed what they call as “decomposer capsules”. Just four capsules can be used to prepare 25 litres of a solution, using some jaggery and chickpea flour, enough to cover one hectare of land.“Scientists say stubble burning reduces soil fertility by killing the good bacteria present in it. But if the crop residue can be turned into manure, the use of fertilizers can be reduced,” the letter read.Kejriwal said this method can be a good solution to the problem of stubble-burning and the city government is going to use it at a large scale to ensure there are "absolutely no farm fires" in the national capital.He recommended Delhi's neighbouring states should be encouraged to use it as much as possible.“I understand that there is not much time left this year. But if we come together, we will be able to stop stubble burning to some extent. Farmers in the neighboring states should be encouraged to use this technology as much as possible,” he said.Kejriwal acknowledged the Centre and states' efforts to reduce stubble burning, but said the focus has been on crop residue management through machinery.“The Centre has been providing subsidy on farm equipment, still farmers are required to spend a lot of money from their own pocket,” he said.There are a lot of farmers who do not have machines to manage crop residue. They burn it instead. This method (decomposer capsules) can reduce the use of fertilizers and increased crop production, which is a win-win situation for farmers, he said.The chief minister also sought time from the Union minister to discuss the issue with him.Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh attract attention during the paddy harvesting season between October 15 and November 15.Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left behind after harvesting and before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR.Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes paddy residue. Farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it.Farmers in Haryana burnt 1.23 million tonnes out of the 7 million tonnes of paddy residue produced.Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to defy it as there is a short window between harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat.The high cost of manual or mechanical management of straw is a major reason why farmers choose to burn it.State governments are providing 50 to 80 per cent subsidy to farmers and cooperative societies to buy modern farm equipment for in-situ management of paddy straw, installing paddy straw-based power plants and running a massive awareness campaign against stubble-burning.But these measures are yet to make any significant impact on ground.

Party leaders said all efforts had been made to maintain a regional balance with adequate representation to all prominent States.The most prominent changes are in the list of eight general secretaries, the crucial organisational position that serves as the link between the states and the central leadership, which now has five new faces including Punjab’s Tarun Chugh.Chugh is a national secretary in the outgoing team and his elevation is being viewed with a lot of interest in the wake of the BJP’s recent fallout with Punjab ally Akali Dal over farm bills. It is being seen as a BJP’s effort towards projecting leadership in the State which it has so far been contesting with the Akalis as the senior partner. Notably, Punjab has another representation in the form of former IPS officer Iqbal Singh Lalpura as national spokesperson.Though Haryana does not have direct representation in the team, newly-appointed General Secretary Dushyant Kumar Gautam (Rajya Sabha MP) has a connection to the state.Dr Narendra Singh from Jammu and Kashmir is the national secretary in ‘Team Nadda’ in which senior leaders Bhupender Yadav (MP, Rajasthan), Arun Singh (MP, Uttar Pradesh) and Kailash Vijayvargiya (Madhya Pradesh) have been retained as General Secretary and Ram Madhav, P Muralidhar Rao, Saroj Pandey and Anil Jain dropped to make way for Chugh (Punjab), Gautam (MP, Delhi), D Purandareswari (Andhra Pradesh), CT Ravi (Karnataka) and Dilip Saikia (Assam).Young and fiery advocate of ‘Hindutva plank’ Tejasvi Surya has made an entry as the president of the party’s youth wing in place of Poonam Mahajan.Nadda also expanded the list of spokespersons to 23, with Rajya Sabha MP and current media head Anil Baluni being elevated as the chief spokesperson. Others on the list include former ministers Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Shahanawaz Hussain and former Congress leader from Kerala Tom Vadakkan.Uttar Pradesh leader Rajesh Agarwal has been appointed treasurer in place of union minister Piyush Goyal while Mandsaur MP Sudhir Gupta will be his deputy. Amit Malviya has been retained as the IT cell and social media in charge.Other appointments include K Laxman as head of the Other Backward Classes Morcha, Jamal Siddiqui as chief of the minority wing and Lal Singh Arya as chief of the SC (Scheduled Castes) Morcha and Fatehpur Sikri MP Rajkumar Chahar as the head of the Kisan Morcha Radha Mohan Singh, Mukul Roy, Rekha Verma, Annapurna Devi, Bharti Shiyal, DK Aruna, M Chuba Ao, AP Abdullakutty were appointed national vice presidents in the reshuffle.The party also made clear its focus areas, including West Bengal, Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, by giving place to West Bengal leader Mukul Roy and Vinod Tawade and Pankaja Munde of Maharashtra in the team.  Punjab’s Aviansh Rai Khanna, Uma Bharti, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Prabhat Jha, Om Prakash Mathur, Shyam Jaju were among those dropped from the list.Changes are also expected in the Parliamentary Board — the BJP’s highest decision-making body — where there are vacancies due to the passing away of senior leaders Ananth Kumar, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley and the election of veteran leader M Venkaiah Naidu to the post of the Vice-President of the country.Prime Minister Narendra Modi greeted the new team of office-bearers and expressed confidence that they would uphold the “glorious tradition” of the party of serving the people of India selflessly and with dedication.“Congratulations and best wishes to the new team. I am confident they will uphold the glorious tradition of our party of serving the people of India selflessly and with dedication. May they work hard to empower the poor and marginalised,” he tweeted.Congratulations and best wishes to the new team.

Some leaders also appear to have been dropped for reasons like “making comments that were not appreciated by the senior leadership and non-performance”.“It is customary for the new president to have a new team,” they stressed, adding that the “team has a mix of new and existing to ensure the continuity”.Though the buzz also is that some of those who have been dropped could make an entry in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Council of Ministers. Prime Minister Modi greeted the new team and expressed confidence that they would uphold the “glorious tradition” of the party of serving the people of India selflessly and with dedication.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jp-nadda-announces-new-team-of-bjps-national-office-bearers-146933

Later, he was found in his car with a bullet injury, the official said.The ADG said investigations are on and clean chit has not been given either to the suspended SP or anyone else.The SIT has sent the preliminary report to the DGP, he added.The trader was attacked days after he had levelled allegations of corruption against the then Mahoba SP.Ravikant had alleged that Patidar had demanded a bribe of Rs 6 lakh from his brother and threatened to kill him or send him to jail in case of non-payment.“My brother uploaded a video on social media on September 7 and 8...  after a few hours on Tuesday (September 8), he was found in his car with a bullet injury,” he had said.On September 9, Patidar was suspended with immediate effect by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on corruption charges.The chief minister had also ordered a vigilance probe into the properties of Patidar.Ballast transporters had accused the then SP of demanding money from them for allowing transportation of material.

She will also be asked if she sent those messages or someone on her behalf sent the alleged messages enquiring about "maal" from Karishma.The sources said that the NCB will also ask Deepika, who is the daughter of badminton icon Prakash Padukone, if she used to consume drugs, if yes, from where she used to procure them and who made the payment for the drugs.The NCB will also ask her if she was procuring the drugs for her personal consumption or someone else and since when she has been using these substances and who all were the persons who provided her with these drugs.She will also be asked for how long she has known Karishma and Sushant's former talent manager Jaya Saha, who worked with Kwan Talent Management Agency.Similarly, Shraddha, who is the daughter of actor Shakti Kapoor, will be asked about her alleged chats with Saha to get the CBD oil.The NCB source said that she will be asked since when she was procuring drugs and for whom and whether she consumed them and who paid for them.The source said that Shraddha, who starred with Sushant in "Chichhore", will also be questioned about her visits to the Pawna resort, where the alleged drugs party was hosted, along with Sushant.She will be asked for how long she knew Sushant and did they consume drugs together and who procured the drugs for the parties, and who made the payment for them.Meanwhile, Sara, daughter of actor Saif Ali Khan, is also being questioned in the case and will be asked if she too consumed drugs. Sara's troubles began after Sushant's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty in a television interview claimed that the late actor got into the habit of smoking marijuana during the shooting of "Kedarnath".Sara and Sushant were the lead actors of "Kedarnath".Sara will also be questioned if she knew of the drug usage by Sushant during the shooting of the film and from where these drugs came and who paid for them.The NCB has already recorded the statement of Sushant's former manager Shruti Modi, Bollywood actor Rakul Preet Singh, Dharma Productions former executive producer Kshitij Prasad Ravi, Kwan Talent Management Agency CEO Dhruv Chitgopekar, producer Madhu Mantena Varma and several others.The NCB has arrested Rhea, her brother Showik, Sushant's house manager Samuel Miranda, personal staff Dipesh Sawant and 16 drug peddlers in the case.The NCB registered a case under the NDPS Act after the Enforcement Directorate (ED), probing a money laundering case linked to the death of Sushant on the basis of a Bihar Police FIR, wrote to the NCB.

26-09-2020||Mumbai||Prostitution not an offence, its public solicitation is: Bombay High Court||Observing that prostitution was not a criminal offence under the law, and that an adult woman had the right to choose her vocation, the Bombay High Court has ordered immediate release of three women sex workers detained at a state corrective institution in Mumbai.In an order passed on Thursday, a bench of Justice Prithviraj Chavan said that prostitution had not been considered a criminal offence under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956.He said that prostitution by itself was not an offence and did not entail a punishment. Instead, its public solicitation was the offence defined under the Act.Justice Chavan was hearing a plea filed by the three women challenging an order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate, Mazgaon, that had upheld their detention at a local correctional facility against their will.As per the HC order, the women, all in their twenties, were picked up by the police in September last year following a raid at a guest house.The middleman was arrested and booked under the Act.The three women were held as “victims” and sent to the correctional facility.Subsequently, the mothers and other legal guardians of the three women approached the magistrate’s court seeking their custody.The magistrate however, declined to give their custody to their guardians.Justice Chavan, however, set aside the magistrate’s order.He said that the women were “adults,” and “entitled to their fundamental right to move freely and choose their own vocation”.The high court held that since the women were not being prosecuted under the law, there was no question of continuing their detention at the correctional home.“Even otherwise, the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 does not empower the Magistrate to hold the custody of the victims beyond the period of three weeks without there being any final order to that effect after following due process of law,” the HC said.It further said that there was nothing on record to show that the petitioners were seducing any person for the purpose of prostitution or that they were running a brothel.“There is no provision under the law, which makes prostitution per se a criminal offence or punishes a person because he indulges in prostitution,” it said.“What is punishable under the Act is sexual exploitation or abuse of a person for commercial purpose and to earn the bread thereby. And where a person is carrying on prostitution in a public place or when a person is found soliciting or seducing another person as defined under the Act,” the court said.

26-09-2020||Mumbai||Kangana bungalow: Did you act in other cases with same speed, HC asks BMC||The Bombay High Court on Friday asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) if it showed the "same swiftness" in other cases of unauthorised construction as it showed in demolishing parts of Kangana Ranaut's bungalow.A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and R I Chagla was hearing Ranaut's petition against the demolition carried out at her Pali Hill bungalow here by the BMC on September 9.The Bollywood actor's lawyer, senior counsel Birendra Saraf, told the court that the BMC gave her just 24 hours to respond to its stop-work notice.The civic body started demolition without giving her adequate time to respond, he said, adding that it also did not make any entry about alleged illegalities at Ranaut's bungalow in its detection report, as is mandatory.The lawyer also questioned the "timing of the demolition," and claimed that Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had said in an interview to a news channel on September 8 that "what is law? we need to teach Kangana a lesson".Ranaut had crossed swords with the Sena, which controls the BMC, earlier with her critical comments."Effectively on the same day at 3.30 pm, the BMC officials reached the bungalow for inspection," Saraf said.On September 9, the order of demolition was passed and pasted at the property's entrance at 10.34 am, but "the officials of the Corporation along with the requisite machinery were present at the site in full force at 10.19 am," Saraf said.At this the bench asked senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, who appeared for the BMC, if alleged illegalities had been recorded in the detection register.When the BMC lawyer replied in the affirmative, the bench asked, "We want to know if the demolition has taken place in those cases (other entries in the detection register) with the same swiftness."Justice Kathawalla then also remarked in jest whether the demolition happened "in the way Advocate Pradeep Thorat's client (Sanjay Raut) wanted".On September 9 too, when Ranaut first approached Bombay HC and the court stayed the demolition, Justice Kathawalla had questioned the BMC's speedy action.It had said if the civic body showed the same swiftness in other cases, the city would be a very different place.The court on Friday asked Ranaut's lawyer to submit photos and other material to show if the portions demolished by the BMC existed prior to January 2020.The bench said it wanted to find out if the demolished part -- whether legal or not -- was under construction, or if it had been constructed in the past.This is a key point as the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act's section 354 A empowers the civic body and its officials to stop any "ongoing" illegal construction.Ranaut has already stated in her amended petition that she had photos from a pooja ceremony conducted in January 2020 and photos from Elle Dcor magazine issue of April-May 2020 which show that demolished portions existed back then.Therefore, the BMC's allegation that illegal work was going on was false, her plea said.Advocate Saraf told the bench on Friday that when the civic body served a demolition notice, only some waterproofing work was going on and she had the requisite permissions.He also pointed out that the photos of `ongoing work' submitted in court by the BMC on Friday did not have any digital time stamp but only a note dating them to September 5.The court asked Chinoy to instruct the BMC officer who took the photos to submit his phone to the court, so that it can be ascertained when the photos were taken.The court also noted that the BMC in its affidavit had said that Ranaut had changed the position of the entrance of the ground floor, but many more things on the ground floor were demolished."What we are thinking is, how was the ground floor demolished if there is no ongoing work there," it said."Whatever they have alleged in the affidavit regarding the ground floor, is all already done (in the past). So how was the ground floor demolished," it asked.The arguments will continue on Monday.

26-09-2020||---||India, Sri Lanka set 11-point agenda to improve ties||New Delhi, September 26Prime Minister Narendra Modi resolved to pursue closer bilateral ties with his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa through a mutually agreed 11-point agenda that will seek to address important issues like the Tamil question, ban on Indian imports, the Colombo port project and harassment of fishermen.Most of the 11 points stated in the joint statement, touched on programmes to provide social and medical assistance to Sri Lanka, including a $ 100-million credit line, step up people-to-people contact and increase coordination between their militaries and security agencies.They also resolved to improve the environment for trade and investment, look into the import bans imposed by Sri Lanka and deepen the integration of supply chains.Mahinda Rajapaksa gave no firm assurance on Indo-Japanese involvement in the Colombo Port project seen as a counter balance to Hambantota port being allotted to the Chinese. Nor was there a firm commitment to resolving the Tamil question almost a decade after the end of the civil war.Also read: Rajapaksa praises Modi for cooperation, hand of friendship during virtual summitOn the Port project, the joint statement merely resolved to work towards the “early realisation of infrastructure and connectivity projects” through bilateral agreements and MoUs.In response to PM Modi’s call on the Sri Lankan government to address the aspirations of the Tamil people, Rajapaksa eschewed any commitment on the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. “Sri Lanka will work towards realising the expectations of all ethnic groups, including Tamils,” he responded.The interaction saw considerable focus on the soft aspects of diplomacy such as exploring opportunities in common heritage such as Buddhism, Ayurveda and Yoga. PM Modi announced in this respect that a delegation of Buddhist pilgrims from Sri Lanka will be aboard the inaugural international flight to the sacred city of Kushinagar, which has recently been announced as an International Airport. PM Modi also announced a grant $ 15 million for promoting Buddhist ties between the two countries.The two leaders also agreed to facilitate tourism by enhancing connectivity and by early establishment of an air bubble.They also resolved to strengthen cooperation between the armed forces through personal visits, maritime security cooperation and support to Sri Lanka in the spheres of defence and security.Recognising that BIMSTEC is an important platform for regional cooperation linking South Asia with South East Asia, both leaders agreed to work together to ensure a successful BIMSTEC Summit to be hosted under the Chairmanship of Sri Lanka.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-sri-lanka-set-11-point-agenda-to-improve-ties-146870

Showik’s name surfaced during the interrogation of alleged drug peddler Basit PariharThe probe into drugs angle of the Rajput death case led the bureau to the discovery of several “linkages” or drug supply networks, he said. The NCB is probing the drugs case related to Rajput’s death as well as an alleged nexus between Bollywood and drug peddlers. Showik Chakraborty’s name came up during the interrogation of alleged drug peddler Basit Parihar, a resident of suburban Bandra, the official said.Focus shifted from CBI probe, says lawyerNew Delhi: The pace of the CBI probe into Sushant’s death has suddenly slowed down and all attention is being diverted to drugs-related issues with the NCB conducting “fashion parade” of Bollywood stars, the actor’s family lawyer Vikas Singh alleged on Friday. “Today, we are helpless as we don’t know which direction the case is going in,” he said. PTIParihar allegedly revealed that he used to procure bud (a curated form of marijuana) and weed for his friend Showik. During questioning, Showik accepted that he used to procure weed and bud through Parihar and Kaizan Ebrahim and pass them to his sister Rhea who gave it to Sushant, the official said.Rajput’s manager Samuel Miranda and cook Dipesh Sawant used to collect the contraband and make `joints’ (marijuana cigarettes) for the deceased actor, he claimed.The starting point of the entire probe was some WhatsApp chats about drugs that the Enforcement Directorate came across in its money laundering probe against Rhea and her family.The ED informed the NCB about these conversations.

26-09-2020||New Delhi||Bihar Assembly poll unlikely to be cakewalk for NDA allies||While the BJP swept the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it has not been doing so well in Assembly elections since 2018. Beginning with Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in 2018, the trend continued in Maharashtra, Haryana, Delhi and Jharkhand in 2019, a cause for concern. And this despite a spectacular performance in the General Elections earlier in the year spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.‘Anti-incumbency’Observers say CM Nitish faces anti-incumbency due to floods and damage to farm land. Agriculture reforms may also affect resultsIssues of backward class, Muslims, etc., besides caste related issues may be the deciding factorThe Election Commission (EC) today announced the three-phase schedule beginning October 28 for the Bihar elections for which the counting will take place on November 10. Notably, the result from neighbouring Jharkhand in 2019 was partly attributed to a substantial dip in the BJP's vote share in urban areas.This may worry the NDA allies in Bihar (BJP, JD-U and LJP) who are yet to resolve seat-sharing and other issues. The BJP believes it has an upper hand given the state of the Opposition in Bihar but political observers believe the ground situation in Bihar, like it was in Jharkhand, is far from what it appears.Observers say Sushant Singh Rajput and Ram Mandir are not an issue for the state where anything related to castes still has the potential to change the scenario as it happened in 2015. The bottom line is votes of backward classes, Muslims, etc., and their issues will decide the fate of parties. The contentious agriculture reforms also have the potential to form another cornerstone.However, BJP leaders, who expect great dividends from the agri-reforms, claim the MSP and APMC are not an issue in Bihar.This apart, while upper castes have grievances against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, it seems migrants who returned home amid the Covid lockdown are also not too happy with him. Besides the massive anti-incumbency faced by Nitish Kumar, floods and damage to farm land are other issues that are expected to affect the results.BJP’s focus areas include PM Narendra Modi’s self-reliance pitch (atmanirbhar Bihar) and monetary help, rations and MGNREGA jobs for migrants after they reached Bihar in the lockdown. With JD-U 's Nitish Kumar as face, BJP president JP Nadda is learnt to have asked party MPs to work not only for ensuring victory for saffron candidates but also nominees of all NDA constituents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-assembly-poll-unlikely-to-be-cakewalk-for-nda-allies-146701

Winter has kicked in at the Ladakh heights, and the intent of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is being assessed following the September 22 joint statement. Both sides had agreed not to add any more troops along the frontline and refrain from unilaterally changing the ground situation.If China does not pull back, the troops and war-waging equipment could very well be the new normal along the LAC. New Delhi is clear that it’s not pulling back its troops till the PLA agrees to do the same. “Our troops are better acclimatised than those of the PLA to survive the winter at an altitude of more than 14,000 ft and they are being provided the best survival gear,” a senior functionary said.India has laid out three parameters for judging the LAC situation: one, disengagement of troops by both sides and not being within rifle-shot range of each other; two, pulling back troops, equipment to the April position; and three, restoration of patrolling points along the LAC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-signs-of-pullback-at-lac-146676

26-09-2020||Chandigarh||SP Balasubrahmanyam soulful voice captured hearts of millions||Sometime all you can do is pray. So for nearly two months, his admirers prayed for his recovery, but Covid-19 finally consumed the versatile singer SP Balasubrahmanyam, also lovingly called Balu or SPB, on Friday.Singers come and go... but Balasubrahmanyam was not just a phenomenon but an institution unto himself. With more than 40,000 songs under his belt, his discography runs like a book of records. A powerhouse in the South with a host of achievements, the rest of India woke up to his voice in 1981 with Kamal Haasan-starrer Ek Duuje Ke Liye. He won the National Award for best male playback singer for the song Tere mere beech main.Music composer Laxmikant may have been hesitant about signing him for Ek Duuje Ke Liye, but later Bollywood welcomed him more than once. If in Tamil film industry his partnership with music maestro Ilaiyaraaja firmed up his position, in Hindi film industry he became the voice of Salman Khan. With duets like Didi tera devar deewana, his popularity soared. For someone who knew AR Rahman as a toddler, he went on to sing in his film Roja too.Born on June 4, 1946, at Konetampet in Tamil Nadu, he inherited musical talent from his father SP Sambamurthy, an exponent of ‘Harikatha’. Besides six National Awards, he received honours such as Padma Bhushan. Best known for lending an emotional feel to songs, he elevated even regular numbers to another level.The felicity for languages came naturally to him — he sang in over a dozen languages. Believing that every singer is an actor, Balu also played character roles in 45 films.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sp-balasubrahmanyam-soulful-voice-captured-hearts-of-millions-146681
26-09-2020||New Delhi||I didn’t blame Anushka for Virat’s failures: Gavaskar||Sunil Gavaskar today said he did not blame Virat Kohli’s wife Anushka Sharma for Kohli’s failures as a batsman, adding that his remarks made during an IPL match were being “misinterpreted”.Yesterday Kohli had a bad day in Royal Challengers Bangalore’s loss to Kings XI Punjab as he dropped KL Rahul twice and then scored only one run off five balls.When Kohli was batting, Gavaskar said: “He knows that the more he practises the better he will be. And during the lockdown, he has only practised against the bowling of Anushka as seen in that video. That is not going to be enough.” Anushka was upset by the comment, saying it was “distasteful”.Gavaskar today said his comments were in reference to a video clip which showed Kohli and Anushka playing tennis ball cricket in their compound. “I’m not blaming her. I am only saying that the video showed she was bowling to Virat. Virat has only played that much bowling in this lockdown period,” Gavaskar said. “It is tennis ball fun game that people have to pass time during the lockdown, so that’s all... So where am I blaming her for Virat’s failures?”Gavaskar said he has never been sexist. “I’m the one who has always batted for wives going with husbands on tours. I am the one who has always said that like a normal guy going to office for a 9-5 job, when he comes back home, he comes back to his wife, similarly why can’t cricketers have their wives with them?” he said. — TNS, agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-didnt-blame-anushka-for-virats-failures-gavaskar-146767
