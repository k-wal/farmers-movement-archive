10-09-2020||New Delhi||People must take course in criminal trial before joining journalism, remarks HC||People must take a course in criminal trial and then get into journalism, was how an annoyed Delhi High Court remarked while expressing displeasure over the alleged parallel investigation being run by journalist Arnab Goswami on his TV channel in connection with Congress leader Shashi Tharoor’s wife Sunanda Pushkar’ death case.The high court, which observed responsible journalism is the need of the time, said it was not saying that anyone will gag the media but at the same time, sanctity of investigation must be maintained.“Can the media sit in appeal against the charge sheet filed by an investigating agency? Justice Mukta Gupta asked.“It is not a reflection on the Plaintiff (Tharoor) but the investigating agency. Can there be a parallel investigation or trial?.. Would you not like the courts to take their own course?,” the judge asked.The high court was hearing an application by Congress MP Tharoor seeking interim injunction against Goswami, Editor-in-Chief of Republic TV, from making defamatory remarks against the leader.Tharoor’s grievance relates to broadcast of the programmes naming him on the TV channel in July and August and in the telecast, the journalist has claimed that they have investigated Sunanda Pushkar case better than the police and that he still has no doubt that Pushkar was murdered.The high court expressed its displeasure over the claims made by the journalist when the trial in the criminal case was still pending.“People must take a course in criminal trial and then get into journalism,” the judge remarked.“Please show restraint. Once the police investigation is going on in the criminal case, there cannot be a parallel investigation by the media,” the judge said.The high court referred to December 1, 2017 order passed in the matter in which it was stated that “Press cannot ‘convict anyone’ or insinuate that he/she is guilty or make any other unsubstantiated claims. Press has to exercise care and caution while reporting about matters under investigation or pending trial.”Pushkar was found dead in a suite of a five-star hotel in south Delhi on the night of January 17, 2014 under mysterious circumstances.Tharoor has alleged that they continued to engage in “defaming and maligning” him despite an assurance given by their counsel in the court on May 29, 2017.

10-09-2020||New Delhi||LAC standoff: Army further strengthens dominance at strategic heights of Pangong lake area||The Indian Army has further bolstered its dominance over a number of strategic heights overlooking key Chinese-held positions around Pangong lake area in eastern Ladakh even as brigade commanders and commanding officers of the two militaries held separate talks to cool tensions in the region, government sources have said.They said additional reinforcements have been made in hilltops and strategic locations around Pangong lake to keep a hawk-eye vigil on Chinese-held position of Finger 4.The mountainous spurs in the area are referred to as Finger. China has been holding onto Finger 4 to 8 on the north bank of Pangong lake, the sources said.Also read: Jaishankar, Chinese counterpart Wang meet amid rising border tensionsThe Indian Army has occupied several key heights in the strategically located Rezang-La and Reqin-La areas on the southern bank of the lake since the end of August.The sources said the two armies held separate talks at brigade commander-level as well as between commanding officers in the general area of Chushul.“The focus was to bring down the temperatures,” said a source.Tension escalated manifold in eastern Ladakh following fresh face-offs between Indian and Chinese troops in Mukhpari area of Rezang-La ridgeline on Monday evening.The Indian Army on Tuesday said Chinese troops attempted to close in on an Indian position near the southern bank of Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh the previous evening and fired shots in the air, a first such instance of bullets being used along the LAC after a gap of 45 years.The Army said this in a statement after the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) late on Monday night alleged that Indian troops crossed the LAC and “outrageously fired” warning shots near the Pangong lake.The incident of Monday evening was considered serious as the previous instance of shots being fired at the de-facto border was in 1975. Provisions of an agreement of 1996 and another signed in 2005 mandate the two sides not to use firearms during any confrontation.MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava at a media briefing on Thursday reiterated India’s position that it was committed to resolve the current situation through peaceful negotiation.“Both India and China are in regular touch through diplomatic and military channels to resolve the situation. This was the consensus when the two Defence Ministers met,” he said.The border situation deteriorated again after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong Lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.India occupied a number of strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong lake and strengthened its presence in Finger 2 and Finger 3 areas in the region to thwart any Chinese actions.China has strongly objected to India's move. However, India has maintained that the heights are on its side of the LAC.India has also rushed in additional troops and weapons to the sensitive region following China’s transgression attempts.Following China’s fresh attempts to change the status quo in the southern bank of Pangong lake, India has further bolstered its military presence in the region.

10-09-2020||---||Contempt plea against Rajdeep Sardesai for his tweets against SC||New Delhi, September 10A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against India Today Consulting Editor and former Editors Guild of India chief Rajdeep Sardesai for allegedly scandalising the judiciary by his tweets against the court and its judges.Petitioner Astha Khurana has also sent an application to Attorney General KK Venugopal seeking his consent for the initiation of contempt proceedings against Sardesai for allegedly disrespecting the Supreme Court.Venugopal had last month urged the top court not to punish activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan. He had also refused sanction to initiate contempt against actor Swara Bhaskar over her alleged remarks on the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict, saying her comments did not amount to attack on the judiciary.Astha cited many of Sardeai’s tweets. In one such tweet posted on August 31 on Prashant Bhushan contempt case, he allegedly said: “Breaking: Rs 1 token fine imposed by SC on @pbhushan1 in contempt case.. if he doesn’t pay it, then 3 months jail sentence! Clearly, court looking to wriggle out of an embarrassment of its own making.”Pointing out other comments by the senior journalist with regard to Prashant Bhushan's case, the petitioner contends that he "tried to spread feeling of no confidence on the Hon'ble Court amongst public and even stated the apology by the Hon'ble Court for its recent judgments”.In another tweet on August 14, Sardesai allegedly compared the Prashant Bhushan case verdict to habeas corpus petitions of persons detained in Kashmir. In yet another tweet he allegedly cast certain aspersions on Justice Arun Mishra who retired on September 2.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contempt-plea-against-rajdeep-sardesai-for-his-tweets-against-sc-139299

India will sit in the most powerful UN organ, for two years beginning on January 1.“Pleasure to meet FM Sergey Lavrov, this time in person. Excellent talks that reflect our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership. Value our exchanges on the international situation,” Jaishankar tweeted on Wednesday after his talks with Lavrov.On his part, Lavrov said, “It is a very good, and almost forgotten, feeling to meet in person.”      “We appreciate this opportunity to discuss prospects for developing our strategic partnership in all areas: bilateral relations and cooperation within the SCO, BRICS, the UN and via other international platforms,” he said.This was the first physical meeting between the two leaders after the COVID-19 situation and there was excellent discussion on bilateral matters, regional developments and international issues of concern, Srivastava said.The SCO meeting could not be held earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic.India and Russia have a special and privileged strategic partnership and this year marks the 20 years of their strategic partnership.Last week, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh met with his Russian counterpart Gen. Sergey Shoigu in Moscow during which he appreciated the “steadfast support” provided by Russia in response to the country’s defence and security needs.Singh, who was on a three-day visit to Russia to attend a crucial meeting of the SCO, pressed for expediting supply of a number of weapons systems, ammunition and spares to India by Russia under contracts which were concluded earlier.

10-09-2020||New Delhi||Strong, stable Northeast key to building self-reliant India: FS Shringla||Asserting that a strong and stable Northeast was the key to building a self-reliant India, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Thursday said the government was working to improve the infrastructure and connectivity in the northeastern states while also facilitating greater regional integration.The government has a vision for this region that is captured in the 3 Cs — Connectivity, Commerce, and Cultural Commonalities, Shringla said at a webinar on “Self-Reliant India: Reimagining the North East India in terms of Employment and Skill”.“In partnership with our neighbours and friends to the east, we are working to improve the infrastructure and connectivity in our north-eastern states while also facilitating greater regional integration,” he said.Shringla cited various examples of cooperation with countries like Japan and Bangladesh to enhance connectivity and ensure economic modernisation of the north-eastern states.A new railway link between Akhaura in Bangladesh and Agartala and Tripura is under construction, he said in his keynote address at the webinar organised by the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India (ICFAI) University.Nationals of the two countries can not only travel onboard the Maitree and Bandhan Express to each others’ countries but on buses plying between Shillong and Dhaka and between Agartala and Kolkata via Dhaka, he said.“We are upgrading the infrastructure of Land Customs Stations for enabling smooth cross-border movement of goods and people,” he said.There had been a considerable augmentation of the inland water transport that links the Northeast to Bangladesh, Shringla said.“The general trend indicated by this listing is also applicable to other neighbours such as Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar. For example, in Myanmar, we are working on the Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project and the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway Project connecting the North East with Myanmar and Thailand,” he said.“We work not just bilaterally to promote these linkages but also multilaterally and plurilaterally. I would like to draw your attention to two such configurations —  the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and the Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN),” he said.While road and rail connectivity have improved significantly, there is also a need to focus on air connectivity in the region, he said.The positive cascading effects of improved connectivity brought trade and investment, Shringla said, adding that they also brought employment opportunities.The potential of mutually beneficial resources and of generating common economic spaces was evident in another area — energy, he said.Noting that Bangladesh currently imports 1160 MW of power through adjoining states in India, he said hydrocarbons would flow through an India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline.“A strong, stable and prosperous North East is key to building a Self-Reliant India. The Act East Policy of the Prime Minister provides an effective means to achieve it,” Shringla asserted.“The realisation of this dream brings together various ministries of the government of India, as also the state governments, which are both implementing agencies and beneficiaries at the ground level,” he said.

10-09-2020||New Delhi||TV show on ‘rising number of Muslims in UPSC’: I&B ministry points to ‘no pre-censorship’ norm, channel says will air it on Friday||The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has asked Sudarshan News, whose controversial programme promo claiming a “big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service” came under judicial scrutiny, to ensure that the show does not violate the laid-down programme code, while noting that there is no pre-censorship of any programme telecast on TV channels.The channel headed by Suresh Chavhanke claimed vindication of its stance and said in a statement that it will air the programme “Bindas Bol” on alleged Muslims’ “infiltration” in UPSC on Friday at 8 pm.The programme had come under judicial scrutiny before the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court last month.The apex court had refused to impose a pre-broadcast ban on Sudarshan TV from telecasting “Bindas Bol”, but the high court in an interim order stayed the telecast of the show.Acting on complaints over the show’s promo, the I&B Ministry had issued a notice to Sudarshan News asking it to clarify about the show in context of the Programme Code enshrined under Cable Television Network Rules, 1994.The Delhi High Court had restrained the channel from telecasting the programme which was scheduled to be on air at 8 pm on August 28, the ministry said in its order.The court had asked the channel to submit its reply to the ministry notice.The Central government shall decide on the notice remaining uninfluenced by any observations made by the court and either party shall be entitled to challenge the order passed by the Central government, the ministry order dated September 9 said quoting the high court directives.In its reply, the first point raised by Sudarshan News that the ministry’s notice is based on content in social media platforms which is not a subject matter of the ministry, does not hold ground as the promo was telecast on the Sudarshan TV channel, the I&B Ministry order said.The second contention of the channel was that the ministry cannot do pre-censorship of a programme, and a programme cannot be stopped or prohibited from being telecast.“As per norm, there is no pre-censorship of a programme telecast on TV channels (other than films, film song or film promo or film trailer, which have to be pre-certified by CBFC),” the order said.“Reference is invited to section 20 of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. Sub-section (3) provides that where the Central Government is of the opinion that any programme of any channel is not in conformity with the prescribed programme code referred to in section 5 (of the act), it may by order, regulate or prohibit the transmission or retransmission of such programme,” it said.This is a peculiar situation where while the programme has not yet been telecast, the promo of the programme has been telecast on the channel, which formed the basis of the complaints received in the ministry, it said.Accordingly, the ministry issued the notice to the channel to give its say regarding adherence by the channel to the Programme Code in respect of the proposed programme, the order said.The channel has mentioned in the written submission that the proposed programme is not violative of the law and further that if at all the programme is found to be violative, action as per law may be taken, the ministry said.“Having regard to the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case, Sudarshan TV channel is hereby directed to ensure that the programme proposed to be telecast does not violate any of the programme code. If any violation of the programme code is found, action as per law will be taken,” the ministry order said.

He has also been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a conspiracy case related to the riots.He was also arrested in connection with the alleged murder of IB official Ankit Sharma during the riots.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

10-09-2020||New Delhi||COVID surveillance: Tender for thermal cameras to detect body temp to be opened Friday||The railways’ ambitious plan of installing thermal cameras at stations across its network to screen passengers for coronavirus seems to be finally taking shape, with the tender for their rates opening on Friday.The cameras that detect a passenger’s body temperature have helped Central Railways, one of the few zones to have such cameras, to deny boarding to around 30 passengers since they were installed at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) from June-end.The initial expression of interest tender floated by RailTel for these COVID-19 surveillance cameras had to be scrapped after Indian firms alleged that the tender specifications favoured a Chinese company. Later, it was floated again with revised specifications.The railways said that these cameras are the need of the hour as a larger footfall is expected at stations and accurate cameras are needed to cater to temperature and screening requirements.A RailTel spokesperson confirmed that the tender will be opened on Friday at 3 pm.The specifications for cameras include temperature screening with facial recognition, simultaneous temperature screening of multiple people, detecting whether people are wearing masks and raising timely alarms for those not wearing them.It also includes a crucial specification called “black body” temperature which the ability of the cameras to accurately measure temperatures emitted by a person to find out whether she has a fever or not.The Central Railway is using FebriEye thermal cameras which detect temperatures of multiple people entering a premise at once and record their temperature automatically even as the passengers keep on moving, said Chief Public Relations Officer (Central Railway) Shivaji Sutar.“Presently all passengers boarding mail/express trains at CSMT and LTT are being scanned by FebriEye at entry points for higher temperature before going to the platform for boarding. All railway staff and officers coming for duty at these two major stations are also being screened through this AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based camera.“Till date, twenty-eight such passengers have been detected with above normal body temperature and advised for medical check up besides further necessary action. They were not allowed to travel,” he said.FebriEye is an AI-based thermal screening system for real time, automated and non-intrusive monitoring to ensure that a person doesn’t have a high fever.FebriEye is equipped with “Black Body”, a constant temperature source that ensures accuracy in temperature readings of up to 0.3 degree Celsius (+/-).While the initiative to install such cameras became a necessity after the coronavirus pandemic, the railways was already on its way to completely overhaul security at railway stations through the use of facial recognition technology backed by artificial intelligence.It also planned to link the facial recognition system (FRS) with existing databases such as the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) to identify criminals prowling railway stations.Other than Central Railways, North Frontier Railway zone, South Western zone and Southern Railways have floated tenders for such cameras. Thermal bullet cameras have also been installed at Hyderabad and Secunderabad stations.

He has contended that allegations of corruption per se can’t be per se contempt of court.In a written submission filed in the top court, Bhushan—who was held guilty of Contempt of Court and filed Re 1 in another case relating to his controversial tweets against CJI SA Bobde— has made it clear that he would invoke truth as his defence.Bhushan contended that corruption in public life has a wide and expansive definition. “Corruption is not restricted to pecuniary gratification alone but various instruments identify its particular forms such as bribery, embezzlement, theft, fraud, extortion, abuse of discretion, favouritism, nepotism,  clientelism, conduct creating or exploiting conflicting  interests,” he submitted.“The factum of corruption in the judiciary has been stated in Parliamentary Committee reports on Prevention of Corruption, has been commented upon by former judges of this Hon’ble Court, has been taken note of in various judgments of this Hon’ble court and High Courts in the country and courts in foreign jurisdictions and commented upon by Constitutional experts,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-makes-attorney-general-a-party-to-11-year-old-contempt-case-against-prashant-bhushan-139282

Only 7.71 sq km is available for any construction.Compensatory Afforestation (CA) over an equivalent area of non-forest land or twice the area of degraded forest land is one of the mandatory requirements for approval of proposals for diversion of forest land for a non-forestry purpose under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.For any new infrastructure development project, the clause regarding CA poses a problem as barren land is simply not available in the islands. The islands' administration had taken up the issue with Government of India for relaxation and as a result, the GoI decided that in case of states or UTs having forest cover in excess of 75 per cent, requisite land for CA need not be offered within the state or UT itself.The land could be arranged in any other UT or state.“But linking with willing forest deficient state or UT was a concern again for the administration,” Asha Chaudhary Malhotra, spokesperson of the Andaman and Nicobar islands administration told The Tribune over the phone from Port Blair.Malhotra said the administration urged the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to notify suitable states for undertaking compensatory afforestation.“The administration has recently drawn up projects worth Rs 33,500 crore under the National Infrastructure Pipeline. The concept development plans for the holistic development of Little Andaman and Great Nicobar Islands with mega projects, under the aegis of the Islands Development Agency, are also under active consideration. The land for compensatory afforestation is a pre-requisite for implementation of most of these projects in the Islands,” Malhotra said.The administration vigorously approached various state governments for consent to carry out compensatory afforestation in lieu of forest land diverted for development projects in the Islands.“We are very glad to share this with everyone that the government of Madhya Pradesh has accepted our request and given consent for compensatory afforestation work in 650 sq km in the degraded forest area of the state. This would enable and expedite transformational infrastructure developmental projects in the Islands,” Malhotra said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madhya-pradesh-steps-in-to-help-andaman-get-new-projects-going-139267

10-09-2020||New Delhi||Implement NYAY, protect small & medium businesses, stop privatisation: Rahul to govt||The Congress on Thursday demanded jobs and relief for the youth amid the alleged rise in unemployment with Rahul Gandhi urging the Modi government to transfer money directly in the bank accounts of the poor, protect small and medium businesses and stop privatisation.Several senior Congress leaders urged the government to implement the Congress-proposed minimum income guarantee scheme NYAY and create job opportunities for the youth as part of its ‘Speak Up for Jobs’ campaign being run on Thursday from 10 am for 10 hours.As part of the campaign, Gandhi also put out a video in support of the youth in which he also attacked the government over alleged job losses.He also questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi for remaining “silent” on issues such as the state of the economy and China.मोदी जी सिर्फ़ अपने चंद "मित्रों" की बात सुनते है और उनका विकास करते है। आज देश का युवा मोदी जी से अपने हक़ का रोज़गार और उज्ज्वल भविष्य माँग रहा है पर मोदी जी चुप हैं। युवाओं की समस्याओं को अनदेखा किया जा रहा है। #SpeakUpForJobs pic.twitter.com/rY3srei6nP  “Why are you silent. You should speak, you have not said anything since many days — you neither speak about the economy nor on China. Say something, the country is looking towards you,” Gandhi said.“Before the coronavirus pandemic, I had said that a storm is going to come, prepare for it, but the government made fun of me,” he said.Gandhi said he also gave suggestions such as putting money in the bank accounts of the poor directly as recommended by the NYAY scheme, protecting and helping the small and medium enterprises, and protecting and stabilising strategic industries but the government did not act on it.Instead lakhs of crores of loan waiver and tax break was given to PM Modi's “15 to 20 friends”, he alleged without elaborating.The BJP has dismissed all such allegations made by Gandhi and the Congress in the past.Alleging that the economy had been “destroyed” and the future of the youth “spoilt”, he urged the Prime Minister to act and provide relief.He said: “1. Make a direct money transfer in the bank accounts of poor people. 2. Save the backbone by protecting the small and medium businesses and give them money. 3. stop this privatization.”Later in a tweet, Gandhi took a dig at the government, saying India is like a ship traversing the ocean with the captain staring into the rear-view mirror of history.India is like a ship travelling the ocean with the captain staring into the rear view mirror of history.It’s going nowhere really fast.It won’t be long before the ship runs aground.  “It’s going nowhere really fast. It won't be long before the ship runs aground,” he said.In an earlier tweet, Gandhi alleged that the policies of the Centre have caused loss of crores of jobs and appealed to people to make the Modi government “listen to their voice”.The policies of Modi Govt have caused the loss of crores of jobs and a historic fall in GDP. It has crushed the future of India’s youth. Let’s make the Govt listen to their voice.Join #SpeakUpForJobs from 10am onwards. pic.twitter.com/mRUooQ1yjX  “The policies of Modi Govt have caused the loss of crores of jobs and a historic fall in GDP,” Gandhi alleged in the tweet.“It has crushed the future of India’s youth. Let’s make the Govt listen to their voice,” the former Congress chief said.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra claimed that there was a “big threat” to jobs due to “increasing privatisation, cuts in government spending and the bad economic policies of the BJP government”.“The government has also stopped recruitment in existing jobs. We have to speak for the future of this country. I am speaking, you also speak,” she tweeted as part of the Congress’ ‘speak up for jobs’ campaign.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the promise was of providing two crore jobs every year and claimed that instead of providing 12 crore jobs in six years, 14 crore jobs were “snatched away”.The youth had now woken up and demands an answer, he said.मोदी जी,युवाओं को बरगला आपने सत्ता हथियाई थी।2 करोड़ रोज़गार हर साल देने का वादा था।12 करोड़ रोज़गार देना तो दूर, 14 करोड़ रोज़गार छीन लिए और भविष्य अंधकार में है।युवा अब जाग गया है और जबाब माँगता है।सिंहासन ख़ाली करो, युवा आता है....#SpeakUpForJobs pic.twitter.com/kCkVQo7ZkF  The Congress, on its official Twitter handle, said: “One devastating policy after another, BJP has snatched away the livelihoods of crores of Indians & pushed our youth into a bleak future”.“Join our #SpeakUpForJobs campaign & raise your voices against BJP’s misadventures,” the party tweeted.Videos of several party leaders were posted on the Congress’ official Twitter handle in which they attacked the government over the alleged rise in unemployment and demanded jobs for the youth.

10-09-2020||Mumbai||How many mouths will you shut, my voice will echo far: Kangana Ranaut to Thackeray||A day after Mumbai’s civic authorities demolished portions of her office, actor Kangana Ranaut on Thursday again took on the Maharashtra government by castigating Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for “misusing power” and declaring that her voice won’t be suppressed.Ranaut, who found support from a section of the film fraternity and also some opprobrium, posted a series of tweets comparing the Shiv Sena-led Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to goons, terming the state government a “milavat sarkar” and recalling Marathi culture and pride.On Wednesday, the day the actor returned to Mumbai from her home state Himachal Pradesh, the BMC demolished illegal alterations of her bungalow. The Bombay High Court stayed the demolition process and sought to know why the BMC entered the property when the owner was not present.Also read: Kangana’s mother expresses gratitude to Amit Shah for providing security cover to KanganaThe “Queen” star, whose comment likening Mumbai to Pakistan occupied Kashmir triggered a spat with the Shiv Sena, took a jibe at the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress state government and said the ideology of the Shiv Sena had been compromised.“The ideology on which Shri Bala Saheb Thackeray built Shiv Sena, today they have sold the ideology for power, becoming Sonia Sena from Shiv Sena. The goons who broke my house behind my back, do not call them a civic body. Don’t insult the constitution.”Ranaut described Thackeray as a prime example of nepotism who is misusing power to suppress her voice.“Your father’s good deeds can give you wealth, but you have to earn respect, you will shut my mouth, but my voice will echo in a hundred millions after me, how many mouths will you shut? How many voices will you suppress? Till when you will run away from the truth, you are nothing but an example of dynasty,” the 33-year-old actor wrote on Twitter.The actor said the Shiv Sena made a “milavat sarkar” (mixed government) after the election and turned it into a “Sonia Sena”, alluding to the party's alliance with the Congress.Ranaut said she was touched to receive overwhelming support from her well-wishers from Maharashtra, who “condemned the hooliganism done by the government”.The actor said her fans across the world, including her home state Himachal Pradesh, were pained by the incident. She added that she also wants to assure them that she got “love and respect” in the state.“Many of my Marathi friends cried on the phone yesterday, some gave me many contacts for help, some were sending food to the house which I could not accept due to security protocols. Marathi culture and pride should not be hurt by the Maharashtra government’s shameful act,” she added.A complaint has been filed against the actor — who had also posted a video against Thackeray on Wednesday — for allegedly using foul language against the Chief Minister, an official said on Thursday.Based on the complaint filed by a city-based advocate, a non-cognisable offence was registered at the Vikhroli police station.Prashant Kadam, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Zone VII, said: “After registering an NC, we asked the complainant to approach the court. No FIR was registered.”Many from the fraternity criticised the action of the BMC.Actor Dia Mirza said she condemns the demolition of Ranaut’s office as well as the “harassment and abuse” that actor Rhea Chakraborty has been subjected to over the death of Sushant Singh Rajput.“This is not about taking sides. This is about calling out what is unjust. Remember this could happen to you,” Mirza said.Chakraborty, who has been accused of abetting Rajput’s suicide by his family and subjected to intense media scrutiny, was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on September 8.“I condemn the demolition of Kangana’s office and I condemn the hounding and harassment of Rhea. Yes, I can be against both these things,” filmmaker Reema Kagti tweeted.Actor Renuka Shahane, too, came out in support of Ranaut. Though she didn’t like the “Manikarnika” actor’s comment comparing Mumbai to PoK, she was “appalled” by the “revenge demolition” by the BMC, she said. “You do not have to stoop so low. @CMOMaharashtra please intervene. There is a pandemic we are dealing with. Do we need this unnecessary drama?” Shahane wrote.Filmmaker Ashoke Pandit backed Ranaut for her decision to make a film on Kashmiri Pandits.“She has expressed a desire to make a film on this huge tragedy and we are with her in this. I am sure this film will show the correct picture of our tragedy when it releases. This will be a slap on filmmakers who have mocked our tragedy. Thank you Kangana ji,” he said.The Indian Motion Pictures Producers’ Association (IMPPA) condemned the demolition but also reprimanded the actor.IMPPA president TP Aggarwal said the action was neither “good for the government” nor for the “Queen” star. “The action taken by the Maharashtra government or BMC is absolutely wrong and should be condemned,” Aggarwal said in a statement.He criticised the actor for calling the film industry a place for drug addicts, saying this will stop funds from coming to the industry.

It should be demand-based.The speakers noted the problem of payment delays.“Providing employment under the scheme should be linked to the right to livelihood and not considered as an act of charity,” Anuradha Talwar of the NREGA Sangharsh Morcha said.Annie Raja, head of National Federation of Indian Women, flayed the Union Government for putting a restriction on persons attaining 65 years from seeking jobs under the scheme.Increase of mandis to 200 days, from the present 100 days, and enhancement of minimum wages under the scheme were some of the other demands.Prof Jayati Ghosh of JNU and independent MLA from Gujarat Jignesh Mivani also spoke on the occasion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/civil-society-groups-pitch-for-better-implementation-of-mgnregs-139223

This will create millions of new employment opportunities only in the fisheries sector, said Modi. He said that much of the fish farming depends on the availability of clear water and the Mission Clean Ganga will further help.The fisheries sector is also set to benefit from the work being done on river transport in the areas around Ganga. The mission Dolphin announced on August 15 this year will also have its impact on the fisheries sector, he added. The PM lauded the work done by the Government of Bihar for providing safe drinking water supply to every household. He said that in 4-5 years only 2 per cent houses in Bihar were linked to water supply connections and that now more than 70 per cent households in Bihar were connected with the supply of clean drinking water. The PM said that many of the workers who had returned from the cities due to the corona crisis were moving towards animal husbandry and they were getting support from many schemes of the Central Government and the Government of Bihar.Meanwhile, Mission Gokul is underway to develop better indigenous breeds in the country. A countrywide artificial insemination program was started a year ago, Phase I has completed on Thursday.The Prime Minister said Bihar was now becoming a major center for the development of quality indigenous breeds. The state is going to be strengthened in the dairy sector due to the modern facilities built in Purnia, Patna and Barauni under the National Gokul Mission today, he said. The center built in Purnia is one of the largest centers in India. This will greatly benefit not only Bihar but a large part of eastern India, the PM said, adding that this center will also give a further boost to the development and conservation of indigenous breeds of Bihar like 'Bachhaur' and 'Red Purnia'.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-launches-matsya-sampada-yojana-e-gopala-app-with-an-eye-on-bihar-polls-139222

This kind of induction is very important for the kind of atmosphere that has been created on our borders,” Singh said at the ceremony.Also read: Committed to helping India in defence, international arena, says French ministerHe said Rafale is considered one of the best combat aircraft globally and the deal to procure the jets was a “game changer” for India’s national security.The Defence Minister said the government is determined to do “everything possible” to protect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.Singh’s stern message to the neighbouring country came hours ahead of an expected meeting between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) conclave in Moscow.The much-anticipated talks are taking place against the backdrop of a massive spike in tension in eastern Ladakh triggered by fresh face-offs between the two armies along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).“In my recent foreign trip, I put the point of view of India in front of the whole world. I also made everyone aware of the resolve to not compromise India's sovereignty and territorial integrity under any circumstances and we are determined to do everything possible for this purpose,” he said referring to his visit to Moscow.The defence minister said India's responsibility is not limited to its territorial boundary only and that it is committed to contribute towards peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region as well as in the Indian Ocean.There has been mounting global concerns over China's growing military assertiveness in both regions.In his address, Singh also complimented the IAF for its “swift deployment” of assets at forward bases, saying it created confidence that the country’s Air Force is fully prepared to fulfil its operational obligations.“I would like to congratulate the IAF for its swift and deliberate action near the LAC during a recent unfortunate incident on the border. It shows your commitment,” Singh said without elaborating.In the last three months, the IAF deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the LAC.“The IAF plays an important role in maintaining military deterrence and your action will be decisive in any future war. While the prevailing situation on our geographical borders has caught our attention, we should not ignore the threat of sponsored terrorism,” Singh said.Speaking on the occasion, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said the induction of Rafale jets could not have happened at a more opportune time considering the current security scenario.“Induction of Rafale in Ambala is important as the fleet can rapidly access all areas of interest from the airbase,” he said.The defence minister said India is enhancing its military power in its quest for peace.“Our motive behind strengthening our defence has always been driven by our desire for peace. Our country is committed to not take any step which can disturb the peace anywhere. We expect the same from our neighbours, and the rest of the world,” he said.Calling induction of Rafale into IAF a historic moment, Singh said it also reflected “deep ties” between India and France.“We have been successful in creating future-oriented ties...India and France have common views in fighting against terrorism and expansion of UN Security Council,” Singh said while talking about growing convergence in ties between the two countries.“The induction of Rafale into the IAF fleet shows the close ties between India and France. India and France have long been economic, cultural and strategic partners. Our faith in a strong democracy and the desire for peace in the whole world is the basis of our mutual relations,” he added.

No FIR was registered."Talking to PTI, Mane said that since the police refused to file an FIR against the actress, he plans to move a court to lodge a defamation case against her for "insulting" the CM.Ranaut has crossed swords with the Shiv Sena, which rules in Maharashtra as well as controls the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), with her remark comparing Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK).The 33-year-old actor, who returned to Mumbai on Wednesday from her home state Himachal Pradesh, alleged that the Maharashtra government was targeting her because of her clash with the Shiv Sena.The Shiv Sena-ruled BMC on Wednesday pulled down some illegal alterations at the Bandra bungalow of Ranaut. However, the Bombay High Court later ordered a stay on the process.Addressing Uddhav Thackeray, Ranaut later posted a video message saying his "ego will be destroyed" the way her Bandra home was demolished."Uddhav Thackeray, 'tujhe kya lagta hai' (what do you think)?. You think you have taken a huge revenge by destroying my house in collusion with the movie mafia. Today my house is destroyed, tomorrow it will be your ego. The wheels of time keep changing," she said in a video message in Hindi."Uddhav Thackeray, this cruelty and terrorism, it is good that it happened to me because there is some meaning to it," she said in the video.

After the ruling NDA fielded JDU’s Harivansh to contest for the election of Rajya Sabha deputy chairman, the Congress-led opposition on Thursday finalised the candidature of RJD’s Manoj Jha.The contest is virtually set to shape as Bihar versus Bihar ahead of the state elections.Manoj Jha, a former academician, is 53 years old and will challenge former RS deputy chairperson Harivansh—the expiry of whose RS term recently led to the vacancy of the post.Harivansh was since reelected to the upper house from Bihar.The opposition choice fell on Jha after DMK declined the offer to contest and the majority of other non-NDA parties also showed little interest in entering a losing battle.The ruling NDA has a comfortable majority in RS to get Harivansh elected.For the Congress and RJD especially it would be a symbolic fight for “principles.”The Congress candidate and then Rajya Sabha MP BK Hariprasad had in 2018 also contested against NDA nominee Harivansh and lost.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-vs-bihar-in-rajya-sabha-deputy-chairman-election-as-manoj-jha-to-take-on-harivansh-139214

10-09-2020||New Delhi||SC seeks AG's assistance in 2009 contempt case against Bhushan, Tejpal||The Supreme Court on Thursday accepted the plea of activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan to seek the assistance of Attorney General K K Venugopal in a 2009 contempt case against the advocate and journalist Tarun Tejpal.The apex court had in November 2009 issued contempt notices to Bhushan and Tejpal for allegedly casting aspersions on some sitting and former top court judges in an interview to news magazine 'Tehelka'.Tejpal was the editor of the magazine.The matter came up for hearing through video-conferencing before a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for Bhushan, said that larger questions of law would be dealt with in the matter and assistance of Attorney General was required to be taken.“We want the Attorney General to assist this court in dealing with the questions given by us and the court had also framed some questions,” Dhavan said, adding that they had given some questions for consideration in the matter.The bench directed that entire records of the matter be served to the office of the Attorney General and posted the matter for hearing on October 12.On August 31, the apex court had imposed a “nominal fine” of Re 1 on Bhushan, who was convicted for criminal contempt in a separate case for his two tweets against the judiciary, saying he has attempted to “denigrate the reputation of the institution of administration of justice”.  In the 2009 contempt case, the top court had on August 25 decided to refer the matter to another bench to deal with certain larger questions related to freedom of speech and levelling of corruption charges against the judiciary.Dhavan had told the court that 10 questions of constitutional importance have been raised by them and they needed to be dealt with by a constitution bench.On August 25, the court had not undertaken the hearing due to paucity of time as Justice Arun Mishra, who was heading the bench, was a demitting office on September 2.The court had not agreed to Dhavan's submissions that it should seek the assistance of the Attorney General in dealing with the issues raised and said that “it is best left to the appropriate Bench" which will be set up by the Chief Justice of India.Dhavan had said that questions raised by Bhushan included the issue whether bona fide opinions of corruption also constitute contempt of court and "whether it is enough to show bonafide of opinion or it is necessary for the person to prove the allegation of corruption.They also included whether a complainant is barred from discussing in the public domain the contents of his complaint if an in-house inquiry is started, among others, he had said.On August 17, the top court had framed certain questions and asked the parties to address it on three issues-- whether such statements about corruption against judges or judiciary can be made, in what circumstances they can be made and what is the procedure to be adopted with respect to sitting and retired judges.Bhushan had also filed 10 questions on his own and sought adjudication by a constitution bench."Whether the expression of a bona fide opinion about the extent of corruption in any section of the judiciary would amount to contempt of court," Bhushan's plea had said."If the answer to the question is in the affirmative, whether the person who expresses such an opinion about the extent of corruption in a section of the judiciary is obliged to prove that his opinion is correct or whether it is enough to show that he bona fide held that opinion," the second question read.He had also given eight other questions related to freedom of speech and expression and the width and scope of contempt powers.In response to the 2009 contempt case, Bhushan had earlier told the apex court that making corruption charges against judges would not amount to contempt of court and mere utterance of corruption charge could not be contempt of court. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-ags-assistance-in-2009-contempt-case-against-bhushan-tejpal-139203

10-09-2020||New Delhi||CBSE won't be able to help students taking Class-12 compartment exams: SC||The Supreme Court Thursday said the CBSE would not be able to help much the students taking compartment exams for class XII this month as it would be the colleges and universities which will take their admissions for higher studies.The apex court said this while hearing a plea which has challenged the decision of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to hold compartment exams on the ground that it would be detrimental to the health of the examinees.“It is the colleges, universities and deemed universities which will be taking admissions of those students and the CBSE will not be able to help much the students taking compartment exams,” a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar told senior advocate Vivek Tankha, who was representing the petitioners.The bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, said this after Tankha argued that the CBSE may ask the colleges to give provisional admissions or wait till results are declared for compartment exams.Tankha said that compartment exams are scheduled from September 22 to 29 and by that time, admissions for various undergraduate courses would be over.He said students taking compartment exams would not get admissions in colleges and their whole year would be wasted.The senior advocate argued that the CBSE could not hold main exams due to the COVID-19 pandemic and decided to declare results based on some “hybrid systems of evaluation” and due to this, many students are facing compartment exams.“In the interest of students, who are almost five lakhs, taking compartment exams, something must be done,” he said.The bench observed that compartment exams are being conducted “perhaps three times in a year”.The top court said around 87,000 students have failed and the solution does not lie with the CBSE.During the hearing conducted through video-conferencing, Tankha said the Centre and states could be served with the copy of petition through standing counsel and attempts could be made to find an acceptable solution for such students.“Don't complicate it otherwise it will not come up for hearing,” the bench said. The apex court later asked the petitioners to serve the copy of the plea to the Centre and posted the matter for hearing on September 14.On September 4, the CBSE had opposed in the top court a plea and said all "necessary" safety measures for students are being taken in view of COVID-19 pandemic.The CBSE's counsel had said that the board has increased the number of examination centres for compartment tests from 575 to 1,278. "We have taken a decision that in a class where 40 students could sit, now only 12 will sit and we are taking all precautions," the counsel for CBSE had said, adding that all necessary measures are being taken. The apex court had asked the CBSE to file a short affidavit in the response of the plea of Anika Samvedi and others.

What a disgrace for the nation, which extols 'vidhya' (education) and gyan (knowledge)!"The senior BJP leader, known for his maverick ways and plain-speak, is under attack from his party's massive and active army of social media users over views regarding economy and JEE-NEET exams during Covid pandemic. Swamy has, in fact,  given an ultimatum to the BJP to remove its high-profile IT cell head Amit Malviya by Thursday. However, he has not received much support from his colleagues on this. Swamy had on Monday accused Malviya of running a campaign against him using fake tweets. He said removing Malviya was the “compromise proposal” he had made to BJP president JP Nadda. “By tomorrow if Malaviya is not removed from BJP IT cell (which is my five villages compromise proposal to Nadda), it means the party brass does not want to defend me. Since there is no forum in the party where I can ask for cadre opinion, hence I will have to defend myself,” Swamy had said.Swamy has been facing criticism from within the party on his stance on some issues, including economy and conduct of JEE-NEET during Covid and also reservations regarding GST implementation.He has been supporting  student protests against the Narendra Modi government’s decision to conduct JEE and NEET, calling for their postponement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-amit-malviya-swamy-engages-in-duel-with-education-minister-pokhriyal-on-twitter-over-jee-139195

The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) too has armed its soldiers. The number of soldiers facing on either side along the LAC is small but the backup is in thousands, apart from tanks and artillery guns.This was not so at Galwan. The team led by Col Santosh Babu, which had gone to probe a Chinese tent, was unarmed, while the PLA soldiers had come armed with improvised clubs and machetes, leading to a bloodbath. Since Galwan, matters have flared up twice — once on August 30-31 and again on September 7 at the south of Pangong Tso.The Army has denied opening fire at PLA soldiers on September 7 and accused the other side of firing shots. The PLA claims the Indian Army did it.While both sides deny having opened fire, it is certain that firing did occur — first such incident in Ladakh since 1962. On September 7, the PLA tried to capture Mukhpari but it was repulsed.
