China has strongly objected to India's move. India has, however, maintained that the heights are on its side of the LAC.India has also rushed in additional troops and weapons to the sensitive region following the Chinese attempts.Army Chief Gen MM Naravane paid a two-day visit to Ladakh from Thursday during which he carried out a comprehensive review of India's security preparedness in the region.He visited the region in view of the escalating tensions triggered by China’s fresh attempts.“The situation along the LAC is tense. We have undertaken precautionary deployment in some areas. The troops are prepared for all contingencies that may arise. All these actions have been carried out only along the LAC,” Gen Naravane said at the end of his visit.

In any case, travel for such functions and provision of bags or mementos should be avoided,” the ministry said. It asked all the ministries /departments to carry out a review of the individual consultants appointed by them in consonance with the provisions of General Financial Rules (GFR) and reduce the number of consultants to the minimum requirement.“Due economy may be observed while determining the fees of the consultants and care may be taken that such fees are not disproportionate to the quality and quantity of work to be carried out by the consultants,” it added. With regard to new positions, it said there will be a ban on creation of new posts, except with the approval of the expenditure department.“If any post has been created after July 1, 2020, under delegated powers or authority, without approval of Expenditure Department and have not yet been filled, then shall posts shall not be filled. If it is deemed absolutely essential to fill them, proposals may be sent for approval of Department of Expenditure,” it added. Earlier this week, the finance ministry had asked ministries/departments/PSUs and public sector banks not to print calendars, diaries, greeting cards and schedulers in physical format henceforth.It also banned printing of coffee-table books and instead encouraged use of e-books.

04-09-2020||Moscow/New Delhi||Amid tension on LAC, Rajnath holds talks with Chinese counterpart in Moscow||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his Chinese counterpart Gen. Wei Fenghe held talks in Moscow on Friday on ways to ease escalating border tension in eastern Ladakh, government sources said.It is the first high-level meeting between the two sides after the border row erupted along the Line of Actual Control(LAC) in eastern Ladakh in early May though External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval held separate telephonic talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to resolve the standoff.The focus of the talks between the two defence ministers was on ways to resolve the prolonged border standoff, the sources said.The meeting was requested by the Chinese defence minister, they said.Both Singh and Wei are in Moscow to attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) defence ministers which took place earlier in the day.Indian and Chinese troops are engaged in a bitter standoff in multiple places in eastern Ladakh.Tensions flared up again in the region after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong lake five days ago when the two sides were engaged in diplomatic and military talks to resolve the border row.India occupied a number of strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong lake and strengthened its presence in Finger 2 and Finger 3 areas in the region to thwart any Chinese actions.China has strongly objected to India's move. India has, however, maintained that the strategic heights are on its side of the LAC.India has also rushed in additional troops and weapons to the sensitive region following China's transgression attempts.In his address at the SCO ministerial meet, Singh said peace and security in the region demands a climate of trust, non-aggression, peaceful resolution of differences and respect for international rules. The SCO is a eight-nation grouping.Singh's comments in the presence of the Chinese defence minister was seen as a veiled message to China over the border row in eastern Ladakh.Minister Jaishankar is also scheduled to travel to Moscow next week to attend a meeting of the foreign ministers of the SCO on September 10. He is expected to have a meeting with Wang Yi on the sidelines of this meeting.

They also exchanged views on the international situation and regional hotspots including Afghanistan and West Asia.Jaishankar also urged full support of BRICS in reforming UNSC as an “exercise in our collective faith in meaningful multilateralism”.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the BRICS and all its member countries were always open to cooperate with partners who are ready to work constructively in order to become a “centre of attraction” for other actors in the international arena.Chaired by Russia, the annual meeting of foreign ministers from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) also focused on the development of a unified response to the severe global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/foreign-ministers-jaishankar-wang-yi-to-meet-next-week-in-moscow-136372
04-09-2020||New Delhi||Javadekar hints at possibility of GST rate cut for vehicles||Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday lent his weight to the automobile industry’s demand for a reduction in GST rate to boost growth, saying he will discuss the need for a reduction in taxes with the prime minister and finance minister.The heavy industries minister also said proposal for the auto scrappage policy was ready and all stakeholders have provided inputs, therefore its announcement was likely “very soon”.Elaborating on the possibility of GST rate cut for the vehicles segment, he said details of the proposals are being worked out by the Finance Ministry and he is not privy to all the details.                 However, Javadekar said, “naturally in a logical sequence, two-wheelers, three-wheelers, public transport vehicles, in that category only, and then four-wheelers, in that order it should come. I hope that you will get some good news surely very soon.”   He said he will definitely discuss the automotive industry’s demand for a Goods and Services Tax (GST) reduction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.The minister said as the industry feels that “this GST reduction will ultimately benefit the government and you are not asking for this permanently, you are asking this for a period, and therefore I will definitely discuss this demand with the finance minister and all concerned, the prime minister also.”       “We may not agree immediately for reduction in GST but that is not a final no. There can definitely be a way forward which I also see, progress will be done,” said Javadekar.Two-wheelers are neither a luxury nor sin goods and so merit a GST rate revision, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said at an industry interaction last month. She had further said a rate revision proposal would be taken up by the GST Council.Two-wheelers currently attract 28 per cent GST.The rates are decided by the GST Council, chaired by the union finance minister comprising ministers in-charge of finance or taxation of all the states.Javadekar said the government is working with all stakeholders on ways and means to boost demand.Addressing the 60th annual convention of auto industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), the minister said “the automotive industry is important for Indian economy and we would like to support the industry by providing incentives for increasing its competitiveness, especially with a focus on exports”.          Javadekar said a ‘Champion’ export scheme is also on the anvil.He said details of the scheme are being worked out and it is likely to provide benefits to companies for increasing their sourcing from India, compensate the cost disadvantage in logistics and also provide benefits to firms that have high export potential.The Ministry of Heavy Industry had invited expressions of interest from state transport departments for the deployment of 5,000 electric buses last year.“I have instructed that there are so many good Indian companies manufacturing (electric buses), so concentrate on Indian companies,” Javadekar said.The minister also said the Centre was reviewing the national automotive mission plan, and assured the industry that it “will not experience supply side bottlenecks now because movement has been eased out and there will be no lockdown any further, as I hope”.          Javadekar, who also holds the portfolios of information and broadcasting and environment, forests and climate change, said COVID-19 management rests mainly on containment zone management as well as more testing. He also wondered how China has been able to contain the disease to one restricted geography.“There are two countries of our size, China and India, and China surprisingly after Wuhan there is not a single patient anywhere so how this happens only China can know about it,” Javadekar remarked.

04-09-2020||Hyderabad||Don’t show-off like ‘Singham’: PM Modi to young IPS officers||Women police personnel can engage with mothers of children in Jammu and Kashmir to prevent the youngsters from taking the “wrong path”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, while lavishing praise on the people of the union territory, hit by the menace of terrorism.Addressing the 2018 batch of IPS probationers at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy here through video-conferencing, he also cautioned them not to indulge in wrongdoings and said they would be exposed by the latest technologies, which are also useful in better policing.Responding to a woman probationer, Modi heaped praise on the people of Kashmir, saying they are ‘lovely’ people and having special ability to learn new things.“I am very connected to these people. They treat you with so much love...All of us together, we have to work towards stopping the children from taking a wrong direction.“And this can be done by our women police officers efficiently. Our women force can effectively work in educating the mothers and bringing back those children. I am confident if you do that, in the initial stage itself we can prevent our children from getting into the wrong path,” Modi said.He was apparently referring to youngsters being radicalised and made to join terror groups in Jammu and Kashmir.The Prime Minister also stressed on constabulary intelligence for effective policing.“Nowadays, technology plays an important role in crime detection, be it CCTV footage, mobile tracking...it helps you in a big way. But, the same technology is also responsible for suspension of police personnel nowadays...,” Modi warned.“The way technology is helpful it is also becoming a cause of musibat (difficulty)...and police are subjected to it more,” he added.He further said the police officials need to train people to see how technology can be used to its maximum and in a positive way. Big data, artificial intelligence and social media were the new age technologies which can be used as weapons for better policing.Stressing the importance of training, Modi pointed to the “Mission Karmyogi” scheme approved by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday.“Training plays a very important role. In our country, for a government employee training is considered a punishment... An impression has been created that any useless official would be assigned the work of training,” he said.The Cabinet approved Mission Karmyogi as the government wanted to “give a lot of importance to training activity...There is a need to take it forward,” he said.Dubbed as the biggest bureaucratic reform initiative, the scheme was aimed at capacity building to make government employees more “creative, proactive, professional and technology-enabled”.The Prime Minister said the ‘humane’ side of the police force in the country came to fore during the coronavirus pandemic and the security personnel did a commendable job.During coronavirus times, Police used to sing songs to create awareness, used to feed the poor and take patients.These scenes were witnessed by people... During the coronavirus, humanity worked throughKhaki uniform, he said.He also counselled the new officers—not to be influenced by films like “Singham” that portrayed super cops, saying some police personnel want to first show-off but miss out on main aspects of policing.“Some policemen who join new duty want to first show-off ... scare people... And anti-social elements should shiver from hearing my name itself.... after watching films like ‘Singham’, it gets over their mind and because of it those works which need to be done get missed out,” Modi noted.Replying to one of the cadets from Tamil Nadu on managing stress among police personnel, Modi said farmers also face stress if there was unwanted variation in rainfall.He also noted that yoga and pranayama were great ways to beat the stress.Police stations should be kept clean and neat and also made centres of social trust, Modi said.Asking police personnel to always respect the power of society, he said officers should leverage the inherent strength of the society for achieving citizen friendly objectives.As many as 131 probationers, including 28 women, of the Indian Police Service of 2018 batch successfully completed their training in the academy.Kiran Shruti D V, the best all-round probationer of the batch, led the parade.

04-09-2020||New York||‘Scavengers, Sexless, Suck-up Experts’: NYT contributor scoops deeply racist Kissinger-Nixon remarks on Indians||On June 3, 1971, when US National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger was wild at India and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for sheltering millions of Bengali refugees fleeing Pakistan’s army, he and his boss, US President Richard Nixon didn’t just blame her for causing the refugee flow and covert sponsorship of Bengali insurgency. Kissinger condemned Indians as a whole, his voice oozing with contempt, “They are a scavenging people”.Kissinger, who continues to be influential and is routinely granted access by kings and governments, also voiced prejudices, albeit milder, about Pakistanis. On August 10, 1971, while discussing with Nixon whether the Pakistan junta would execute Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, the leader of the Bengali nationalists, Kissinger hissed to the President: “I tell you, the Pakistanis are fine people, but they are primitive in their mental structure.” “They (Pakistanis) just don’t have the subtlety of the Indians,” Kissinger, the toast of India’s thinktanks at 97, explained helpfully. On June 17, 1971, Nixon and Kissinger, in a collective generalisation of a losing battle with Indira Gandhi, burst out on Indian women at large by calling them “Sexless” newly accessed tapes reported in the New York Times by Princeton Professor of International Relations and author Gary J Bass state.The Republican President, ultimately disgraced and having to quit in 1974, was unsparing to contrarians in his own team for even minor editorial tilts towards India. The tapes, Bass explains, have a reference to Kenneth B. Keating, Ambassador to India, as “a bastard”. Keating’s fault, even as he stood outranked, was to have confronted Nixon and Kissinger in the Oval Office calling Pakistan’s crackdown “almost entirely a matter of genocide”.The tapes have Nixon asking what “do the Indians have that takes even a Keating, for Christ, a 70-year-old” (here there is cross-talk, but the word the Professor heard seems to be “bachelor” or even “bastard”). In his reply to Nixon, Kissinger explained: “They (Indians) are superb flatterers, Mr President. They are masters at flattery. They are masters at subtle flattery. That’s how they survived 600 years. They suck up - their great skill is to suck up to people in key positions.”Kissinger continued: “The most sexless, nothing, these people. I mean, people say, what about the Black Africans? Well, you can see something, the vitality there, I mean they have a little animal-like charm, but God, those Indians, ack, pathetic. Uch.”On November 4, 1971, during a private break from a White House summit with Indira Gandhi, Nixon revealed to Kissinger his sexual disgust at Indians. He said: “To me, they turn me off. How the hell do they turn other people on, Henry? Tell me.”  Kissinger’s response was inaudible to Prof Bass, but he believes the NSA did not discourage the President from his theme.The President, in between bitter sparring matches with Indira Gandhi about the danger of war with Pakistan, confesses to Kissinger that his own sexual neuroses were having an impact on foreign policy: “They turn me off. They are repulsive and it’s just easy to be tough with them.”A few days later, on November 12, 1971, in the middle of a discussion about India-Pakistan tensions with Kissinger and Secretary of State William P. Rogers, after Rogers mentioned (claims of) reprimanding Indira Gandhi, Nixon blurted: “I don’t know how they reproduce!”In the 47 years since, Kissinger has successfully portrayed himself as above the racism of the Nixon White House, but Bass’s newly unveiled tapes show him joining in the bigotry. Though, as the author himself confesses, the tapes cannot fully determine whether he truly shared the President’s prejudices or was just pandering to the boss.A conversation between Nixon, Kissinger and H.R. Haldeman, the White House chief of staff, in the Oval Office in June 1971 is equally revealing. “Undoubtedly the most unattractive women in the world are the Indian women,” said Nixon.“Undoubtedly,” he repeats, with a venomous tone.The tapes are a sequel to Bass’s well-received book, “The Blood Telegram” published in 2013. The book documents the violent birth of Bangladesh and what Bass called, “disgraceful White House diplomacy”. Much of the evidence came from scores of White House tapes, which reveal Nixon and Kissinger as they operated behind closed doors.In December 2012, Bass filed a follow-up legal request for a mandatory declassification review with Nixon’s Presidential Library and Museum. After much wrangling, the Nixon archivists released a few unbleeped tapes in May 2018 and then a few lots every now and then culminating this past May. There are bleeps still remaining on some of the reviewed tapes, some of which Bass says he is appealing.Nixon died in 1994. Kissinger was NSA from 1969 until 1973 and then rose to be US Secretary of State in 1974. His negotiating genius with Vietnam and China won him cult status and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973. A request for comment from Kissinger Associates wasn’t answered at the time of publication.

04-09-2020||New Delhi||MPs will require COVID-19 negative report for entering Parliament during Monsoon Session||The Members of Parliament (MPs) will now require COVID-19 negative reports of themselves, their family members and other close contacts to attend the upcoming monsoon session, beginning September 14.According to the detailed guidelines issued by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha secretariats, the close contacts of MPs include personal assistant (PA), personal secretary (PS), driver and maid.The COVID-19 test of the MPs needs to be done 72 hours before the start of the session and it can be done either in their constituencies or at the Parliament complex.“In case a member is found to be negative, she/he can attend the session. In case a member is found positive, she/he will have to go for institutional isolation/hospitalisation as per the advice of a doctor and as per patient or clinical management protocol,” according to the guidelines.The guidelines further say that for safety purposes, MPs’ family and staff members can undergo COVID-19 test on the Parliament premises as well.If a family member of an MP or his or her PA, PS, driver or maid is found COVID-19 positive, then the parliamentarian is in the high-risk zone and has to go for quarantine for 14 days from the last day of their contact.Besides, the secretariats of both houses in the nine-page guidelines have also emphasised on wearing a mask, maintaining a physical distance of six feet, keeping hands clean during the session.Staff members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha secretariats will also undergo COVID-19 test, which is going to be started from Saturday.Thousands of masks and gloves, hundreds of sanitiser bottles and face shields, touch-free operation of doors, and COVID-19 tests for an estimated 4,000 people, including MPs and staff members — several arrangements have been made for the 18-day session that would be held under the shadow of a pandemic for the first time ever.“Frequent sanitisation of the entire Parliament complex will also be carried out while arrangements have been made to sanitise various parliamentary papers as well as footwear and cars of MPs,” officials said.Frisking of people will also make way for touch-less security scanning while thermal scanning will also be totally touch-free.The first-of-its-kind monsoon session will see the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha sitting in two different shifts while special seating arrangements have been made for MPs in adherence to social distancing guidelines.For making the entire Parliament complex a safe zone in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu have held extensive discussions with officials of the Home Ministry, the Health Ministry, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).The Monsoon Session will be held from September 14 to October 1.

Besides, there were attempts to take unilateral actions that “seem to be efforts to change facts on ground.’’“Even in the depth of the Covid crises, we kept the communications lines [with China] open. Ground commanders are talking as we speak. But it is a fact that unless there is peace and tranquility in the border areas, normal bilateral relations will be affected,’’ he said.“There is a linkage between what is happening on the border and the larger reaction that is very evident,’’ he added. The ‘large reaction’ Shringla was referring to is the banning of Chinese apps, curbs on investments from Beijing and a general souring of ties.  “As we seek to de-escalate and disengage, that could be a way to go back. Not until then,’’ he added.The Foreign Secretary said India will give priority in supplying vaccines to its neighbours and friends. India is currently well placed to manufacture at least three vaccines and the “pharma of the world’’ will scale up its manufacturing capacities on a gigantic scale.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-willing-to-talk-but-no-compromise-foreign-secretary-shringla-136361

In response to request of UN Secretary General, India is rushing two medical teams to Africa to strengthen Indian peacekeeping hospitals - one in Goma, DR Congo and other in Juba, South Sudan”.As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage across the world, the UN Secretariat has set up a System-Wide Medical Evacuation Task Force to ensure high quality treatment facilities for people serving the United Nations in field locations.Guterres has decided to scale-up the Level-2 and Level-3 hospital facilities, managed by the Indian peacekeepers, at the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) to mitigate and contain the COVID-19 outbreak at these two locations.Based on a request, India will be deploying two medical teams of 15 medical personnel each at Goma in the DRC and Juba in South Sudan in the second half of September, 2020.The main hub of command and control centre of MONUSCO is located in Goma, where the hospital by India has been operational since January, 2005 and has 90 Indian nationals including 18 specialists.Due to the increasing number of coronavirus cases in the area, the ‘Level-3' facility, which is the highest level of medical care provided by a deployed UN unit, will now further be upgraded to a Level-3 Plus facility.In Juba, the ‘Level-2 plus' hospital by India, operational since December, 2016, has 77 Indians, including 12 specialists.The Indian facility in Juba is presently one of the top-level of medical facilities existing in South Sudan. This facility will now be upgraded from Level-2 plus to a Level-3 facility.Of the total 16,306 troops deployed with UNMISS, India contributes the largest number of troops at 2,420 personnel.The country is the second largest contributor of troops to MONUSCO, with 2,030 Indian troops deployed with the UN Mission, which has a total of 15,159 peacekeepers.India's long-standing contribution to the UN peacekeeping has been widely lauded by the world organisation.

The preliminary enquiry revealed that the seized stuffs were sourced from Canada or the US and were finally to be taken to Goa from Mumbai, he added.The official said: “A crackdown on the illegal import of curated marijuana (bud) was initiated after it was found that the drug has huge market demand in Mumbai. All of it was being sourced from the USA or Canada where it is produced in large quantities.”The NCB’s initial probe also indicated that the suppliers of these drugs were in contact with Bollywood celebrities.As an arrested accused, Ahmed, who works as a driver with a resort in Goa, was found to be receiving the drugs, and indicated the involvement of Bollywood celebrities.The official added that the role of some prominent drug suppliers based in Bangalore is also under scanner.Noting that NCB sleuths would use Ahmed to further expose the entire chain of the racket, the official said: “The drugs were seized from the foreign post offices in Delhi and Mumbai based on the specific inputs.”In the operations in Delhi, another official said: “The bud was found to be from the US and the consignee of the contraband was based in the city but he was misguided by his contact at Mumbai that some legal stuff is being procured from the US and the same was further to be collected by Mumbai based persons, whose search is underway.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncb-busts-curated-marijuana-buds-supply-chain-racket-in-delhi-mumbai-136348

In those terms, the upcoming Bihar elections will not just test parties but also the voters of the state where caste combinations, social situations and poverty continue to be the biggest issues.This time, there is more.According to political observers, the combination of the coronavirus pandemic, resultant migrant crisis and job losses, and recent floods have the potential to lead to “some unexpected results”.“If you think Sushant Singh Rajput is an issue, think again. Ram Mandir is not an issue in the state where anything related to ‘Mandal Commission’ (reservation) still has the potential to knock down a party as it happened with the BJP in 2015. The votes and issues of the backward classes, the EBCs and the Muslim community will decide the fate of the parties. The upper castes have their own grievances. The floods have played havoc and large tracks of farmlands have been submerged. Parties have to keep all that in mind,” the experts say.As far as the saffron party is concerned about digital and social media and high-tech campaigns, it is more experienced than others. Its e-campaign focusing on virtual rallies and ‘digital raths’ with LED screen mounted atop vehicles for the live telecast of campaigns to take care of those whose who do not have smartphones or internet connection is ready. Party cadres will also be conducting ‘nukkad’ or corner meetings with a limited audience and maintaining social distancing. Election guidelines will further define the contours and specifics of physical rallies and meetings, party leaders say.The BJP’s focus areas include Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s self-reliance pitch (‘Atmanirbhar Bihar’) and monetary help, rations and the MNREGA jobs to migrants after they reached Bihar during the COVID-19 lockdown.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-age-digital-raths-and-e-electioneering-new-normal-bihar-elections-test-for-parties-136344

04-09-2020||New Delhi||Bihar elections, 65 pending bypolls to be held around same time: EC||The pending by-election to one Lok Sabha and 64 assembly seats spread across 15 states and the Bihar assembly polls will be held “around the same time”, the Election Commission said on Friday.The term of the Bihar assembly ends on November 29 and elections are likely to be held sometime in October-November.Among the 64 vacant assembly seats, 27 are in Madhya Pradesh. Most of these 27 seats fell vacant when rebel Congress members resigned from the party and the assembly to join the BJP.With the resignations of the Congress members, the Kamal Nath-led government fell and the BJP returned to power.“One of the major factors in clubbing them together is the relative ease of movement of central forces and related logistics issues,” a Commission statement said.“Considering that General Assembly Elections of Bihar are also due and required to be completed before November 29, 2020, the Commission has decided to conduct all the 65 by-elections and the General Assembly Elections of Bihar around the same time.... Announcement of schedule of Bihar General Assembly Elections as well as these by-elections will be done by the Commission at appropriate time,” it said.The issue of holding the by-elections came up at the meeting of the Commission on Friday.“The Commission reviewed the reports and inputs from chief secretaries and chief electoral officers of many of the concerned states seeking deferment of the by-elections in their states in view of several factors including the extra-ordinary heavy rains in some places and other constraints like pandemic,” the statement said.The EC took the decision after taking into account various factors, an official said.The bypoll to the Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha seat in Bihar has been pending.One assembly seat each in Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka and West Bengal; two seats each in Assam, Jharkhand, Kerala, Nagaland, Tamil Nadu and Odisha; five assembly seats in Manipur and eight each in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh are also vacant.In July this year, the Election Commission had deferred the by-elections to one Lok Sabha and seven assembly seats beyond the six month period due to the onset of monsoon and possibilities of floods and the COVID-19 pandemic.

All candidates will carry their own hand sanitiser in transparent bottles and (their own) water bottles, and will be required to cover their mouth and nose with mask or cloth,” CBSE Exam Controller Sanyam Bhardwaj said in an official notification detailing the exam schedule.Earlier in the day, the CBSE opposed in the Supreme Court a plea seeking postponement of compartment exams for Class 12 scheduled this month, saying all “necessary” safety measures for students are being taken in view of COVID-19 pandemic.The plea challenged the CBSE’s decision to hold compartment examinations for Class 12 on the ground that it would be detrimental to the health of the examinees in view of rising COVID-19 cases.The apex court will hear the case on September 10.

04-09-2020||---||As some states accept GST offer, Opposition plans strategy meet||New Delhi, September 4Opposition-ruled states will formulate a strategy that may include activating the dispute resolution mechanism after Bihar, Assam and Karnataka decided to accept one of the two options offered by the Centre for GST compensation.The states are likely to firm up their plan after their officials get back with the clarifications sought from the Finance Ministry. An opportunity to meet may take place during the forthcoming Parliamentary Session as the next GST Council meet will be held on September 19, a few days after Parliament convenes.The Centre’s two options for compensating states for their GST dues have already been rejected by West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Telangana, Delhi, Puducherry, and Punjab.While Assam and Karnataka are BJP ruled, the party is a junior partner in the Bihar government. Their acquiescence has not been without a political cost as the opposition has criticised the respective state governments for letting go of their legitimate dues from the Centre.Karnataka has chosen the first option and is eligible for Rs 18,289 crore out of which the Centre will straightaway provide Rs 6965 crore and the rest will have to be borrowed, to be compensated later. By choosing the first option, it becomes eligible to borrow one per cent of State GDP without any conditions.Under this option, the Centre had said instead of Rs 2.35 lakh-crore, states are eligible for Rs 97,000 crore because rest of the revenue was lost due to “Hand of God.’’ Punjab CM Amarinder Singh and Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel have contested the growth assumptions and the concept of bifurcating revenue loss figures into Covid (“Hand of God’’) and non-Covid.Under the second option (and originally as well), Karnataka was eligible for Rs 25,508 crore. It will get Rs 6965 crore straightaway and the rest will have to be borrowed. However, only additional borrowing of 0.5 per cent of State GDP will be available without any conditions.Most of the opposing states are asking the Centre to borrow from the market and compensate them the amount promised when inking the GST pact.Though the one-week deadline for conveying the options ended on Friday, this is not an issue as states are still engaged in seeking clarifications from the Union Finance Ministry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-some-states-accept-gst-offer-opposition-plans-strategy-meet-136330

04-09-2020||Mumbai||Malegaon blast: Lieutenant Colonel Purohit moves HC seeking quashing of case||Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, has filed a fresh petition in the Bombay High Court seeking that the charges against him be quashed.Purohit was doing his job as a military intelligence officer and was “framed” in the case, his lawyer and former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the high court on Friday.The petition also contended that the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the prosecuting agency, did not seek a prior sanction under the Code of Criminal Procedure to prosecute him, though he was a serving Army officer.Arguing before a division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik, Rohatgi said that Purohit had been working for the Army’s military intelligence unit.He attended conspiracy meetings before the 2008 Malegaon blast while “discharging his duties” as an intelligence officer, the senior counsel said.Hence the NIA should have sought a prior sanction under Section 197 of the CrPC to prosecute him, Rohatgi argued. Section 197 makes it mandatory to obtain a sanction from the government before public servants are prosecuted.The Army reinstated Purohit in 2017 after the Supreme Court granted him bail, Rohatgi pointed out, adding that the apex court had noted in bail order that Purohit attended conspiracy meetings as part of discharging his duties.“His job was to infiltrate meetings of religious fanatics and report to the Army. He was framed in the case and spent eight years in jail until the SC granted him bail,” Rohatgi said.The NIA, in its affidavit opposing Purohit’s plea, has claimed that while attending the conspiracy meetings, he was not working for the Army, so no sanction was required for his prosecution.The trial court as well as the high court had in the past rejected his plea seeking discharge, and a criminal appeal seeking similar relief is already pending before the high court, so he can not file a fresh plea, the NIA said.The high court granted Purohit’s lawyers time to respond to the NIA’s affidavit and posted the matter for hearing on September 23.Purohit had argued earlier too that he attended the blast conspiracy meetings in Faridabad and Bhopal while doing his job as an intelligence officer with his superiors’ permission.Six people were killed and 100 injured when a bomb strapped to a motorcycle went off near a mosque at Malegaon in north Maharashtra on September 29, 2008. As per the investigators, the bike belonged to co-accused and BJP MP Pragya Thakur.

Insisting that his tweets were not intended to disrespect the Supreme Court or the judiciary, he had said he reserved his right to file a review petition.However, the BCI—which regulates the legal profession in India—has directed the Bar Council of Delhi to “examine” the Supreme Court’s decision convicting Bhushan of contempt of court and proceed as per law and rules “as expeditiously as possible”.The decision was taken in the BCI General Council meeting held on Thursday via video conference that “discussed and deliberated” upon the top court judgments of August 14 and August 31 that held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt of court and ordered him to pay a token fine or Re 1.“The Council is of the view that the tweets and statements made by Shri Prashant Bhushan, Advocate and the Judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India needs thorough study and examination by the Bar Council in the light of the statutory duties, powers and functions conferred on it under the Advocates’ Act, 1961 and the rules framed thereunder, particularly, Section-24A and Section-35 of the Advocates Act, 1961 and Chapter-II, Part-VI of Bar Council of India Rules,” BCI Secretary Srimanto Sen said on Friday.The meeting was chaired by BCI Vice-Chairman Satish A Deshmukh, Sen added.A three-judge Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra—which held Bhushan guilty of contempt of court on August 14 for scandalising the Judiciary by his tweets against CJI SA Bobde and four former CJIs—had taken strong exception to the contemnor talking to the press and releasing his statement to journalists in advance.Two days after the verdict, Justice Mishra demitted office on September 2.“We are of the view that, in the circumstances, the defence taken cannot be said to be either in the public interest or bona fide one. On the contrary, it is more derogatory to the reputation of this Court and would amount to further scandalising and bringing administration of justice in disrepute, in which the common citizen of this country has faith and approaches this Court as a last resort for getting justice,” the top court had said, adding the contemnor has indulged in making reckless allegations against the institution of justice.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contempt-of-court-bci-directs-bar-council-of-delhi-to-examine-prashant-bhushans-tweets-136316

Be it Mumbai or entire Maharashtra, it is safe in the hands of the police,”Deshmukh told reporters in Nagpur.The NCP minister said the Maharashtra Police are capable of ensuring proper law and order in the state.And those who think Mumbai or Maharashtra is not safe for them (to live in), they have no right to live in Mumbai or Maharashtra, he added.The 33-year-old, Himachal Pradesh-born actress’s controversial statements on Mumbai and its police have triggered strong reactions.“Why is Mumbai feeling like Pakistan-occupied- Kashmir,” Ranaut had tweeted, and tagged a September 1 news report where Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut purportedly said she should not come back to Mumbai if she was afraid of the city police.She would require security from Haryana or Himachal Pradesh police and would not accept protection from the Mumbai police to expose the “drug mafia in Bollywood”, the award-winning actor had said.

Tensions flared up in the region after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong lake five days back.The Defence Minister also talked about the threat of terrorism and extremism and pitched for having the institutional capacity to deal with the challenges.“India unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and condemns its proponents. Adoption of anti-terror mechanism by SCO to counter extremist propaganda and de-radicalisation is a significant decision,” Singh said.Rajnath Singh added that India valued the works of the SCO Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS) and was committed to the evolution of global security architecture, which will be open, transparent and anchored in international laws.“We laud recent work of RATS in the cyber domain to prevent the spread of radicalism and extremism. The adoption of anti-terror measures by the SCO Council to counter extremist propaganda and de-radicalisation is a significant decision,” he added.In his address at the combined meeting of defence ministers of SCO, Collective Security Treaty Organisation and Commonwealth of Independent States member states, Singh said: “I reaffirm today that India is committed to the evolution of a global security architecture which will be open, transparent, inclusive, rules-based and anchored in international laws.”We needed the institutional capacity to deal with both traditional and non-traditional threats, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said at the SCO meet.“There is a need for a climate of trust, non-aggression and sensitivity towards each other key for peaceful, stable and secure SCO region. Respect for international laws, cooperation and peaceful resolution of differences is the only key for peace and stability in the SCO region,” he said.On the security situation in Afghanistan, he said it was a matter of concern.“India will continue to support efforts of people and government of Afghanistan for Afghan-led and Afghan-controlled peace process,” Rajnath said, adding: “The SCO contact group on Afghanistan is useful for exchanging notes among SCO member states.”He added that India was also deeply concerned about the situation in the Persian Gulf as well.“We call upon countries in the Gulf region to resolve differences through dialogue based on mutual respect and sovereignty,” he added.“India has vital interests and links of civilisation and culture with all States in the Gulf. We call upon countries in the region — all of which are dear and friendly to India, to resolve differences by dialogue based on mutual respect, sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs of each other,” he added.Rajnath Singh also talked about World War II at the SCO meet.In his address, he said the memories of World War II taught the globe the “follies of aggression” of one state upon another which brought “destruction” to all.“This year marks the 75th anniversary of the end of the World War II as well as the formation of the United Nations, which underpins a peaceful world, where international laws and sovereignty of states are respected and states refrain from unilateral aggression on another,” he said.On the coronavirus pandemic, he said the pandemic reminded us that mankind must forget differences to prevent and mitigate higher forces of nature.Singh also thanked Russia for organising the annual anti-terror exercise ‘Peace Mission’, which he said contributed to building trust and sharing of experience among defence forces.   “We applaud Russian scientists and health workers for spearheading the Sputnik V vaccine,” he said.

04-09-2020||---||DIAL sets up COVID-19 testing facility at IGI airport for inbound international flyers||New Delhi, September 4The operator for the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport — DIAL — on Friday informed that it had set up a COVID-19 testing facility at the multi-level car parking area of its Terminal 3 for select inbound overseas passengers, who have to take connecting domestic flights.“The facility will become operational in a few days,” it added.Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) has collaborated with Genestrings Diagnostic Centre in setting up the testing facility. Genestrings Diagnostic Centre is currently associated with the Delhi government to test COVID-19 samples.In an official statement, DIAL said: “Results of the samples collected at the laboratory will be declared within four to six hours to the incoming passengers. Until the results are confirmed, passengers will be isolated at the waiting lounge or may opt to stay in a hotel.”“In case of a positive result, the passenger will be processed in line with the applicable Indian Council of Medical Research protocols by the state authorities, who will then ensure that such persons do not come in close contact with those already having RT-PCR negative report. Those testing negative will be allowed to continue their onward journey,” it added.The Civil Aviation Ministry on Wednesday had said that international passengers, who had to take connecting domestic flights after landing in India, would have the option of getting themselves tested for COVID-19 at the entry airports.“If the RT-PCR test result is negative, the international passenger will be allowed to board his or her connecting domestic flight and he or she will not need to undergo any institutional quarantine,” the Ministry’s order said.An international passenger, who does not have a COVID-negative result certificate from a test done not more than 96 hours prior to the journey and does not opt for an on-arrival testing facility at the entry airport, will have to compulsorily undergo seven-day institutional quarantine followed by seven-day home quarantine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dial-sets-up-covid-19-testing-facility-at-igi-airport-for-inbound-international-flyers-136304

But after seeing my determination, she agreed for this long journey, he said.The couple arrived here on August 30 for DEd exam being conducted by the MP Board of Secondary Education. The examination will continue until September 11.As a video of the couple and their journey taken by some newspersons went viral on social media, the district administration stepped in to help them.If I had hired a taxi for coming to Gwalior, it would have cost Rs 30,000 which was a big amount for me. Whatever little jewellery we have, we mortgaged it to raise Rs 10,000."So far, we have spent Rs 5,000 on our one-way journey and on a room that we have taken on rent in Deendayal Nagar here, Kumar, who has studied till Class 8, said.We started off on August 28 morning and en route stayed a night each in Muzaffarpur (Bihar) and Lucknow to reach Gwalior on our scooter, said Kumar, who was working as a cook with a caterer before he lost his job three months ago because of lockdown.Earlier I thought that it won't be possible for me to appear in this examination but after seeing my husbands determination and courage, I got ready for this long journey."We faced a lot of trouble due to rains. I got a mild fever en route, but now everything is okay. I will apply for a teaching job in Jharkhand and I am sure I will get selected, Soni, who got married to Kumar in December last year, said.Taking cognisance of the couple's travails, Gwalior collector Kaushlendra Vikram Singh directed the districts women empowerment officer, Shaleen Sharma, to take care of them and provided Rs 5,000 as immediate assistance.Sharma said the administration will also pay for their rent and make arrangements for their food. We have also offered to send them back to their village safely.As the woman is pregnant, special attention is being given to her and her medical examination and ultrasound will be done on Sunday, he added.

The cumulative tests as on date have reached 4,66,79,145," the ministry said.The substantial increase in the testing levels is anchored in the daily expansion of the network of diagnostic laboratories across the country. As on date, there are 1,631 such laboratories in India -- 1,025 in the government sector and 606 private ones.With 83,341 new cases reported in a span of 24 hours, the country's COVID-19 tally mounted to 39,36,747, while the death toll due to the disease climbed to 68,472 with 1,096 people succumbing to it in a day, the data showed.

A precious year of students cannot be wasted,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra had said, adding that students' career “cannot be put under jeopardy for long”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-dismisses-plea-by-punjab-5-other-states-to-review-order-allowing-neet-jee-amid-covid-pandemic-136287

04-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi doc, aide held for giving forged COVID-19 test reports||A 34-year-old doctor and his associate were arrested for allegedly providing forged COVID-19 test reports to people in the National Capital, police said on Friday.The accused have been identified as Kush Bihari Parashar, a resident of Malviya Nagar, and his associate Amit Singh, they said.Police said they received a complaint from a reputed testing lab regarding forgery of COVID-19 test reports, following which a case under relevant sections was registered at the Hauz Khas police station.On August 30, one person, who runs a business of providing nursing staff to patients, asked doctor Parashar for COVID-19 test reports of his two nursing staff before they were engaged in the job, a senior police officer said.Parashar forged the reports and sent them to the businessman who, in turn, sent it to his client on her mobile. Spotting a mistake in the name in the report, the client contacted the diagnostic centre and asked for a new report with correction, the officer said.On verifying the details of the patients, it came to notice of the diagnostic centre that no such patient exists in their record. Later, a case was registered at Hauz Khas police station.The accused were arrested on Thursday."Parashar used to recommend patients for COVID-19 tests and collect the sample. With the help of co-accused Singh, he used to make forged test report of the renowned diagnostic centre or of the labs as desired by the patients,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.As the reports were prepared in PDF format on a computer and same were sent to patients on WhatsApp, it was difficult to differentiate between the forged and the genuine report, said the DCP.Parashar admitted that he had given forged COVID-19 test reports to more than 75 patients using names of diagnostic centres such as CRL Diagnostics Lab, Modern Diagnostics and Research Centre, Dr P Bhasin Pathlabs (P) Ltd and Prognosis Laboratories.Parashar said that he had been doing this forgery for the past two-and-a-half months and used to charge Rs 2,400 per test.There was no specific criterion for deciding negative or positive. Just as per the symptoms of the patient, the reports were prepared. Samples taken were destroyed, police said.Further investigation is in progress and efforts are being made to trace the other persons involved in the nexus, police added.

Is there any other methodology contemplated by CBSE," the bench asked during the hearing conducted through video conferencing.The counsel for the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) said the board has increased the number of examination centres for compartment tests from 575 to 1,278."We have taken a decision that in a class where 40 students could sit, now only 12 will sit and we are taking all precautions," the counsel for CBSE said."All necessary measures are being taken. The notification is likely to be issued soon. The examinations are to be held in September," he said.The court, which asked CBSE to file a short affidavit in response of the plea of Anika Samvedi, has now fixed the case for hearing on September 10.The plea has challenged the CBSE decision to hold compartment examinations for 12th class on the ground that it would be detrimental to the health of the examinees.The apex court asked the counsel for the petitioner to be clear about the relief being sought when he said the students will be considered as failed as the compartment examinations will not be concluded by September end.The lawyer also said the students will not be able to apply for further studies as admissions in universities will close by the time compartment examinations will be held.The counsel for CBSE said that on the one hand, petitioner wanted cancellation of examinations and then also raised the issue of admissions in universities.

We cannot grant you bail,” a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told senior advocate Vikas Singh, who represented Kumar.The Bench – which also included Justice AS Bopanna and Justice V Ramasubramanium – also declined his plea for hospitalisation, saying his medical reports suggested he didn’t need to be sent to a hospital.As Singh contended that it was a faulty judgment and testimonies of witnesses were completely reversed, the top court said his appeal against the Delhi High Court’s judgment convicting him in the case will be heard when the court reopened for in-person hearings.On behalf of riot victims, senior counsel HS Phoolka opposed Kumar’s bail plea, saying he was being looked after properly in the jail.Earlier, the court had refused to give him interim bail on May 13 this year after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had submitted that “it’s a case genocide and he was leading a mob.”Kumar (73)—who had sought interim bail on the ground of his poor health conditions—is in jail since December 31, 2018, when he surrendered after being convicted and awarded life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.He has challenged the Delhi High Court’s verdict of December 17, 2018, that awarded him life imprisonment for the “remainder of his natural life”.The case relates the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment’s Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1-2 in 1984, and burning down of a Gurudwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-sajjan-kumars-bail-plea-in-1984-anti-sikh-riots-case-136271

At present it is holding 75 per cent of its total water capacity as compared to 89 per cent last year and the 10-year average of 83 per cent.Both these dams are controlled by the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB).Following unprecedented inflows into the reservoirs last year due to freak weather events which led to heavy release of excess water, BBMB sources said that this year the water levels were being deliberately kept low so as to create a buffer to cater to any such events.Thein Dam, which is located on the Ravi in Punjab, had water reaching up to 514.25 meters against the maximum limit of 527.91 meters. Storage at this dam at present is just 58 per cent compared to 87 per cent last year and the average of 76 per cent over the past 10 years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-monsoon-nears-end-water-level-in-punjab-himachal-dams-remains-below-normal-136255

It was launched on Independence Day in 2019 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The government's initiative to rope in private players is based on challenges it faced in the last one year in JJM's implementation across different geographical regions."Given the challenges and the knowledge gaps being faced while implementing the JJM with speed and scale along with the future of rural water security, there is a pressing need for significant research and innovation in the water supply sector," Jal Shakti Ministry officials said.The rural drinking water supply is a complex subject with various social, environmental and technical challenges like geo-genic and anthropogenic water quality issues.Long-term potable water supply in harsh edapho-climatic conditions and disaster-prone areas along with monitoring it on sustained basis is no easy task.The challenge, particularly in rugged mountainous terrain in parts of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, and snow-capped habitations and hamlets in Arunachal Pradesh is huge.The challenges also include treatment of grey water generated in the households and its reuse, especially with toilets provided in households under the Swachh Bharat campaign.The applications of those, including scientists and R&D institutions, start-ups and innovators willing to join hands with the government, will be processed by the Ministry and referred to the office of Scientific Advisor to the Government of India for approval.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-to-seek-collaboration-from-scientists-and-institutions-in-private-sector-to-make-implementation-of-jjm-cost-effective-and-efficient-136253

Meanwhile, the stage is also set for the return of senior and experienced leader Sharad Yadav to the JD(U) fold.With Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party “sulking”, it remains to be seen if Chirag will experiment with something radical or allow his ambitions for a larger political role to fizzle out for a compromise settlement within the NDA.

The Indian assessment is clear — the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China istrying to alter the status of the LAC and is not open to reasoning. India’s plan for the short term is restoration of the April status quo ante while its long-term strategy demands demarcating the LAC on ground.Since May this year, the PLA has been making a westward push to capture more territory. The PLA first prevented Indian patrols in ‘grey areas’ – the points where the perception of the LAC varies and both have been making claims and counter-claims.“The situation is by far more serious than that in 1962,” said a functionary referring to the India-China war that year. This time, forces on either side are backed by latest technology such as satellite imagery, UAVs, long-range guns, missile launchers, fighter jets and radars.After months of negotiations having yielded nothing, the PLA made another westward movement on August 29-30 night. The Indian Army quickly rushed to occupy mountain tops along a 70-km stretch on the southern bank of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake. The PLA had done the same on the northern bank of the lake when it prevented Indian movement east of Finger-4, a mountain ridge.The LAC is at present not demarcated, but is assessed by the area under the control of troops of each country.China has been rejecting every proposal to define the boundary in the last 174 years, or since 1846.The British made five different proposals to define the boundary in 1846-47, 1865, 1873, 1899 and 1914, but China rejected all of them.In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested demarcation of the LAC.
