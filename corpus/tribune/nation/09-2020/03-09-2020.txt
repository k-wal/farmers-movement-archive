Because we have the long (term) view, our position there has been very clear--we have agreements and understandings with China. The agreements and understandings must be scrupulously observed by both parties,” Jaishankar said at an online event for the launch of his book.“The reality is what happens at the border will impact the relationship, you cannot separate it.”“I made this point a few days earlier in another context, I would say that I am totally convinced that a solution to the situation has to be found in the domain of diplomacy. And I say that with responsibility,” he said.Asserting that this is not the easiest of times in India-China relationship, Jaishankar pointed out that he had written the book ‘The India Way: Strategies for An Uncertain World’ before the Galwan Valley clashes broke out on June 15 in which 20 Indian army personnel were killed.He also said India and China were two civilizational states who are going to enter the fourth industrial revolution when most other big civilizations did not make it.

India is the location which has all these qualities. As a result, India is becoming the leading destination for foreign investment. The world believes in us. We have received over $ 20 billion in foreign investment this year. It rose to 20 per cent in 2019 when globally, overseas investments fell by one per cent. This shows the success of our FDI regime,” the PM noted.In order to emphasise the point that India was safe for business, the Prime Minister recounted the steps taken to shore up the health infrastructure. “The outcome of these efforts was that a country with 1.3 billion people and limited resources had one of the lowest death rates per million in the world and the recovery rate is also steadily rising,” Modi said.Apart from detailing all business-friendly measures taken so far in a 15-minute speech, the Prime Minister was also keen to underline to the international audience that the country also looked after its poor and maintained social stability despite the loss of earnings due to the lockdown.“In the past four months, the nation has battled COVID-19 and other natural crises such as floods, two cyclones and a locust attack. But it made people’s resolve stronger. Throughout, the government was clear on one thing: the poor have to be protected. This led to the largest support system seen everywhere globally,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-is-ready-for-investment-modi-tells-overseas-businesses-135859

We talked about a wide range of issues, particularly how to deepen defence and strategic cooperation between both the countries,” he said in a tweet.Earlier on Thursday, India and Russia finalised a major deal for manufacturing AK-47 203 rifles in India, the official Russian media reported.The AK-47 203 is the latest and most advanced version of the AK-47 rifle, which will replace the Indian Small Arms System (INSAS) 5.56x45 mm assault rifle.The Indian Army has a requirement for around 770,000 AK-47 203 rifles, of which 100,000 will be imported and the rest will be manufactured in India, Russia’s state-run Sputnik news agency said.There was no official confirmation from the Indian government on the finalisation of the deal.The rifles will be manufactured in India as part of the joint venture Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited (IRRPL), established between the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), the Kalashnikov Concern and Rosoboronexport—the Russian state agency for military exports, it said.Officials said that Singh is also likely to request the Russian side to ensure the timely delivery of the S-400 missile defence systems to India. The delivery of the first batch of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to India is scheduled by the end of 2021.Before departure, Singh in a tweet had said that issues of mutual interest will figure in his talks with Shoigu.“India and Russia are privileged Strategic Partners. Looking forward to further this partnership during my visit,” he said.It is Singh’s second visit to Moscow since June. He had represented India at the Victory Day Parade in Moscow on June 24 that commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War.Singh will also attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation here on Friday which will be attended by the defence ministers of the eight member nations.They are expected to deliberate on regional security challenges like terrorism and extremism and ways to deal with them collectively.The meeting is taking place under the shadow of a fierce border row between India and China, both members of the influential bloc.The SCO comprises eight member states—India, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.Chinese Defence Minister Gen Wei Fenghe and Pakistan’s Pervez Khattak are expected to attend the SCO meeting.The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations which accounts for almost 44 per cent of the world population stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea.The aim of the SCO is to maintain peace, stability and security of the region.

But the Bench can decide to take it up in an open court.The six ministers from Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Jharkhand have sought postponement of JEE-NEET exams.They have filed the petition in their individual capacity, their counsel Sunil Fernandes said.The petitioners are -- Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab), Moloy Ghatak (West Bengal), Dr Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Dr Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Uday Ravindra Saman (Maharashtra).As per the public notices issued by National Testing Agency (NTA) -- which conducts the tests, JEE (Main) April 2020 is scheduled from September 1 to 6, while NEET-UG 2020 exam is scheduled for September 13.The petitioners have requested the top court to reconsider its August 17 decision on conducting JEE-NEET examinations, highlighting the fact that 25 lakh students will cumulatively appear for the two exams at a time when COVID19 cases have crossed 3.31 million. They said the decision failed to balance the competing but equally important aspects of conducting the exams and safety of students  i.e. their right to life as mandatory safeguards had not been ensured during the tests.The Supreme Court had on August 17 rejected a petition seeking to postpone JEE (Main) and NEET-Undergraduate exams scheduled to be held in September, saying a precious year of students “can’t be wasted”.“Life has to go on... Life has to move ahead. A precious year of students cannot be wasted,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra had said, adding students’ career “cannot be put under jeopardy for long”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-take-up-on-friday-plea-by-ministers-from-6-non-bjp-ruled-states-to-postpone-jee-neet-135854

Where do we draw the line? How far back can we go?” the Bench asked as it emphasised that its direction in the February 17 verdict were one-time measures only.On behalf of the Centre, senior counsel R Balasubramanian opposed the plea, saying it can’t be an open-ended proposition.“The applicants had not completed 14 years of service as on February 17 — the cut-off fixed by the top court,” he pointed out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-plea-for-permanent-commission-for-women-army-officers-beyond-cut-off-date-135847
03-09-2020||New Delhi||Fake IFS officer flaunted red-beacon cars, five-star meetings to dupe company of 36 crore||The Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police has arrested a man who impersonated as an IFS officer flaunting red-beacon cars and held meetings at five-star hotels to create an impression that he played an important role in policy-making in the Government of India.The accused, Piyush Bandopadhyay, was arrested from Noida after he had duped a company of Rs 36 crore by luring them into a fake deal.A representative of SRM Mahadeo Smart Bio Toilet Pvt. Ltd. filed a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing against a woman named Shweta Sorout and her husband Piyush Bandopadhyay.Sorout introduced herself as the India head of Intellectual Innovation Think Tank (IITT) company dealing in selling patent technology to government and non-government agencies all across the world. She claimed her company was in the business of helping get government/non-government contracts.Sorout claimed her husband Piyush Bandopadhyay was an IFS officer posted in the PMO. She arranged a meeting of the representatives of SRM Mahadeo Smart Bio Toilet Pvt. Ltd. with her husband at Delhi’s Ashok Hotel.In the first meeting, Bandopadhyay introduced himself as an IFS officer working in the government and even produced fake visiting cards purportedly carrying his fake designation and insignia.He told the representatives that all projects related to Make-in-India, Smart City and solar energy were looked after by him. He claimed he could get any proposal of the company passed by the government.In order to convince the company about his genuine credentials, he also produced forged documents purportedly issued by the government.On the basis of the false representations by Bandopadhyay and his wife, SRM Mahadeo Smart Bio Toilet Pvt. Ltd. convinced the Directors of Mitsumi Distributors based in Dubai to purchase patent technology from IITT.As per their discussion, an initial amount of approximately Rs 23 crore was transferred by Mitsumi Distributors through SRM Mahadeo Smart Bio Toilet Pvt. Ltd. to the account of Intellectual Innovation Think Tank (IITT).Later, a few other transactions took place between the conman couple’s company and Directors of Mitsumi Distributors. In this way, the total amount transferred to Intellectual Innovation Think Tank was to the tune of Rs 36 crore.On the basis of the complaint, a case under section 419/420/406/409/120-B IPC relating to cheating and forgery were registered in police station Economic Offences Wing and an investigation taken up.In order to establish his credentials as an IFS officer, Bandopadhyay used to have business meetings in five-star hotels. He would arrive for the meetings in a red-beacon fitted car.In order to create an impression about his status as a senior government functionary, he would drop names of senior officials before the clients during business conversations.He used to highlight recent initiatives of the government as if he had played an important role in policy making.“Piyush Bandopadhyay has been changing his rented residences quite often. Even before his landlords, he introduced himself as an IFS officer. It is reliably learnt that two more complaints have been filed against him regarding impersonation. On the basis of credible inputs, Bandopadhyay was arrested by the EOW team from his rented accommodation in Noida. The beacon-fitted car used by him for meeting his clients has also been recovered from a hideout. The police have also seized papers of property from the accused procured through the cheated amount,” said OP Mishra,Joint CP EOW.

03-09-2020||New Delhi||Gen Rawat gives warning to Pakistan; says country will suffer ‘heavy losses’ if it attempted any misadventure against India||India’s armed forces are capable of handling aggressive Chinese actions in “best suitable ways”, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat said on Thursday. His remarks came against the backdrop of China’s fresh attempts to change the status quo in certain areas in eastern Ladakh.In an interactive session at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, Gen Rawat also asserted that India’s policy of engagement in the region, if not backed by credible military power and influence, would imply acknowledging China's pre-eminence.Rawat also warned Pakistan against trying to take advantage of any possible conflict between India and China in eastern Ladakh, saying Islamabad may suffer “heavy losses” for any “misadventure”.“Of late, India has been seeing some aggressive actions by China but we are capable of handling these in the best suitable ways,” Gen Rawat said at the online event while mentioning laid down protocols between the two countries in maintaining peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control.Also read: Border situation in Ladakh ‘direct result’ of Chinese action to effect unilateral change in status quo: MEAHe said China’s infra projects in Tibet Autonomous Region, including completion of a highway renovation project and development of strategic railway lines, as also recently introduced reforms in Chinese military were being monitored by India and their implications are being considered in devising a strategy for the future.Tensions flared in eastern Ladakh after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the Southern Bank of Pangong lake four days back when the two sides were engaged in diplomatic and military talks to resolve the festering border row.India occupied a number of strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong lake and strengthened its presence in Finger 2 and Finger 3 areas in the region to thwart any Chinese actions in the future. China has strongly objected to India’s move.Noting that Pakistan could take advantage of India’s border row with China, the Chief of Defence Staff said it might create some trouble for New Delhi on the northern border.“Therefore, we have taken adequate precautions to ensure that any such misadventure by Pakistan is sorted and they are not able to succeed in their mission. In fact, they may suffer heavy losses should they attempt any misadventure,” he said.The Chief of Defence Staff spoke extensively about how Pakistan has been engaged in a proxy war against India and pushing terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir and also its attempts to spread terrorism in other parts of the country.“We have unsettled borders along the northern front and also in the western front with Pakistan. So our military will continue to be a significant factor in determining our national security. Our armed forces will have to be prepared to deal with the immediate crisis and concurrently prepare for the future,” he said.Gen Rawat said China’s economic cooperation with Pakistan in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir along with its continued military, economic and diplomatic support requires high levels of “preparations” by India.“At the same time, it poses the threat of coordinated action along the northern and western fronts which we have to consider in our defence planning,” he said, adding: “Considering the threats from our northern and western borders, we have devised strategies to deal with a primary front, depending on which to consider a primary threat.”Talking about India’s overall security challenges, the Chief of Defence Staff said the country faced the most “complex threats and challenges” spanning the full spectrum of conflict from “nuclear to sub-conventional”.“The key geostrategic challenges emanate from the instability due to perceived misconception about nationalism often leading to conflict. The proxy war unleashed by Pakistan blocked India’s efforts at regional integration besides fomenting terrorism against India and exploiting our diverse faultlines,” he said.“The rising Chinese influence in East Asia, South East Asia and South Asia, and developments in the Indian Ocean Region including non-traditional threats like piracy, maritime terrorism, human trafficking and bioterrorism have a direct bearing on India's interests,” Gen Rawat said.On ‘Quad’ or Quadrilateral coalition among India, the US, Australia and Japan, Gen.

Beyond that the lift will operate automatically, from vertical movement to opening and closing of doors. There are 50 such lifts at these metro stations.Also as per the COVID-19 safety norms, a maximum of three passengers will be allowed in a lift at a time at any station, a senior official said.The stoppage duration of trains will be longer. From 10-15 seconds at each station it will be increased to 20-25 seconds, and at interchange facilities, it will be increased from 35-40 seconds to 55-60 seconds, when services resume.DMRC has 10 lines spanning 242 stations, and 264 stations including the Rapid Metro in Gurgaon.On Wednesday, the city recorded 2,509 coronavirus cases, the highest single-day spike in nearly the last 60 days.Officials of the urban transporter also cautioned that “trains may not stop at some of the stations” if social distancing norms are not adhered to by passengers.“The Delhi Metro services will be resumed in a graded manner in three stages from September 7-12 with the Yellow Line or Line 2 connecting Samyapur Bali in Delhi to HUDA City Centre in Gurgaon and Rapid Metro to be the first ones to be made operational on September 7,” the DMRC said on Wednesday.Trains will operate in batches of four-hour each from 7-11 am in the morning and 4-8 pm in the evening, it said.Metro services in Delhi-NCR have been closed since March 22 due to the pandemic.The Ministry of Home Affairs on Saturday had issued Unlock 4 guidelines, permitting metro rail operations from September 7 in a graded manner. “This is a new normal and an evolving scenario, so we will anyway be assessing the situation once we resume services,” a senior official said.Wearing masks will be mandatory for commuters and for the time being, no tokens will be issued to passengers due to the high risk of virus spreading through it, officials said.Only smart card users, including QR code users on Airport Express Line will be allowed to travel, which can be recharged digitally without any human interface, the official said.Recharge of smart cards at ticket vending machines (TVMs) or Customer Care Centre will be through cashless mode only, via debit card, credit card, Bharat QR code etc, he said.New smart cards can be purchased through cashless modes, the official said, adding, grievance redressal will be taken up through online means and social media, and complaint books at stations will be discontinued for the time being.Use of Aarogya Setu App by commuters will be advisable, and regular announcements on maintaining hygiene and social distancing norms will be continuously announced in station premises and inside coaches, official said.Dos and don’ts on COVID-19 have been prominently displayed at metro stations, and a large team of staff will be deployed to regulate or restrict entry of passengers in case of crowd build up or violation of social distancing norms, the DMRC said.Luggage bags will be sanitised just before the frisking points, and people are advised to carry light luggage with no metallic objects, it said.The number of containment zones in Delhi on Wednesday jumped to 894, according to the Delhi Health Department bulletin, according to which the total cases mounted to over 1.79 lakh and COVID-19 death toll mounted to 4,481.The total number of entry points at Delhi Metro stations will be heavily curtailed to ensure compliance with COVID-19 safety norms. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/foot-pedal-driven-lifts-auto-dispensers-for-sanitiser-metro-for-least-contact-travel-for-riders-135831

In September 2019, five women and a man were arrested from Indore and Bhopal for allegedly running the racket.The photos show jailer KK Kulshreshta sitting on a chair outside the video-conference room in the women’s wing of the district jail, talking to Shweta Vijay Jain, who has been lodged at the jail here after her arrest in the case.The probe will ascertain who clicked the photos and circulated them as photography in the jail is prohibited, the official said.It is suspected that a jail staffer clicked the pictures secretly, he added.The charge sheet filed by police in December 2019 said the accused were allegedly involved in trafficking of women and “trapping persons in higher positions in government by capturing their intimate moments with these women by secret cameras, taking screen shots of chats and other objectionable material to blackmail them”.Deputy Inspector General (Prisons) Sanjay Pandey told PTI that Indore Central Jail Superintendent Rakesh Kumar Bhangre has been asked to probe in a week how the photos were clicked inside the prison and submit a report.Pandey said it is the jailer’s duty to interact with inmates to know about arrangements in the jail, adding he found nothing objectionable in the photo content.

Russia’s state-owned export agency, Rosoboronexport, would own the remaining 7.5 per cent, the report said.The 7.62×39 mm Russian weapon will be produced at the Korwa Ordnance Factory in Uttar Pradesh, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year, the report said.The cost of per rifle is expected to be around USD 1,100, including the cost of technology transfer and of setting up the manufacturing unit, according to the report.The INSAS, which is use since 1996, has developed some issues such as jamming and magazine cracking at higher altitudes in the Himalayas, the Sputnik report said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-russia-finalise-ak-47-203-rifles-deal-media-report-135818

My family felt that we will be safe here. I wanted to spend some quality time with my family,” he said.He said he was falsely implicated by the UP government and sent to jail as he had exposed the system.“I was leading a simple life. I tried to expose the system as children died at BRD Medical College due to lack of oxygen. This did not go well with our chief minister and a false case was lodged, and I was sent to jail,” he claimed.Khan alleged he was tortured and asked “weird questions” after being arrested by the UP special task force in Mumbai over the speech in gave at the Aligarh Muslim University.“The NSA was imposed on me for three months and was extended for three months. Again, it was extended after three months. I was not given water for 72 hours after being taken into custody,” he claimed.“I was physically tortured after the STF arrested me. I was asked weird questions like if have invented any powder to kill people and visited Japan to topple the government,” Khan said.He had been in jail since January after he delivered the speech during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) last December.Ordering his release on Tuesday, the Allahabad High Court said the speech didn’t promote hatred or violence and gave a call for national unit.The Bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Saumitra Dayal Singh said the Aligarh district magistrate, who passed the order for Khan’s detention, did a “selective reading” of his speech, “ignoring its true intent”.             Immediately after his release from Mathura Jail on Tuesday night, Khan told reporters that he was apprehensive that the UP government might frame him in any other case.

03-09-2020||New Delhi||500 academicians, scientists write to Environment Ministry for withdrawal of draft EIA notification||As many as 500 academicians, scientists and researchers from various educational institutes across the country have urged the environment ministry to withdraw the controversial draft EIA notification and strengthen the existing EIA 2006 notification with a new proposal.Ever since the notification was issued in March, the Ministry has received suggestions through nearly 17 lakh e-mails, including several objections.In yet another letter, the signatories from 130 institutions have listed their concerns regarding the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, which has been surrounded by controversy since its release and asked the ministry to withdraw it as it could adversely affect the environment and dilute the clearance process.The institutes and universities that have written to the ministry include the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER), the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) the and Wildlife Institute of India (WII).The controversial notification has drawn severe criticism and protests from students, citizens, activists, environmentalists across the country for “fundamentally dismantling environmental safeguards to promote ease of doing business”.“This cross-institutional collaboration, initiated by PhD students from different institutes, was supported by 105 faculties, former faculties and senior scientists, along with over 400 PhD scholars, post-doctoral research fellows, independent researchers and other research students, who have all signed the letter in their personal capacities,” a press note released by the signatories said.The letter says the legitimisation of ex-post facto environmental clearances is a significant dilution of the EIA process. It also expresses concern on the reclassification of many highly-polluting industries and projects to exempt those from proper environmental appraisals altogether.It calls for an improved and more inclusive public consultation processes in environmental decision-making and effective post-clearance monitoring mechanisms.“While a lot of noise is made about iconic species such as tigers, turtles and elephants and there is outrage even about individual animals, the truth is that poorly planned large-scale development projects have the greatest negative impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems and people. This notification leaves the door open to projects that may severely impact the environment and yet have little real benefit for the people in need,” Kartik Shanker, associate professor at the IISc, Bengaluru, who is one of the signatories to the letter, said.Ayaz Ahmed, a PhD scholar from IIT-Bombay, said: “The EIA process is supposed to regulate the polluting industries and other development projects and mitigate their impact on the environment. But instead, the draft proposes to ease the environmental safeguards. We need stronger environmental regulations.”The draft EIA notification was issued by the Ministry on March 23 with public opinions and suggestions invited till August 11.

However, in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu there is decrease in daily deaths," he said."On a week-to-week basis, there has been 4.5 per cent decrease in average daily deaths reported in Andhra Pradesh, 11.5 per cent decline in Maharashtra and 18.2 per cent decline in Tamil Nadu. On the other hand, Delhi has seen 50 per cent and Karnataka has seen 9.6 per cent increase in average daily fatalities," he said.There was a decline of both active cases and deaths but there has been a rise in the past few weeks in the National Capital, he said.Giving statistics on the number of cases per million population, Bhushan said India has 2,792 cases of COVID-19 per million population which is amongst the lowest in the world.He added that in India, deaths per million population is 49 which is also amongst the lowest in the world."Recovered cases of COVID-19 are 3.6 times the number of active cases," he added.Bhushan said states and UTs where COVID positivity rate among healthcare workers is on the higher side are Telangana (18 per cent), Maharashtra (16 per cent), Delhi (14 per cent), Karnataka (13 per cent), Puducherry (12 per cent) and Punjab (11 per cent).Responding to a question, Bhushan said there is no directive from the Health Ministry on wearing a mask if you driving a car alone or riding a cycle alone."If you are cycling or jogging in a group you need a mask and need to maintain social distancing," he said.On a question on why the government is opening up the economy when cases are increasing, Bhushan said a graded approach has been adopted to unlock and open up various economic activities."It is not as if suddenly everything has been opened up. Prior to graded opening of economic activities, the government also ensured that all prerequisites such as adequate testing capacity, clear-cut guidelines of standard clinical treatment protocol and enhanced hospital infrastructure are in place," he said.At the end of the day the government firmly believes that while lives are important, livelihoods are equally important, he added."Daily positive numbers are increasing there is no doubt about it. But then these numbers have to be seen in the context of the total population of India. We are the second most populous country in the world. We are conducting, on an average, 9.5 lakh tests in a day which was not happening atleast a month and half ago," he said."In the last 24 hours we conducted 11.70 lakh tests and what is interesting to note is that in these tests, the positivity rate remained 7.20 per cent," Bhushan added.

03-09-2020||Satya Prakash||Loan moratorium: SC breather for distressed borrowers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi September 3The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered banks not to declare any loan account non performing asset (NPA) if it was not so on August 31 when the loan repayment moratorium scheme announced by the RBI ended."Accounts not declared NPA as on August 31 shall not be declared NPA for two months," a three-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan said in an interim order.The order protects those accounts from being declared as NPAs which were not NPA's as on August 31.Read also: Sitharaman asks banks to speed up loan disbursals to Covid-hitThe protection from being declared NPAs for such accounts will continue till the petitions seeking interest waiver on loans during COVID19 lockdown were disposed of, it said posting the matter for further hearing on September 10.While passing the interim order, the Bench -- which also included Justice R Subhash Reddy and Justice MR Shah -- noted that borrowers needed to be protected.The order came after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Harish Salve, representing the Centre and Indian Banks' Association respectively, tried to convince the court as to why interest has to be kept alive in order to save banks.Mehta said banks were free to deal with borrowers and offer them solutions depending upon their specific problems and needs. A one-size-fits-all solution cannot be granted owing to the difference in difficulties faced by different categories of borrowers, he said.However, the Bench said the RBI needed to issue certain directives to deal with the situation."What you do, that's for you to decide. Certain things have to be decided by the Government of India and the RBI. Everything can't be left to the banks," the top court said.During Thursday's hearing, the Bench made it clear that it was mainly considering two issues -- if banks should be charging interest on interest and if the National Disaster Management Authority under the Disaster Management Act can provide relief with regard to loan repayment in disaster situations.Announced by RBI in March for three months, the loan moratorium is a legal authorization to debtors to postpone payment of EMIs. it was extended to six months till August 31, 2020.The RBI and Centre maintained that a complete interest waiver was not possible as banks too had to pay interest to depositors. RBI had said forced waiver of interest on term loans would jeopardise the financial health of banks and would also harm debtors' interests.Amid uncertainty over loan repayment moratorium scheme that ended on August 31, the Centre and RBI had told the court on Tuesday that it was capable of being extended up to two years in view of COVID19. However, no formal decision had been taken in this regard.The top court -- which is seized of petitions demanding waiver of interest, or waiver of interest on interest on the suspended EMIs during moratorium -- had earlier commented that there was no point in charging interest on interest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/loan-moratorium-sc-breather-for-distressed-borrowers-135802

03-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant case probe: HC asks media to exercise restraint||The Bombay High Court on Thursday said it expects media organisations to exercise restraint while publishing or reporting any details about investigation in the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.A division bench of Justices A A Sayed and S P Tavade said the media should report in such a manner that it does not hamper the investigation.The court was hearing two petitions which claimed a “media trial” was going on in the case of Rajput’s death and sought for it to be stopped.One of the petitions was filed by eight former IPS officers against the “unfair, malicious and false media campaign” against Mumbai Police.The petitioners include former director generals of police M N Singh, P S Pasricha, K Subramanyam, D Sivanandan, Sanjeev Dayal and Satish Mathur, former additional DGP K P Raghuvanshi and former Mumbai police commissioner D N Jadhav.The other petition was filed by filmmaker Nilesh Navlakha and two others who claim to be social activists, seeking direction to media organisations not to sensationalise reportage in the case.“We urge and expect the media to exercise restraint before publishing or reporting on details of the investigation, and report in such a manner that it does not hamper the investigation,” the court said.The bench said before hearing the matter further, it would like to first see what the Union government and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing the case, have to say in response to the pleas.The high court posted the petitions for further hearing on September 10.The court also said Navlakha shall once again serve copies of his petition to news media channels that are respondents in the petition.Navlakha’s advocate Devadatt Kamat told the court that they are not demanding a prohibition on reporting in the case, but only seeking the media to adhere to journalistic standards and ethics.The plea filed by the retired IPS officers said a section of TV channels has been trying to influence the course of investigation being carried out by central agencies like the CBI, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), and is running a false propaganda against the Mumbai Police.Senior counsel Milind Sathe, appearing for the retired police officers, on Thursday argued that the media was running a “parallel investigation and the reporting is completely defamatory towards the city police”.“We (petitioners) are not concerned about which agency is probing the case or who the accused persons are...we are only concerned about the media trial being conducted,” Sathe said.The retired IPS officers have sought a direction to news media organisations to refrain from publishing or circulating any false, derogatory and scandalous comments which may jeopardise the reputation of the city police.Rajput, 34, was found hanging in his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14 following which the Mumbai Police registered an Accidental Death Report and recorded statements of over 50 people, including some of his family members and Bollywood personalities.The late actor’s father on July 25 lodged a complaint with Patna Police, accusing Rajput’s girlfriend and actress Rhea Chakraborty and her family members of abetting his suicide and misappropriating his money.The Supreme Court last month upheld the transfer of the FIR lodged in Patna to the CBI, which is currently probing the case.Besides, the ED is probing allegations of money laundering against Chakraborty and her family, while the NCB is probing a drugs trafficking case linked to the case of Rajput’s death. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sushant-case-probe-hc-asks-media-to-exercise-restraint-135796

He lauded the focussed efforts by the station personnel towards maintaining proficiency in all roles envisaged and urged them to continue performing their duty with due diligence,” the official said.The IAF Chief has been regularly visiting key air bases along the LAC since the border row broke out between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh in early May.In June, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria made a quiet visit to Ladakh and Srinagar air bases to review the IAF’s overall preparedness.In the last two months, the IAF deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the LAC.The IAF has also deployed Apache attack choppers as well as Chinook heavy-lift helicopters to transport troops to various forward locations in the region.On Monday, the Indian Army said the Chinese military carried out “provocative military movements” to “unilaterally” change the status quo on the southern bank of Pangong lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30 but the attempt was thwarted by the Indian troops.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Tuesday said the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was engaged in “provocative action” again a day earlier when the ground commanders of the two sides were holding talks to ease the situation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-chief-marshal-reviews-iafs-operational-preparedness-in-eastern-sector-135791

"Also, we are trying to get videos or pictures of the incident," he added.The incident was reported on August 21 and as per the Khap panchayat, the man and woman were asked to wash off their sins by bathing in a public place. Hundreds of villagers gathered to look at the so-called punishment.A few onlookers even took pictures and made videos of the incident, but nobody came forward to help them.

03-09-2020||New Delhi||India steps up scrutiny of visa requests of Chinese influence group CAIFU||India has ordered tougher scrutiny of visa requests by a Chinese non-profit headed by a senior official of the ruling communist party, designating it as an entity of concern in a broader security sweep, sources involved in the matter say.The closer monitoring of the Chinese Association for International Understanding (CAIFU) comes at a time when India and China are locked in their most serious border dispute in more than half a century.This week, India expanded a ban on China’s mobile apps in a new move to counter its dominant position in internet services, following tighter approval norms for investment by its firms and tougher rules for companies joining in government tenders.Its latest step also follows tougher scrutiny of Chinese cultural and language institutions such as Confucius Institutes in the United States and partnerships in Australia.Indian officials say the well-resourced Beijing-based group is tied to the Communist Party Central Committee’s United Front Work Department, which runs influence operations outside China by cultivating leaders, members of think tanks and the media.In an internal memo, the Indian government has listed the body as an entity of concern, signalling that its activities could run counter to national interests, said two officials aware of the matter.The new category means that the body’s representatives, or groups it backs, will face a security clearance procedure before visas can be issued, said the officials, who sought anonymity because they were not authorised to speak in public.“Visa requests will be looked at very closely, whether it is think-tankers or businessmen,” one of them added.China’s Foreign Ministry said the association, headed by Ji Bingxuan, vice-chair of China’s largely rubber-stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, was a non-profit engaged in friendly interaction with social bodies from all countries.“It aims to promote mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and people from all over the world, including India,” a ministry representative said in response to a Reuters query, adding: “It also strives to promote the exchange between cultures and civilisations.”Organisations such as the India-China Economic and Cultural Council, based in Beijing, that have been sponsoring visas for the CAIFU will also be subject to security clearances.India’s Home and the Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment.The move is part of a broader investigation into Chinese activities in India as political ties sour.“We do know that the government is looking at various China-related outfits operating in India,” said Jayadeva Ranade, a China specialist formerly with the Research and Analysis Wing, India’s external intelligence service.Scrutiny in the United States, AustraliaLast month, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the centre that managed Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes in the United States would have to register as a foreign mission. He called the institutes a malign influence on the US campuses.Amid concerns about Chinese state interference in its politics and society, Australia has also looked to improve oversight of some activities by foreign groups and ended other arrangements while often avoiding naming China specifically.Last week, Australia said it would introduce laws to give the federal government the power to veto any pacts that local authorities, universities and other public institutions have with foreign governments.The CAIFU has traditionally been headed by a high-ranking Chinese leader, such as a current or former vice-chair of the National People’s Congress.Its board comprises a current and two former vice ministers from the communist party’s International Liaison Department.“It has a lot of resources at its disposal, intended to win friends and reduce the risk for China abroad,” said Srikanth Kondapalli, a China studies expert at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University.A Chinese professor, however, said the new move would make little difference as India had traditionally been strict in handing visas to Chinese scholars and organisations.“I think the Indian move is more to appease domestic nationalism than a real security threat about Chinese spies,” said Zhang Jiadong, director of the Center for South Asian Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.

03-09-2020||New Delhi||Facebook responds to Congress’ charge of political bias; says it is non-partisan, denounces hate||Amid a raging controversy over Facebook’s alleged political bias and interference in India’s democratic process, the social media giant has told the Congress that it is non-partisan, denounces hate and bigotry in all forms and strives to ensure that its platforms remain a space where people can express themselves freely.Responding to the concerns raised by the Opposition Congress, Facebook’s Public Policy, Trust and Safety director Neil Potts has said that it has taken the party’s allegation of bias very seriously and will ensure that it remains non-partisan and is committed to maintaining the highest levels of integrity.The Congress accused Facebook of interfering in India’s democratic process and social harmony and being soft on members of the ruling BJP while applying its hate-speech rules.The Congress had written to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg after reports by the Wall Street Journal and the Time magazine about the conduct of Facebook and WhatsApp India’s leadership team flagged bias and proximity with the ruling BJP.“We take seriously the concerns and recommendations you raised on behalf of the Indian National Congress. First and foremost, we want to take this opportunity to state that we are non-partisan and strive to ensure that our platforms remain a space where people can express themselves freely. We take allegations of bias seriously and want to make clear that we denounce hate and bigotry in all forms,” Potts said in the letter, dated September 1.In his letter to AICC general-secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal, who had written to Zuckerberg twice, Potts said: “On the question of hateful content by public figures, we want to assure you that our Community Standards prohibit attacks against people based on their protected characteristics, including religion, caste, ethnicity, and national origin. In line with our hate speech policy, we have removed and will continue to remove hateful content by public figures in India on our platforms.”Facebook is at the centre of a raging political debate in the country with both the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress accusing it of colluding and influencing opinion.The BJP has accused the social media giant’s employees of supporting people from a political predisposition that lost successive elections, and “abusing” the Prime Minister and senior cabinet ministers.In a three-page letter to Zuckerberg, IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad flagged the social media platform’s alleged “bias and inaction” by individuals in the Facebook India team on complaints by people supportive of right-of-centre ideology.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology had also called representatives of Facebook to hear their views “on the subject of safeguarding citizens’ rights and prevention of misuse of social or online news media platforms, including special emphasis on women security in the digital space”.Facebook’s India head Ajit Mohan appeared before the panel on Wednesday.In his letter to the Congress, Facebook’s Potts said: “To reiterate, we are committed to maintaining the highest levels of integrity in the way we operate and in fostering an environment of free and safe expression on our platforms.”The Facebook official said as part of its policy development process, it consults a community of external voices, including civil society organisations, academics and subject experts, besides also relying extensively on inputs from a broad cross-section of internal teams, who understand both local and global contexts in the enforcement of our policies on hate speech and dangerous organisations and individuals.Facebook said it had a team with deep expertise on terrorism and organised hate, who paid attention to global and regional trends and advise on these matters.“These decisions are not made unilaterally by any one person; rather, they are inclusive of different views from teams around the company, a process that is critical to making sure we consider, understand, and account for both the local and global contexts,” the company said.Congress’ Data Analytics Department head Praveen Chakravarty said Facebook had acknowledged and responded to concerns of the Congress about interference in India’s affairs and has promised corrective measures but awaits further concrete measures.He said this was not a political issue and it was about India’s democracy and use of digital weapons to disrupt India’s social order by a foreign company, at the behest of certain individuals in their leadership team.“The Congress party will await further concrete action from the global leadership of Facebook and demonstration of specific corrective measures being undertaken in Facebook and WhatsApp India. It must be reiterated that the media revelations on this issue were based on solid documentary evidence of internal communication and are hence incontrovertible,” Chakravarty said in a statement.Earlier, the Congress had demanded a joint parliamentary party (JPC) probe into Facebook India’s role in interfering with the country’s democratic process and a criminal investigation against Facebook India’s leadership.

03-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: NCB nabs another suspect||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is questioning another person, suspected to be a drug trafficker, in connection with the drugs trafficking case linked to the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death, officials said on Thursday.The man whose identity has not been revealed is allegedly linked to Basit Parihar who has been arrested by the federal anti-narcotics agency in this case.The NCB has arrested two people in this probe till now, the other being Zaid Vilatra (21).Zaid was produced before a local court by the agency on Thursday that sent him to its custody till September 9.Indian currency worth Rs 9,55,750 and foreign currency (USD 2,081, 180 British Pounds, 15 dirhams), which the NCB claimed are "proceeds of drug peddling", were recovered from Zaid."Zaid disclosed that he runs an eatery in Bandra which was not giving any pecuniary gains since lockdown. He also disclosed that he is into drug peddling, especially bud, through which he used to earn a substantial amount of money," the NCB had said.According to the NCB, the best quality of bud is sold for about Rs 5,000 per gram.Zaid came under the scanner after the agency arrested two people -- Abbas Lakhani and Karan Arora -- in another narcotics case on August 27-28 in Mumbai and recovered a bud consignment from them.Lakhani had "linkages" with Zaid, the NCB claimed.Bandra resident Parihar was arrested after interrogating Zaid. Parihar is learnt to have "links" with the narcotics case registered against Rajput's live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty, 28, and others.Parihar is linked to a person who in turn was allegedly reported to be featuring in chats recovered from the mobile phone of Rhea and her brother Showik, they said.Rhea is the main accused in the death case of the 34-year-old actor that is being probed by the NCB, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on money laundering charges and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The role of Rhea's brother Showik and his purported links with the people nabbed by the NCB are under the scanner of the agency and he and Rajput's manager Samuel Miranda are expected to be summoned for questioning soon, the officials said.Some more drug peddlers based in Maharashtra, Delhi and Goa are also under the agency's scanner, they said.The agency filed a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act after the ED shared with it a report following the cloning of two mobile phones of Rhea.According to the officials, the mobile phone chats and messages indicated procurement, transportation and consumption of drugs and these leads were shared by the ED with the NCB and the CBI.The NCB is understood to have obtained the phone records of other accused in the case too.Rajput was found dead at his duplex flat in Bandra on June 14.

03-09-2020||New Delhi||India conducts 11.72 lakh daily COVID-19 tests, Health Ministry says numbers one of highest in world||Cumulative tests for detection of COVID-19 rose to 4,55,09,380 in the country with a record 11,72,179 tests being conducted on Wednesday, the Union Health Ministry said underlining that India’s daily testing numbers are one of the highest in the world. Higher testing numbers subsequently result in lowered positivity rate, it said on Thursday.“India has witnessed an unprecedented surge in testing. Over 11.7 lakh tests were done in 24 hours,” the ministry said.                  From conducting merely 10 tests per day on January 30, the daily average has crossed more than 11 lakh, the ministry said, adding this demonstrates an exponential increase in the daily COVID-19 testing in the country.“Such high levels of testing on a sustained basis over a period of time in widespread areas enable early diagnosis, and in turn facilitates seamless isolation and effective hospitalisation. This eventually leads to lower mortality rate.“Higher numbers of testing also subsequently result in lowered positivity rate,” the ministry said.           India’s COVID-19 case fatality rate due to the disease has further dropped to 1.75 per cent as on date, while the national recovery rate has risen to 77.09 per cent.There are 8,15,538 active cases of coronavirus infection in the country which comprises 21.16 per cent of the total caseload, the data stated.               Asked about rapid antigen tests comprising a large chunk of the total tests conducted now, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan at a press briefing on Thursday said that there is no uniform picture across the country on this.              In Tamil Nadu, more than 90 per cent tests even today are RT-PCR tests while there are other states where the RT-PCR testing, TrueNat and CBNAAT testing capacity is limited and therefore in those states, if there are containment zones or buffer zones, one cannot be satisfied with limited testing, he stressed.The ICMR’s guidelines clearly lay down that rapid antigen tests are ideal screening tests for densely populated areas, for containment and buffer zones so why not use them there, he said.       “However, I  do admit there are states where the optimal capacity of RT-PCR off late is not being utilised and we have in the Health Ministry drawn the attention of those states that they do have an installed capacity of conducting more RT-PCR tests and hence they need to scale it up,” Bhushan said.ICMR Director General Dr Balram Bhargava said that WHO has lauded India for use of rapid antigen tests in a calibrated and distributive manner.      The surge in testing has been made possible by an equally speedy expansion in the testing lab network across the country. India has as on date 1,623 labs with 1,022 in the government sector and 601 private labs, the ministry said.          With a record single-day spike of 83,883 infections, India’s COVID-19 caseload mounted to 38,53,406, while the death toll climbed to 67,376 with 1,043 people succumbing to the disease in a day, the ministry’s data updated at 8 am showed. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-conducts-11-72-lakh-daily-covid-19-tests-health-ministry-says-numbers-one-of-highest-in-world-135765

We could have called it a second wave if there were no positive cases for one or two months and then cases would have started coming again. The virus is still there in Delhi. You should not stress about numbers." He said Delhi's case fatality ratio was 0.75 per cent on Wednesday, which is a good sign."Overall, it is 2.5 per cent. Yesterday, it was less than one per cent, which is a good sign. At one time, it was 3.5 per cent," he added.Jain said the Delhi government is working to increase testing for COVID-19."We are increasing (the number of) tests. We are emphasising on testing and working aggressively on it. Yesterday, the number was around 30,000 and today the number of tests will be around 35,000. If a case is isolated at home or hospital, he won't be able to infect 10 people. We want that not one positive case should be there," he said.Last week, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that his government will double COVID-19 tests from 20,000 to 40,000. On Wednesday, a total of 28,835 tests were conducted, the maximum since March.On certain private hospitals in Delhi facing a shortage of ICU beds, Jain said over 70 per cent of the 14,000 beds allocated for COVID-19 in the city are vacant."We asked five to six hospitals and learnt that 70 to 80 per cent of patients there are from outside Delhi. There might be issues in some hospitals but there is no shortage of beds," he said.Jain also said the government is formulating protocols for travelling in the Delhi Metro, which will resume from September 7 after a hiatus of over five months."A dry run is also being conducted so that it can be ensured that people wear masks, clean their hands, follow social distancing norms and a COVID-19 appropriate behaviour," he said.The Delhi Metro will resume services in three stages between September 7 and 12, according to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.Trains will be available from 7-11 AM and 4-8 PM, it said.Metro services in Delhi-NCR were suspended on March 22 in view of the pandemic.

Gavai and Krishna Murari said: "Let the project be positively completed within 10 months." The top court during the hearing earlier this week noted undertakings have been furnished by the Secretary of Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, as well as the Principal Secretary of the Department of Environment and Forests, Delhi government.The concerned authorities have informed the top court that the work relating to smog towers will be complete within 10 months and the requisite money has been transferred to the Tata Consultancy."It is stated in the affidavit filed on behalf of the MoEF that a sum of Rs 52 lakh has also been transferred to Clean air- CARE LLC, which is the licensee of the University of Minnesota. Similar is the stand of Govt. of NCT of Delhi. Undertakings are taken on record," the bench observed.The bench said that if there is any violation on any ground, then it will be treated as contempt of the order passed by the top court.The bench noted there is already a huge unjustified delay in making the compliance of the order. "However, since steps are being taken and undertakings have been furnished, we have not proceeded for violation of the order passed by this Court, only on the basis of the action taken and undertakings furnished to complete the project," said the bench.On August 4, the apex court had asked the Centre to "start at the earliest" the work for the installation of smog towers in the national capital. The Centre had informed the top court that the process will take 10 months.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/finish-construction-of-smog-towers-in-10-months-sc-135754

Apart from this, there is a huge difference in the amount given as compensation for the same land of different persons. Lallu, who was going to share the pain of the farmers, was detained by police at the Ahmadpur toll plaza in Barabanki and taken into custody," state Congress media convenor Lalan Kumar said.Lallu was accompanied by Congress's state spokesperson Tanuj Punia and some other leaders.The state Congress chief strongly condemned the police action and said the BJP-led government is taking farmers' land at throwaway prices in Ayodhya in the name of land acquisition.He said the "undeclared emergency" imposed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is suppressing the voice of farmers, weavers and youngsters, and the Congress will not back down from its fight against the state government.

03-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi HC allows breath analyser test through tube process on air traffic controllers||The Delhi High Court on Thursday allowed breath analyser test through the tube process for air traffic controllers (ATCs) that was earlier suspended in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high court modified its March 23 interim order suspending breath analyser test (BAT) through the tube process for ATCs, saying the DGCA will be bound by the June 16 recommendations of the medical board.Justice Navin Chawla allowed the application of DGCA seeking modification of the earlier order and to implement the medical report of Directorate General of Medical Services (DGMS).As per the DGMS medical board’s recommendation, one machine would be used per person and not again for the next 12 hours.The court said the interest of the ATCs and the passengers had to be balanced and noted that the BAT was being presently conducted on pilots also in a restricted manner and the medical report has been given by those who are experts in their fields.“With the respondent (DGCA) taking all precautionary measures and restricted testing, this court finds no reason to continue with the March 23 order. The interim order shall stand modified to the extent that respondent number 2 (DGCA) will be bound by the recommendations of the medical board till further orders,” the high court said.The DGCA’s application was filed in pending petition by the Air Traffic Controllers’ Guild (India), represented through Advocates Piyush Sanghi and Khushbu Sahu, seeking direction to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Airport Authority of India (AAI) to temporarily suspend the BAT through the current tube process to prevent further spread of the virus.The petitioner had said that on a random basis 10 per cent of the ATCs are subjected to the BAT, which uses equipment that could result in the spread of COVID-19.The DGCA, in its interim application, said in pursuance to the high court’s earlier order, DGMS (Air) had convened a meeting with representatives from the DGCA and the AAI to formulate the alternative protocol to conduct the BAT and it was concluded that BAT was the most efficient and reliable form of detecting alcohol in the breath of the person.It said that other methods, that is, testing of blood and urine were neither considered to be practical nor there was any provision in any Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs) to date.Advocate Anjana Gosain, representing DGCA, submitted that it has been decided to accept the June 16 medical report and implement it by conducting random tests in a day by the concerned airline in terms of the protocol.The court was informed by a DGCA official that keeping in view the risk involved, random tests are being done on pilots but no ATCs were tested due to the high court's stay order.It further said as per the recommendations, once the BAT machine was used for testing an ATC or cabin crew member, it would not be used again for the next 12 hours.It is also suggested in the report that apart from random testing, the concerned authorities should be empowered to test any ATC who is suspected to have consumed any psychoactive substance, it said.“It is not out of place that since March 2020, no form of testing has been conducted and the same can be a safety issue for the aircraft as well as the passengers. In view of the fact that limited functioning of aviation activities has been permitted and in the near future, in view of normalcy, some method of testing must be introduced,” the plea said, adding that DGCA would like to resume the BAT to ensure safety for the crew and passengers.The high court, in its March 23 order, had directed the authorities to hold an urgent meeting to explore alternative methods for the test, which was not invasive in nature and does not increase chances of spread of COVID-19.It had directed the DGMA (Air), Delhi to immediately convene a meeting of the DGCA, the AAI, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, including doctors or medical specialists to draw up an alternative protocol for conducting breath analyser tests on ATCs.

03-09-2020||New Delhi||Demonetisation was attack on country's unorganised sector: Rahul||In the second instalment of video series, Rahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push for “cashless economy” was meant to "attack India's informal sector" and turn it into “labour-farmers-small business-less economy”. “The scary result of the demonetisation move on November 8, 2016, came on August 31, 2020,” Gandhi said in his video explaining how India’s “unorganised sector was devastated by economic moves like demonetization.” “The hidden agenda of demonetisation, which saw the scrapping of all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, was to clear the ground” by “deliberately harming India’s informal sector which survives on liquid cash” and “passes on the gains to a handful of big corporates,” he claimed.“Our informal sector works on cash. Small shopkeepers and workers survive on cash. Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the nation that he wants a cashless India. If India goes cashless, small shopkeepers, farmers and workers will be finished,” Gandhi said.The series comes in the wake of the shrinking of the economy by a record 23.9% in the first quarter of April to June in the current financial year 2020-21. India’s informal, or unorganised, sector absorbs about 95% of the county’s workforce and is the key to equitable growth. He also recounted how millions of people suffered during demonetisation. “What did poor Indians benefit, nothing. So who all benefitted, only the country’s billionaires,” Gandhi said, alleging that the government used the money “to write off the loans of billionaires”.Speaking to media persons Congress leader Randeep Surjewala added that had the BJP paid some heed to warnings and suggestions by Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and economic experts, the country would not be in the “economic mess” it is in today.“They (BJP leaders) made fun of their suggestions and today have become a ‘Mazak’ (joke) themselves. The sad part due to their arrogance the country suffered. The simplest way to put back the economy on rails, as also suggested by top economists, would be to put Rs 15000 in hands of common people. The moment consumption increases, the economy will also receive an automatic kick. “However, arrogance is making them ignore genuine concerns and pushing the country towards a bigger economic disaster,” Surjewala claimed, warning a further downslide in economy and job losses in days to come. “The country has failed miserably on the issue of managing corona. If infections continue to increase the way they are India will soon be at the top of the chart,” he added.मोदी जी का ‘कैश-मुक्त’ भारत दरअसल ‘मज़दूर-किसान-छोटा व्यापारी’ मुक्त भारत है।जो पाँसा 8 नवंबर 2016 को फेंका गया था, उसका एक भयानक नतीजा 31 अगस्त 2020 को सामने आया।GDP में गिरावट के अलावा नोटबंदी ने देश की असंगठित अर्थव्यवस्था को कैसे तोड़ा ये जानने के लिए मेरा वीडियो देखिए। pic.twitter.com/GzovcTXPDv  The Congress leader also slammed the Centre for “defaulting” on payment to States. “How will the country function this way? The Centre is running away from its responsibilities. 40 crore Indians are being pushed below poverty lines, between April and July 2 crore people have lost jobs, only one-fourth MSMEs are manufacturing and that too with 50 pc capacity, But they(government) is only worried about the party(BJP)".  Sidesteps questions related to G-23 dissent  Sidestepping questions related to the internal political developments in the party, Surjewala said Congress president Sonia Gandhi who heard all voices "with a large heart" has said all that needs to be said on the issue. " There is no need to say anything beyond that. Still, if there are more issues, they can always approach her," he said||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/demonetisation-was-attack-on-countrys-unorganised-sector-rahul-135740
03-09-2020||Dhaka||In historic verdict, Bangladesh Hindu widows to get share of husbands' properties||In a historic verdict, the Bangladesh High Court has said that Hindu widows are entitled to shares in all properties owned by their late husbands and not just their homesteads.Previously Hindu widows in the country were only entitled to their spouses' homesteads and not other assets like agricultural land.However, human rights activists said that Wednesday's verdict was just a little progress and not an achievement.Advocate and activist, Dipty Sikder told IANS: "This verdict is of course one step forward in the fight for the establishment of equality between men and women. But there's still a long way to go to achieve the goal for equal rights of Hindu women."The Hindu leaders have never played a positive role for the Hindu widows of Bangladesh. Only we the human rights activists have been fighting for 50 years first initiated by the country's legendary activist, Begum Sufia Kamal."Still we wish them to come with us to achieve Kamal's goal of a Uniform Family Code." Meanwhile, Rana Das Gupta, General Secretary of the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council hailed the verdict, telling IANS: "We always welcome any positive verdict like this." A single High Court bench of Justice Miftah Uddin Choudhury passed the order on Wednesday after finalizing a case in this regard.After 83 years (since 1937), Hindu widows will now get their rights on their husbands' assets.Barrister Syed Nafiul Islam, one of the lawyers for the plaintiff said: "After this verdict, they (widows) will get a share of agricultural land too." The strictest part of the Hindu law in the country is the distribution of property among girls.Enacted in 1937, the law deprived women of the right to inherit their husbands' properties.One Jyotindra Nath Mandal of Khulna filed a case in 1996 seeking a court order to deprive his dead brother's wife (sister-in-law) of their father's assets.The lower court said that widows had rights only to the area of the houses in which they lived, and not to agricultural property.Later, the district judge expressed a different opinion, that widows also had rights to agricultural land in the same manner as their husbands.The matter was then brought to the High Court.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-historic-verdict-bangladesh-hindu-widows-to-get-share-of-husbands-properties-135738

How can the PM even sleep?” he said.“We need a major economic and financial surgery,” Surjewala said on a day Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched yet another salvo against the BJP-led NDA accusing it of selling the country to four-five corporate houses and ignoring repeated warnings from experts on the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic had affected the economy.Surjewala claimed the BJP had lost the right to govern and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, “responsible" for pushing the GDP down by almost 24 per cent, should herself resign. “How can the FM be allowed to remain on the position. The PM should dismiss her immediately,” he said.Surjewala alleged that the Modi government was shying away from answering questions which was why it was trying to kill “democracy and Parliament” by suspending the question hour. “They want to cripple and finish Parliament and the decision is a proof of that conspiracy. Can there be any logical answer to why the government does not want to answer questions? This is nothing but lockdown. The government does not want to answer questions on the issues of economy, suicides and job losses. That is why they are doing something that has not been done in the past 73 years. NDA ministers are telling white lies. The government is scared of answering questions on brazen transgressions by the Chinese, the plunder of Indian economy and businesses. The Congress party will oppose their policies tooth and nail,” said Surjewala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/suspending-question-hour-akin-to-parliament-lockdown-will-oppose-it-tooth-and-nail-congress-135737

So what has happened with this is that Pakistan’s attempt to list all four Indian nationals in this 1267 sanctions list has failed,” he said.He said the Indian mission has thanked the Council for blocking “this blatant attempt by Pakistan to politicise the working of this 1267 procedure by giving it a religious colour”.

Talks among them are in progress.Sources say the issue would be clinched any day after September 11.The seat-sharing formula will need the final seal of approval of former Bihar Chief Minister Laloo Prasad, who is presently serving jail term in the fodder scam.A national CPI(M) leader who is involved with his party's affairs in the state, said the three left parties have provided their list of names of seats they want to contest to the RJD.The cumulative number of seats they have pitched is about 60 out of a total of 243 in the state Assembly.The Left parties are determined as other opposition parties to oust the ruling JD(U)-BJP from power. RJD leadership had pushed for the Left parties joining the alliance led by it.As per the arrangement, the RJD and the Congress will part from their share of seats to Left parties and other smaller constituent allies.The opposition parties are optimistic of turning the tables on the JD(U) and Bihar in the election on account of the alleged public resentment against the government's handling of floods, COVID pandemic and the low ebb in the economy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-elections-left-parties-mount-pressure-on-rjd-congress-135725

03-09-2020||Hyderabad||BJP MLA Raja Singh says he has no Facebook account after being banned||After Facebook and Instagram barred Telangana’s BJP MLA T Raja Singh from their portals, Singh who represents Goshamahal Assembly segment in Hyderabad said he does not subscribe to social media.“I just got to know that all accounts operating on my name have been taken down. I’m very happy about this as they don’t belong to me and may have been opened by some supporters.” But he later said he would ask Facebook to allow him to start a Facebook page as this was a “neutral platform” and he would promise to adhere to all rules of the online portal. It was earlier reported that Facebook had taken down the account for promoting hate against Muslims.Both Facebook and Instagram are owned by Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook has been under attack for showing a bias towards the BJP by relaxing its rules pertaining to hate speech. Raja Singh told the media in Hyderabad that he had not used Facebook for the past two years and that “his official account was taken down in 2018 itself and I haven’t had an account since then”.He said there were several accounts being run under his name and he had brought this to the knowledge of Facebook several times. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), an American business newspaper, had on August 15 published a story that said one particular post by Raja Singh had been classified as “dangerous hate speech” by employees of Facebook.This post pertained to Rohingya Muslim, about whom it was said “these immigrants must be shot”, calling them “traitors”.  Raja Singh accused former Congress president Rahul Gandhi of making false statements against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP using social media platforms, even as he wanted to exercise his right to be on Facebook.  In another video message, Singh asked if Facebook and Instagram were working under the Congress party’s pressure. He said he had written a letter to Hyderabad Police Cyber Crime department on October 8, 2018 that his official Facebook verified page was hacked.He again started a new page which “was unpublished/ deleted in April 2019”.  In a statement, he reiterated, “So, since April 2019, I’m not on Facebook itself, so no question of banning (me). Is Facebook working under the pressure of Congress,” Singh said in a brief statement.He demanded that accounts of Congress and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) should be deleted from social networking sites.  But he later said that he will write to Facebook to let him open a Facebook account by promising to adhere to all rules and regulations. Stating that Facebook was a neutral platform, linking it with BJP was not fair.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-mla-raja-singh-says-he-has-no-facebook-account-after-being-banned-135710

03-09-2020||New Delhi||Bihar elections: After Manjhi's 'ghar wapsi', Sharad Yadav's return to JD(U) expected||With the 'ghar wapsi' of Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM(S) in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ahead of the Bihar assembly polls, the upcoming elections to the 243-member Assembly have taken yet another turn.On one side the latest move by politically savvy Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has added another angle to the JD(U)'s ongoing power tussle with Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party, on the other hand, it has also thrown open some interesting options.It remains to be seen whether young Chirag will exercise those options to experiment with something radical or vie for a larger political role for his party to fizzle out a compromise and settlement within the NDA.With Manjhi joining in, the tussle for seats among partners will naturally increase though according to BJP leaders Nitish Kumar is expected to adjust HAM(S) from his quota.The BJP has already announced that Nitish Kumar will be the alliance's chief ministerial candidate. However, his move to bring in Majhi has prompted the LJP to call a meeting on the future course of action, including whether to put up candidates against Nitish Kumar,So far Chirag Paswan has been playing safe, targeting Nitish Kumar and praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. However, observers say the political space of Bihar is crying for fresh leadership and it is the correct opportunity for a young blood like Chirag to grab the opportunity to come into his own. It is now or never for Paswans, they say.Chirag's father, LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, is a minister in the Narendra Modi government. BJP sources say Chirag is unlikely to disturb the existing status quo.The elections will be contested on the strengths of Nitish Kumar and PM Modi. The electoral performance of Manjhi, who comes from Scheduled Castes like Paswan, is nothing to write home about. As an NDA ally in 2015, his party barely managed about one seat.The BJP contested 159 seats, the LJP 40 seats, the RLSP 23 seats and HAM 21 seats. He also drew a blank in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as an RJD-Congress ally.Likewise, the influence, cadre and worker of the LJP, which believes that Nitish Kumar has brought Manjhi in the NDA to counter it, is also limited. The LJP has not been able to do well at the State level with Ram Vilas Paswan largely concentring on his politics at the Centre.In 2015 when it fought with the NDA, it won only two. Its performance in Lok Sabha elections has been thanks to Prime Minister Modi, say BJP leadersChirag has been trying hard to make his presence felt in these elections. He has been touring the State, calling upon party cadres to prepare to fight all Assembly seats and due to his accessibility also believed to be popular among people, especially the youth. However, he is yet to prove his credentials as a leader on his ownThe BJP, which has so far played down their differences, is watching closely. The saffron leadership knows that to win Bihar they need Nitish Kumar. Meanwhile, the stage is also set for the return of senior and experienced leader Sharad Yadav to the JD(U) fold, say sources.Insisting that the NDA is intact and will fight the assembly, BJP leaders say a fair distribution of seats among allies will settle all issues. Besides, everyone knows that "posturing" is a part of the electoral game and at the end of the day the LJP will also come around, they add.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-elections-after-manjhis-ghar-wapsi-sharad-yadavs-return-to-jdu-expected-135695
03-09-2020||Washington||US urges India to enhance its position in global supply chain||The United States has urged India to create an environment that will foster its position in the global supply chain and said that the country continues to face challenges on the market access front despite improvement in the ease of doing business.Observing that the coronavirus pandemic may give rise to self-sufficiency and self-reliance sentiments among struggling economies, Joseph Semsar, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said India with its “Atmanirbhar Bharat” Initiative has put forward a programme that puts a question mark on the notion of self-reliance.“Our thought is that isolationist policies can also cause a decrease in exchange between businesses and economies, less technology and best practice sharing, fewer joint research and development projects and stifled innovation,” Semsar said at the third India-US Leadership Summit organised virtually by the US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF).“So we urge the Government of India to focus on creating an environment, fostering an environment that will enhance India's position in the global supply chain,” he said in response to a question from Anish Shah, deputy managing director and group CFO, the Mahindra group, who is also a USISPF board member.“India has improved its ease-of-doing-business index, but challenges remain on the market access front,” he said.“There are concerning issues regarding data localisation, intellectual property rights, high tariffs, duplicative safety and security testing, price controls, and FTI restrictions in sectors like insurance,” he added. These are the challenges that India and the United States have to work together to resolve, Semsar said. Noting that the Trump administration has long recognised the need to diversify supply chains for both economic and national security of the US, he said that business leaders are finally realising that they cannot rely on unsuitable sources for their production.The coronavirus pandemic has shown how easily supply chains can weaken and in some cases, even break down entirely. “On this front, India has the potential to become a global supply chain leader in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond,” Semsar said.

The BJP is keeping a watch on all the 243 seats, examining its own possibilities and also assessing the ground strength of the allies as chief JP Nadda wants state leaders and MPs to work not only for ensuring victory of their party’ candidates but also the nominees of the NDA allies and project a perfect picture of unity in the elections,” the sources say.At the same time, leaders also admit that there will be a tussle over seats, which is “natural”. Eventually, the JD-U may end up with 115-120 seats, the LJP 25-30 and the BJP 95-105.Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), which left ‘mahagathbandhan’ (grand coalition) last month, will formally join the NDA on Thursday and it will have to be adjusted.Significantly, the HAM-S has formed an alliance with the JD(U). “We have forged an alliance with JD(U) and have become a part of the NDA. There has been no discussion about seat-sharing,” Manjhi was quoted as saying. The former CM is believed to be seeking 10 seats. However, it remains to be seen how and from whose kitty HAM-S is accommodated.The BJP is leaving no stone unturned to win back Bihar with Nadda himself leading brainstorming sessions and strategy meetings.Meanwhile, the CPI, the CPM and the CPI (ML) are pressuring the Congress and the RJD of ‘mahagathbandhan” to finalise seats for them for the upcoming state polls. This will help prepare better for the polls, a Left leader said.LJP ‘upset’ over moveNew Delhi: With Manjhi’s expected entry into the NDA, the latter’s ally Lok Janshakti Party has called a meeting of its state parliamentary board next week. With the LJP’s worsening relations with CM Nitish Kumar, party sources said the main agenda on September 7 will be whether to put up its candidates against the JD(U). We are definitely considering it, an LJP leader said. Chirag Paswan declined to comment on the matter. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-to-bargain-hard-seeks-120-seats-135493

At this time, we are not aware of additional accounts being impacted," a Twitter spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.Modi's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the tweets posted on the account @narendramodi_in.The account, with over 2.5 million followers, is the official Twitter handle for Modi's personal website (https://www.narendramodi.in/) and the Narendra Modi mobile application.Modi's personal Twitter account, which was unaffected by this incident, has over 61 million followers.The tweets, which have since been taken down, asked the followers to donate to the PM National Relief Fund through cryptocurrency.Hackers had in July accessed Twitter's internal systems to hijack some of the platform's top voices including US presidential candidate Joe Biden, former U.S. President Barack Obama and billionaire Elon Musk, and used them to solicit digital currency. -  Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitter-account-linked-to-modis-personal-website-hacked-retrieved-135658

China already has a military base in the African nation Djibouti.In its annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China (PRC) 2020” that was submitted to the US Congress, the Pentagon said these potential Chinese military logistics facilities are in addition to the Chinese military base in Djibouti, which is aimed at supporting naval, air and ground forces projection."A global PLA (People's Liberation Army) military logistics network could both interfere with US military operations and support offensive operations against the United States as the PRC's global military objectives evolve,” the Pentagon said in the report.China has probably already made overtures to Namibia, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands, it said, adding the known focus areas of PLA planning were along the Seal Lines of Communication from China to the Strait of Hormuz, Africa, and the Pacific Islands.Similarly, the Pentagon said, Beijing uses the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative to support its strategy of national rejuvenation by seeking to expand global transportation and trade linkages to support its development and deepen its economic integration with nations along its periphery and beyond. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-striving-for-military-bases-in-pak-lanka-135535
03-09-2020||---||US-led allies attempt to outflank China in Asia Pacific trade, security||New Delhi, September 2When PM Narendra Modi agreed at one day’s notice to deliver the keynote address on Thursday at the ongoing US India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), it was another indication of the strategy brewing among a clutch of Asia-Pacific democracies to pool in their security and economic interests led by the US flag.At present, India’s diplomatic engagements seem to be more Kremlin-oriented. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has travelled to Moscow for the second time in recent months, while Foreign Minister S Jaishankar will interact with his Russian and Chinese counterparts under the SCO and BRICS formats.That will be overlapped by interactions seeking to put more punch into an economic and security answer to China. “Our strategy is to push back China in virtually every domain,” US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun admitted at a USISPF session.With the clashes at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), India appears to have signed on to a concept of Quad plus.As Biegun revealed, Foreign Secretaries of six Asia Pacific countries have been in unprecedented weekly. The other countries are India, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Vietnam and New Zealand, all of whom are informally called Quad Plus.India, once touted to be the weakest link, has shed its inhibitions and is set to host its first in-person diplomatic engagement after the pandemic broke in March with a two plus two with the US.The conversation between Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper with S Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh would set the tone for a Quad ministerial meeting later this year involving the External Affairs Ministers of the US, India, Australia and Japan.The US Foreign Secretary also emphasised both legs – security and economic — of a joint strategy will gradually seek to involve five democracies of the region and Vietnam. “We’re doing it in terms of outsized demands to claim sovereign territory, whether it’s in the Galwan valley of India on the India-China border or whether it’s in the South Pacific. We’re also doing it economically,” he had said.His equal emphasis on the economic part would seek to bring back the balance from the present, heavy tilt towards the security side. As former NSA Shivshankar Menon wrote, “Where India and the US once collaborated on a wide range of issues in pursuit of common goals, they now cooperate on security to the exclusion of much else.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-led-allies-attempt-to-outflank-china-in-asia-pacific-trade-security-135497

Besides, Punjab, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have also expressed their opposition.Kerala suggested a third option which entailed the Centre borrowing the full amount on their behalf and the states extending the cess to recoup the amount.The states have also toyed with the option of approaching the Supreme Court but want to first exhaust the political options of approaching the PM as well as discussing the issue again at the next GST Council meeting on September 19.Mamata Banerjee accused the PM of undermining federalism and directed her party to hold three rounds of protest for the withholding of dues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/more-states-oppose-centres-options-to-meet-gst-shortfall-135504
