The panel will also assess any violations of law and submit its recommendations within 30 days.This was communicated by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to Congress MP KC Venugopal and other Parliamentarians who had demanded that the government protect data of Indians from spying by Chinese entities.Meanwhile, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the report is “seriously untrue”. Quoting the company, the Chinese MFA said the private company’s clients are research institutions and business groups. Instead of collecting data, it only mobilises data which is open and available online. China offered to enhance dialogue and cooperation to jointly build an open and cooperative cyber space.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-takes-up-issue-of-chinese-snooping-with-envoy-142112

We demand they be acknowledged and treated as martyrs. Their families and children deserve solace and from the Government. IMA also urges the Government to seek data from the representatives of nurses and other healthcare workers,” IMA president Rajan Sharma wrote to the government.He said no nation had lost as many doctors and health care workers as India. Doctors suffer four times mortality of ordinary citizens and private doctors suffer eight times mortality on the same scale.“To feign that doctor death data doesn’t merit the attention of the nation is abominable. If the Government doesn’t maintain the statistics of total number of doctors and health care workers infected by Covid 19 and the statistics of how many of them sacrificed their life due to the pandemic, it loses the moral authority to administer the Epidemic Act, 1897, and the Disaster Management Act. This also exposes the hypocrisy of calling them corona warriors on one hand and denying them and their families the status and benefits of martyrdom,” Sharma said.IMA also questioned MoS for Health Ashwini Kumar Choubey for stating before Parliament that public health comes under states and so the insurance compensation data is not available with the Union Government.This amounts to abdication of duty and abandonment of the national heroes who have stood up for our people, said IMA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/treat-them-as-martyrs-%C2%A0ima-publishes-list-of-382-doctors-who-died-of-covid-142103

16-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Lok Sabha clears Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 16The Lok Sabha on Wednesday cleared the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020, a law that aims to protect the interest of depositors by bringing cooperative banks under the regulatory framework of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), amid demand by Opposition parties that the Bill be withdrawn and sent to the Select Committee and observations terming it an “infringement or encroachment” upon powers of states and federal structure and the cooperative movement in the country.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who systematically demolished all objections raised during the discussion on the Bill, however, remained non-committal to the question as to when the beleaguered depositors of the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank, the collapse of which is precursor to the Ordinance during the Covid lockdown and now the legislation, will receive their deposits.NCP’s Supriya Sule had wanted to know the “timeline when PMCB depositors will get their money” saying that “only small depositors have got back their money”. “What have you done for resolution to nine lakh affected families…people have died and committed suicide,” Sule said.The Finance Minister, while making it clear that the law will only cover cooperative societies acting like banks, said the aim of the legislation is only to ensure that depositors of cooperative banks, a large number of which are in the red, do not suffer. “No one is infringing upon the power of States or federalism. Banking and regulation of banking is definitely under Central list. State cooperative laws are not being touched,” she said.Adding that no one can deny the success story of cooperatives, Sitharaman said one also needs to keep in mind the fact that in past two decades 430 cooperative banks have been de-licenced and gone into liquidation, whereas not a single commercial bank, whose depositors are protected by the depositors law, have gone under liquidation. “Financial status of 277 urban cooperative banks is weak. As many as 105 cooperative banks are unable to meet the minimum regulatory capital requirement. 47 banks have net worth in negative. 328 urban cooperative banks have more than 15% gross NPA ratio,” she said.Sitharaman also said cooperative banks in India are being regulated by RBI since 1965 unlike what some members had claimed. Regarding the reason for bringing the Ordinance (which is being replaced by the legislation) she said during the Covid lockdown there were “uncertainties” and “protection of depositors’ interest was important”. “We did not want PMC type incident hurting the depositors,” she said.In March 2020, the stress in cooperative banks increased due to pandemic and gross ratios of urban cooperative banks increased from 7.7 per cent in March 2019 to over 10 per cent in March 2020. Therefore, it was felt that the ordinance should be brought in the interest of depositors,” she saidOn an observation by Congress’ Manish Tewari on the need to “descramble” the RBI rather than overload it, Sitharaman said the preamble of the RBI Act says it has the authority to operate and empower credit system of the country. Allaying apprehensions, including that the legislation “does not touch agricultural credit societies or cooperative societies whose primary objective is to provide long-term funds for agricultural developments,” she said changes will not affect existing powers of the state registrars of co-operative societies under state laws. And nor will the changes apply to primary farm credit societies or cooperative societies, the main business of which is long-term finance for agricultural development.Tewari, who called it “another attack on federal structure”, maintained that the changes will “create utter mayhem in the agricultural economy”. “For one PMCB, you don’t take way the power of cooperatives,” said AITC MP Saugata Roy. According to AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owasi, it was because of decision like demonetisation that banks are suffering. He also questioned why the government “was not showing PMCB depositors the same love they had shown to the depositors of the Bank”. Opposing the Bill, RSP’ NK Premachandram said “it will have far reaching implications on cooperatives”.The Bill amends the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  The Act regulates the functioning of banks and provides details on various aspects such as licensing, management, and operations of banks.  The Bill aims to bring co-operative banks under the supervision of the RBIIt will also permit the RBI to initiate scheme for reconstruction or amalgamation of a stressed lender without imposing a moratorium.It does not apply to a primary agricultural credit society or a co-operative society whose primary object and principal business is providing long term finance for agricultural development if such society does not use as part of its name, or in connection with its business, the words “bank”, “banker” or “banking” and does not act as drawee of cheques.In June, the Union Cabinet approved the Ordinance to bring 1,482 urban and 58 multi-state cooperative banks under the supervision of the RBI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-clears-banking-regulation-amendment-bill-142100

Ltd.The officials said investigation under the PMLA was initiated on the basis of an FIR and charge sheet filed by the Uttarakhand Police against Dinesh Pratap Singh and other revenue officers, farmers and middlemen.In the charge sheet it was alleged that DP Singh and Anil Shukla, the then revenue officials, working in the capacity of Competent Authority of Land Acquisition, entered into conspiracy with other public servants, farmers and middlemen for misappropriation of government funds by way of granting compensation at non-agriculture rate, which was much higher than the designated rate.The ED probe also revealed that after receiving the compensation fraudulently by the land owners, funds have been diverted to the account of various individuals and entities, the officials said.Barinder Singh and Balwant Singh diverted the “proceeds of crime” to the tune of Rs 9 crore  whereas Harjinder Singh diverted fund to the tune of Rs 1  crore to the accounts of Jasdeep Singh Goraya and Mehak Kaur, which was  utilised by them in their company Fibremarx Papers Pvt. Ltd, they said.Ramesh Kumar created the fixed deposits in the name of his family members from the “proceeds of crime” and therefore all these identified assets totaling to Rs 11.62 crore have been provisionally attached under the PMLA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-11-62-crore-in-nh-74-scam-142098

A tablet attached to Mitra's chest allows patients to see loved ones, as well as medical staff unable to access the wards."It takes a lot of time to recover, and during this time, when patients need their families the most, they are unable to visit," said Dr Arun Lakhanpal, a doctor at the Yatharth Super Speciality Hospital in Noida Extension, a satellite city of the capital New Delhi.Mitra is mainly used by patients who are not able to communicate using their phones."We mainly discuss my health," said Makhanlal Qazi, a retired government bureaucrat and coronavirus patient who has used the robot to communicate with relatives. "I came here on Friday and now I have started feeling better. I am feeling very happy now."The robot, developed by Bengaluru-based start-up Invento Robotics, cost the hospital Rs 1 million, according Yatharth Tyagi, director of the company that runs the hospital.Mitra is also being used for remote consultations with specialists to reduce their risk of becoming infected, he added."Normally it is very difficult for a psychologist or a dietician to see a COVID patient," Tyagi said, adding the robot is "very useful".India's novel coronavirus cases surged past 5 million on Wednesday, only the second country in the world to cross the grim milestone after the United States.

Several women have faced harassment at COVID care centres, but hardly any action has been initiated,” he alleged.The former chief minister also raised the issue of crimes against women in general, and pointed out that the Shiv Sena-led government had promised to bring in a law on the lines of ‘Disha Act’ in Andhra Pradesh.The 2019 Act provides for speedy trial of crimes against women and the capital punishment in certain cases.“At least seven cases of women being burnt alive took place in February this year. A Disha Act was promised, but now it has gone into cold storage,” Fadnavis said in the letter.

16-09-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Telangana adopts resolution to oppose Electricity Amendment Bill 2020||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, September 16  The Telangana Legislative Assembly on Wednesday unanimously adopted a resolution opposing the proposed Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 that is likely to be introduced by the NDA Government in the ongoing Monsoon Session of Parliament. The resolution was moved by the leader of the House and Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR), who said the Bill, would put the lives of farmers in the state at peril and destroy the agriculture economy.  “The Bill in its present form is dangerous. The Centre has sent us a draft and I have discussed the provisions of the Bill and wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to withdraw the proposal. As I understand, the Centre will go ahead and introduce the Bill in the present Parliament session itself,” KCR said on the floor of the House. The Telangana State Assembly has asked the Central government to withdraw the “draconian Bill which is against the federal spirit envisaged by the Constitution and is aimed at usurping powers of the states”.  KCR said the proposed amendment to the Electricity Act of 2003 was drafted in a way that was detrimental to the interests of farmers.“Through this resolution, the Telangana Assembly demands the Centre not to impose the Act on the people of the nation and immediately withdraw the proposed Bill,” said the Chief Minister. “While the Centre is trying to put the entire power sector in the hands of the private sector, I have been insisting that only the government will run the Bhadradri and Yadadri power plants,” he said.“The logic is simple, if the government runs the units, then we can give subsidies to farmers, the poor, we can plough back the earnings into the state’s economy and give more jobs. But a private company will just reap the benefits and leave,” KCR added. He also announced that the Telangana Government had accepted the demand of the people to present the electricity bills for the lockdown period on a monthly basis and not present a bill in aggregate.“I have instructed the state power distribution companies to divide the electricity bills covering the entire lockdown period month-wise to save the consumers from paying inflated bills,” he announced.Paying tributes to those who lost their lives in the Srisailam Left Bank Hydro Electric Station fire accident on August 20, the Chief Minister said nine people sacrificed their lives to save the unit from further damage.“Their sacrifice was ultimate and I have instructed the Energy Minister to help the bereaved families in all aspects. A CID inquiry has been ordered and the department is also looking into the reasons for the accident,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-adopts-resolution-to-oppose-electricity-amendment-bill-2020-142084
16-09-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi to inaugurate Kosi rail mega bridge in Bihar on Friday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will dedicate to the nation the “historic” Kosi rail mega bridge through video-conference on Friday and also inaugurate 12 rail projects related to passenger facilities in Bihar, his office said.Modi has either inaugurated or laid the foundation stone of a number of development projects in the poll-bound state in the last few days with sources saying that the total cost of these infrastructure and other programmes would be about Rs 16,000 crore.The Prime Minister’s Office said on Wednesday that the ‘Kosi Rail Mahasetu’ (mega bridge) is a watershed moment in the history of Bihar as it will connect the region to the North East and described it as historic.In 1887, a meter gauge link was built between Nirmali and Bhaptiahi in the region but it was washed away during the heavy flood and severe Indo-Nepal earthquake in 1934, the PMO said, adding no attempt was made to restore this rail connectivity for a long period due to the meandering nature of Kosi river.The mega bridge project was sanctioned by the Union government during 2003-04.It is 1.9 km long and its construction cost is Rs 516 crore, the PMO said.“This bridge is of strategic importance along the India-Nepal border. The project was completed during the COVID-pandemic where the migrant labour also participated in its completion,” it added.The 12 other rail projects, which Modi will also inaugurate, include a new railway bridge on the Kiul river, two new railway lines, five electrification projects, one electric locomotive shed and third line project between Barh and Bakhtiyarpur.The inauguration of Kosi rail mega bridge will fulfil the 86-year-old dream and a long wait of the people of the region, the PMO said.The prime minister will also flag off the Saharsa-Asanpur Kupha train from the Supaul station.Once the regular train service begins, this would prove to be highly beneficial to Supaul, Arariya and Saharsa districts, making it easier for those on long distance travel to Kolkata, Delhi and Mumbai.He will also inaugurate the railway electrification projects of Muzaffarpur– Sitamarhi, Katihar–New Jalpaiguri, Samastipur-Darbhanga-Jaynagar, Samastipur-Khagaria, and Bhagalpur-Shivnarayanpur sections, the PMO said.Assembly polls in Bihar are slated to be held in October-November, and the Election Commission is expected to announce the schedule sometime this month.

But it has also come to light that the Centre also signed a $ 500 million agreement with AIIB on August 24 to improve the network capacity of Mumbai’s suburban railway system.Despite the bad blood with China, India’s borrowing programme proceeded on a parallel track. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman attended the annual meeting of the AIIB Board by video conferencing where the Chinese President was the star speaker.AIIB is the brainchild of Chinese President Xi Jinping and was set up in 2016 as an alternative to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, dominated by the US and Japan. It is aimed at mainly promoting the One Belt and One Road (OBOR) Initiative but now has a wide membership base of 103 countries, including India which has 8 per cent stake in the venture. India has also borrowed from the Shanghai-based New Development Bank (NDB), promoted by the BRICS countries.In May, India had taken a $ 500 million Covid project from AIIB and had also borrowed $ 1 billion from NDB. In rupee terms, the two China-led banks have so far lent India Rs 17,000 crore to fight the aftereffects of Covid.Opposed by the US, the AIIB has approved loans to about 20 countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh in India’s neighborhood.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-borrowed-from-beijing-headquartered-bank-month-after-galwan-clash-142078

16-09-2020||New Delhi||Stubble burning: Gopal Rai says Pusa institute’s bio-decomposer can help reduce pollution||Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday witnessed a demonstration of a bio-decomposer developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute to convert crop stubble into manure and said if successful, it will help reduce air pollution.He said he will discuss the technique, which involves spraying the decomposer on crop stubble, with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and later a work plan will be developed for its implementation.Every year, Delhi’s air quality plummets as farmers in the national capital and neighbouring states burn agricultural stubble to clear their fields before the onset of winter to sow the next crop.Farmers claim that setting their fields on fire is the only economically viable solution to clear stubble before the sowing season starts.Rai said the Delhi government will provide the bio-decomposer to farmers free of cost.“The cost of spraying the decomposer in fields will be borne by the Delhi government so that there is no financial burden on the farmers and an effective solution to the problem of stubble burning can be developed,” he said.The minister said the Central government has devised a scheme under which subsidy is provided to farmers for using machines to clear crop stubble.“I believe that the money spent on the purchase of machines and the subsidy can be used for the decomposition of stubble in these states. If successful, the technique will reduce smoke and air pollution,” he said.The Union Environment Ministry has a very important role to play in this initiative, he added.Delhi faces air pollution every year in winter due to the burning of crop stubble in neighbouring states, Rai said.“Punjab produces 20 million tonnes of crop stubble out of which 9 million tonnes was burnt last year. In Haryana, 1.23 million tonnes out of 7 million tonnes was burnt,” he claimed.Rai said the Delhi government will talk to the Union Environment Ministry and the governments of neighbouring Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for coordination in implementing the bio-decomposer technique.The Delhi government is keen to develop a sustainable and effective solution to the issue of stubble burning that causes major pollution in Delhi, especially during the winter season, he said.Last year, stubble burning accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi’s air pollution, he said.An official of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute said it has received an advance order from the Uttar Pradesh government to demonstrate the technique on 25,000 hectares of land.He said around 10 companies are manufacturing the institute’s bio-decomposer on a large scale.

16-09-2020||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut attacks Jaya Bachchan again, Swara Bhasker calls her comments sickening||Kangana Ranaut on Wednesday reacted sharply to veteran actor and MP Jaya Bachchan’s “thaali” comments in the Parliament, claiming that she did not receive anything on the platter.On Tuesday, Bachchan, through a Zero Hour mention in Rajya Sabha, said the entertainment industry was being flogged by social media and asked the government to protect and support it.“People who have made a name in this industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree... I was really embarrassed and ashamed that yesterday (September 14) one of our members in the Lok Sabha, who is from the industry, spoke. I am not taking names. It is a shame,” Bachchan said in a clear reference to Lok Sabha MP Ravi Kishan and Ranaut’s statements on the alleged Bollywood drug cartel.“Jis thali mein khate hai Usme chhed karte hai. Galat baat hai,” she said referring to a popular Hindi proverb that translates to biting the hand that feed you.Ranaut, who has been in the news for her provocative comments, had slammed Bachchan on Tuesday and she upped her attack on Wednesday.“Which plate are you referring to Jaya ji? A thaali (plate) was given, in which a two-minute role, item numbers and a romantic scene were offered and that too only after sleeping with hero.“I taught feminism to the film industry, decorated the ‘thaali’ with patriotic films. This is my own plate Jaya ji, it is not yours,” she wrote in Hindi on Twitter.Ranaut’s tweet drew sharp criticism from her “Tanu Weds Manu” co-star Swara Bhasker, who called the actor’s comment “sickening” and “shameful”.“Keep the dirt of your mind limited to yourself. If you want to abuse me, then please go-ahead... I will gladly listen to your nonsense and fight this mud wrestling with you. Respect for elders is the first lesson taught in Indian culture and you are a self-proclaimed nationalist,” Bhasker said.Filmmaker Alankrita Srivastava also called out Ranaut for her tweet.“There is nothing feminist about abusing generations of women who have cleared the way so we can enjoy the opportunities we do.

After the speech (in Parliament by Jaya Bachchan), we stepped up peripheral security and increased patrolling outside their bungalows in Juhu,” the official said.The Bachchans have ‘Jalsa’, ‘Janak’ and ‘Pratiksha’ bungalows in Juhu. They live in ‘Jalsa’ and ‘Pratiksha’.The official said the security has been stepped up as a precautionary measure to avoid any untoward incident in view of Jaya Bachchan’s speech.Batting for Bollywood that has been under a cloud since the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June on the floor of the Rajya Sabha, Jaya Bachchan on Tuesday argued for government support to the entertainment industry and slammed those tarnishing its image.In her speech, she had used a Hindi proverb to say those defaming the industry were biting the hands that fed them.Though Bachchan did not take any names, her speech came a day after BJP’s Lok Sabha MP and Bhojpuri actor Ravi Kishan said there was a problem of drug addiction in the film industry.She had also said she completely disagrees with those who term the entertainment industry a “gutter”, a term used by actor Kangana Ranaut to describe Bollywood in a tweet last month. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-increase-peripheral-security-outside-bachchans-homes-142056

Both the sentences will run concurrently, the judge ordered.Special public prosecutor Bibhas Chatterjee prayed for the capital punishment to Anindita, claiming that it was a premeditated murder.The court, however, sentenced her to life imprisonment since she has a three-year-old child, and also because there was no eyewitness and the conviction was based on circumstantial evidence.As she was being taken to the prison van from the courtroom, Anindita said she was framed and she will fight till the “last drop of blood”.During the trial, the prosecution had claimed that on the intervening night of November 24 and 25, 2018, Anindita strangulated her husband Rajat, also a lawyer, with the wire of a mobile phone charger in their New Town flat near Kolkata.The prosecution claimed that the couple were having a strained relationship for some time and that led to the murder of Rajat.Anindita’s lawyer Pinak Mitra claimed that she was sleeping in another room when she heard a sound from Rajat’s room and found him hanging after rushing there.Rajat’s father had lodged an FIR alleging that Anindita had killed his son and she was arrested on November 29 by the police following interrogation.Trial and arguments in the case were completed in March this year.Both Anindita and Rajat were practising lawyers at the Calcutta High Court.

Was it fruitful?" asked Sharma.He said that had pre-announcement consultations held, states would have made prior arrangements like quarantine facilities and other logistics. The exodus of hapless migrant labourers trudging long-distances back home from cities portrayed a negative image of India, said Sharma as he demanded compensation for the workers who died under duress of the pandemic.Expressing concern at government's stand that it did not have a record of the number of deaths, Sharma demanded preparation of a data-base of migrant workers.He urged bolstering of public health infrastructure which was exposed during the lockdown days.The government hospitals in the country accounted for 30 per cent of oxygen-fitted beds, while the private hospital accounted for the rest. "But government hospitals handled 70 per cent of the cases."Sharma also contested government's claims that the mortality rate was lowest in India, saying neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka fared better.Appreciating the role of healthcare workers, he asked the government for action against the foreign journal which slandered hydroxychloroquine drug which was manufactured in bulk in India at a low cost. A nominated member and BJP leader Swapan Dasgupta urged the government to clear the mist regarding the data related to the disease, patients, etc."You are under-reporting Covid cases," said Tiruchi Siva of the DMK.Derek O'Brien of the TMC said the government was busy welcoming the USA President Donald Trump at the cost of paying attention to the pandemic.The government's engagement with Trump's visit was critical refrain of the other Opposition members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-comes-under-fire-from-opposition-over-covid-mismanagement-142053

The Sputnik V vaccine, which is based on well-studied human adenoviral vector platform with proven safety, is undergoing clinical trials for the coronavirus pandemic.Deliveries could potentially begin in late 2020 subject to completion of successful trials and registration of the vaccine by regulatory authorities in India.The agreement between RDIF and Dr Reddy’s reflects the growing awareness of countries and organisations to have a diversified anti-COVID vaccine portfolio to protect their populations, Dr Reddy’s said.Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said, “We are very pleased to partner with Dr. Reddy’s in India. Dr. Reddy’s has had a very well established and respected presence in Russia for over 25 years and is one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in India. India is amongst most severely impacted countries from COVID 19 and we believe our human adenovirus dual vector platform will provide a safe and scientifically validated option to India in the battle against COVID 19. RDIF partners will receive an effective and safe drug to fight the coronavirus. The platform of human adenoviral vectors, which is the core of the Russian vaccine, has been tested in more than 250 clinical studies over decades, and it has been found safe with no potential negative long-term consequences.”G V Prasad, Co-Chairman and Managing Director of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories said, “We are pleased to partner with RDIF to bring the vaccine to India. The Phase-I and II clinical trials have shown promising results. We will be conducting Phase-III trials in India to ensure safety and efficacy for the Indian population and to meet the requirements of the Indian regulators. Sputnik V vaccine could provide a credible option in our fight against COVID 19 in India.”On August 11, the Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology was registered by the Ministry of Health of Russia and became the world’s first registered vaccine against COVID-19 based on the human adenoviral vectors platform.On September 4, a research paper on the results of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine was published in The Lancet, one of the leading international medical journals, demonstrating no serious adverse effects and a stable immune response in 100% of participants. Post-registration clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine involving 40,000 volunteers are currently ongoing. More than 55,000 volunteers have applied to take part in post-registration trials. The first results of these trials are expected to be published in October-November 2020.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-to-supply-100-mn-doses-of-sputnik-covid-vaccine-to-indias-dr-reddy-inks-pact-142052

It has also signed a memorandum with the Saudi Chemical company.Russia has billed Sputnik-V as the first vaccine against the coronavirus to be registered in the world. Phase III trials, involving at least 40,000 people, were launched in Russia on Aug. 26 but have yet to be completed.

16-09-2020||New Delhi||Parliament nod to Bill for giving ‘national importance’ tag to Gujarat Ayurveda institutes||Parliament on Wednesday passed a Bill to accord the status of an institution of national importance to a Jamnagar-based cluster of Ayurveda institutes.The Bill -- ‘The Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda Bill, 2020’ -- was passed by a voice vote in the Rajya Sabha.The Lok Sabha has already approved the Bill in the last session, in which three Jamnagar, Gujarat-based institutes—Institute of Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Gulabkunwerba Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya and Institute of Ayurveda Pharmaceutical Sciences—would be conglomerated.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, responding to queries of members as to why the Gujarat institute alone was chosen for the national importance tag, said selection of the Jamnagar institute was not “arbitrary” or “biased” but it was chosen in a most objective manner being one of the oldest institutes under the category, established in 1956.He said there are 103 institutions of national importance in the country but not even one Ayurveda institute, and “this is the oldest collaborating centre with the WHO in Ayurveda” and qualified on every parameter to get such status.The institute has imparted training to students from 65 countries in 20 years, he said and added that it has inked 30 pacts with different countries.The minister, however, said that there is National AYUSH Mission to support other such institutions and government was ready to support them to get international stature when time comes.“Not only me but the whole government led by Prime Minister is a strong supporter of Ayurveda to the extent” that after forming government in 2014, one of the first decisions was on promotion of Ayurveda.Under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, the government has approved Rs 4,000 crore for cultivation of medicinal plants and supporting farmers, he said and expressed appreciation for Ayurveda and its usefulness for the society and also for strengthening healthcare systems of the world.The proposed institute at Jamnagar would have a 15-member committee, including the Minister of Ayush, Secretary of Ayush and Secretary of Health & Family Welfare of the Gujarat Government, along with three MPs in which two would be from the Lok Sabha and one from the Rajya Sabha.Earlier, participating in the debate on the Bill, Binoy Viswam (CPI) termed Kerala’s Kottakkal Ayurvedic Shala as the pride of the nation and stressed the need for promoting Ayurveda in Kerala, describing it as the real Centre for Ayurveda.“Ayurveda has to develop. Changing needs are emerging. Research is a must. Centres of excellence are must for the country, he said.“The capacity of Ayurveda in fighting COVID has been proven,” he claimed.K Keshava Rao (TRS) accused the government of being selective in selecting institutes of national eminence, saying Telangana too has many institutes eligible to be one.K K Ragesh (CPI-M) sought to know why the government did not consider Kerala for the tag as the state has many ayurveda institutes and is also home to rare medicinal plants.M Thambidurai (AIADMK) suggested that there should be an institute of national importance in each state.Subhash Chandra (BJP) said,  “It is a shame for us” that even Germany and Switzerland have done more work on Ayurveda now and China has taken 28 per cent market share of Ayurveda products globally.He demanded that promotion of ayurveda be made a national mission to cut on billions of dollars on western allopathic medicines and strengthen the Indian economy.Biswajit Daimary (BPF) demanded setting up of such an institute in the Northeast, while Dr Fauzia Khan (NCP) said there should be elections for selecting the head of the institute.Narain Das Gupta (AAP) demanded proper infrastrucure in Ayurvedic institutes and added that its importance has been established during COVID-19.Veer Singh (BSP) demanded that such institutes should also be set up Uttar Pradesh, while Ram Das Athawale (RPI) demanded the same for Maharashtra.Manoj Kumar Jha (RJD) said new structures are always welcome. “But if you do not back it up with a coherent inclusive vision, the structures have a tendency to become graveyard for innovative ideas.”He pointed out that clause 6 of the bill provides for composition of the institute in which 10 out of 14 members of the board are from non-Ayurveda background. This top heavy approach will not add a value to the government’s move of granting tag of national eminence, he said.Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP) and Ram Chandra Prasad Singh (JDU) also spoke.While initiating the debate on the Bill on Tuesday, INC member L Hanumanthaiah had questioned the move to grant such a status to an institute from Gujarat while ignoring states like Kerala and Karnataka, which have a rich history of traditional Ayurveda system.

Cong rues timelines for Covid debate||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 16The Government has come under attack from the opposition for severe time restrictions on the crucial debate on COVID 19 that was held in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.With just about two-and-a-half hours allocated for the debate, as many as 15 Opposition parties wrote a signed letter to house chairman M Venkaiah Naidu asking for debate time to be raised to four hours since this was once in a century calamity.“No, we have fixed the time and everyone must keep it,” Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh repeatedly said in the Upper House when Congress deputy leader Anand Sharma opened the debate.A visibly irritated Sharma told the chair that it was unfair to have timelines for discussion on COVID pandemic, which has cost the country so much.TMC leader Derek O Brien also later said that 15 parties had asked the chairman for extended timings.Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh lamented lack of time to debate the issue saying what’s the point of a session if COVID-19 cannot be debated when over 80,000 people have died and cases have crossed five million today.“Deeply disappointing that members were not allowed to speak fully on the COVID-19 situation in the Rajya Sabha today. What is the point of having this session and MPs coming from all over the country, if even on COVID-19 MPs have severe time restrictions while speaking,” said Ramesh.The government for its part is unfased and cited the fact that Health Minister Harsh Vardhan wasn’t allowed to even read a full Statement on COVID-19 in the Lok Sabha on Monday and was asked to lay the same due to paucity or time and pending electorate agenda.Vardhan had been cut short by LS Speaker Om Birla just 12 minutes into the COVID-19 status statement in the Lower House on Monday.The Health Minister had also looked visibly perturbed by time restrictions, but had no choice other than simply laying his written statement on the table.COVID-19 cases continue to rise with over 90,000 daily infections reported on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/whats-the-point-cong-rues-timelines-for-covid-debate-142029

State-owned Air India’s revenue fell from Rs 7,066 crore to Rs 1,531 crore.The employment at airlines has reduced from 74,887 as on March 31, 2020 to 69,589 as on July 31, 2020, while that at airports reduced from 67,760 to 64,514. For the same period, the employment at ground handling agencies reduced from 37,720 to 29,254 and at cargo operators it reduced from 9,555 to 8,538.Coming to the present, the number of passengers that travelled on domestic airlines in August 2020 was 28.32 lakh as compared to 21.07 lakh in July 2020, according to the DGCA. Private carriers accounted for over 90 per cent of the load factor during these two months, with the remaining being with Air India.Following the complete lockdown being imposed across the country in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no flights operated in April. With partial relaxation, 2.81 lakh passengers were ferried in May and 19.84 lakh in June.The number of passengers carried by domestic airlines from January-August 2020 was 401.17 lakh as against 943.58 lakh during the corresponding period of previous year, thereby registering an annual growth of minus 57.48 per cent.In August 2020, the airlines carried 28.32 lakh passengers compared to 117.93 lakh for the same month last year, which translates to a month-on-month growth of minus 75.99 per cent, the DGCA said.Airline data also showed that among all airlines Indigo had the highest market share, accounting for 49.8 per cent of the passengers carried from January to August this year, followed by Spicejet with 15.9 per cent and state-owned Air India with 11.4 per cent.As far as passenger grievances are concerned, the highest number of complaints received pertained to the refund of tickets. During the month of August, 23,219 passengers were affected due to cancellation of flights and another 12,591 people were affected because of flight delays.In accordance with the Civil Aviation requirement, all airlines are required to submit data on the number of cases of denied boarding, cancellations and delays along with the status on a monthly basis to the DGCA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-airlines-rev-up-ministrys-data-paints-grim-picture-of-covid-impact-142027

16-09-2020||---||Congress has always misled farmers, says Nadda||Vibha SharmaTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 16   Seeking to allay reservations regarding the three agri-Ordinances, BJP president JP Nadda on Wednesday accused the Congress of double standards, slamming it for misleading farmers, whereas it promised to free agricultural trade in its 2019 election manifesto. The Parliament is currently replacing the three contentious Ordinances with legislations amid strong objections by Opposition MPs and farmers protests, including in Punjab and Haryana.A day after Sukhbir Badal, the president of the NDA-ally Akali Dal, told the Lok Sabha that his party was “not consulted” before the three agri-Ordinances were brought and that the party’s representative in the Narendra Modi Cabinet (Food Procession Industries Minister Harsimrat Badal) registered her apprehensions during the meeting, Nadda said they were “talking” with the Punjab-ally to “address their concerns”.Asserting that MSP will stay within the Mandis now and forever and that APMC Act will also remain, Nadda also maintained that decisions had be taken after consultations.Notably, during the discussion on the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, on Tuesday Badal claimed the Akali Dal was “not consulted” before the three contentious agri-Ordinances.Calling the three legislations “revolutionary”, which will change the face of Indian farming sector and the state of the farmers for better, Nadda accused the Congress of misleading people “MSP under ‘mandis’ will remain now and forever.Farmers who do not want to go to ‘mandis; can sell outside. If they are getting better price outside why would they go for MSP under ‘mandis’ And if they are getting good price in ‘mandis’, they will go there, it will be their choice. MSP is limited to ‘mandis’ and available for limited period,” he saidResponding to the Congress, which has termed the BJP-led Centre's legislations “anti-farmers and pro-hoarders, pro-big traders and pro-corporates,” Nadda accused the Opposition party of adopting dual standards on the issue.Nadda, who said that only were the legislations “pro-farmers, they will also help them get better price by reducing bottlenecks in markets”.“The Congress party is opposing the Bill because they know nothing except politics.  The same party de-notified fruits and vegetables out of the APMC in 2014. In their 2019 manifesto they said they will make trade of agriculture produce, including exports, etc, free from all restrictions.“They said the ESMA act of 1955 belong to the age of control and promised to do away with it. Prime Minister Modi has only implemented what they promised. Today they are opposing the legislations in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha whereas they had promised the same in their manifesto”Stating that every action and policy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is dedicated towards poor, farmer and the last person in the queue, Nadda said the legislations were dedicated to farmers and giving them choice and freedom to cross barriers.“Of the Rs 20 lakh crore benefits announced under Armanirbhar Bharat, one lakh crore are only for farmers to help them increase their production and incomes with value additions. They will help farmers increase produce and ensure investment in the agriculture sector.“When ESMA was enacted in 1955, there was shortage of grains. India used to produce 10 MT wheat, today it is producing more than 100 MT, the production of rice has increased from 25 MT to 110 MT and pulses from 10 MT to 25 MT.“The agri-reforms will help farmers produce more and facilitate them in trade and commerce. They also help the farmers benefit of selling outside ‘mandis’ and empowering them. All the laws are transparent and competitive and will give information of prices with a framework of market intelligence,” he said   Nadda also said that farmers will be protected with model agreements for limited periods for produce. The agreements will be in regional language so that farmers can understand. The farmers will also get immediate payments along with benefits of bonus, assured price and variables.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-has-always-misled-farmers-says-nadda-142023
16-09-2020||New Delhi||Centre in SC favours time-bound trial of pending cases against lawmakers||The Centre favoured expeditious disposal of pending cases against former and sitting lawmakers on Wednesday before the Supreme Court and said these matters "must reach their logical conclusion" within a timeframe.A bench of Justices NV Ramana, Surya Kanta and Hrishikesh Roy was told by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that he had no problems with the suggestions made for speedy disposal of cases by senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, appointed as amicus curiae in the matter.Mehta said that if proceedings of any of these cases against lawmakers are stayed by the high court, then the top court may direct it to decide the matter in a time-bound manner.He told the bench that these cases "must reach their logical conclusion within a time-bound manner" and if any central agency (like CBI or ED) is not proceeding with the matter despite there being no stay then he would take up the issue at another level."Whatever directions will come from the Supreme Court, the Union of India will welcome them," Mehta said, adding that if there are any lacunae regarding infrastructure of special courts, then the top court may direct the state government concerned to do the needful within a maximum of one month.At the outset, Hansaria, along with advocate Sneha Kalita, referred to the details of cases against MPs and MLAs from his report.The bench asked Hansaria about the status of the cases being investigated by central agencies like the CBI and ED, some of them pending for years.Hansaria said several Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) cases had been stayed by the high courts like in Karnataka and many cases under the PC Act and the PMLA against elected representatives had been stayed by the Telangana high court.He said in some of these cases trials had not been expedited and many of them are pending at the stage of framing of charges.The bench observed that there may be cases where the central agencies had registered FIRs but nothing much had happened thereafter.To this, Hansaria said there are several cases where even charges have not been framed.The bench observed that there are several issues like non-appointment of public prosecutors, charge sheets not being filed and witnesses not being called.The apex court observed that if there is only one special court in one state then it may not be possible to conduct all these cases in a time-bound manner.Mehta said that the court might consider having a particular number of cases in one special court.He also referred to the geographical aspect of a particular state and said that the chief justice of the high court of states might decide the number of cases to be dealt with by a special court.Hansaria said that there are states which are big and it is very difficult for the witnesses to travel from one part of the state to other.Mehta said the Centre had released funds to the states for creation of special courts and several states had not yet filed the utilisation certificate with the Centre.The bench, which said it would consider the suggestions given by the solicitor general, said it would pass order on these issues which had also been raised in Hansaria's report.At the fag-end of the hearing, Mehta requested the court that direction regarding funding issue might be avoided at this stage as he would have to take instruction on this aspect.Mehta said he agreed with the demarcation that cases having offences attracting life sentence and under the PC Act should be given priority as suggested by the amicus curiae.Hansaria had suggested that after death or life sentence cases and corruption, money laundering cases, the special court should take up cases like SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Offences under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.He said that thereafter the special court might take up cases of offences punishable with imprisonment for seven years or more and other crime-related matters.The top court that was earlier informed that the politicians are facing criminal trials in 4,442 cases across the nation and out of these, sitting MPs and MLAs are undertrials in as many as 2,556 such matters, sought further information from all high courts about other pending cases against sitting and former lawmakers.Hansaria in his supplementary report said that more than 200 cases are pending against lawmakers under special laws such as the PCA, PMLA and the POCSO Act, 2012, in different states.Over a dozen cases are also pending against Members of Parliament or Members of Legislative Assembly (both former and sitting) for offences under the Income Tax Act, Companies Act, Prevention of Arms Act, Excise Act and NDPS Act, the apex court was informed.The report said the analysis of pending cases also shows that there is no uniformity on setting up of Special Courts for MPs/MLAs throughout the country.The plea filed by advocate Ashiwini Upadhyay has also sought a direction to the Centre to take appropriate steps to debar the person convicted of the offences specified under some provisions of the Representation of the People Act (RPA) from contesting “MLA or MP election, forming a political party or becoming office-bearer of a political party”.

Her remarks came a day after BJP's Lok Sabha MP and Bhojpuri actor Ravi Kishan said there was a problem of drug addiction in the film industry.Supporting Bachchan's stand, the Marathi daily said, "A doping test should be conducted on those who claim that all artists and technicians in the film industry are under the influence of drugs."The Shiv Sena said the foundation of the Indian film industry was laid by Dadasaheb Phalke, a Maharashtrian. The industry made a start with silent movies like 'Raja Harishchandra' and reached the present pinnacle of success due to the hard work of lakhs of people.It also said actors like Sunil Dutt and his colleagues would tour the borders to entertain soldiers, Manoj Kumar always produced patriotic films while Raj Kapoor's films catered to social issues."Several artistes raised their voice against the Emergency for which they had to pay a heavy price," it said.--PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shiv-sena-backs-jaya-bachchan-for-standing-up-for-bollywood-141999

This is exactly what India, one of the aspirants to a permanent seat on an expanded UNSC, says.“This process is member-states driven. We will build on the meetings in previous sessions,” he said while bemoaning the US quarantine policy that has inhibited heads of state and governments from attending the session in person and, by their physical presence, guiding their delegations to indulge in off-the-record discussions.Bozkir said his first priority will be to appoint facilitators for the process after holding consultations with member countries.India, which has been seated in the front row and has under its belt successful elections to three ECOSOC bodies, would be taking his statement with circumspection since Bozkir is a Turkish while the question was asked by a Pakistani journalist and both their nations have plans for UNSC expansion very different from what India has been lobbying for: Permanent memberships for itself, Germany, Brazil, Japan and nominees from Africa.Bozkir attacked the US quarantine policy and was unaware if the US President Donald Trump would be the lone head of state to address the momentous diamond jubilee session of the UNGA.Pushing strongly for in-person meetings, he said the “silent process didn’t help in making decisions”.Now that the UN has begun physical interactions, “we are going to show that the UN is back”, he said while strongly defending the WHO ahead of a UNGA special session to discuss Covid, tentatively scheduled for the first week of November. Another special session will deal with corruption.Asked about his country’s views shaping his decisions, he agreed that having served for 39 years in the diplomatic services and 10 years as a politician, he would have “some views”.“But I think the chair must be impartial. I must look at a situation from the UN perspective and not my country’s perspective,” he said when asked how he would arbitrate between Turkey and Greece on their contest for the Eastern Mediterranean.On the vaccine, Bozkir said if it is found, the world must ensure it is distributed fairly and justly instead of only a part of the world benefiting from it while leaving the major portion of the world to a later stage. “UN’s role and GA’s role comes into picture at this point. I will make it a priority to make statements on this point. There is a run to finding the vaccine. That is going to be a major solution to the problem,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-gets-front-row-seat-at-75th-unga-wins-membership-of-3-ecosoc-bodies-141993

People who made their names in the industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree. I hope that the government tells such people not to use this kind of language,” she said. Bachchan also gave a zero hour notice in the Rajya Sabha over “the alleged conspiracy to defame the film industry”. She pointed out that the entertainment industry provides direct employment to 5 lakh persons and indirect employment to 50 lakh. But a campaign on social media has started when the financial situation is in a depressing state and unemployment at the worst level. “Just because there are some people, you can’t tarnish the image of the entire industry. I am really embarrassed and ashamed that yesterday one of our members in the Lok Sabha, who is from the film industry, spoke against it. It is a shame,” she said, adding that there were some people in the film industry who bite the hand that feeds them. Kangana issue raised in LS New Delhi: Mandi MP Ram Swaroop Sharma on Tuesday raised the issue of treatment meted out to Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut by the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Government. “The Shiv Sena is no longer a Sena of Shivaji Maharaj but Congress,” Sharma alleged, pointing to the demolition of her Mumbai office last week.

16-09-2020||Sandeep Dikshit---||Scattered seating, somnolent debate||Tribune News Service New Delhi, September 15 There was no hubbub rising to the media gallery from the bowels of the Rajya Sabha today when it reconvened for the first time after the Covid pandemic ravaged the world. Members were split between the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha with some of them even consigned to the visitor’s galleries next to the media gallery. The scattered and widely dispersed seating arrangement meant a loss of collective voice, either to yell aye in approval or raise the decibel level several notches in protest. As the House assembled, the difference was in two large LED screens behind Chairman Venkaiah Naidu which captured the action in the Lok Sabha and various Rajya Sabha galleries. And the small number of MPs in the House seemed to give it an air of a somnolent debate in the middle of a lengthy session rather than reflective of the energy on the first day of Parliament when many political scores have to be settled. Special Mentions saw Naidu keeping a strict vigil while members’ names were called out. He repeatedly noted the changes brought about by the pandemic. Some MPs utilised the opportunity to saunter over to the Lok Sabha chamber to have a feel of the place as during normal sessions, they would not have been allowed to enter the Lok Sabha. After the Special Mentions closed and papers were laid on the table of the House, Deputy Chairman Harivansh, firmly masked, stood at a more-than-usual distance waiting for Naidu to vacate the Chair. As the transition was taking place, a marshal moved in swiftly to spray sanitiser on the vacant chair. But MPs were unhappy. “Many elements of a democratic system are missing,” said one.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scattered-seating-somnolent-debate-141717

We will be happy to give up our entire salary, but the Rs 20,000-crore Central Vista project must also be cancelled.” She added that she would rather prefer a hospital with all facilities like ventilators etc.In April, the Cabinet gave its nod to the government’s decision to suspend MPLADS scheme for two years, along with a 30 per cent cut in salaries of sitting MPs to mobilise money to fight against Covid-19.The suspension of the MPLAD scheme, especially during a pandemic, has invited much criticism from several MPs, who asked the government to “give back people their rightful money”.Congress’ Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury questioned if any BJP MP can say he or she does not need MPLAD funds. “No one from ruling side said nothing about MPLAD. We should pass a unanimous decision for restoring the funds,” Chowdhury said.AAP MP Bhagwant Mann also said the government should take away the salary, but give them the public funds money with “guidelines on expenditure”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/take-away-our-salary-but-restore-mplad-funds-say-oppn-mps-141718

Thakur said this while replying to a spate of questions, including from Elamaram Kareem (CPM), V Vijayasai Reddy and Kethi Reddy Suresh Reddy (both TRS).In written replies, Thakur maintained that the future course of action to meet the GST compensation shortfall was discussed by the GST Council on August 27 where the states were given two options to meet their GST compensation shortfall for the current financial year from market borrowing.Thakur said five questions were put to the AG. On the question that in case the balance in the GST compensation fund is not adequate to meet the compensation, the AG said states are entitled to receive the full amount of compensation during the “transition period”.But in case the balance in the fund is insufficient, the AG said there is no express provision in the Compensation Act for the Centre to bear the liability of making good the shortfall. While the AG agreed that the GST Council can recommend extension of period for compensation, in reply to two questions he made it clear that the Centre will have the last word on any borrowing by the states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gst-fund-partly-used-to-pay-pending-dues-says-anurag-thakur-141722

The Bill sought to ensure higher safety and security of passengers, aircrafts, airports and others in line with international standards. The Lok Sabha had passed it during the Budget Session.The bill sought to transmute the three regulatory bodies — Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) — under the Ministry of Civil Aviation into statutory bodies.Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri introduced the Bill in the House yesterday which was considered today. The minister said the amendments would fulfill the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which had raised questions of safety and security in its audit. The reflection of the body had necessitated amendment to the Aircraft Act, 1934.The Act regulates the manufacture, possession, use, operation, sale, import and export of civil aircraft and licensing of aerodromes.Taking part in the discussion, Puri rebutted charge of Opposition parties that the government was promoting crony capitalism through the route of privatisation of airports.Awarding management of airports to private parties was startd by the UPA regime in 2006 in the form of Mumbai and Delhi airports.He supported participation of private parties to manage airports saying it helped to raise revenues which are ploughed back in development of other airports. With regard privatisation of Air India, the national carrier, Puri said that with it being in debt of Rs 60,000 crore, the choice was between running it or halting it for good.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-nod-to-statutory-tag-for-aviation-regulators-141724

Party president Sukhbir Badal said when the Centre brought the ordinances in June, his party’s representative in the Union Cabinet had “expressed reservations”.Will move court: CaptThe state Congress will challenge the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Riding roughshod over farmers’ concerns, the government has imposed a Central law on a state subject, thus eroding the federal structure of the country.— Capt Amarinder Singh, Punjab CM“These ordinances should not have been brought without discussions and allaying the fears of the farming community,” he said, invoking the contribution of his father Parkash Singh Badal as a farmer leader to press his claim.Sukhbir said: "Before bringing the ordinances, parties and groups representing farmers should have been consulted. In the past two months, I have talked to many farmer organisations and listened to their concerns over the matter.”He said the ordinances would affect farmers in Punjab and Haryana where the mandi system existed. “I don’t know about others, but our concerns have not been addressed,” he said, urging the Union Government to reconsider the matter.Sukhbir’s assertion was ridiculed by AAP’s Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, who said: “I am surprised he (Sukhbir) is objecting to the Bills, while his wife is occupying a ministerial berth at the Centre.

At the same time, he assured the House that the country was ready to deal with all contingencies. “No one should doubt our determination to safeguard our borders,” he maintained.Unusual face-offThere have been prolonged LAC stand-offs in past too, but situation is different this year in terms of scale of troops involved and number of friction points. — Rajnath Singh, Defence MinisterReferring to the June 15 Galwan clash, he said Indian soldiers had inflicted costs, including casualties, on the Chinese side. “China can’t unilaterally change LAC status quo. The amassing of troops by China (since April) goes against the 1993 and 1996 pacts, which call for respecting and strictly observing the LAC. Disturbing peace along the border is bound to have implications,” the minister said in what was seen as a message to China that hostilities and trade couldn’t go together. While Indian forces never violated border pacts, a similar reciprocation didn’t come from China, he said, listing recent friction points in eastern Ladakh, including Gogra, Kongka La and north and south banks of Pangong Tso.China has currently mobilised a large number of troops and armaments along the LAC as well as in depth areas. India too had made appropriate counter deployments, he pointed out.Referring to his meeting with Chinese counterpart General Wei Fenghe in Moscow on September 4 and the subsequent meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries, Rajnath Singh said India had stuck to three key principles: both sides should strictly respect and observe the LAC; neither side should attempt to alter status quo and all agreements must be respected.About the recent incidents along the southern bank of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial melt lake, the Minister said the Chinese side engaged in provocative military manoeuvers on the night of August 29 and 30 in an attempt to change the status quo.Agreements breachedIndia’s 3-point stand1 Both sides should strictly respect and observe the LAC2 Neither side should attempt to alter the status quo3 All agreements must be fully abided by in their entiretyPrime Minister misled nation: CongressCongress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused PM Narendra Modi of misleading the nation on Chinese aggression. “...when will you recover Indian Territory from China?" Rahul tweeted. In the Lok Sabha, the Congress MPs staged a walkout, accusing the government of not allowing them to seek clarifications.

Both the forces have been asked to place their demands for essentials and stock these for next six months.Sources in the ministry said a detailed plan had been chalked out to rush bulk supplies of essential commodities, including winter tents, heaters, warm clothes, sunglasses and packaged food.“The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), which guards borders with China, and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), deployed along the boundary with Bhutan and Nepal, have been asked to place their demands as early as possible. The government wants to make available the required commodities within 10 days,” sources said.The move comes in backdrop of ongoing tensions with China in Ladakh and the Indian forces have been told to ensure unprecedented arrangements to ensure Beijing doesn’t attempt any border incursions during winter.Sources said directions had also been issued to the forces to stay put at their respective locations all through the winter to deal with any Chinese threat. During harsh winter months, both Indian and Chinese forces earlier used to withdraw from their patrolling locations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ssb-in-for-long-haul-along-bhutan-141735

The Russian side tried hard to persuade Pakistan not to do so. Its NSA Nikolai Patrushev conveyed that Russia didn’t support what Pakistan had done. Moscow hoped that Pak’s provocative act wouldn’t affect India’s participation in SCO and impact Patrushev’s rapport with NSA Doval, sources said.Doval first consulted with the host, in this case the Russian NSA, before walking out of the conference. Later, the Ministry of External Affairs said the display of the map was “a blatant disregard to the advisory by the host against it and in violation of the norms of the meeting”.“After consultation with the host, the Indian side left the meeting in protest at that juncture,” admitted MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava. It was claimed that India had also raised objections to the display of Pakistan’s new political map in the background during a test call three days back.After Doval walked out, the meeting carried on with the “new map” of Pakistan which was a constant feature behind its NSA at the videoconference.The MEA said the Pakistani NSA had “deliberately projected a fictitious map”.In Geneva, UN Human Right Council chief Michelle Bachelet’s observations on Kashmir were sought to be rebutted by diplomat Indra Mani Pandey, who stated people in the UT of J&K had been enjoying the same fundamental rights as people in the rest of country ever since changes were rung in on August 5 last year.He also sought a sympathetic view because of the “enormity of the challenges that India faces due to a large and very diverse population of 1.3 billion” and wanted the HRC to act “as our partner in a cooperative and constructive spirit in our endeavour to secure all basic human rights for our people”.Bachelot, a two-time President of Chile and a victim of torture by its army, had expressed concerns over continued arbitrary detention of many persons.Saudi Arabia and Pakistan seem to have made up as Pakistan delivered the statement on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC). Its envoy Khalil Hashmi promptly raised the issue of J&K on behalf of the OIC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doval-walks-out-of-sco-meet-over-fictitious-pakistan-map-141744
