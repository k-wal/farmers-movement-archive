Passengers found travelling without masks in the metro trains, stations or any other metro premises will have to pay a fine of Rs 500,” the NMRC said in a statement.“These penalties will be imposed strictly by the NMRC staff so that commuters follow the guidelines and help the NMRC in preventing the spread of the coronavirus,” it added.NMRC‘s senior officials on Saturday held a detailed inspection of the complete Aqua Line to check the “health” of the metro system and to avoid any last-minute glitches in its operation.The inspection was carried under the guidance of NMRC Chief Operating Officer Ravindra Saxena and other officers of the Operations, Electrical and Rolling Stock team, it stated.“All the systems were thoroughly checked by officials. All the officials travelled in a rail motor trolley to check the tracks and signalling from the Depot station in Greater Noida to Sector 51 Station in Noida,” the NMRC said.“They stopped at various stations on the way and inspected each and every aspect related to the functioning of the Metro trains and all its related systems,” it added.The inspection was also done to check the preparedness of the NMRC for beginning metro services after the lockdown of almost five months and to fill lapses, if any, and to check the aspects related to the implementation of the guidelines adopted by NMRC to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. ---PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/noida-metro-rs-500-fine-for-commuters-without-face-mask-rs-100-for-spitting-136881

Confirmation of reactivation or re-infection and their epidemiological importance are awaited,” it said.Serosurveillance is generally a sensitive tool to determine the extent of infection and immunity in the general population. Only a few field-based studies have generated serosurveillance data but with inconclusive inferences.The editorial mentioned a recent seroprevalence study which showed that most of the population of Geneva, Switzerland, remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the region.“Such studies raise red flags on continuous susceptibility of the population to COVID-19 and inability of the virus to produce widespread immunity. It may contribute to a ‘second wave’ of cases.“The role of reduced use of non-pharmaceutical interventions in facilitating a second wave as community engagement wanes, requires further investigation,” the experts said.The uncertainty of long-term immune response has potential implications for the efficacy of vaccines. The real impact of vaccines on this pandemic will become evident only once it has been widely in use for a few months in different populations, they said.As of now, vaccine is being considered as the ultimate intervention to contain the pandemic. The global race to make it available to the world has been accelerated.Currently, there are about 165 different candidate vaccines for COVID-19 being developed around the world and several of these are in different phases of clinical trials.Three vaccine candidates (inactivated, DNA based recombinant and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine consisting of the replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector ChAdOx) are currently in early phases of human trials in India, the editorial said.“Commercial production of COVID-19 vaccine and possible imports are likely to commence by the end of 2020,” it said.Global procurement and distribution of vaccine to ensure its universal access has been planned by the WHO, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.India has developed a blueprint for efficient deployment of the vaccine, supported by IT-based vaccine tracker.“Immunising the entire population, prioritizing high risk segments, assuring quality in logistics and undertaking post-vaccination surveillance for adverse effects and impact on disease burden shall be huge challenges for any health system,” it highlighted.In the absence of specific antiviral drugs or vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions undertaken by the communities assumed critical importance in curtailing viral transmission. “Community engagement, especially of poor and illiterate, is always difficult to ensure”, it said.The COVID-19 pandemic has attracted the entire focus and efforts of the health system. Usual health services to communities have become restricted because health facilities are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, it said.People are also apprehensive about visiting health institutions for fear of contracting COVID-19. Important components of health services that have suffered most include health needs of children, women, elderly with noncommunicable diseases and management of other therapies (e.g. cancers, tuberculosis and HIV) and health emergencies.The pandemic has pushed back progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and is hampering achievement of ambitious UN Sustainable Development Goals.“It is still not clear as to how the global community will make up for the pandemic-induced setback to its critical operations of major disease elimination programmes such as for tuberculosis,” the editorial said.Implementation of efficient public health actions is possible on the foundations of sound scientific knowledge of the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.“Despite extensive research on all aspects of COVID-19 pandemic, the world is still struggling with the origin of the virus, public health implications of the mutations in the viral genome, availability of a diagnostic test with better sensitivity and specificity, understanding the immune response to the virus, its pathobiology and clinical spectrum, and availability of safe and efficacious specific antiviral drugs and a vaccine.“These unknowns have made it an enigmatic pandemic till now,” the editorial said.

However, if approved for the next rank, his retirement age would be raised and he would continue in service.The Bench observed that the petitioner was recommended for promotion by the board held in April 2020 but the Ministry had not approved the board proceedings apparently due to observations with regard to award of board marks, and instead directed that the board be reconvened. The promotion board, however, has not been reconvened so far.After considering the “extraordinary” facts of the case the Bench agreed with the petitioner’s contentions that  his retirement on August 31 would place him at a substantial disadvantage during consideration by the promotion board when it is re-convened at a future date."We direct that the retirement of the applicant should not be given effect to till declassification of results of the said No. 1 Promotion Board (AFMS) for AMC after it is reconvened, as ordered on July 19 this year,” the Bench ruled.“In case the applicant is approved for promotion to the rank of Major General and there is a vacancy available for his promotion on that date, he should be promoted with effect from August 31, 2020," the Bench added.The Bench also directed that in case the officer was not approved for promotion by the reconvened board, he would be deemed to have retired on August 31 and he would surrender all salary or allowances other than his pension that may have been paid to him with effect from September 1, 2020, for his services after that date.The petitioner had averred that the promotion board was supposed to be held in 2019 but was delayed till April 2020. Thereafter its proceedings were forwarded to the Ministry for approval but they were not accepted and returned on July 29 with an order to reconvene the board.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aft-stays-brigadiers-retirement-till-mod-declares-promotion-board-results-136861

Thereafter, the college management would conduct interviews for final selection and appointment. Contending that the amended rules violated their fundamental right to establish and run a minority educational institution, the petitioner assailed the UP Government order for interfering with its rights. Terming the high court’s order as “erroneous” and be wrong based on wrong interpretation of precedents, the petitioner had urged the top court to direct the UP Government not to make appointments under amended rules.However, the top court refused to grant any interim relief to the petitioner committee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-stay-up-amendment-to-rules-for-appointing-teachers-in-minority-institutions-136860

05-09-2020||New Delhi||Withdraw circular ‘banning’ creation of new posts: Cong to govt||The Congress on Saturday demanded that the Centre withdraw its circular calling for a freeze on the creation of new posts, and urged it to create more vacancies while filling the existing ones in the wake of the alleged rise in unemployment.As part of measures to rationalise non-priority expenditure, the government on Friday asked all ministries and departments to review appointments of consultants, curtail functions among other steps. It said there will be a ban on the creation of new posts, except with the approval of the expenditure department.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at the Centre over the issue, alleging that the Modi dispensation’s thinking is “minimum government, maximum privatisation”.The COVID-19 pandemic is just an excuse and the intention is to make government offices “free” of permanent staff, he alleged on Twitter.“Rob the future of the youth and promote friends,” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi and urged the people to speak up.At an online media briefing, Congress leader and former Union minister Rajeev Shukla said the government has come out with the circular which has suggested that new jobs cannot be created at all and the vacancies which are already existing should not be filled.“This is a very alarming situation since the country’s economy is already in doldrums. Our GDP has gone down -23.9 per cent. An ILO report suggests that 40 crore people are going to be below the poverty line.“So, in this situation, if the government stops helping people, if the government stops creating new jobs, if the government is not coming forward or stepping up to support the young people, then who is going to support them,” he asked.The private sector is already into retrenchment because its financial situation is very bad, he said.“The Congress demands that more and more vacancies and posts should be created, existing ones should be filled immediately and people should be provided employment,” Shukla said.All those sectors where more employment opportunities can be created should be helped, Shukla said.The government should reconsider and withdraw this circular, he said.  “The second part of the circular is suggesting that the government expenditure in certain areas should be curbed, but, there are very trivial like the use of (imported) paper, the celebration of foundation day, and stopping of distributing bags and mementos, he said.“How much are you going to save? Few thousands, few lakhs (of rupees), that is not going to make any difference.“Actually, the government should reconsider all those projects... from which you are trying to derive publicity and you have been spending thousands and thousands of crores on those projects, those projects for the time being should be stopped,” he said.He reminded the BJP of its “poll promise” to give “two crore jobs every year”. “Here, the authentic data is showing that two crore people have lost jobs in a few months,” Shukla claimed.“The Congress demands from the government that in this moment of economic crisis, it should step up its efforts and come forward to help the people instead of backing out,” Shukla said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/withdraw-circular-banning-creation-of-new-posts-cong-to-govt-136835

05-09-2020||New Delhi||BJP will form next government in Odisha, says Nadda||Launching a strong attack against the Naveen Patnaik-led BJD government in Odisha, BJP president JP Nadda said on Saturday that it would not be long before the saffron party, which has emerged as the lead opposition in the State, will form the government there with an absolute majority. “Undoubtedly, the next government in the State will be that of the BJP,” Nadda said, addressing Odisha BJP State Executive Meeting. The party has moved forward at a fast pace since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when it got 21 per cent of the vote share, he said. “In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, with nearly one crore votes the BJP received 38 per cent of the votes. Similarly, in the 2014 Odisha Legislative Assembly elections, the BJP got 18 per cent votes and in 2019 it got 32 per cent votes. The vote share of the BJP has to increase above 50 per cent,” Nadda  said, asking party cadres to take a pledge regarding this.Nadda accused the state government under Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik of indulging in "rampant corruption". “Be large hearted to give the credit to the Centre for its welfare schemes," he said and claimed that they had been “hijacked” by his government as its schemes. He also came down heavily on the state government for not implementing the Ayushman Bharat scheme. “Some 2.4 crore people could have benefited from the Rs 5 lakh medical coverage. I call upon CM Naveen Patnaik to allow Prime Minister Modi`s scheme to reach poor and needy". Nadda also stressed on PM`s “able handling” of the pandemic situation in India and economic packages to help the poor and needy during the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-will-form-next-government-in-odisha-says-nadda-136832
05-09-2020||New Delhi||Nixon’s remarks against Indians reflect his ‘vulgarity’, ‘racism’: Former diplomats||Former US president Richard Nixon’s disparaging remarks on Indians, revealed in newly declassified White House tapes, reflect his “vulgarity” and “racism” as well as his anti-India stance driven by his preference for Pakistan, say former Indian diplomats.While former foreign minister Natwar Singh labelled the 37th president of the United States a “third-rate” human being, former diplomat Mani Shankar Aiyar termed him “uncivilised” and former Indian ambassador to the US Meera Shankar recalled his animus with Indira Gandhi. They also spoke of Nixon being outwitted and out-maneuvered by Gandhi.The “newly declassified trove of tapes provides startling evidence of the bigotry” voiced by Nixon, who was president from 1969 to 1974, and his national security advisory Henry Kissinger, Princeton professor Gary Bass has revealed in The New York Times.Asked about Nixon’s remarks, Natwar Singh said Nixon’s language reflected “his vulgarity and racism”.“Richard Nixon was a third-rate human being and his entire record shows that and also the manner in which he was dismissed,” Singh told PTI, referring to the Watergate scandal that led to Nixon’s resignation.Nixon had a genuine preference for Pakistan vis-a-vis India and he knew about the genocide that was going on in Bangladesh but turned his eyes the other way. In this, his accomplice was Kissinger, Singh said.“Kissinger, 20 years later at least had the decency to apologise, but Nixon went to his grave and never apologised,” said Singh, who has been a decorated diplomat and India’s envoy to several countries.Singh also hailed then prime minister Indira Gandhi for “completely out-maneuvering” the Americans.Aiyar, a former Union minister and IFS officer who has handled sensitive assignments, also slammed Nixon, describing him as “very vulgar” and “completely uncivilised”.“The Nixon tapes have long ago revealed that Nixon was a very vulgar, completely uncivilised and perhaps typical white American male of his generation. The revelations made by Gary Bass only confirm that,” Aiyar told PTI.“It is perhaps Indira Gandhi’s greatest achievement that she completely outwitted and put to shame this horrible man who was perhaps the only president to be driven out of office for his misdemeanours,” said Aiyar, who had just come back from a posting in Hanoi in the early 1970s to when the remarks date back to.According to Aiyar, Nixon was infuriated with Indira Gandhi because she did not behave like other world leaders when the “American boss wags his finger at them”.“She just went away disgusted and did her thing...she put them in their place and that is why they hated her,” he said of the 1971 Bangladesh War episode.In his opinion piece titled “The Terrible Cost of Presidential Racism”, Bass writes that the full content of the tapes reveal how “U.S. policy toward South Asia under Mr. Nixon was influenced by his hatred of, and sexual repulsion toward, Indians”.In the “stunning” conversation – that takes place at the Oval Office in June 1971 between Nixon,  Kissinger and his chief of staff H.R. Haldeman – the then president asserts in a “venomous tone” that Indian women are “undoubtedly, the most unattractive women in the world”, Bass says.            Nixon also calls Indians “most sexless”, “nothing” and “pathetic”, according to the tapes.Asked whether the remarks were the outcome of personal behaviour or a product of the Cold War era, Shankar said, “I think it would be a combination of personal animus  and perceived complications for the US policy.”“He did not get on with Indira Gandhi… for whatever reasons, they did not hit it off, and subsequently there was the whole issue of the opening up to China with Kissinger using Pakistan as the intermediary to pave the way for his confidential diplomacy,” she told PTI.Both these issues informed Nixon and Kissinger’s behaviour towards India, she said, adding that the cold war coloured the US’ perception of India.G Parthasarathy, who has been India’s envoy in several countries, said the remarks could be attributed to a “mixture of circumstances”. “Firstly was his own character. He was given to being foul mouthed. Secondly, the dislike for India was very clear and he was planning was a sort of Pakistan, China and the US getting together and that was what we saw in the Bangladesh conflict.”“Therefore, if you look back on the vehemence  and venom with which he had spoken, all credit to Mrs Gandhi that she completely out-maneuvered him,” he said.Former foreign secretary Salman Haider, however, said the revelations were “very unfortunate” as ties between India and the US have developed in a very satisfactory way and the relations have taken the turn for the best.On November 4, 1971, during a private break from a contentious White House summit with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India, a rare woman leader at the time, the president harangued Mr. Kissinger about his sexual disgust at Indians, Bass, author of “The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger and a Forgotten Genocide”, writes. Referring to Indians, Nixon says to Kissinger, “To me, they turn me off. How the hell do they turn other people on, Henry? Tell me.” According to Bass, while Kissinger’s response is inaudible in the tapes, it did not discourage the president from his theme.In November 1971, in the middle of a discussion about India-Pakistan tensions with Kissinger and Secretary of State William Rogers, after Rogers mentioned reprimanding Gandhi, the president blurted, “I don’t know how they reproduce!”    While Nixon and Kissinger had some reasons to favour Pakistan, an American ally which was secretly helping to bring about their historic opening to China, their biases and emotions contributed to their excessive support for Pakistan’s murderous dictatorship throughout its atrocities, Bass says. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nixons-remarks-against-indians-reflect-his-vulgarity-racism-former-diplomats-136830
05-09-2020||New Delhi||Home 30-minute drive from hospital, but duty keeps doctor away for 5 months||"When will you come home?" the daughters of Dr Ajit Jain would ask when they used to talk over call late at night.The nodal officer for novel coronavirus at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital in Delhi has not been home for nearly five months. Duty and fear of spreading the infection among the family members kept him away.When he finally came home, 13 km away in Kamla Nagar and just a half-an-hour drive from his hospital in Dilshad Garden, his two daughters opened the door and hugged him tight.Jain's wife, trying not to be overwhelmed with emotion, performed an 'aarti' and applied a 'tilak' on his forehead, as his son shot a video of the homecoming – the first time since March 17. A cake was cut and the family dined together in almost six months."When cases started emerging in March, we understood COVID-19 is one of the biggest challenges mankind has ever confronted," Jain, who availed his first leave on Thursday after working for 170 days on the trot, told PTI."Initially, I didn't go home for the fear of spreading the infection in my family," the 52-year-old said. "Both my parents are aged above 75. I was worried about them. I didn't want to put their lives in jeopardy."As the number of patients swelled, it seemed impossible to talk to the family on the phone, too."Saving lives was the first priority. There was so much going on," he says. "I could talk to my family only at night, around 1 or 2 am."       Jain's daughter, Aarushi, says the family was really worried for him as the cases kept piling up."We would ask him 'papa when will you come home?' We saw what happened in Italy, in the US... we were freaking out. So many doctors contracted the virus are no more between us," she says."We would wait up till 2 am to talk to him for five minutes, to enquire about his well-being," the daughter says.Though the government made arrangements for the health staff to stay at Leela Ambience hotel, the doctor spent several nights in the hospital itself.For the initial three months, not once did Jain sleep for 15 minutes at a stretch. His phone just won't stop ringing.The doctor has given his personal mobile number to all coronavirus patients who are undergoing treatment or have been discharged from the hospital after recovery."The situation was more serious during the lockdown. Patients were more anxious living in closed rooms. They would call after every five minutes... No one could even imagine the entire country would shut down," he says.Talking to the patient personally builds confidence among them and lessens their anxiety and stress, he says.The doctor also formed a team – including a nurse, nursing orderly and housekeeping staff – who would talk to the patients admitted in the hospital daily on general things so that they do not feel lonely. Separate teams have been created to call up those who have recovered from the virus to know about their well-being."After the patient is discharged, the team calls up him/her to take feedback," the doctor says. "This is how we got to know that a few recovered patients were suffering from long-term complications like anxiety, breathlessness, insomnia."The feedback led to the opening of a post-COVID clinic, a first-of-its-kind facility, on the premises of the hospital with medical specialists to treat symptoms particular to their respective fields.The doctor has also created WhatsApp groups and is in "regular touch" with more than 1,500 patients."They or their family members call me up directly if they want to discuss something," Jain says."Sometimes people give us blessings, sometimes, they say bad things about us... I am just doing my job."  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/home-30-minute-drive-from-hospital-but-duty-keeps-doctor-away-for-5-months-136825

05-09-2020||New Delhi||Professor seeks 'justice' for Sushant Singh Rajput on Teachers' Day||"Sincere, calm, quiet", that is how deceased actor Sushant Singh Rajput's teacher, who taught him engineering, remembers him on this Teachers' Day, even as the world is scrambling to put labels of "bipolar, addict and depressed" on him.His teacher also refuses to believe he could commit suicide and demands "justice" for him."He was very Sincere, very calm and very quiet in the class. I cannot comment on his activities outside the class. But he was not the kind who could do this (take his own life). I could never have imagined this," Professor RC Singh, who taught Sushant kinematics (the science of describing the motion of objects) at Delhi Technological University, formerly known as Delhi College of Engineering, told IANS.At times, Sushant was so quiet in class that Singh would wonder whether the late actor was catching what was being taught. So, often he would walk up to where Sushant used to sit. "Then I would find he was catching everything. In fact, if asked, he would explain as well. Pursuing mechanical engineering in spite of being a topper in the entrance, was his own choice," he said.Sushant Singh Rajput had secured 7th rank in the engineering Entrance Examination in 2003. After this, Sushant pursued mechanical engineering. However, he took a break from studies and started acting in the third year of the course.Sushant diverted his focus on theater and dance during his college days when he found his true calling.As the nation celebrates Teachers' Day, Singh fondly remembered a talented student who has gone too soon. But he also wants "justice" for Sushant. "On this Teachers' Day, I pray that his soul rests in peace and his family gets courage to face this situation. I also want to say that given the enquiries which are going on, I hope he gets justice," he said.Speaking to IANS, Singh also spoke about what he feels are the "shortcomings" of Bollywood. "I hope the field he was in and its shortcomings should be corrected. That will be a justice for him and his family will get peace." Singh's statement assumes significance in the backdrop of all kinds of wild theories flying thick and fast. Last night, tightening the noose around Rhea Chakraborty, Sushanta's girlfriend and now a suspect, the Narcotics Control Bureau arrested her brother Showik and Rajput's housekeeping manager Samuel Miranda as part of its probe into the drug angle in the Bollywood star's death.On June 14, Sushant was found dead at his home in Mumbai. At that time, the Mumbai Police had concluded it was a case of suicide.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/professor-seeks-justice-for-sushant-singh-rajput-on-teachers-day-136817

05-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Even after week, more ‘dislikes’ than ‘likes’ on PM Modi's videos on BJP channel||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 5It will be a week tomorrow but the trend that started with the unprecedented number of ‘dislikes’ on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s monthly radio show ‘Mann Ki Baat’ last Sunday does not appear to be showing any signs of ending. Today a video posted by the BJP on its official channel, where the Prime Minister can be seen interacting with a woman probationer (‘IPS studying textiles to fighting terror: Tanushree shares her story with the PM’), again saw ‘dislikes’ outnumbering ‘likes’ by a huge number.In fact, a worried BJP chose not to provide the option (of hitting the ‘like’ or ‘dislike’ button) on the video of his interaction with IPS probationers posted on the channel yesterday. This after his address at the third leadership summit of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF) registered more than one lakh dislikes compared to about half the number of ‘likes’. An animated video of the work done by his government during the Covid-pandemic also saw ‘dislikes’ outnumbering the ‘likes’.Though the BJP blames it on ‘Opposition conspiracy’, the trend is coinciding with the outrage among students appearing for JEE, NEET exams and also those aspiring for various government jobs who are upset over delay in results, recruitment notification and issuance of admit cards. It all began last Sunday when PM Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ received a record number of ‘dislikes’ to become one of the most disliked videos on the channel. While students and those aspiring for jobs expected him to address the issue, the PM skipped talking about them completely. Soon social media trend started with users asking why he did not address the important issues involving lives and career of lakhs across the country. The BJP, which dismissed it as an opposition conspiracy, claims only a fraction of those hitting the ‘dislike’ button are from India, terming it all  a ‘Congress game plan’ to pull down PM’s image.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/even-after-week-more-dislikes-than-likes-on-pm-modis-videos-on-bjp-channel-136811
05-09-2020||New Delhi||MeToo: Disclosure of sexual harassment was for public good, Priya Ramani tells court||Journalist Priya Ramani told a Delhi court on Saturday that her remarks alleging sexual harassment by former Union minister MJ Akbar were “her truth” that she disclosed in “good faith” for the “public good” and, therefore, do not amount to defamation.Ramani submitted this before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja through her lawyer during the final hearing of a private criminal defamation complaint filed by Akbar against her.During the #MeToo movement, Ramani in 2018 accused Akbar of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago when he was a journalist.Akbar resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.Senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing for Ramani, told the court on Saturday that as per law it is not defamation to impute anything which is true concerning any person if it is for the public good.“A true imputation made in the public good is not defamation...  it is not defamation to make an imputation on the character of another when it is made in good faith for the protection of his or other’s interest,” she told the court during a virtual hearing.John further said that “Priya Ramani’s alleged defamatory tweets and the Vogue article were her truth. I am saying this is my (Ramani’s) truth... it is the truth, is in good faith, touching public good”.          The court will further hear the arguments on September 8.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by using adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ against him that harmed his reputation.MJ Akbar has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during the #MeToo campaign against him.Akbar had told the court that the allegations made in an article in the ‘Vogue’ and the subsequent tweets were defamatory on the face of it as the complainant had deposed them to be false and imaginary and that “immediate damage” was caused to him due to the “false” allegations by Priya Ramani.Ramani had earlier told the court that her “disclosure” of alleged sexual harassment by Akbar has come at “a great personal cost” and she had “nothing to gain” from it.She had said her move would empower women to speak up and make them understand their rights at the workplace.Several women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by MJ Akbar him while they were working as journalists under him.He has termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.

05-09-2020||Islamabad||Taliban return to Doha setting stage for Afghan peace talks||Taliban officials say a senior delegation returned early Saturday to Qatar, paving the way for the start of peace talks with the Afghan government that are expected to take place in the tiny Gulf state.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media.The negotiations are the second, critical part to a peace deal the US signed with the Taliban in February in Doha.Washington has ramped up pressure on Afghans on both sides of the conflict to get started with their negotiations to decide what a post-war Afghanistan might look like, how rights of women and minorities would be protected, and how the tens of thousands of armed Taliban and government-allied militias are disarmed and re-integrated.The US Security Adviser Robert O'Brien had a long call with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani last week. American officials have also pressed neighbouring Pakistan to get the Taliban to the table.Relentless delays over the exchange of prisoners —5,000 held by the Afghan government and 1,000 by the Taliban — have hindered efforts to get intra-Afghan talks started.In late August, a delegation led by the Taliban's political office head and the chief negotiator of the February deal with the United States, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar came to Pakistan.While little was revealed about the details of his meetings with Pakistani officials, it is believed he was pressed to get started with intra-Afghan talks.With many of the Taliban leadership council living in Pakistan, Islamabad has been pressed by Washington to use its influence to push negotiations forward.Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has repeatedly said he wants peace talks started and that a military solution for Afghanistan is an impossibility.Pakistani officials reportedly met a second time with Baradar on Friday before his return to Doha again pressing for a swift start to Afghan peace talks, it is believed.US and Afghan officials have both said they want to see a reduction in violence in the conflict going into talks with the Taliban, but the militant group maintains that a cease-fire would only be on the agenda once talks begin.Washington's February agreement with the Taliban was reached to allow the exit of American troops after nearly 20 years at war in keeping with a promise President Donald Trump made during the 2016 US election campaign.The withdrawal, which has already begun, is not dependent on the success of the Afghan negotiations but rather on commitments made by the Taliban to fight terrorist groups and ensure Afghanistan cannot be used to attack America or its allies. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taliban-return-to-doha-setting-stage-for-afghan-peace-talks-136807

05-09-2020||Aurangabad||‘Neighbour Katta’ enables Maharashtra hamlet kids study amid lockdown||Amid the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown, teachers at a hamlet in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad district have devised a method of distance learning to make the local school children study the syllabus and do the homework by following social distancing.Teachers of a Zilla Parishad-run primary school in Dattawadi, a settlement of 165 people located near the world- famous Ajanta caves, have named this initiative as ‘Neighbour Katta’.Katta in Marathi means a place where people meet and talk informally.Under the initiative, the teachers send the list of curricular exercises on the mobile phones of the students’ parents. And the children have to complete the given tasks daily during the specified school hours by coming together in small groups by maintaining social distancing.Each group comprises children of different classes living in the vicinity, so that seniors can guide the juniors.The photos of the completed homework are then sent in a WhatasApp group to the teachers, who accordingly ask the students to make corrections.This activity has been going on since April this year.School headmaster Bapu Bawiskar said, “There are only 19 students in our primary school. After the school was shut due to the lockdown, we decided to form this ‘Neighbour Katta’. Its implementation started on April 9”.“We formed groups of around three children of different classes. We send a list of homework through SMS on the phones of their parents as most of them do not have smartphones,” he said.“We have also formed a WhatsApp group of some parents. We get the clicks of the homework done by students in that group. As a teacher, I check their work. Out of the four hours of school held daily this way, two-and-half hours are dedicated to the study part,” he said.The rest of the school time is reserved for activities like jumping, running, learning or making different sounds to make their study exciting, he said.“There is 100 per cent attendance,” he said, adding that they have completed around 75 per cent of the syllabus of the first semester.Block education officer of Aurangabad Zilla Parishad Vijay Dutonde said, “This concept of online education has helped children in continuing their education by maintaining social distancing”.Bawiskar claimed that the idea of ‘Neighbor Katta’ has found a place in the 30 most inspiring ideas of change 2020 organised by the Design for Change (DFC) and United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF).

05-09-2020||Moscow||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh leaves Russia for Iran||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday left Moscow for Iran where he will meet his Iranian counterpart and discuss bilateral defence ties, a day after he urged the Persian Gulf countries to resolve their differences through dialogue based on mutual respect.Singh was in Moscow on a three-day visit to Russia to attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) defence ministers. He also held bilateral talks with his counterparts from Russia, China and the Central Asian countries."Leaving Moscow for Tehran. I shall be meeting the Defence Minister of Iran, Brigadier General Amir Hatami," Singh said in a tweet.India on Friday said that it was “deeply concerned” about the situation in the Persian Gulf and called upon the countries in the region to resolve their differences by dialogue based on mutual respect.A series of incidents in the Persian Gulf involving Iran, the US and the UAE in recent weeks have flared up tension in the region.“We are deeply concerned about the situation in the Persian Gulf,” Singh said in his address at a meeting of the SCO here."We call upon countries in the region - all of which are dear and friendly to India, to resolve differences by dialogue based on mutual respect, sovereignty and non interference in internal affairs of each other," he said in his address at the combined meeting of defence ministers of the SCO, Collective Security Treaty Organisation and Commonwealth of Independent States member states.Last month, Iranian navy briefly seized control of a Liberian-flagged oil tanker in what the US said were international waters near the Strait of Hormuz, which links the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman to the south and the Arabian Sea beyond.Iran has threatened to disrupt oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz if the United States tries to strangle its economy.The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations which accounts for almost 44 per cent of the world population stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea.The aim of the SCO is to maintain peace, stability and security of the region.Iran has observer status in the SCO, which was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the Presidents of Russia, China, Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.India and Pakistan were admitted as observers of the grouping in 2005. Both the countries were admitted as full members of the bloc in 2017. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-leaves-russia-for-iran-136800

Few months earlier, a similar incident happened. A befitting reply must be given to #PLA and #CCPChina”, Ering tweeted while marking the tweet to @PMOIndia.SHOCKING NEWS: Five people from Upper Subansiri district of our state Arunachal Pradesh have reportedly been ‘abducted’ by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).Few months earlier,a similar incident happened. A befitting reply must be given to #PLA and #CCPChina. @PMOIndia https://t.co/8gRdGsQfId pic.twitter.com/KbDMJ3bUi2  The youths, residents of Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh, were allegedly caught by the PLA soldiers from the jungle near Nacho. The youths apparently went inside the jungle to carry loads for the Army as hired porters. After their job was over, they were out fishing when the PLA picked them up.The missing villagers have been identified as Toch Singkam, Prasat Ringling, Dongtu Ebiya, Tanu Baker and Ngaru Diri. They were allegedly picked up on September 3.The area where the incident took place is very remote and normally it is not possible for any news to travel outside so fast. Only the Army has the requisite communication network for passing on the news outside. “But the Army is keeping absolutely mum. Guess they have reason for keeping quiet,” Ering said.The Congress leader said he spoke to the Deputy Commissioner Kanto Danggen in the morning following which personnel were despatched to the youths’ villages to collect information.The Congress MLA said the incident showcased yet another instance of Chinese forays inside India. “Ordinarily the Chinese would not patrol the area. But lately they have been frequently making incursions – be it Changlang or Dibang Valley or Kibithu,” Ering said.The Congress leader said when an Arunachalese youth was similarly taken away by the Chinese earlier this year, Delhi swung into action and release of the youth could be secured.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinas-pla-accused-of-abducting-five-youths-from-arunachal-136789
05-09-2020||New Delhi||Congress urges PM, Defence Minister to take nation into confidence on India-China border row||The Congress on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to take the nation into confidence on talks with China on the border row in Ladakh, saying people want to know about the outcomes of the repeated conversations with the Chinese side.The Opposition party’s demand comes a day after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his Chinese counterpart General Wei Fenghe held an over two-hour-long meeting in Moscow with a focus on easing escalating border tension in eastern Ladakh.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said it was “Rajdharma” of the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister to take the nation into confidence on the important issue.Listing the various levels of talks held with the Chinese from the Foreign Ministers-level and corps commanders-level to the Defence Ministers’ discussions, Surjewala asked what was the outcome of these talks.“What is the conversation about, what is happening? Will Prime Minister Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh take the country into confidence?” he asked.Surjewala also referred to Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla’s remarks that it was an “unprecedented” situation at the India-China border and “we’ve never had this sort of a situation since 1962”, to underline the seriousness of the issue.Modi Govt repeatedly talks to China-:EAM level - 1 time,NSA level - 2 times,Our Ambassador to China - 2 times,WMCC level - 4 times,Core Commander level - 5 times,Defense Minister level talks.What’s the outcome of these talks?When will PM show “लाल आँख” to #China? pic.twitter.com/9AZc0IwiEd  “The important part is what is the outcome of the repeated conversations with the Chinese counterparts by our government.... How will we ensure that Chinese transgressions are defeated?” Surjewala said in a video posted on his Twitter account.He said people want answers to questions such as how the Chinese will be repulsed to “reclaim our motherland”.“We hope Prime Minister Modi and the Defence Minister will come forward and take the nation into confidence. That is the true Rajdharma. We will await an answer,” he said.Later, at an online briefing, Congress leader Rajeev Shukla said: “We hope that the issue can be resolved through talks.”He, however, demanded that the government should give a clear picture of the situation.“Conflicting statements coming from the government is a matter of worry for us,” he added.The tension between the two sides had escalated manifold after the violent clashes in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.

05-09-2020||Mumbai||Producers Guild slam media for coverage of Bollywood, say ‘decency’ more important than ratings||The Producers Guild of India on Friday called out the media for "peddling" what it termed clickbait journalism following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and trying to paint Bollywood as a murky den of substance abuse and criminality.In a statement issued on social media, the Guild, headed by producer Siddharth Roy Kapur, also asked the media to stop fanning the flames and said common human decency is more important than advertising revenues and ratings.This is the first time that Bollywood's powerful producer's body, which has 136 members including biggies like Aditya Chopra, Aamir Khan, Karan Johar, Shah Rukh Khan and Vishal Bhardwaj, has formally issued a statement on the media coverage of the film industry, the intense trolling that actors are subjected to and the outsider vs insider debate.In its statement, the Guild defended the industry against criticism that it was a terrible place for outsiders to aspire to, a debate that has not just intensified but also polarised Bollywood since 34-year-old Rajput was found dead in his home on June 14 this year.This is to let all aspirants to the film industry know that they should not be misled by the clickbait journalism currently being peddled to advance the sensationalized narrative that the film industry is a terrible place to aspire to work in, the representative body of the Hindi film producers said.These are difficult times for our country and the world, so rather than venting our fears and frustrations on each other with vile and vicious trolling... it is more important than ever to come together instead of tearing each other apart, it said.The media, it added, must look in the mirror and stop fanning the flames. There are some things more important than advertising revenues and rating things like common human decency. Let's show we still have some, the scathing statement read.The Guild also criticised the media for trying to paint Bollywood as a murky den of substance abuse and criminality even as actor Kangana Ranaut asked top actors to submit to a blood test to prove they were not on drugs.The last few months, it said, have seen relentless attacks on the reputation of the Indian film industry across all media.The tragic death of a promising young star has been used by some as a tool to defame and slander the film industry and its members, Guild said.A picture has been painted of the industry as a terrible place for outsiders to aspire to; a place that treats those who dare to enter it with contempt and derision... This narrative is salacious enough for the media to exploit to great effect in order to boost its ratings, readership and page views. But it is not the truth, it added.Like any other sector, the Guild said, the film industry also had its imperfections and works towards weeding out unsavoury elements or improper practices holding it back but to paint an entire industry with the same brush is a gross misrepresentation of reality.Criticising the relentless trolling that members of the industry from both sides of the debate have faced, the Guild said women have been subjected to rape and death threats.This is unacceptable and must stop now.Pointing out that the cinema industry is a place that employs hundreds of thousands of people and works as the soft power for India while bringing honour and glory to the nation", the Guild said the industry has generously contributed to national causes in times of need by offering its resources, name, recognition, time and funds.It said it was not negating the personal experiences of hardships, struggles and disappointments of people, but these were no different from the challenges that new entrants face in any field they are not born into, be it politics, law, business, medicine or media.However, a concerted effort has been made to single out the film industry as one that specifically inhibits and prohibits new talent from the outside from thriving.This could not be further from the truth, the statement read, citing the example of many outside talents flourishing across different departments of films.While admitting that being born in the industry afforded the privilege of access and a first break, the film body said success ultimately depends on one's talent.This is a place that ultimately rewards your talent, work ethic and the ability to connect with an audience regardless of your religion, gender, caste or economic strata, the statement, which ended with a two-word comment—in solidarity.The statement found a wide echo on social media. Using the hashtag of InSolidarity, filmmakers and actors such as Vikramaditya Motwane, Farhan Akhtar, Richa Chadha, Reema Kagti, Riteish Deshmukh, Nikkhil Advani, Rakyesh Omprakash Mehra and others retweeted the statement.

05-09-2020||New Delhi||Stung by border reverses, China accuses India of playing Tibet card||A rattled China on the defensive due to the military setbacks on the border has now accused India of playing the Tibet card.Chinese outlet, Global Times aligned with the ruling Communist Party reported: “While for India, colluding with the exiled Tibetan and playing the Tibet card is only shooting its own foot, as China’s economic power and military strength are much greater than India’s,” an analyst said.In a sense, China has dared with its economic and military power and tried to send India a message on the issue of “collusion with exiled Tibetan” leadership.Also read: 3 Chinese nationals take a wrong turn, reach Sikkim; Indian Army rescues them“The latest border confrontation between China and India has brought under spotlight an Indian force unit, composed of the exiled Tibetans, who some Indian media believe formed an ‘elite unit’ and played an ‘important role’ in the latest standoff triggered by India’s provocative actions,” Global Times said in a report.“However, according to the Chinese analysts, this so-called Special Frontier Force (SFF), numbered at most 1,000, was far from being “elite” and was only used by Indian army as cannon fodder in the border clash,” the report said.As per the report, Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times that the Indian Army deployed the unit of exiled Tibetans to conduct the pre-emptive actions, but according to the Indian media, the action resulted in one death and injuries to another commander, which fully reflects Indian forces’ insufficient preparations.“One death and injuries to another commander in this non-war military action showed that the SFF was not that ‘special’, and far from being elite. They were only used by the Indian Army as cannon fodder,” Qian said.The SFF was first formed with the support of the US in the 1960s as the exiled Tibetans had high-altitude combat capabilities. They were later used by India to spy on the Chinese military, according to Qian.“At present, the SFF’s importance has declined significantly in the Indian Army and it no longer plays an important role. The number of the unit has also dramatically reduced, and at present, the unit has at most 1,000 offspring of the exiled Tibetans,” he said.“The Indian Army does not trust foreign soldiers, thus most of the ethnic Tibetans had very low status in the military. Becoming a member of the unit was only their means to make a living,” Qian said, as per Global Times.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said: “We firmly oppose any country providing convenience in any form for the ‘Tibet secessionist’ forces’ separatist activities.”As per Global Times, analysts said Tibetan “government-in-exile” has faded into obscurity and cannot make any waves internationally. It only used the China-India border confrontations as an opportunity to get a little bit of attention.

Justice Srivastava has served at the Allahabad High Court while Justice Teji has served with the Delhi High Court.The administrative members include two former top officers, each from the Army and the Navy, and one from the Air Force.

05-09-2020||New Delhi||Is astrology important for a matrimonial relationship?||Matrimony, the holiest of all alliances, in all cultures but especially in the Indian context. India's customs and traditions lay a great emphasis on whether the stars align for your upcoming nuptials.While it is widely believed that marriages are made in heaven, they idea is that they need to go through a number of processes on earth.Astrology plays a major role when finalising a matrimonial alliance. In fact it is believed that astrology is very important for the success of any relationship. It is a very normal practice in our country for parents/families to match horoscopes of prospective brides and grooms before going ahead with any step or process related to marriage.Whenever a matrimonial alliance is being fixed, it is imperative to have a thorough study of horoscopes and stars.There are other ways to do the same, such as face reading and reading body vibrations. All these aim at determining accurately the different 'doshas' or planetary defects that might exist in a prospective relationship.Some of the most common 'doshas' are 'Khuja dosha' - popularly referred to as 'Mangal dosha', 'Rahu dosha' and 'Sarpa dosha'. Apart from these, there are a few other doshas related to the yog of two individuals and other aspects related to horoscope.The remedies of each of these planetary defects are determined on the basis of 'Gochara Phala', following which different pujas and rituals are conducted to ensure that a couple goes into the institution of marriage peacefully and amicably.Apart from this, a study is also conducted of the different 'Guna' (virtues) of prospective bride and groom. Out of 36 'Gunas', at least 18 must match for a healthy and happy marriage. However, this too can be taken care of through a few pujas and rituals.Besides, astrology or horoscope matching also plays a crucial role in giving a heads up and preparing a couple for the challenges that they might come across in their married life.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/is-astrology-important-for-a-matrimonial-relationship-136751

It is called ‘Testing on demand’, which for all practical purposes does away with prescription by a registered medical practitioner although state governments have the freedom to decide on simplified modalities,” the government said on Saturday.The new section ‘Testing on demand (state governments to decide simplified modalities)’ will cover all individuals undertaking travel to countries or Indian states mandating a negative COVID-19 test at the point of entry and all individuals who wish to get themselves tested.Also read: ICMR issues advisory allowing ‘testing on demand’ for COVID-19The advisory also includes testing of asymptomatic people for the first time as a proof is now growing on asymptomatic carriers of the SARS-Cov2 virus.The idea is to track the hidden infection as daily new cases cross 80,000 on an average.“There has been an unprecedented upsurge in India’s daily testing capacities. For two successive days, more than 11.7 lakh tests have been conducted per day. A total of 4 crore and 77 lakh tests have been done so far across the country. There are now 1,647 testing laboratories operational which cover all states/UTs. It is in this background that the Health Ministry has issued the updated testing advisory,” said the government.On recommendations of the National Task Force on COVID-19, the new advisory has further simplified the testing process and given more freedom and flexibilities to the state authorities to facilitate enhanced ease of testing for the people. For the first time, along with more simplified modalities, the updated guidelines provide for ‘On-demand’ testing in order to ensure higher levels of testing.The advisory elaborates on the choice of tests (in order of priority) in various given settings.In containment zones, the following will have to be tested—all symptomatic (influenza-like illness symptoms) cases, including health care workers and frontline workers; all asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts (in family and workplace, elderly over 65, immune-compromised, those with co-morbidities) of a laboratory-confirmed case to be tested once between day 5 and day 10 of coming into contact; all asymptomatic high-risk individuals (elderly over 65, those with co-morbidities) in containment zones.In non-containment areas, tests should be done on all symptomatic (ILI symptoms) individuals with a history of international travel in the last 14 days; all symptomatic (ILI symptoms contacts of a laboratory-confirmed case; all symptomatic (ILI symptoms) health care workers and frontline workers involved in containment and mitigation activities; all symptomatic ILI cases among returnees and migrants within 7 days of illness; all asymptomatic high-risk contacts (contacts in family and workplace, elderly over 65, and those with co-morbidities.In hospital settings, COVID test is recommended for all patients of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI), all symptomatic (ILI symptoms) patients presenting in a health care setting, all asymptomatic high-risk patients who are hospitalised or seeking immediate hospitalisation such as immune-compromised individuals, patients diagnosed with malignant disease, transplant patients, patients with chronic co-morbidities, elderly over 65; asymptomatic patients undergoing surgical and non-surgical invasive procedures (not to be tested more than once a week during hospital stay), all pregnant women in/near labour who are hospitalised for delivery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/country-allows-on-demand-covid-testing-what-does-it-mean-136749

The Kerala Police had registered a case of criminal trespass and theft of critical electronic components installed on-board the indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC) following a complaint by the Cochin Shipyard authorities.The NIA took over the probe on September 26, 2019 following national security concerns since sensitive information was stored on these hard disks.The spokesperson said that after meticulous, extensive and scientific investigation spread over many states in a period of nine months, NIA zeroed in on Singh, a resident of Bihar's Munger and Ram, a resident of Hanumangarh in Rajasthan."After sustained interrogation, they confessed to the crime," the official said.An investigation by the NIA has revealed that Singh and Ram were engaged as contract employees for painting work aboard the IAC between February and September, 2019."While working aboard the IAC, they had observed the computer systems functioning on the warship under construction and conspired, since May, 2019, to commit theft of the computer hardware components, for monetary gain," the official said.The official said that consequently, between the second week of July and first week of September 2019, Singh and Ram trespassed into the locations aboard the IAC, where the critical computer resources were installed and committed theft of critical computer hardware.This included Processors, RAMs and SSDs with data, knowing that the same pertains to the security of the nation and hence is restricted. During September 2019 the accused had sold one stolen Processor for monetary gain, before the theft was detected and the case registered.After the theft, in late-September 2019, both left Ernakulam for their native places, along with the remaining stolen property, that was recovered after their arrest by NIA on June 10 this year.INS Vikrant is the first indigenous aircraft carrier of the Indian Navy. The work on the ship's design began in 1999, and the keel was laid in February 2009. As of 2019, the ship is expected to start sea trials in February 2021 and enter active service as early as 2023. The project cost has neared Rs 20,000 crore.With the completion of INS Vikrant, India will join the ranks of the US, the UK, Russia, France and China in the construction of aircraft carriers.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-files-chargesheet-against-2-for-stealing-hard-disk-from-ins-vikrant-136741

The two delegations of India and China had met at the invite of China on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting.Also read:Three Chinese nationals take a wrong turn, reach Sikkim; Indian Army rescues themStung by borders reverses, China accuses India of playing Tibet cardCongress urges PM, Defence Minister to take nation into confidence on India-China border rowA statement released by the Indian Defence Ministry on Saturday said: “The two sides should resolve the ongoing situation and the outstanding issues in the border areas peacefully through dialogue.”The Chinese Defence Minister conveyed that the Chinese side, too, desired to resolve the issues peacefully.The two Ministers had frank and in-depth discussions about the developments in the India-China border areas as well as on the India-China relations.“The two sides should focus on the overall situation of India-China relations and work together to de-escalate the situation as soon as possible and maintain peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas,” a statement released by the Defence Ministry said.The Chinese Defence Minister suggested that both sides should maintain communication at all levels, including between the two Ministers.Earlier, the Indian delegation laid emphasis on the actions of the Chinese troops, including amassing of a large number of troops, their aggressive behaviour and attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo were in violation of the bilateral agreements and not in keeping with the understandings reached between the special representatives of the two sides.India’s position on the developments along the LAC, including in the Galwan valley, was conveyed and the aggression shown by the PLA was highlighted. The two sides have been locked in deadly standoff since May.General Wei said both sides should scrupulously implement the consensus reached between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping.“Both countries should continue to solve the issues through dialogue and consultation, strictly follow the various bilateral agreements, strengthen the regulation of frontline troops and not undertake any provocative actions that might escalate the situation,” General Wei added.Maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas was essential for further development of our bilateral relations and the two sides should not allow differences to become disputes, the Indian statement read.Rajnath Singh asked his counterpart to work with the Indian side for a complete disengagement at the earliest from all friction areas, including Pangong Tso.

The recoveries have surged to 31,07,223 on Saturday, according to data collated by the Union Health Ministry.“I had predicted that the total number of infections will reach 55 lakh by September 30.

05-09-2020||New Delhi||COVID snag in bullet train project, may fail to meet 2023 deadline||The Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, which is scheduled to be completed by December 2023, may fail to meet its deadline due to the coronavirus pandemic that has led to delays in opening tenders and land acquisition, officials said.The National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRCL) has already acquired 63 per cent of the land for the project — about 77 per cent land in Gujarat, 80 per cent in Dadar Nagar Haveli and 22 per cent in Maharashtra. Officials said there were still issues in acquiring land in areas like Palghar in Maharashtra and Navsari in Gujarat.Last year, the company had floated nine civil work tenders which could not be opened because of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.“Because of COVID, we had to postpone the opening of a few of the tenders. It is difficult to assess the impact of the pandemic on the project as it is still continuing. We cannot say how the pandemic will affect the project as I don't know how long it will last,” NHSRCL MD Achal Khare said.Officially, the NHSRCL spokesperson maintained that the deadline for the project remained 2023.One of the civil work contracts for the construction of stations, bridges, viaducts, maintenance depots, and tunnels across the network is to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore.Tenders for civil works for 345 km out of 508 km alignment, or 68 per cent of civil works, have already been floated. This includes six MAHSR stations (including one underground station in Mumbai). The works related to utility diversion are progressing well and the construction of Sabarmati passenger hub (a multi-modal hub) in Sabarmati, Gujarat has also started.The hostel building of High Speed Training Institute (which is presently being used for COVID-19 patients) and training tracks in Vadodara are also completed.The 508.17-kilometre long network will pass through three districts in Maharashtra (Mumbai, Thane, and Palghar) and eight districts in Gujarat (Valsad, Navsari, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, Anand, Kheda, and Ahmedabad).Apart from land acquisition, another major cause for the delay could be cost escalation owing to a fall in the rupee against the Japanese yen.While the extent of the cost escalation has yet not been confirmed by the railways, sources said it is estimated that it will rise from the present Rs 1.08 lakh crore to 1.70 lakh crore.The total cost of the project is pegged at Rs 1.08 lakh crore and as per the shareholding pattern, the Government of India is to pay Rs 10,000 crore to the NHSRCL, while the two states involved, Gujarat and Maharashtra, are to pay Rs 5,000 crore each. The rest is to be paid by Japan through a loan at 0.1 per cent interest.One section of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai high-speed rail corridor is likely to be tendered out within three months after nearly 90 per cent of the land acquisition for the project is completed, an official said.Officials said that to complete the project, the NHSRCL has divided the work into 26 packages, each has to provide a minimum of 30 months time for the contractors to finish their work.“So, even if the land acquisition is completed and tenders are opened, the NHSRCL will be unable to finish the work within the deadline. Also, the Japanese who have been allotted land here have not been able to begin any of their works, which is sure to delay the project further,” said the official.

05-09-2020||New Delhi||ICMR issues advisory allowing ‘testing on demand’ for COVID-19||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has issued an advisory on COVID-19 testing strategy, allowing ‘testing on demand’ for individuals but left it to states to modify the approach as per their discretion.It also advised testing on demand for “all individuals undertaking travel to countries or Indian states mandating a negative COVID-19 test at the point of entry”.The ‘Advisory on Strategy for COVID-19 Testing in India’ (version VI), issued on Friday, said the state governments could simplify the modalities to facilitate testing on demand.It also suggested that 100 per cent of people living in containment zones should be tested by rapid antigen tests, particularly in cities where there has been a widespread transmission of the infection.The ICMR also stressed that no emergency procedure (including deliveries) should be delayed for lack of tests and pregnant women should not be referred for a lack of testing facility.Further, the existing recommendations related to testing for COVID-19 have been extended, elaborated and divided into four parts — routine surveillance in containment zones and screening at points of entry, routine surveillance in non-containment areas, hospital settings and testing on demand — and choice of test (RT-PCR, TrueNat or CBNAAT and rapid antigen tests) in order of priority has been listed.Under the category of ‘routine surveillance in containment zones and screening at points of entry’, the advisory recommended testing of all asymptomatic high-risk individuals (people above 65 and those with co-morbidities etc) in the containment zones.Besides, it advised testing all symptomatic (ILI symptoms) cases, including healthcare and frontline workers. All asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts (in family and workplace, people aged 65 and above, those who are immunocompromised or have co-morbidities) of a laboratory-confirmed case are to be tested once between day 5 and day 10 of coming into contact.As far as the choice of the test is concerned, rapid antigen test (RAT) is listed first followed by RT-PCR or TrueNat or CBNAAT as the second option.“Ideally, it is suggested that 100 per cent people living in containment zones should be tested by RAT, particularly in cities where there has been a widespread transmission of infection,” the advisory said.Under the category of ‘routine surveillance in non-containment areas’, the advisory recommended testing all asymptomatic high-risk contacts (contacts in family and workplace, people aged 65 and above, those with co-morbidities) with RAT being the first choice of test in order of priority.Besides, it advised testing all symptomatic (ILI symptoms) individuals with a history of international travel in the past 14 days, all symptomatic (ILI symptoms) contacts of a laboratory-confirmed case, all symptomatic (ILI symptoms) healthcare and frontline workers involved in containment and mitigation activities, and all symptomatic ILI cases among returnees and migrants within seven days of illness, with RT-PCR, TrueNat or CBNAAT being the first choice of test in order of priority.Under the category ‘hospital settings’, the advisory recommended testing all patients of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI), all symptomatic (ILI symptoms) patients presenting in a healthcare setting, asymptomatic high-risk patients who are hospitalised or seeking immediate hospitalisation such as immunocompromised individuals, patients diagnosed with malignant diseases, transplant patients, patients with chronic co-morbidities and people aged 65 and above.It also suggested testing for asymptomatic patients undergoing surgical and non-surgical invasive procedures (not to be tested more than once a week during hospital stay) and all pregnant women in or near labour who are hospitalised for delivery.The ICMR stressed that no emergency procedure (including deliveries) should be delayed for lack of test and pregnant women should not be referred for a lack of testing facility. It added that all arrangements should be made to collect and transfer samples to testing facilities.Mothers who test positive for COVID-19 should be advised to wear a mask and undertake frequent handwashing while handling their baby for 14 days. They should also be advised on breast cleaning before feeding the neonate.These measures are likely to reduce transmission of COVID-19 to their babies, the document said.The advisory also recommended testing all symptomatic neonates presenting with acute respiratory or sepsis-like illness and patients presenting with atypical manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, pulmonary embolism, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, progressive gastrointestinal symptoms, Kawasaki Disease (in paediatric age group) based on the discretion of the treating physician.RT-PCR or TrueNat or CBNAAT should be the first choice for tests in order of priority in hospital settings and RAT should be the second choice.The ICMR stated that a single RT-PCR or TrueNat or CBNAAT or RAT positive test is to be considered confirmatory, without any repeat testing and no re-testing is recommended prior to discharge from a COVID-19 facility after clinical recovery, including for transfer from a COVID area or facility to a non-COVID area or facility.If symptoms develop following a negative RAT test, a repeat RAT or RT-PCR should be done.Home quarantine for 14 days is recommended for all individuals before undergoing elective surgery to minimise chances of infection before the procedure.

05-09-2020||Mumbai||NCB gets Showik Chakraborty's custody; says it has got inkling of drugs penetration in Bollywood||Narcotics Control Bureau, which on Saturday obtained custody of Rhea Chakraborty's brother Showik in the drugs case linked to the probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death, said it has got "inkling" of the narcotics network and penetration in Bollywood.Showik Chakraborty "dealt in drugs with many others", the NCB told a court here as it obtained his custody alongwith that of Rajput's house manager Samuel Miranda till September 9.NCB Deputy Director General of the south-west region, Mutha Ashok Jain, told reporters outside his office that while the agency's mandate is to "look for the big fish" and probe international and inter-state drugs transactions, it will "not shirk its responsibility" now that it is getting information about this alleged drugs nexus."Normally this is not part of our mandate but now that we are getting information... This case has given us an inkling of the network and the extent of the penetration," he said when asked if the agency has evidence on the drugs nexus in Bollywood or Hindi movie industry.The NCB, while seeking remand of one of the accused in this case two days ago, had told the court that it was looking into "the drug citadel in Mumbai, especially Bollywood"."The whole idea of taking custody remand (of Showik and Miranda) is to make people confront each other to clarify their individual role. So, yes we will be asking her (Rhea) to join investigation and may be some other people because we also need to clarity as to who did what," Jain told reporters on Saturday.Showik and Miranda were arrested on Friday night by the NCB under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act after questioning them for 10 hours.The NCB produced them in a court here on Saturday.Seeking their custody, it said Showik needs to be confronted with Rajput's personal staff Dipesh Sawant, and Rhea who is the main accused in the actor's death case.Abdel Basit Parihar, arrested earlier in the drugs case, was in contact with Showik and Miranda, the NCB told the court."Further, some characters are to be verified, who as per the CDR (Call Data Record) analysis, Whatsapp chat and preliminary interrogation are deeply entrenched in the drug trafficking," the agency added.Besides Showik and Miranda, Kaizan Ibrahim, another accused, was also produced before the court. He was remanded in judicial custody as the NCB did not seek his remand.Besides Showik, Miranda and Kaizan, the NCB has arrested Zaid Vilatra (21) and Parihar (23).Various angles surrounding Rajput's death are being probed by the CBI, Enforcement Directorate (ED) and NCB.Rajput was found hanging at his flat in Mumbai's Bandra area on June 14. Actor Rhea Chakraborty, his live-in partner, is accused of abetting his alleged suicide.A CBI team visited Rajput's Bandra flat again on Saturday as part of its investigation into the suicide case.Rajput's cooks Neeraj and Keshav, and his flatmate Siddharth Pithani accompanied the team, an official said.In the last two weeks, the central probe agency had visited the flat at least two times to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the actor's death.Maharashtra Home minister Anil Deshmukh told reporters in Nagpur that the Mumbai police is extending full cooperation to the CBI. The case was earlier being handled by the Mumbai police.

05-09-2020||New Delhi||Healthcare experts call for urgent action to address COVID impact on national nutrition mission||As the country marks ‘Poshan Maah’ this month, healthcare experts have called for urgent action to address the impact of COVID-19 on the national nutrition mission, saying the pandemic might affect the health of children and pregnant women the hardest as they are the most vulnerable to undernutrition.The government is celebrating National Nutrition Month or ‘Poshan Maah’ in September during which several programmes to spread awareness on the issues related to malnutrition in children, pregnant women and lactating mothers will be organised.The experts spoke to PTI and said this was a time when there was an urgency among all stakeholders to join forces. On one hand, food security needs to be ensured and on the other, correct nutrition feeding practices need to be promoted in the community, they said.Adopting system strengthening and social behaviour change strategies together in a sustained effort and investment beyond the Poshan Maah would yield results, they added.Sujeet Ranjan, executive director at the Coalition for Food and Nutrition Security (CFNS), said the spread of COVID-19 had impacted the health, nutrition, livelihoods and wellbeing of India’s most vulnerable populations and it would have a lasting effect on people.“One of the fallouts of the COVID-19 containment measures, including the closure of primary schools and Anganwadi centres, is that children in rural India now have to do without that one guaranteed meal, potentially worsening the child malnutrition problem in India,” he said.Even though the government had ordered state authorities to ensure the provision of take-home rations at the doorstep as well as a cash allowance during the lockdown, efforts to tackle acute malnutrition could still take a hit, he said. However, due to the barriers posed by the COVID crisis, there might be multifaceted repercussions on children, Ranjan added.“We can understand that the possible impact would be on the number of meals per day and hence the quantity of food per meal as well. Ensuring diet diversity at the time of COVID also remains a challenge as the main goal during this health crisis and the lockdown is the availability of basic food first. Therefore, the quality of the diet is also compromised,” he said.He suggested that information technology could be leveraged for ensuring many services related to maternal and child health such as the use of mobile phones for counselling by frontline workers, use of remote health advisory and intervention services for getting all the necessary health information and guidance, strengthening mother and child tracking system, Poshan Helpline number for ensuring healthcare, immunisation services, and regular counselling through nutrition specialists.Khan Amir Maroof, honorary secretary at Maternal Infant and Young Child Nutrition (MIYCN), Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine (IAPSM), said the health of children and pregnant women might be hit the hardest as they are the most vulnerable to undernutrition.“The lack of availability of quantity and quality of food is a matter of concern. Both macro and micronutrient deficiencies will have their own effects. In short term, it will lead to malnutrition in terms of undernutrition (low weight for age), followed by higher chances of suffering from infectious diseases such as diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections,” he said.Maroof said pregnant women were at a higher risk of undernutrition due to the increased nutrition requirement which is not being optimally met during this pandemic.“This effect is intergenerational as the child to-be-born is at high risk of low birth weight or stillbirth. These effects put the family in a vicious loop of disease and undernutrition which is difficult to overcome without external support. For the whole country, this will mean a higher prevalence of malnutrition,” he added.He said strategies to mitigate COVID’s impact on the health of children and pregnant women needed to be tailored to a local context and to the severity of the outbreak.“Food security allowances whose provision exists under the midday meal scheme can be implemented, either by way of direct cash benefit transfer or food vouchers. Vouchers have an added benefit as compared to cash that we can ensure to some degree that it will be used for food only,” Maroof added.Sebanti Ghosh, program director at Alive & Thrive India, said the pandemic had the potential to reverse the hard-earned gains in improving health and nutrition of pregnant women and young children as the pandemic and lockdown have adversely affected the delivery of essential health and nutrition services, resulting in reduced coverage of crucial services such as institutional delivery, immunisation, antenatal care, provision of micronutrient supplies to pregnant women, young children and adolescent girls.“Early detection and treatment of severely acute malnourished children (SAM) must be prioritised and ensured,” she said.Chandrakant Pandav, former head at Centre for Community Medicine at AIIMS, suggested that India could mitigate some of the effects of COVID-19.“India’s nutrition journey is too important to be derailed by a crisis like COVID-19. There must be a clarion call for the nutrition community in India to rally strongly and to give continued attention to malnutrition in all its forms, generate relevant evidence and to support and engage all of society to urgently and adequately address malnutrition in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have come too far to turn back now,” he added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/healthcare-experts-call-for-urgent-action-to-address-covid-impact-on-national-nutrition-mission-136723

05-09-2020||Washington||'Very nasty' situation along India-China border; ready to help ease tension: Trump||Describing the situation along the India-China border as "very nasty”, US President Donald Trump has said that the Chinese are "going at it much more strongly" than a lot of people understand and he would "love to get involved and help" ease the tension.Indian and Chinese troops are engaged in a bitter standoff in multiple places in eastern Ladakh for four months. Tensions flared up again in the region after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of the Pangong lake six days ago when the two sides were engaged in diplomatic and military talks to resolve the border row."While we're at it, we're talking about China and India are going at it pretty good on the border, as you know. It's been very nasty,” Trump told reporters on Friday at a White House news conference in response to a question on Indian-Americans and the US-India relationship.Trump reiterated that he is talking to both India and China about the situation. “And we stand ready to help with respect to China and India. If we can do anything, we would love to get involved and help. And we are talking to both countries about that,” he said.His comments came on a day when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held talks with his Chinese counterpart Gen. Wei Fenghe in Moscow with a focus on easing escalating border tension in eastern Ladakh. They met on the sidelines of a meeting of the defence ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.When asked if China is bullying India, he said that he hoped it is not the case but noted that China is "certainly going at it". “I hope not... But they (China) are certainly going at it. They are going at it much more strongly than a lot of people even understand,” Trump said in response to a question.

05-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhiites who went to Murthal eateries should self-isolate, get tested: Official||People from Delhi who recently visited the two popular eateries in Murthal, whose large number of staff have been found to be COVID-19 positive, should immediately self-isolate and get themselves tested after a couple of days, officials said on Friday.Sixty-five workers at Amrik-Sukhdev dhaba and 10 at Garam Dharam dhaba on the highway had tested positive for novel coronavirus infection, following which both the eateries were sealed on Thursday till further orders, Sonepat’s Deputy Commissioner Shyam Lal Punia said.Both famous eateries are located in Sonepat’s Murthal and are nearly 50 km away from Delhi. On regular days, a large number of people from the national capital visit these joints for ‘parathas’ and other delicacies.A senior official of the Delhi government said the people who went to these outlets by the highway should immediately self-isolate and go for testing after three to four days.“Highway dhabas are dangerous places to go to as of now, as customers can go to any city from that point. So, it’s also a logistical nightmare for the surveillance team,” the official said on the condition of anonymity.“The best is families should not go out as much as possible. This is still a heath emergency and people should not be complacent, and venture out only if really necessary,” he said.Contact tracing would be done by the surveillance team given the constraints in this case, the help of apps might be taken, another official said.“It is very irresponsible on people’s part to go out and enjoy as if everything is normal. They are putting themselves and their family members and others at risk,” he said.Murthal is known for its eateries which dot a stretch on both sides of the Ambala-Delhi national highway. People generally drive in cars in groups to relish the lip-smacking delicacies these dhaba-cum-restaurants are known for.Meanwhile, the Sonepat district administration has launched a massive contact-tracing drive after the 75 workers tested positive for COVID-19, officials said on Friday.The Sonipat Deputy Commissioner said sampling work has been initiated at other eateries also.The DC said in the wake of the pandemic, all eateries had already been directed to maintain a register to record the number of visitors and their contact details.“On the basis of these, we are trying to contact as many as possible who have eaten food at these two dhabas during the past few days,” he said.Sonepat’s Chief Medical Officer Dr J S Punia said the majority of those infected at the Sukhdev dhaba were workers who had recently come from Bihar.Delhi recorded 2,914 fresh COVID-19 cases on Friday, the highest single-day spike here in 69 days, as the tally mounted to over 1.85 lakh, even as a senior official claimed it “wasn’t an alarming surge” and so there was no chance of another lockdown.

Most of these (27) fell vacant when rebel Congress members resigned from the party to join the BJP. The elections had to be deferred in the wake of Covid-19 and monsoon.The poll panel said, “One of the major factors in clubbing them together is the relative ease of movement of central forces and related logistics issues.” “Considering that the Bihar Assembly are also due and required to be completed before November 29, the Commission has decided to conduct all 65 byelections around the same time.
