28-09-2020||New Delhi||Govt launches portal for updates on COVID-19 vaccine development||The Union Health Ministry on Monday launched a web portal that will provide all important information on COVID-19, vaccine development, ongoing clinical trials and progress made in this area locally and globally.The “vaccine web portal” and the “National Clinical Registry for COVID-19” have been developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and was launched by Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, according to a health ministry statement.Vardhan earlier had said a COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be available by the first quarter of 2021.The National Clinical Registry for COVID-19 will collect systematic data on clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory investigations, management protocols, the clinical course of COVID-19, disease spectrum and outcomes of patients.“The data will serve as an invaluable tool for formulating appropriate patient management strategies, predicting disease severity, patient outcomes, etc.,” the ICMR said in a statement.The vaccine portal contains all information regarding Indian efforts towards the development of a vaccine against COVID-19.“Interested people can visit the website on vaccine.icmr.org.in\nvaccine.icmr.org.in to get the latest information on vaccine development,” it said.Vardhan said, “The portal provides useful and important information related to vaccine development, ongoing clinical trials and progress made in this area locally and globally at regular intervals.”“Today, in the times of the coronavirus pandemic, vaccine development is watched very closely. Thus, it becomes important to showcase the status of vaccine development in the country,” he said.On India’s fight against COVID-19, the health minister said the continuously rising recovery rate and progressively falling case fatality rate in the country have proven the success of the COVID-19 containment strategy followed by all states and Union Territories.“From having one laboratory (for COVID-19 testing) to over 1,800 today, we have come a long way in strengthening our capabilities. We have successfully ramped up our testing capacity which has touched 15 lakh daily tests,” he said.Vardhan also lauded the healthcare personnel working selflessly to serve the people “even at a time when resources are limited” due to COVID-19.Apart from the “vaccine web portal” and the “National Clinical Registry for COVID-19”, Vardhan also unveiled a time-line depicting the ICMR’s historical achievements and inaugurated the apex health research body’s mobile stroke unit, the statement said.The timeline of the ICMR depicts its 108-year journey since its inception in 1911 when it was known as Indian Research Fund Association, it said.According to the statement, the time-line captures the policy and programme interventions by the ICMR and its institutes to control diseases, and its pioneering work in the fields of maternal and child health, HIV, cancer and nutrition, among others.Vardhan said, “The ICMR has always been in the forefront of health research in India and is now leading the country in tackling the unprecedented pandemic through scientific rigour and innovation.”“It has contributed immensely towards the nation’s welfare. Through these exhibits, people will take pride in knowing the contributions of the ICMR and the country in the area of medical science,” he said.Launching the mobile stroke unit, Vardhan said it is disheartening to see the susceptibility of people to heart diseases and hypertension, and added that timely treatment can reduce fatality and prevent people from disability.Vardhan, also released the ‘Nutrient Requirements for Indians’ and ‘What India Eats’ report apart from launching a new participatory research initiative to map the nutrition and health status dietary habits of people across the nation.The Nutrient Requirements for Indians, for the first time includes the Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) and also the Tolerable Upper Limits (TUL) of nutrients alongside RDAs.While RDAs are daily dietary nutrient intake levels which would be sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all healthy individuals, EARs are the average daily nutrient intake levels of population.These recommendations are the basis for defining the nutrient levels in policies and programmes.“What India Eats” reports the dietary patterns across the country for the first time, the data has been analysed and projected based on food groups. This report gives details of ‘Regional Dietary Pattern of Indian Population’ and energy and protein sources from different food groups in graphical form,” the statement said.Another key initiative being spearheaded by ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition that was launched by Vardhan was the proposal on ‘Mapping of nutrition and health status’, which is a national level participatory real-time data generation programme.This programme aims to develop a mobile based device used by nutrition researchers at district level nationwide in the present pandemic situation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-launches-portal-for-updates-on-covid-19-vaccine-development-147945

28-09-2020||---||India inks first green strategic partnership with Denmark||New Delhi, September 28.India and Denmark on Monday decided to elevate their bilateral ties to a “green strategic partnership”, the first of its kind, during a virtual summit between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Mette Frederiksen.Niche pollution control solutions being offered by Denmark include those to curb stubble burning.“Danish companies are already talking to Indian companies to take it forward,” said MEA’s Joint Secretary (Central Europe) at a media briefing.India and Denmark have agreed to collaborate in several sectors on the basis of an action plan that will set specific targets for the next few years, the official added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address indicated that Indian expectations from Denmark went well beyond pollution control initiatives and partnerships.He mentioned the extensive reforms in the manufacturing, labour, regulatory and taxation sectors, recalled Denmark’s constant attendance at the Vibrant Gujarat Summit since 2009, and cautioned against the risks of overdependence on a single source.  The PM also spoke of the virtual conferences with India, Japan, Australia and France to diversify supply chains and invited other like-minded democracies to join this endeavour.PM Modi observed that India and Denmark could set up energy parks where a large number of Danish companies are present.India had recently intensified its conversation with Denmark and the groundwork for this summit was laid during talks between the Foreign Ministers of the two countries in January, followed up with more online interactions.Besides tapping Denmark for technology and manufacturing, another reason for India’s attempt to build closer ties is strategic. Denmark is a leading player in the group of five Nordic countries – Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland – which, like Russia are interested in the opportunities in the Arctic Sea.Besides, Denmark is the only Nordic country that has made a maritime foray in the Straits of Hormuz (SoH) along with seven other countries with active assistance from the UAE with whom India enjoys close ties.Called European Maritime Awareness in the SoH (EMASOH), it intends to deploy surveillance ships and drones in the Gulf and Arabian Sea.The EMASOH also intends to get involved in the politics of the region by encouraging de-escalation and promoting regional dialogue.Denmark had recently welcomed the normalisation of ties between the UAE and Israel.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-inks-first-green-strategic-partnership-with-denmark-147938
28-09-2020||Aditi Tandon||Negate farm Bills with your own laws: Sonia to Cong-ruled states||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 28A day after President Ram Nath Kovind granted his assent to the controversial farm Bills, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday asked states ruled by her party to negate the agriculture-related Central laws by passing their own legislations.“Congress president has advised the Congress-ruled states to explore the possibilities to pass laws in their respective states under Article 254(2) of the constitution which allows the state legislatures to pass a law to negate the Anti-Agriculture Central laws encroaching upon State’s jurisdiction under the Constitution,” AICC general secretary organisation KC Venugopal said.Sonia Gandhi has told the states ruled by Congress that enacting their own legislations would enable bypassing the unacceptable anti-farmers’ provisions in the three “draconian agricultural laws”, including the abolition of MSP and disruption of APMCs in Congress-ruled states.She said this would also alleviate the farmers from the grave injustice done by the NDA government and the BJP.Describing the logic behind the move Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said, “As Finance Minister Arun Jaitley got states to resort to Article 254(2) of the Constitution to override the provisions of the 2013 Land Acquisition law, a law he had fully supported as Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha. So States should now follow the same advice to undo the damage caused by the farm bills that have become Acts.”Ramesh quoted the relevant provision of the Constitution under which the late FM asked states to override the provisions of the 2013 land acquisition bill.“Where a law made by the legislature of a state with respect to one of the matters enumerated it in the concurrent list contains any provisions repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to that matter, then, the law so made by the legislature of such state shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail in that state. Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter, including a law adding to, amending, wearing or repealing the law show made by the state legislature,” Ramesh said quoting the Constitution.The Congress feels it has solid legal ground to go against farm bills as agriculture, marketing and pricing are listed as state subjects in the seventh schedule of the Constitution which deals exclusively with state rights.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/negate-farm-bills-with-your-own-laws-sonia-to-cong-ruled-states-147936
28-09-2020||New Delhi||Land acquisition matter: Some clarity needed on larger bench verdict: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday said some clarity was required on a judgement delivered by its five-judge constitution bench on the issue of land acquisition and payment of fair compensation as it creates some confusion.A bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian observed that there were “some questions” which were required to be discussed.“There are some questions in my mind. I want to discuss it with my brothers (judges on the bench). The constitution bench judgement, I think, creates a confusion,” said the CJI.The bench observed: “Suppose, there is a property of which the government has not taken possession and has not paid compensation, then the acquisition will lapse.”“If the government has taken over possession but not paid compensation, the five-judges says the acquisition will not lapse. For how long, is the question,” the bench said, adding, “For how long if the government does not pay compensation, the acquisition will continue?” it said.A five-judge bench of the Apex Court had on March 6 this year delivered a verdict and held that disputes over land acquisition and payment of fair compensation to owners cannot be re-opened under the 2013 Act if the legal processes have been completed before January 1, 2014.The constitution bench had interpreted section 24 of the ‘Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013’ as there were two conflicting verdicts by different benches of the apex court on the issue.Section 24 of the Act deals with situations under which a land acquisition proceedings shall deem to have been lapsed.The provision said that if no award of compensation had been decided in a land acquisition case by January 1, 2014, then the provisions of 2013 Act would apply in determining the compensation for acquisition of land.“We will discuss it and take up the matter. We have certain questions. There is something which we want to be clear about,” the bench said, adding that it would hear the matter after two weeks.In its verdict, the constitution bench had said that under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) of the Act, if the award was not made as on January 1, 2014, there was no lapse of proceedings and compensation had to be determined under the provisions of 2013 law.It had said the deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under section 24(2) of the 2013 Act takes place where due to inaction of authorities for five years or more prior to commencement of the law, the possession of land has not been taken nor compensation has been paid.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench that these matters, which concerned section 24 of the Act, were kept pending as the issue was referred to the constitution bench.He said several such matters were pending in the Apex Court as well as different high courts.“The judgement of the constitution bench would operate differently based on the facts of each case,” Mehta told the bench.

28-09-2020||Mumbai||‘Something fishy’ going on in BMC over demolitions, says Bombay HC||The Bombay High Court on Monday said there was “something fishy” going on in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) when it came to the demolition of alleged illegal constructions. The court was hearing a writ petition filed by actor Kangana Ranaut.A bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla said in Ranaut’s case, the civic body did not follow its own practice of attaching photos of alleged illegal constructions with its stop-work notices and waiting for some days before carrying out demolitions.The HC made the remarks while hearing the writ petition filed by Ranaut challenging the demolition of a part of her bungalow in Pali Hill in suburban Bandra by the BMC on September 9.The judges were questioning the BMC’s H Ward officer, Bhagyawant Late, a respondent in the writ petition under whose jurisdiction Ranaut’s property falls.During the questioning, the bench noted that in cases of similar illegalities in buildings close to Ranaut’s, the BMC had waited for several days to carry out the demolition.Besides, in most other cases, it had attached photos of the alleged illegal constructions with its stop-work notices served to building owners, and in such cases, it did not often take the police along for demolition, it said.However, when it came to Ranaut’s case, the BMC did not have any photos with digital date and time stamps of the alleged illegalities and the demolition had been carried out in the presence of a huge police force just 24 hours after the stop-work notice was served to the actor, the bench noted.The judges noted that in its reply, the BMC had claimed to have demolished a similar case of illegality on September 8. But when the bench asked Late for photos or records of the demolition, the latter said no such photos or documents existed.The ward officer also said the BMC team had not taken the police along for the September 8 demolition. This irked the bench.“Mr Sakare (BMC’s standing counsel here), there is something absolutely fishy! There are no photos for the 8th. How come in the system, this demolition is not shown on 8 (September)? It is only when we asked for the file it is prepared. Is there any answer?” it said.The bench also asked why the BMC had taken a huge police force along on September 9 to demolish Ranaut’s bungalow. To this Late said Ranaut’s case was a “critical” one.“What is the definition of critical cases? In cases of celebrities, it becomes a critical case?” the bench asked.Ranaut’s counsel Dr Birendra Saraf raised questions over the BMC’s action at the actor’s bungalow.Saraf argued that the manner in which the entire BMC team swooped in on September 7 in issuing the stop-work notice and subsequently rejecting Ranaut’s reply to it and carrying out the demolition, the discrepancy in documents, among others, showed the action was vitiated by malice.Saraf pointed out that the demolition was followed by a news item (on September 10) in ‘Saamana’, where Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut is executive editor, that carried a headline showing as it were some rejoicing news.Saraf urged the court to ensure that the damage to Ranaut’s property was assessed by a qualified person and then to decide on a fair compensation amount for the same.In her plea, Ranaut has sought Rs 2 crore as damages from the BMC and its officials.In the course of the day-long hearing, Saraf also played a clip of a news interview where Raut had said “Ranaut should be taught a lesson”.The Sena MP is also a respondent in the writ petition.Raut’s counsel Pradeep Thorat, though, argued that in the entire interview, the Sena leader had not referred to Ranaut by name.“If it is your stand that, you (in the audio) have not called the petitioner a ‘haramkhor’, we will record it. Should we record your statement?” the court said, referring to an alleged comment Raut made in the interview.“Don’t run around the bushes... Have guts to say (before the court) what you have tweeted or told a news channel, the court said to both Raut and Ranaut’s counsels,” the Bench said.The BMC, meanwhile, denied all allegations of malice made by Ranaut.Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, who appeared for the BMC, urged the HC to dismiss the plea, or to hear Ranaut through a suit, and not a writ petition, saying that in a suit, Ranaut would have to stand in the box (witness box) and clarify all facts.Let this be dealt with in a suit. Let her get into a box and let her establish these facts. Alternatively, this is a petition that deserves to be dismissed.“It lacks absolute candour. This petition is being portrayed as an individual being harassed because of her public utterances against a government and party in power,” Chinoy said.The reality was slightly different. This is a case where the petitioner has unlawfully carried out substantial illegal alterations, he said.Referring to the courts previous remark on the swiftness shown by the BMC in Ranaut’s case, Chinoy said, I agree there was a quicker response in this case.“But that is not an answer (Ranaut’s plea). You cannot carry out illegal construction.”The court will hear Raut’s submissions on Tuesday.

28-09-2020||Allahabad/Mathura||Seers’ organisation to meet on 'liberating' Krishna Janmasthan in Mathura||A major organisation of seers will meet in Vrindavan on October 15 to decide whether it should become a party to the legal move seeking the removal of a mosque near the birthplace of Lord Krishna in Mathura.Last week, a group of people moved a Mathura court over the 17th century Shahi Idgah mosque they claim was built at the birthplace of Krishna, within the 13-acre premises of the Katra Keshav Dev temple.Their petition filed in the court of Senior Civil Judge Chhaya Sharma also demanded the annulment of a 1968 Mathura court ruling, ratifying a land deal reached between the Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan and Shahi Idgah Management Committee.The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad office bearers will now visit the Krishna Janmasthan to take stock of the situation, its president Narendra Giri told PTI.He said the organisation will make a decision at its Vrindavan meeting on becoming a party to the lawsuit.In a reference to the mosques located near Hindu temples, he said the ‘parishad’ has been advocating the “liberation” of the Krishna Janmasthan and the Kashi Viswanath temple in Varanasi.However, another body of priests had on Sunday condemned the filing of the petition for the removal of the Shahi Idgah mosque.The Akhil Bharatiya Tirth Purohit Mahasabha president Mahesh Pathak said “some outsiders” are trying to disturb the peace in Mathura by raising a frivolous temple-mosque issue.“There is no temple-mosque dispute in Mathura at Srikrishna Janmasthan after a compromise between both the parties in the 20th century,” he said.The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 froze the status of religious places as it existed at the time of Independence. The Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid structure was exempted from the law's purview.

28-09-2020||New Delhi||678 cases under investigation by CBI, 25 for more than five years: CVC||As many as 678 cases are under investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), 25 of them for more than five years, as on December 31, 2019, a latest report by the Central Vigilance Commission has said.The CBI is normally required to complete investigation of a registered case within one year.“Completion of investigation would imply filing of charge sheets in courts wherever warranted, after receipt of sanction from the competent authority. The Commission has observed that there have been some delays in completing investigations in certain cases,” the CVC’s annual report for 2019 said.The report was tabled in Parliament in the recently-concluded monsoon session and uploaded by the CVC on its website on Sunday.The CVC said out of the total 678 cases under investigation, 268 were pending for less than one year, 177 for more than one year but less than two years, 122 for more than two years but less than three years, 86 for over three years but less than five years and 25 for over five years.The CVC, which exercises superintendence over CBI probe in corruption cases, cited some of the reasons for the pendency including “delay in investigation due to work overload”, “inadequacy of manpower” and “delay in obtaining responses to Letters Rogatory (LRs)” among others.It highlighted “delay in receipt of prosecution sanction from competent authorities, etc.”,  “delay in supply of departmental records by the concerned department”,  “time taken in scrutiny of voluminous records, specially in economic offences and bank fraud cases” and “time spent in locating and examining witnesses living in distant places” as the other reasons for the pendency.The Commission also expressed concerns about the slow progress of disposal of the large number of cases pending trial in different courts for long periods, at times for over twenty years.Of the total 6,226 corruption cases pending trials, 182 were pending for more than 20 years, 1,599 for more than ten years and upto 20 years, 1,883 for over five years and upto ten years, 1,177 for over three years and upto five years and 1,385 for less than three years, as on December 31, 2019, the report said.“Such inordinate delays in investigation defeat the very purpose of efficient vigilance administration and are an impediment to the fight against corruption. The Commission has been emphasising that effective measures are required to be taken to increase the disposal of pending Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act cases under trial/appeals/revisions in order to effectively combat corruption,” it said.The pendency of these cases has been brought to the notice of the authorities concerned with a request for such appropriate action as are possible to expedite the finalisation of such cases, the CVC said.It said some of the reasons for delay in trials are limited number of hearings, “non-availability of witnesses”, “dilatory tactics adopted by the accused by way of filing applications for transfer of cases from one court to another court challenging the legality of investigation by CBI and court stay, etc.” and “inadequate strength of prosecution staff due to vacancies”.There were 11,380 appeals and revisions pending in PC Act cases in various courts as on December 31, 2019. As many as 338 such appeals and revisions were pending in the Supreme Court, 11,031 in High Court, eight in Session Court and three in Additional Session Court, the CVC’s annual report said.Of these 11,380 appeals and revisions, 151 were pending for more than 20 years, 377 for more than 15 years but less than 20 years, 1,485 for over ten years but less than 15 years, 3,231 for over five years but less than ten years, 2,540 for more than two years but less than five years and 3,596 for less than two years, it said.The CVC said 74 departmental cases were pending at various stages against CBI personnel.“The Commission regularly reviews cases pending against CBI officers. Pendency of cases against CBI officers reflects on the reputation and image of the country’s premier investigation agency,” it said.As on December 31, 2019, 47 departmental cases against Group A officers and 27 cases against Group B and C officials of the CBI were pending at various stages, the report said, adding that 37 of these cases were pending for more than four years. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/678-cases-under-investigation-by-cbi-25-for-more-than-five-years-cvc-147916

The Congress leaders raised slogans against the NDA government at the Centre and the TRS Government in Telangana before being taken away in a van.  State Congress president and MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy said they were not even allowed to hand over the memorandum to any official in the Governor's office.He demanded that the Farm Bills be withdrawn as these would push the agriculture sector into crisis and permanently damage the farm economy. Reddy said: "This is injustice to the principal opposition party which always stood by farmers. This is unfortunate. The Governor, whose duty is to safeguard the Constitution, should have at least allowed us to submit the memorandum." Tagore, who is on his first visit to Hyderabad, since his appointment as Congress in-charge, urged the party cadre to actively participate in the ongoing protests over farm legislations throughout the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-congress-workers-protesting-farm-bills-detained-147912
28-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Former public servants bat for farm Bills||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 28Amid intensifying agitation by farmers, senior retired civil servants from across the country, including from Punjab and Haryana, on Monday came out in support of the controversial farm bills and condemned the “surreptitious practices of vested interest for misleading and misguiding the farmers and discrediting the well intentioned national initiatives”.“The farm bills passed by the Parliament mark the watershed in the liberation of India’s farming community from the shackles of exploitative practices that slow pedaled their progress,” says the statement signed by senior IAS officers, including former Haryana Chief Secretary Dharam Vir, former Haryana Additional CS G. Prasanna Kumar, former Punjab Principal Secretary Ramesh Chander Nayyar and former Chairman SEIAA, Haryana, Bharat Bhushan, and circulated by the ruling BJP.“We have reasons to apprehend the disinformation which certain sections within our society are trying to spread in the country. We have recent instances of untruths and distortions being paraded before the public with hugely negative impact on the morale of the minorities, students, and now the farmers. The general public has every reason to suspect attempts by well-known vested interests to destabilise the country and create disaffection among the minorities, students and farmers,” they said.While calling the legislations “definite game-changer in the life of the Indian farmer” and “far-sighted” they said despite categorical assurances from the Union Agriculture Minister, vehemently reiterated by the Prime Minister, that minimum support price mechanism (MSP) shall remain as ever before, “it is objectionable to incite the farmers and create disaffection in their mind by wrongly suggesting that their interests are being bartered in favour of multinational concerns”.“In fact, wherever the farmers are suffering, they are suffering because of inadequate local marketing facilities leading to their exploitation by middlemen.“Major impediments which retarded the seamless growth of the farming fraternity of India are given the go by through the passage of these monumental Acts.“We strongly support the well-meaning efforts of the government in bringing succor to the farming community who has fed the nation over the years, converting India from a food deficit to a food surplus economy. Our group condemns the surreptitious practices of vested interest for misleading and misguiding the farmers and discrediting the well intentioned national initiatives,” they added. Meanwhile, after early announcement of Kharif rice procurement, sources say the government is planning to make procurement in the Rabi season, for which MSP has already been announced, an ideal case to prove wrong the rival parties who are leading the “misinformation campaign” against the provisions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-public-servants-bat-for-farm-bills-147910

28-09-2020||New Delhi||Offsets for govt-to-govt defence deals done away with under new acquisition procedure||In a major move, India has done away with offset requirements for government-to-government defence deals and single-vendor contracts under a new policy unveiled on Monday for the procurement of arms and military platforms for the armed forces, officials said.The Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP) released by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh provides for allowing the three forces to take on lease military equipment, hardware and platforms like helicopters, simulators and transport planes as per operational requirements as it could be a cheaper option than their procurement, the officials said.The decision to do away with the offset requirements for government-to-government deals, single-vendor contracts and acquisitions under the framework of intergovernmental pacts came days after the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) came down hard on the government over poor implementation of the offset policy.Under the offset policy, the foreign defence entities, for all contracts worth more than Rs 300, were mandated to spend at least 30 per cent of the total contract value in India through procurement of components, transfer of technologies or setting up of research and development facilities. The Offset guidelines have also been revised, wherein preference will be given to manufacture of complete defence products over components and various multipliers have been added to give incentivisation in discharge of Offsets.  The CAG had specifically mentioned about the Rs 59,000-crore Rafale deal, and said the manufacturer of the plane Dassault Aviation and weapons supplier MBDA were yet to fulfil their offset obligations of offering high technology to India. The offset component in the deal was 50 per cent.“Offsets will not be applicable in single vendor, government-to-government and IGA (inter-government agreement) deals as per DAP 2020,” said Apurva Chandra, Director General of Acquisition in the defence ministry, adding the offset policy will remain in force contracts involving competitive bidding.“No offset contract has led to transfer of technology,” he said indicating that it could be the reason behind the government decision.A new procedure has been included as a new chapter in DAP and structured as an enabling provision for Services to procure essential items through Capital Budget under a simplified procedure in a time bound manner.  The categories of Buy(Indian-IDDM), Make I, Make II, Production Agency in Design & Development, OFB/DPSU and SP model will be exclusively reserved for Indian Vendors meeting the criteria of Ownership and Control by resident Indian citizens.  Another official said removing offset obligations for contracts under the three categories is likely to result in a reduction of cost of acquisitions as the defence firms used to factor in funds required to fulfil offset conditions.The DAP, released after over a year-long consultation with concerned stakeholders, features a number of steps aimed at turning India into a global manufacturing hub of military platforms, reducing timelines for the procurement of defence equipment and allowing the purchase of essential items by the three services through capital budget under a simplified mechanism.The first defence procurement procedure was promulgated in 2002 and since then, it has been revised periodically to provide impetus to the growing domestic industry. The DAP will come into effect from October 1.The DAP also incorporates new chapters on information and communication technologies, post-contract management, acquisition of systems developed by the state-run defence entities like the DRDO and Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), they said.In what is seen as a significant move, the DAP featured measures to reduce delay in the procurement of essential items by the three services as it proposed a new enabling provision to acquire them through capital budget under a simplified procedure in a time-bound manner.The defence minister said the DAP has also included provisions to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) to establish manufacturing hubs both for import substitution and exports while protecting the interests of the Indian domestic industry.“The offset guidelines have also been revised, wherein preference will be given to manufacture of complete defence products over components and various multipliers have been added to give incentivisation in discharge of offsets,” the defence minister tweeted.He said the DAP has been aligned with the vision of the government’s ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India) initiative and to empower the Indian domestic industry through ‘Make in India’ projects with the ultimate aim of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.The policy also provides for single-stage accord of AoN (Acceptance of Necessity) in all cases up to Rs 500 crore to cut delays in approval of acquisition proposals.The DAP also mentioned measures to reform pre-induction testing of defence equipment.“Scope of trials will be restricted to physical evaluation of core operational parameters. Other parameters may be evaluated based on vendor certification, certification by accredited laboratories, computer simulations of parameters etc,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/offsets-for-govt-to-govt-defence-deals-done-away-with-under-new-acquisition-procedure-147884
28-09-2020||Satya Prakash||Trissur MP moves Supreme Court against farm law||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 28A day after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, Congress MP from Trissur in Kerala TN Prathapan on Monday moved the Supreme Court challenging its validity.In his petition, Prathapan has challenged the constitutional validity of various provisions of the Act that has led by farmers’ protests in Punjab and certain other parts of India.The Act was liable to be struck down as it violated Articles 14, 15 and 21 (right to equality, right to non-discrimination and right to life and liberty) of the Constitution of India, Prathapan submitted.“Without Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) acting as a protective shield around the farmers, the market would ultimately fall to the corporate greed of multinational companies who are more profit oriented and have no care for the conditions of the poverty-stricken farmers who are dependent on farming for their livelihood,” the petitioner said, opposing bypassing of APMC mechanism.“The APMC deterred the exploitation of the farmers by providing minimum support  price which would guarantee that the farmer who comes to the APMC would not leave empty handed,” Prathapan contended.Alleging that the law has been “hastily passed without having adequate discussion on it, he submitted that “the implementation of the Act in its current form will spell disaster for the farming community by opening a parallel market which is unregulated and gives enough room for exploitation of the farmers’ community by concentration of power in the hands of a few corporates/individuals, multinationals and moneylenders thus working against the very object it was seemingly created for.”The petitioner contended that “the standards used for farming produce may be more profit oriented and the parties involved may over look the environmental impact of such “standards” leaving the land barren or unfertile due to excessive and over use. Once the land loses its fertility properties, the farmer will lose his only source of income.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trissur-mp-moves-supreme-court-against-farm-law-147876
28-09-2020||Bhopal||IPS officer beats wife; relieved of duties after viral video||Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday said a senior state IPS officer has been relieved of duties, after a video showing him assaulting his wife went viral on social media.In the video, the officer, Purushottam Sharma is seen thrashing his wife, while the latter is seen resisting the assault.“The officer has been relieved of his duties. Action will be taken against anyone who holds a responsible position, but indulges in illegal activities and taking law into his hands,” the chief minister said.The order to remove Sharma, 1986-batch IPS officer, from the post of Director Public Prosecution was issued by the state home department Under Secretary Annu Bhalavi.There is no official confirmation so far of reports that the IPS officer was caught red-handed by his wife of 32 years at a woman’s house, after which he assaulted her.Sharma’s son Parth, a deputy commissioner in the Income Tax Department, sent the video to state Home Minister Narottam Mishra and some senior bureaucrats, and requested that a complaint be registered against his father.Sharma, who has been married for 32 years, said if he has done anything wrong, then his son should say why was his mother living with him for so long.“My son should say why was she taking money (from me) since 12-15 years and going on foreign trips. After enjoying so much comfort in life, she has an obligation towards her family, to save its reputation,” Sharma said.“This is a family matter, not a crime...I am not a criminal,” Sharma told reporters.“My wife stalks me wherever I go. I am dealing with this,” the IPS officer said, adding there is no place for fight in a family.Asked what action will be taken against Sharma, Mishra said, “If a written complaint comes to me, it will be looked into. I have also seen it (the video).”State women’s commission chairperson Shobha Oza termed the incident as highly objectionable and shameful.She said the action taken by the state government against Sharma is “inappropriate” and demanded his immediate dismissal from the service and registration of a criminal case against him.

28-09-2020||Houston (US)||Agriculture and food processing sector to strengthen India-US ties: Arkansas Governor||The “historic” relationship between the US and India can be further be strengthened with increased cooperation in the agriculture and food processing sector, Arkansas State Governor Asa Hutchinson has said.Participating in the webinar ‘India- Arkansas Partnership: Food Processing, Logistics and Manufacturing’, Governor Hutchinson said trade opportunities in Arkansas and India, and collaboration in them would be beneficial for both economies.“We have laid an incredible foundation for the future. And that foundation is based on our commitment to democracy, our mutual love for entrepreneurship, business and trade,” Hutchinson said on Wednesday.Apart from Hutchinson, Secretary Food Processing Industries, India, Pushpa Subrahmanyam and Consul General of India in Houston Aseem R Mahajan participated in the webinar hosted by the Government of India.The governor recalled his visit to India in October 2019. “We met several companies during our ‘Incredible India visit’, ranging from textile to steel to technology,” he said.“With agriculture being our number one economic driver, food processing is natural for us, followed by the steel industry. We have major steel mills like Big River Steel, Nucor-Yamato Steel Company,” he said.“The aerospace and defence industry are another major part of our economy. Lockheed Martin, Dassault Falcon, Aerojet Rocketdyne, Raytheon Missile Systems, General Dynamics, and others. Big companies like Tyson and Walmart that have significant investment and partnership in India are located here,” he said.Hutchison also mentioned the “vibrant and significant Indian-American community in Arkansas who contribute in all major fields, especially medicine, education”.Consul General Mahajan said: “We deeply value Governor Hutchinson’s support to strengthen economic ties, as a result of which eight major Indian companies have invested over USD 392 million in Arkansas creating around 1,700 jobs in areas like information technology, manufacturing and engineering. The objective of today's webinar is to highlight the immense potential and opportunities for companies in both countries to invest and build fruitful partnerships for mutual benefit.”Providing an overview of the food processing industry in India, Secretary Subrahmanyam said: “Food processing is considered one among the champion sectors in India with policy shifts including measures to remove bottlenecks, fast track investments by fiscal measures and a better facilitating environment.”“Today is a watershed moment in the Food processing industry, we are launching a second wave of liberalisation in the country, the agriculture sector is liberated from regulations, liberalising the marketing ecosystem, enabling contract farming in India and removing sealing on storage for agriculture commodities,” she said.The Indian government last week introduced three Bills — The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce Bill, 2020, The Farmers Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and The Essential Commodities Bill 2020 — saying they will revolutionise the country’s farming sector.The bills permit the sale of agricultural produce outside the mandis regulated by the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees, provides guidelines for contract farming and deregulates the production, supply, distribution of food items like cereals, pulses, potatoes, onion and edible oilseeds.“A factor attracting investments into India is its enormous food surplus, offering potential for processing this surplus and developing new products through fortified mechanisms, better technology and better nutritional attributes,” she said.“The Government of India has financial subsidies to set up manufacturing units in the country, a dedicated fund provided through the Ministry to promote agriculture in rural areas and concessions for investment in this sector. Also promotes huge infrastructure for plug and play units to come up, such as mega-food parks and mini-food parks. We hope that investments from Arkansas and the US will deepen further and enable us to forge stronger collaborative roles with the help of the Food Processing Ministry,” Subrahmanyam said.The participating panel included Secretary of Commerce & AEDC Executive Director Michael Preston from Arkansas, Principal Secretary Industries, Maharashtra, Venugopal Reddy, Principal Secretary Industries, Punjab, Alok Shekhar, Managing Director and CEO of Invest India Deepak Bagla, vice president, corporate affairs, Americas, Mahindra Group, Ridhika Batra, senior director of Tyson Foods Todd Menotti.

28-09-2020||Baruipur/Siliguri||BJP leader says will hug Mamata if infected by coronavirus, police complaint filed||Newly-appointed BJP national secretary Anupam Hazra has said that he would hug Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee if he is infected by the coronavirus to make her feel the pain of the families of COVID-19 patients.A police complaint was filed by the Trinamool Congress in Siliguri for the comments Hazra made at a party programme in Baruipur in South 24 Parganas on Sunday evening."Our workers are fighting a bigger enemy than corona.They are fighting Mamata Banerjee. When they (BJP cadres) have been able to fight it out against Mamata Banerjee without a mask, they think they can also fight against COVID-19 without wearing a mask," Hazra said."I have decided that if I get infected by the coronavirus, then I will go and hug Mamata Banerjee," he added.Hazra, a former TMC MP who joined the BJP last year, said the way the bodies of COVID-19 patients were being cremated in the state was pathetic."She (Banerjee) treated victims of the disease pathetically. Their bodies were burnt with kerosene. Sons were not allowed to see the face of their parents who died of COVID-19. We don't even treat dead cats or dogs like that," he said.Senior TMC leader Saugato Roy condemned the comments and said such remarks reflect the mindset of the BJP."Such words and statements can only come from BJP leaders. This reflects the mindset of the party. We condemn such insane statements," he said.The Trinamool Congress's Siliguri unit held a rally against Hazra and lodged a police complaint against him."We have lodged a police complaint against Anupam Hazra. We have urged the police to take immediate action against him," a senior TMC leader from the north Bengal city said.Reacting to the police complaint, Hazra told PTI that Banerjee too has made several controversial remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi."If my comments are demeaning, then Mamata Banerjee too had made such comments against the prime minister.Secondly, if one FIR has been filed against me, then at least 10 FIRs should be lodged against TMC leaders," he said.The state BJP leadership, however, distanced itself from Hazra's comment."We don't support such comments. We should avoid making such remarks," a state BJP leader said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leader-says-will-hug-mamata-if-infected-by-coronavirus-police-complaint-filed-147847
28-09-2020||Dubai||G20 leaders' summit to be held virtually on November 21-22||Saudi Arabia, which is presiding over the Group of 20 countries this year, said on Monday that the upcoming November gathering of world leaders will be held virtually amid the coronavirus pandemic.The kingdom had originally planned to host world leaders for the G-20 summit in Riyadh before the pandemic, offering Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman the chance to share handshakes and wide smiles with presidents and prime ministers, such as Donald Trump, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, India's Narendra Modi and China's Xi Jinping.Instead, the planned virtual meet-up announced Monday strips the kingdom of the pomp that would have accompanied televised arrivals on Riyadh's tarmac just two years after the killing and dismemberment of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi stained the crown prince's reputation.Prince Mohammed has insisted he had nothing to do with the operation carried out by Saudi agents inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, despite US senators and intelligence officials saying he bore responsibility for the slaying.Saudi Arabia said the virtual summit on November 21-22 will be chaired by King Salman. The meeting will focus on focus on “protecting lives and restoring growth by addressing vulnerabilities uncovered during the pandemic and by laying down the foundations for a better future,” a Saudi statement said.The statement added that G-20 countries, which represent the world's biggest and most powerful economies, have contributed over $21 billion to support the production of vaccines and access to therapeutics, as well as injected $11 trillion “to safeguard the global economy”.G-20 nations, however, have been criticised for not taking cohesive action against the virus and its economic impact. The US, China and Russia have opted out of a collaborative effort to develop and distribute a vaccine.The G-20 agreed this year to suspend the debt of developing countries and defer billions of dollars in payments as governments focus spending on emergency stimulus programmes to protect vulnerable people and boost national health care systems. Pakistan's prime minister, however, has called for outright debt relief for poorer nations from the world's richest countries.The leaders of the G-20 last met virtually in March in a session hosted by King Salman. The virtual video call was unusual at the time, as governments around the world were beginning to stress the importance of social distancing to curb the virus' spread amid closures, curfews and lockdowns globally.Rights groups and others had called for world leaders to boycott the summit in Saudi Arabia due to Khashoggi's killing, the kingdom's human rights record and its continued detention of activists.It was unclear whether leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or German Chancellor Angela Merkel would have attended an in-person summit, but there were others, such as Putin, who said they were ready to take part.Agnes Callamard, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions who investigated Khashoggi's killing, told The Associated Press earlier this month that another country should volunteer to host the G-20 leaders summit if it was going to be held in-person.Failing that, she said, it should be made conditional that Saudi Arabia releases imprisoned women's rights defenders, human rights activists, journalists and others. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/g20-leaders-summit-to-be-held-virtually-on-november-21-22-147846

We don't want any further adjournment,” the bench also comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah observed.The bench recorded the statement of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that this issue is under active consideration of the government and a decision is likely to be taken within two-three days.It said that Mehta should endeavour to circulate the affidavit among the parties by Thursday so that the matter is heard on October 5.“The decision taken by the government should be brought on record along with an affidavit,” the bench said.At the outset, Mehta said several economic issues are under consideration of the government.The bench asked Mehta if he would be able to circulate his affidavit in advance to the parties concerned to which he agreed.Senior advocate Rajiv Dutta, appearing for the main petitioner Gajendra Sharma, said this is a very important matter and banks are acting as if it is a very normal issue.Mehta requested to wait for two to three days so that the government can take a final call. “I assure you that it is under consideration and is at a very advanced stage.”On September 10, the top court had extended its interim order that no account is to be declared NPA till further orders after the Centre said an expert panel had been set up to look into the issue of interest being charged by banks on instalments deferred during the moratorium period due to COVID-19 pandemic.The government at “highest level” is considering all the issues raised before the court in the petitions and a decision would be taken within two weeks, the Centre informed the apex court.The top court had directed that decisions taken by the Centre, the RBI and different banks be placed on record for consideration.“As noted above, on the next date of hearing, the specific instructions with regard to charging of compound interest and credit rating/downgrading during moratorium period shall be obtained, so that appropriate order be issued on the next date of hearing,” the bench had said.The Centre had sought two weeks' time to file an appropriate affidavit bringing on record the relevant decisions and directions of the government as well as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).It had said that everything had to be considered holistically and the government is considering all the sectors, for which an expert panel had been constituted.The top court had asked the Centre that concrete decisions should be taken with clarity.On September 3, in a relief to stressed borrowers who are facing hardship due to the impact of pandemic, the top court had said that accounts which were not declared as non-performing assets till August 31 this year, would not be declared NPA till further orders.The pleas in the apex court have raised issues pertaining to validity of RBI's March 27 circular which allowed lending institutions to grant moratorium on payment of instalments of term loans falling due between March 1, 2020 and May 31 this year due to the pandemic. Later, the period of moratorium was extended till August 31.The Centre had recently told the court that waiver of interest on deferred EMIs during moratorium period would be against “the basic canons of finance” and unfair to those who repaid loans as per schedule.The RBI has, however, come out with a scheme which provides for extension of moratorium for two years to certain stressed borrowers, the Centre had informed the top court.

28-09-2020||Mumbai||What is left of NDA after Akali Dal, Shiv Sena exit, asks Sena mouthpiece Saamana||With the Shiromani Akali Dal walking out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over farm bills, the Shiv Sena on Monday wondered if the BJP-led alliance really existed and asked who were in the coalition now.An editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said it was surprising that the NDA's "last pillar" Shiromani Akali Dal was not stopped from severing ties with the alliance.The editorial said, "When the Badals left, no effort was made to stop them. Earlier, the Shiv Sena also left the NDA. With these two parties out, what is left of the NDA? Those who are still there, do they have anything to do with Hindutva?""Punjab and Maharashtra represent manliness and Akali Dal and Shiv Sena are the faces of that manliness," it said."Now some have said 'ram-ram' (adieu) to this venture and so there is no Ram left in NDA, which has lost two lions (Akali Dal and Sena)," the editorial said.The Akali Dal quit the NDA on Saturday over the issue of farm bills passed in Parliament. It is the third major party to walk out of the NDA in the recent period after the Shiv Sena and the TDP.The Shiv Sena quit the NDA last year following differences with the BJP over sharing the chief ministerial post in Maharashtra on a rotational basis."First, the Shiv Sena had to quit the NDA. Now the Akali Dal has left it. Does the NDA really exist after its two key pillars have walked out?" it said."The NDA was formed to give a strong alliance against the Congress at the national level. The alliance saw many ups and downs over the years and several other parties quit it as per their convenience," it said.The country’s politics is being pushed towards a one-party system, but the BJP has to face elections in several states by forging alliances with other parties, the Sena said.The Shiv Sena said its government with the NCP and Congress in Maharashtra is doing a good job, and added it would complete its five-year term.

28-09-2020||Bengaluru||Farmers in Karnataka protest against amendments to Land Reforms Act, APMC Act||Pro-farmer organisations backed by several other social and political outfits on Monday staged protests across Karnataka over the amendments to the APMC and land reforms actThe demonstrations were against two important amendments to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act passed by the Karnataka Assembly despite strong objection by the opposition parties, mainly the Congress and JD(S).The amendment to the KLR Act lifts restrictions on purchasing agricultural land and enables any individual to purchase it.Earlier, the law permitted only the farmers to purchase agricultural land in the state.The repeal of certain provisions in the APMC Act through an amendment allows private players to directly purchase agriculture produce from farmers, which was prohibited earlier.The protesters alleged that these laws will ruin the agriculture sector as people with moneybags will purchase agricultural land to convert their black money into white and turn agriculture land into real estate business.The farmers alleged that the amendment to the APMC Act will deprive them of the minimum support price and enable multinational companies and big corporate houses to directly procure produce at their rates.The call for a bandh given by the Karnataka Raitha Sangha (Karnataka Farmers' Association) and other farmer organisations is supported by the Congress, JD(S), Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV) and the Left parties.The protests were staged at important locations in Bengaluru, Ramanagara, Mandya, Mysuru, Chamarajanagara, Kolar, Chikkaballapura, Tumakuru, Ballari, Raichur, Chitradurga, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Vijayapura, Bagalkote, Bidar, Belagavi, Uttara Kannada, Udupi, Dharwad and Davangere among others.Ignoring the coronavirus fear, farmers came on the roads in groups, raised slogans, took out bike rallies, burnt tyres in protest on the road and staged sit-in demonstrations.At many places, the demonstrators courted arrest.In Bengaluru, farmers and KRV members including its chief T A Narayana Gowda took out a rally and tried to stop buses when they were arrested.Protests were held at various places including Mysuru Bank circle, Town Hall, Yelahanka and Ballari Road in the city.The Congress, which has extended support to the protests, said it will stage a demonstration in front of its office on Race Course Road in Bengaluru.Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Sunday had appealed to the protestors not to create unnecessary confusion over the amendments.Stating that he had spoken to leaders of farmers organisations, Yediyurappa said his government's stand and the expectations of the Prime Minister were in favour of the farmers.Revenue Minister R Ashoka had said there would be no scope for the bandh from the government side.As there was a crackdown on the protesters, AICC general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, Randeep Singh Surjewala, asked the Chief Minister to repeal the 'draconian amendments' instead of banning the bandh."Dear BS Yediyurappa ji, Instead of banning the Farmers #Karnataka Bandh, 'ban' & 'banish' the anti-farmer- labourer mindset. Withdraw the law & apologise for the blatant sell out by BJP on Land Reforms Bill. Repeal the draconian amendments to APMC Act. This is your litmus test!" he tweeted.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-in-karnataka-protest-against-amendments-to-land-reforms-act-apmc-act-147819

Manufacturers whose various models have been provisionally accepted by the DGCA will also have to get permanent certification from QCI.Earlier, the DGCA had issued the Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs) to ensure airworthiness and seamless operations for privately owned remotely piloted aircraft systems for civilian purposes. Consequently, drones to be used, whether manufactured in India or imported, are required to be certified to ensure they meet the stipulated technical and safety parameters.There are a number of firms in India that manufacture drones of various sizes and capability. The number of start-ups getting into this business segment has also witnessed an increase recently. Drones, along with robotics and electric vehicle equipment, are among the focus areas identified by the government to reduce imports and ramp up domestic production for becoming self-reliant.  Certification is different from registration of drones, which has now been made mandatory and for which there is a different process. While certification deals with the technical specifications of the machine and is the responsibility of the manufacturer, registration, like that of a vehicle, concerns post-sale ownership and identification and is the responsibility of the operator.DGCA has classified drones into five categories by their all-up weight, including payload. These are nano, weighing up to 250 grams; micro, weighing from 250 grams to 2 kg; small, from 2 kg to 25 kg; medium, from 25 kg to 150 kg; and large, weighing above 150 kg.According to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, a total of 19,553 drones have been registered in India till March 2020. These are 1,832 nano, 13,735 micro, 2,808 small, 140 medium and 1,038 large drones. In addition, several thousand illegal drones are believed to be operating in the country. The use of drones also has security implications.The DGCA and QCI have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop and operate a certification scheme as per the technical standards defined by DGCA for drones, registered flight modules and ‘no permission, no take-off’ (NPNT) operating framework, as well as procedures and specifications for third-party conformity assessment systems.The process is aimed at ensuring that the drones meet applicable regulatory requirements and secure international acceptability. The system of certification is based on guidelines provided in the international standard 17067:2013, which guides the development of product certification schemes worldwide.A multi-stakeholder steering committee chaired by a seasoned professional will oversee the certification scheme along with a QCI secretariat. The steering committee will also be supported by a technical committee and a certification committee that will be constituted by QCI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-off-loads-civilian-drone-certification-to-third-parties-147814
28-09-2020||Kolkata||Historian digs out story of lesser-known Bhagat Singh||Shaheed-E-Azam Bhagat Singh, whose 113rd birth anniversary is being observed on Monday is an inspiration for many.However, there was another Bhagat Singh who too was a freedom fighter. Thus Bhagat Singh is hardly known and would have remained so had Jadavpur University historian Suchetana Chattopadhyay not dug out his story from the state archives.Like his illustrious namesake, the lesser-known Bhagat Singh too believed in socialism and wanted to drive out the British from India.According to Chattopadhyay, the Nau Jawan Bharat Sabha (a youth group founded in Punjab and influenced by the Ghadar movement) gained popularity among left inclined radical Sikh activists in Kolkata during the late 1920s and early 1930s. From the beginning, their activities were closely monitored by the police.On February 15, 1933, five Sikh men (all five originally belonging to Hoshiarpur) were arrested for being ‘terrorists’. The police accused them of having links with the banned Bengal branches of Nau Jawan Bharat Sabha and Kirti Dal, the older organisation of communists from Punjab and Bengal.The arrested activists occupied a room on the third floor of 6 Ganga Prasad Mukherjee Road at Bhabanipur, a prominent South Kolkata neighbourhood. Two aluminium bombs and a phial containing strong sulphuric acid were found among their effects. On May 20, they were convicted and sentenced to six years’ rigorous imprisonment.Bhagat Singh, the alleged ring-leader, and his four associates were suspected of having imbibed a toxic mix of militant Left-wing convictions and terrorist violence while living and working in the city.Bhagat Singh, born in 1908 in Mahilpur, had passed middle school in 1923 and arrived in Kolkata in 1924. He had learnt driving in the city and worked as a bus driver till 1933 when he was jailed. Among his four co-accused, three were bus drivers while one drove a taxi for a living. They were all literate. Diaries, leaflets and handbills in Gurumukhi script were found in their possession.Amar Singh, who was among the five arrested, died in Multan prison. Bhagat Singh, Pakkar Singh and Dhanna Singh were released from Bengal jails during 1938, having been granted remission after 5 years. Banta Singh vanished from the records. Pakkar Singh’s friendship with a Sikh warder in Rajshahi jail (now in Bangladesh) led to the latter’s dismissal.Before his release from Dum Dum Central Jail, Bhagat Singh had written a secret letter in Punjabi which was intercepted by police. He had wanted to know the opinion of communist and socialist leaders regarding hunger-strike undertaken by the prisoners in Punjab jails.From his photograph, it appears that Bhagat Singh had given up observing religious customs. Nevertheless, the gurdwara at Kolkata’s Rash Behari Avenue, out of empathy for the freedom movement, had promised to help him after his release.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/historian-digs-out-story-of-lesser-known-bhagat-singh-147809

28-09-2020||Washington||Strategic energy partnership emerged as cornerstone of expanding India-US ties: Envoy||Strategic Energy Partnership has emerged as a cornerstone of expanding the US-India ties as the bilateral hydrocarbon trade has increased by 93 per cent in the last two years, a top official has said.India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, in an op-ed in The Houston Chronicle, wrote that numbers speak for themselves.There has been an increase of 93 per cent in the hydrocarbon trade between India and the United States in the last two years; it has reached USD 9.2 billion in 2019, he said.India is now the fourth largest international market for the US crude oil and the fifth largest for the US liquefied natural gas. Indian firms have concluded several contracts for sourcing crude from the United States and are expanding their investments in the US energy sector, creating jobs and economic opportunities, he said.“Announced during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States in June 2017 - and its intensity enhanced when Modi visited Houston in September 2019 - the Strategic Energy Partnership has emerged as a cornerstone of expanding India-US ties.“In an uncertain world, the key to effective partnerships between nations is reliability, trust and long-term commitment. The India-US strategic energy partnership touches all three aspects. The pandemic has only reminded us of the need for more focused and expeditious action to galvanise economic growth through mutually beneficial collaborations,” Sandhu wrote.While crude oil and liquefied natural gas transactions have been impressive, Sandhu said, these comprise only one of the four pillars of the US-India energy cooperation.The other pillars - power and energy efficiency, renewable energy and sustainable growth - are equally critical, he wrote.“Underlying all of these is innovation. Indian and the US entities are also working together to advance cooperation in the civil nuclear energy,” he said.Noting that cooperation with the United States in the natural gas sector is a priority for India, he said as India evolves into an increasingly gas-based economy, natural gas infrastructure - pipeline networks, city gas distribution grids and LNG terminals - is being ramped up across the country.Significant opportunities exist for the US companies in LNG bunkering, container development, petrochemicals and bio-fuels, according to the Indian envoy.India is primed for investment of USD 118 billion in oil and gas exploration, and natural gas infrastructure, including urban consumer gas distribution networks over the coming five years. For the US investors and energy companies with their global footprint, India is the new frontier, he said.“As India builds its strategic petroleum reserves at home, India is also looking to lease crude storage capacities in the United States. An agreement for cooperation in this area was signed in July 2020,” Sandhu added.

If they remain strong, the foundation of Atmanirbhar Bharat will remain strong,” PM Modi said in his monthly “Mann Ki Baat” radio talk.Modi said if the essence of Mahatma Gandhi’s economic philosophy had been followed, there would not have been any need for the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign as the country would have become self-reliant much earlier. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/president-nod-to-farm-bills-as-protests-rage-in-region-147616
28-09-2020||---||We are nowhere near herd immunity: Harsh Vardhan||New Delhi, September 27As the Covid-19 caseload in India breached the six-million mark on Sunday night, the government said the country was way off the herd immunity and masks, physical distancing and maintenance of hygiene were sole protections available to people against the virus.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the ICMR’s sero surveys that traces the Covid spread across India should not create a sense of complacency and asked the people to wear masks even in places of worship.“The first sero survey in May 2020 revealed that the nationwide prevalence of the infection was only 0.73 per cent. The second sero survey indications are that we are far from having achieved any kind of herd immunity which necessitates that all of us should continue to take appropriate precautions. Low prevalence of infection means a large population remains vulnerable to the virus,” Vardhan said.In his social media interaction with people, Vardhan warned against over-dependence on Remdesivir and plasma therapy, saying these are only investigational therapies with no proven benefits. He added that after evidence of Covid impacting other organs apart from lungs, especially heart and kidneys, the ministry had formed committees of experts to examine these areas.“The ICMR is investigating re-infection cases. Although such instances are negligible at this moment,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-are-nowhere-near-herd-immunity-harsh-vardhan-147665

The two allies decided to part ways to save their “individual political identity” and “core voters”.Alliance politics2017: JD(U), which had walked out of alliance in 2013, rejoins2018: TDP pulls out over special status for Andhra Pradesh; BJP abandons PDP over concerns related to J&K; RLSP president Upendra Kushwaha resigns from the Cabinet2019: TN-based AIADMK joins NDA; Shiv Sena parts ways over Maharashtra CM’s post; Haryana’s JJP joins hands with BJP2020: SAD quits alliance over contentious farm lawsThe current NDA allies include the JD(U), LJP and HAM(S) in Bihar, JJP in Haryana, AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, Apna Dal in UP and some other minor parties like the Ram Das Athawale-led RPI in Maharashtra.Party leaders claim the BJP never initiated move to sever ties with any party and those who left have either joined back or regretted the move.TDP leader N Chandrababu Naidu, after faring poorly in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, “openly admitted regret” over his decision to quit the NDA, they claim.Both JD(U) and the AIADMK have joined the alliance, while the Shiv Sena may have parted ways in Maharashtra, it stood with the NDA in the Lok Sabha. Similarly, the HAM(S) is back. In all, the NDA is an alliance of around 25 parties, they say.So far as the PDP is concerned, the BJP pulled out because of “genuine concerns” related to Jammu and Kashmir, they claim.The leaders claim that there is no state, including Punjab, where the BJP’s organisational structure is not as strong as that of regional parties. Rajya Sabha MP Shwait Malik says: “They (Akali Dal) quit the alliance. There was no such move from our side. Why did they not leave earlier? Why were they giving favourable statements regarding farm ordinances? The BJP has always taken them along on issues concerning Punjab.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sad-third-major-ally-to-quit-nda-in-three-years-147669
28-09-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Jaswant Singh: The Rathore from deserts who defended Pokhran||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 27“We are going to come down on those guys like a ton of bricks,” then US President Bill Clinton had thundered soon after the US establishment had got over the shock of not getting a whiff about India’s five nuclear tests in three days at a site 1,200 km away from major Department of Atomic Energy facilities.A month after those tests and Clinton’s dire admonition, Jaswant Singh bravely landed in Washington to engage the US President’s college-mate and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott in the first of 14 meetings over the next 30 months in 10 locations on three continents.It finally turned out to be the most intense and prolonged set of India-US exchanges ever at a level higher than that of ambassadors. The jury is still out whether those exchanges in Rome, London, Frankfurt, Moscow etc turned around US policy. According to Talbott, they didn’t. The sanctions were lifted not because it was a mistake to impose them, but because by then they had passed the point of diminishing returns.But as his most trenchant critic AG Noorani conceded, that serial dialogue, conducted with not a single paper, file or folder in Jaswant’s hand, lifted Indo-US relations out of the trap of cyclical ebbs and flows. He deployed elements of conciliation and contest to catch the deep and constant undercurrents, enabling the duo to set the foundational basis which then matured into the specifics that we see today.Jaswant, however, was more than the man of the desert who set out to defend his government’s policies for conducting nuclear tests not more than 100 km from where he was born.He was the man who intimately knew the story of the cold war through protagonists from both sides of the fence. For, his life-long friends were the famous communist power couple Romesh and Raj Thapar. A person who took a liking for him was PN Haksar, the man who shaped the Indian foreign policy’s sunshine years of the 70s. It is little wonder that he never hid his admiration for Nehru that was also gained from years of deep scholarship.Apart from the nuclear tests, there were other tumultuous episodes in his stint as Foreign Minister in the Vajpayee government. The seven sleepless nights during the hijack of the Indian airlines plane, the double-crossing when he bravely landed in Kandahar — because “somebody had to go”. And at the end, “there was relief because so much accumulated pain and agony had burst open like a long throbbing carbuncle”.Fortified by spirited interactions with the framers of India’s security and strategic environment such as K Subrahmanyam, Maj Gen Rajinder Singh Sparrow and Marshal of the Air Force Arjan Singh, Jaswant was as much at home in discussions of disarmament as he was on regional issues with Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Though this Rathore from the deserts is best remembered for telling the world not to negotiate with him on nuclear issues “as if with a gun to my temple”, his interactions and experiences straddled a range of other issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaswant-singh-the-rathore-from-deserts-who-defended-pokhran-147670
28-09-2020||KV Prasad||Jaswant Singh: A worthy scholar, soldier and politician||The death of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh brought an end to a rare breed of personality who shaped a successful political career after leaving the Indian Army. The 82-year-old politician breathed his last on Sunday after remaining in coma for the last six years, as a result of a fall at home.Hailing from Rajasthan and having entered politics in 1980s, Jaswant Singh was a member of the Lok Sabha on four occasions, including once representing Darjeeling backed by the Gorkhas and in the Rajya Sabha for five terms. He left the BJP after being denied a ticket in 2014 and contested the Barmer Lok Sabha as an Independent.Much before he came into national limelight, the suave and articulate preferred to identify in his baritone voice as Major Jaswant Singh, with pride of being associated with Central India Horse, an armoured regiment.Jaswant Singh came in contact with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and their friendship grew as fellow travellers in the Bharatiya Janata Party. Although he did not have association with the RSS, he had the trust of both Vajpayee and LK Advani since the inception of the party.A gentleman and mild natured person, Jaswant Singh was a scholar in his own right with deep interest in foreign affairs, an aptitude that helped him share interests with Vajpayee.As the External Affairs Minister in the Vajpayee government, it was left to him to navigate the country’s international engagement after the Pokhran nuclear tests in 1998.Jaswant Singh was among the few Indian politicians who had the distinction of serving in three of the four prime ministries on the Raisina Hill — External Affairs, Defence and Finance and Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission.Yet for all his achievements, he had to face severe criticism for the handling of the Kandhar hijack in 1999 and live with barbs from opposition for having taken terrorists Masood Azhar and two others to Afghanistan in exchange of the passengers held hostage on a Indian Airlines plane. He wrote several books, including “A Call to Honour”, an account of his days in politics and “Jinnah: India Partition Independence” in which he held Congress leaders responsible for it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaswant-singh-a-worthy-scholar-soldier-and-politician-147675
