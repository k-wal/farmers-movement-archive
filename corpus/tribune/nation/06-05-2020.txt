Does the Indian constitution exist?” he said in a tweet.A section of migrant labourers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal had created a ruckus in Bengaluru on May 4, demanding that they be sent home.Many desperate workers said they are keen on returning due to difficult survival conditions. They are also concerned about the wellbeing of their families back home and are apprehensive that they may not be able to return quickly if their kin faced some problems.Shailesh, a painter from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, said he had exhausted all the money that he had.“My elder brother is stuck in Hyderabad whereas I am held up in Bengaluru. Both of us are jobless for the past one-and- half months,” he said.The first Shramik Special train from Haryana carrying 1,200 migrant workers left for Katihar in Bihar from Hisar railway station even as Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar too renewed his appeal to migrant workers engaged in industries not to leave and instead start working in manufacturing units that have been allowed to resume operations.In Maharashtra, state Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik accused the BJP governments in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka of adopting an uncooperative approach in taking back migrant workers hailing from these two states.“They are creating new hurdles. There are no such problems in case of other states like Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal though,” he said.As on Tuesday morning, Gujarat was the originating station for around 35 of these special trains, followed by Kerala with 13.Among the receiving states, Bihar has accepted 13 trains, with 11 more currently on journey and six more planned, the data accessed by PTI shows.Uttar Pradesh has received 10 such trains and five more are on their way and 12 more planned, as per the data.The West Bengal Government has, however, given clearance to only two trains—one each from Rajasthan and Kerala—and they are en route to the state.Jharkhand has accepted four trains, while five are on their way to the state. Two more Shramik Special trains have been planned.Odisha has received seven trains and five are on their way to the state, with one more planned, the data shows.The Odisha Government said a total of 35,540 migrant workers have so far returned to the state.Earlier, the Centre had drawn flak from opposition parties after the Railways had made these services chargeable.The Maharashtra Government has sought clarity from the Railways over whether it is bearing 85 per cent of the transport cost of migrant workers heading home amid the lockdown, the state home minister said.The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal blamed the Centre’s alleged “lack of farsightedness” for the migrant labourer crisis in the country and asked why the PM CARES fund is not being used to finance their journey home.The party also said it is condemnable that migrant labourers who have been “starving” for over 40 days are being made to pay for their tickets, as is being alleged.

06-05-2020||---||Justice Deepak Gupta gets virtual send-off||Satya PrakashTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 6Justice Deepak Gupta became the first Supreme Court judge to get a “virtual” send off on Wednesday with the Supreme Court Bar Association organising a “Zoom party” to bid him farewell during COVID19 lockdown.In his farewell address, Justice Gupta asserted that there was no alternative to a fearless and independent judiciary in a country which professed to be follower of rule of law and separation of powers.“When a judge sits in the court... we have to forget our religious beliefs and decide cases only on the basis of our Constitution. The Constitution is our Bible, Quran, Geeta, Guru Granth Sahib and other religious books,” Justice Gupta said in a virtual farewell function via video conferencing.The function was attended by CJI SA Bobde, several judges, Attorney General KK Venugopal, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, SCBA President Dushyant Dave and and a large number of advocates.“Today as I hang up my robes after 42 years in the profession, I have enjoyed each and every moment of it. Though I end relationship with court, my relationship with Bar can never end,” said Justice Gupta who was elevated to the Supreme Court on February 17, 2017.“Though I am sad for leaving the profession, I am happy that I will have more time for my family and myself. I will get some time to read and pursue hobbies. I will also get to earn some more money than I do as a judge,” he said.Justice Gupta thanked his father for inculcating reading habit in him.  “It’s only because of reading that I reached where I am. After my father passed away, it was my mother who gave us everything we needed for an elegant upbringing,” he said.Justice Gupta also thanked his wife for being a pillar of strength for him.“I have been called an activist judge or lawyer, I never stepped out of the boundaries...I never broke it,” Justice Gupta said.However, he said a humane and compassionate judiciary was the need of the hour.“Scales of justice can’t be equal when apples and oranges are measured together. Persons dispensing justice in times like these need to weigh justice in favour of the poor and downtrodden. Bar members should take up some pro bono work,” Justice Gupta said thanking the Bar for extending “a lot of cooperation” to him.Venugopal described him as the first judge to come out so strongly and openly in defence of dissent. “It should have been said earlier. Your thoughts that citizen has a right to protest in a peaceful manner will never be forgotten. A very bold statement to make for a sitting judge,” the AG said.“You are a young man and your health will permit to be a judge for the next 15 years. A judge to leave his office now at the age of 65 is unfair,” Venugopal said pitching for increasing the age of judges’ retirement.Dave expressed gratitude on behalf of the Bar. “Your departure creates a void...the Bar and Bench is eternally grateful to you,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/justice-deepak-gupta-gets-virtual-send-off-81235

As far as women are concerned, they are regular customers and keeping their convenience in mind we reserved them separate queues,” said a vend owner of DLF city.Interestingly showing solidarity with the soldiers killed in Hundwara, one of the liquor vend owners in Baadshahpur area offered special discounts and queues for Army veterans and even gave free liquor to next of kin of martyrs on production of valid I-cards.“This is all I can do. We come from a village where every house has a soldier and thus this is what we could do for them. Liquor is like any commodity. Had I been running a grocery store, I would have given grocery for free,” said Satish Yadav, the vend owner.Day one meanwhile kept Gurugram police on its toes that toiled the entire day keeping people and vehicles in check.Interestingly the number of vehicles increased by 40 per cent today as compared to last two days of lockdown relaxation.It was however the border which proved to be tougher fight with many people from Delhi trying to enter Gurugram to get liquor stock citing closure of vends in their areas or increased liquor rates.“The police had extra workload but we pulled it off perfectly. Unlike national pictures of chaos at vends we ensured social distancing and no nonsense. We have told all vend owners and people that self-discipline is key to keep things running. Any kind of chaos and we will shut the shops,” said CP Mohammad Akil.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gurugram-liquor-vends-special-queues-for-women-senior-citizens-and-corona-warriors-81232

06-05-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Stranded Indians put high fares, evacuation delay behind them||India’s first phase of evacuation operation to be launched from Thursday with two naval ships and 64 flights spread over one week has come as a ray of hope for the lakhs stranded around the world. But many more could have returned home but for the absence of cooperation between countries, said sources.The Ministry of External Affairs’ directives to pay the full fare in advance has not gone down well with a section of the media though officially it has been said that the purpose of charging passengers is to ensure that only deserving cases take the flight back home.India will charge slightly less than the US, which charged between $ 2,000 and $ 2,500 per person. However, the US system allows penniless passengers to board the flights provided they sign a promissory note and they will not be eligible for new passports until the loan is repaid.The UK, on the other hand, instead of asking passengers to pay higher charges for chartered flights, has provided a £ 75 million support for flights to countries like India to help its most vulnerable citizens.Although videoconferences by international and regional organisations---UN, WHO, G-20, BRICS, NAM---underlined the need for cooperation during the epidemic, sources said many stranded Indians would have returned home more than a month ago had there been an understanding between the respective civil aviation authorities.For instance, Israel sent half a dozen flights since March 21 to evacuate its nationals. Sources said besides its national carrier El Al, Israel also took the services of Air India. But no stranded Indian has returned from Israel from any of these flights. Given India’s modest beginning with the first phase of evacuation, it may be a while before anyone of them returns.Similarly the US has sent two dozen flights to India with none of them bringing back stranded Indians. Sources said the US could have easily followed the protocol for disinfecting the plane had it arrived with Indians.As a result, Indians in distress in the US have had to wait for well over a month. And the first phase of evacuation will be able to accommodate a maximum of 1,750 passengers said sources.Germany, Britain, Canada and Russia, all have substantial numbers wanting to return to India, have had to wait it out.  Britain sent nearly five dozen flights only to India, almost equal to the 64 Air India flights to a dozen countries but has seen no Indian returning.The chartered flights from Britain brought back over 15,000 British travellers---after observing physical distancing norms---which is almost the same number that India will bring back in phase one.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-stranded-indians-put-high-fares-evacuation-delay-behind-them-81227

06-05-2020||New Delhi||High fatality rate among COVID-19 patients in Gujarat, Maharashtra worrisome: Harsh Vardhan||Expressing concern over high fatality rate among COVID-19 patients in some districts of Maharashtra and Gujarat, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday asked the states to focus on early surveillance, aggressive contact tracing and early diagnosis to reduce the number of deaths in the areas.The minister held a high-level meeting with Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister and Health Minister Nitinbhai Patel and Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope.In the meeting, Vardhan stressed on the need for proper interventions like screening and testing of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and Influenza Like Illness (ILI) cases as this may prevent spread of infection in other areas. “Implementation of effective containment strategy needs be on the top priority of the states to reduce the mortality rate. It is the need of the hour to take preventive, pre-emptive and comprehensive measures in a systematic manner and follow the protocols laid down by the Centre to prevent occurrence of fresh cases,” he said.It was pointed out that in some cases, the patients either suppressed the information of their infection or reported late to the hospitals for treatment, which may be indicative of some fear or stigma associated with COVID-19.Aggressive behavioural change and communication exercise need to be taken for removing the stigma against reporting COVID-19, which shall contribute towards timely reporting, clinical management and reduction in fatality rates, the minister stressed.“This shall also lead to people reporting early for diagnosis and treatment,” he said.Of the 1,694 fatalities and 49,391 cases of coronavirus infections reported till Wednesday morning, Maharashtra tops the tally with 617 fatalities and 15,525 cases followed by Gujarat with 368 deaths and 6,245 cases, according to the data provided by the Union health ministry.The health ministry had on Tuesday said the nationwide COVID-19 case status will be updated on its website only once a day in the morning instead of twice a day as was being done previously.In view of Gujarat and Maharashtra reporting larger number of coronavirus deaths and cases, Vardhan suggested that along with the surveillance teams in containment areas, community volunteers may also be identified at the ward-level to spread awareness about the preventive measures like hand washing, physical distancing etc.Some districts such as Aurangabad and Pune have done this, he said.The health ministry would provide full support and handholding to the state governments through the National Health Mission (NHM) for health systems strengthening as part of the immediate and long-term measures, the health minister stated. He also appreciated the move by some districts where the high-risk population, including the elderly and those with non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, were identified and provided focused treatment. The Union minister urged the states to ensure that persons aged more than 65 years having any non-communicable disease are screened on priority in the Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres. He also pointed out that in compliance of the guidelines issued by the Centre, non-COVID-19 essential health services such as antenatal care, immunisation drives, Tuberculosis case finding and treatment, providing blood transfusion for dialysis patients, treatment of cancer patients among others should not be neglected. Vardhan suggested that the data available with the states on Health Management Information System (HMIS) for various diseases may be optimally utilised for risk profiling.He also assured that additional teams comprising of officials from the Centre will also be deployed in the states as per their request, adding they may also take support offered by AIIMS, Delhi for treatment guidance and clinical management of COVID-19 patients through the national teleconsultation centre.“A single mobile number (+91 9115444155) can be dialled from anywhere in the country by COVID-19 treating doctors to reach the centre,” he informed.The health minister also asked the states to publicise the Aarogya Setu mobile application and the Aarogya Setu Interactive Voice Response System facility for those without smartphones. He also appreciated the best practices shared by the district magistrates, commissioners and other officials of various districts like “Corona Yodha Samitis” developed in slum areas of Surat in Gujarat, distribution of soaps and masks to each family, installation of hand washing machines in slum areas, setting up of fever clinics among others.

06-05-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena hits out at UP, Bihar for tests on migrants||The Shiv Sena on Wednesday hit out at the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for asking migrant workers from those states to get themselves tested for the COVID-19 virus before taking them back.An editorial in party mouthpiece Saamna said the governments of the two states sent buses to Kota in Rajasthan to bring back their students even as hurdles were put in the way of poor migrants whowished to return home.”These states are biased against the poor. Hundreds of buses were sent to fetch the students from Kota free of charge without tests because they were rich. But train fares are being charged from the poor migrant workers. It is cruel and a crime against humanity that the poor migrants are not being allowed to go home,” Saamna said.The newspaper Sena praised Congress president Sonia Gandhi after the arty asked its state units to bear the cost of train fare of the migrant workers returning home.Saamna said the workers from UP were treated like a vote-bank by the rulers of that state.“These workers were the vote-bank of political parties. But now that they want to return home, their political mentors have turned their backs on them,” Saamna said in an oblique reference to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath, who campaigned for the Bharatiya Janata Party in the last assembly elections.The newspaper also accused the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar of treating the migrants “like cats and dogs” and pointed out that the migrants had originally come to Mumbai to earn a living.“What will they eat in their home state,” the newspaper asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shiv-sena-hits-out-at-up-bihar-for-tests-on-migrants-81209

Like hand wash, nose and throat wash may also remove or reduce viral load.In previous studies it has been shown that cells in throat and nasal mucosa convert chloride ion of hypertonic saline to hypochlorous acid (HOCl) having anti-viral effect.Interestingly, HOCL is also an active component of the bleaching powder, which is used in disinfecting hands by wash.Many studies have shown that nasal wash and gargles can reduce period of illness, symptoms of the viral disease and amount of viral shedding.In a study carried out at Edinburgh, types of viruses were also evaluated in upper respiratory tract infections, quoting the findings of others Dr Virendra Singh, leading the research group and chest expert of Rajasthan hospital here, underlined.Interestingly 56% were rhinovirus and 31% were coronavirus (not COVID). With decreasing amount of viral shedding, the risk of spread of infection in other household people was also reduced, Dr Virendra said, adding  Japan along with face mask and hand washing, gargles are also included in the preventive therapy of national guidelines on influenza control.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nasopharyngeal-wash-can-prevent-covid-infection-lung-india-81208

06-05-2020||New Delhi||Plea in HC to close liquor shops in Delhi till COVID-19 pandemic under control||A PIL was filed in the Delhi High Court on Wednesday seeking direction to the AAP government to close liquor shops here until the coronavirus pandemic is under control.The plea was mentioned for an urgent hearing and it is likely to be listed on May 8.The petition by NGO, Civil Safety Council of India, challenged the Delhi government and its Excise Department's decision to open liquor shops in the city from Tuesday “without any planning and crowd management”. The plea, filed through advocate Arvind Vashistha, said the people of Delhi are facing complete lockdown for the last so many days but the May 3 notification regarding opening of liquor shops has failed the whole system, set up by the state, and it is going waste and putting the life of citizens in danger.“Liquor consumption is not in consonance with the directive principles of state policy, under which improving public health is among the primary duties of the state. This would include prohibition of intoxicating drinks and drugs, which are injurious to health,” the plea said.It said due to this decision, a large number of persons have lined up outside liquor shops in the city for the second consecutive day, when they were re-opened after a 40-day dry spell because of the coronavirus lockdown.The plea said that on May 4, the authorities imposed a 'special corona fees' of 70 per cent tax on MRP of all liquor brands but even then the public gathered at outside liquor shops in huge number without following the social distancing guidelines. “Instead of closing the shops, the government increased the tax on it but the situation is the same,” it said, adding that the steps taken by the Delhi government will be more critical and there are full chances of increase in coronavirus or COVID-19 cases.

06-05-2020||---||Analysing Kautilya from a wider perspective||New Delhi, May 6The Covid-impacted months of March and April have been cruel for Indology as they snatched away two masters of this field—Michael Leibig and Dietmar Rothermund, both from Germany.Michael Leibig was a German scholar of Kautilya, who passed away on April 15 after a long illness, borne with fortitude. He was 69. A month earlier, Dietmar Rothermund, one of the world’s top scholars on Indology and senior to Leibig by nearly two decades, also passed away in Germany.Fittingly, Leibig, a fan of Kautilya’s Arthashastra, was Fellow and Lecturer at the world’s oldest university in Heidelburg where Rothermund was Professor Emeritus at its prestigious South Asia Institute (SAI). This was where after abandoning a career in journalism that Liebig was awarded a PhD for a thesis offering new insights often overlooked by shallow analysis by British and other scholars who misread Kautilya as a precursor of Machiavelli. It was after a visit to India that he decided to study Kautilya and approached the Arthashastra as a political scientist, comparing the English and German translations and developing new insights that connected with the observations that Max Weber offered in his 1916-17 essays on Hinduism.Thereafter, Liebig worked closely with IDSA’s major ‘Indigenous Knowledge’ project, its leading scholars, and others. His would blend domain expertise into these translations, teasing out the concepts embedded in Kautilya’s 6,000 aphorisms of prose (sutras). This included acknowledging Kautilya as the first proponent of a raison d’état doctrine, entirely original in his analysis of warfare (including humane treatment of the people of a defeated opponent kingdom), paralleling the much sparser text in Sun Tzu’s Art of Warfare. Kautilya was also credited with a pioneering the science of intelligence gathering. Liebig’s works include “Kautilya’s Arthashastra: An Intellectual Portrait” (co-authored with Subrata K Mitra) and “Comparing Kautilya with Sun-Tzu, Nizam al-Mulk, Barani and Machiavelli”.While Leibig remained active on the seminar circuit, diversifying onto other topics, including internal security, his seminal contribution continued to be advancing the view of Max Weber on Arthashastra. During his lectures, recalled a former student, Leibig veered away from the Hindutva view that Kautilya’s thesis on public administration was junked by the Mughals and the British. Rather, he emphasised that many of its elements were incorporated.Rothermund was of an earlier era and a personal acquaintance of former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. A classicist academic unlike Leibig who drifted in from journalism, Rothermund is especially remembered for co-authoring “A history of India” that examined the major political, economic, social and cultural forces shaping the history of the subcontinent with the fourth volume also taking into account the recent developments such as in Kashmir.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/analysing-kautilya-from-a-wider-perspective-81204

However, this year there was relatively higher snow in April due to western disturbances and because of that we are continuing to issue avalanche warnings which we normally do till April,” he added.Avalanche warnings are issued everyday to the armed forces as well as state governments, identifying the likely areas to experience an avalanche and forecasting the level of danger, so that preventive and cautionary measures can be taken.SASE is a laboratory under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) that is enagged in mountain meteorology, avalanche forecasting, artificial triggering and structural control in snowbound areas. SASE has developed its own statistical model for seasonal winter precipitation forecast over western Himalayas.Based on this model, the precipitation forecast for the winter season of 2019-20 was “good” for western Himalayas, with chances of less snowfall during mid of February to mid of March this year. In November 2019, Himalayas had received unprecedently high snowfall. The area has experienced 10 avalanches during the winters.Good snowfall in the mountains will have a favourable impact on the availability of fresh water in the summers. Already, the Bhakra Beas Management Board, which manages two major reservoirs on the Sutlej and the Beas in Himachal, is expecting above-high inflows in the summers.While the snowfall was in excess in the beginning of the winters, it became deficient in mid-winters, particularly in the month of February 2020 which otherwise is known as the month of highest snowfall in western and central Himalayas.Observations show that Dhundi station near Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh received the highest cumulative snowfall of 1,220 cm while Bahang, the headquarters of SASE near Manali, received the lowest snowfall of 225 cm during the entire winter season.This year, SASE also initiated a series of training programs for quick reaction teams of various state agencies, including police, home guard and central armed police forces on the management and mitigation of avalanche hazards and carrying out rescue operations. SASE has already been imparting training to Army troops on avalanche safety, rescue and movement in avalanche-prone areas for the past many years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-himalayas-getting-unusually-higher-snow-in-april-sase-extends-avalanche-warning-period-81200

In Mumbai, local ward officers have been given powers to take over private hospitals and nursing homes to put up ICU beds.More than 25,000 doctors who operate as private practitioners in Mumbai have also been asked to sign up to treat patients affected by COVID-19 or risk having their licenses cancelled.“The number of patients testing positive for the virus has increased as we have increased the number of tests. The number of patients who are being cured of the disease has also gone up,” Thackeray said in his statement.The chief minister said the central government expects the number of patients to rise in May and hence the state government wanted to be ready with as many ICU beds as it can for COVID-19 patients.He added that the state government has already set up huge facilities for treating patients affected by the pandemic at Nehru Science Centre, Mahalaxmi Race Course, Nehru Planetarium, the Bombay Exhibition Centre, the MMRDA grounds at Bandra-Kurla Complex and other places.However, the number of patients is likely to increase as people are likely to return to Maharashtra from other parts of the country and abroad, Thackeray said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-maharashtra-runs-out-of-icu-beds-to-take-over-private-military-hospitals-81198

We should all be together in this fight. If the Congress cannot help the country, it should at least not try to weaken its fight against coronavirus,” he said.The entire country had complete faith in the Prime Minister and his efforts in this fight, he said.Hussain also criticised former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for telling the Congress CMs to hold meetings and make individual plans.“Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh raise a new question every day. Do they not have any constructive suggestion instead of trying to corner Prime Minister Modi who is doing his best in the fight against coronavirus?“The least they can do is not do politics on the issue by raising questions on the efforts of the government, divide the CMs on the basis of their political affiliations. Several of their (Congress) CMs have done good work by becoming a part of Team India,” the senior BJP leader said.Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday convened a meeting with the CMs of Congress-ruled states to take stock of the situation after the third lockdown was imposed by the Modi government.At the meeting, she also questioned the government on what would happen post May 17. “What after May 17? What criteria is the Centre using to judge how long the lockdown will continue?” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-accuses-sonia-of-weakening-fight-against-covid-by-talking-separately-to-cong-cms-81197

I will look into the complaints," Narayanan quoted Gangwar as saying to the union leaders.During the discussion, Gangwar also informed that the government would welcome any suggestion from the unions regarding the welfare of workers.The government is pro-active and progressively taking measures to ameliorate the lot of workers affected by the lockdown, said the minister.This was the first meeting of Gangwar with the union leaders post the lockdown.Representatives of INTUC, AITUC, CITU, HMS and TUCC also participated in the discussion.Notably, INTUC, which is affiliated to the Congress, was invited to the event by the Labour Ministry after a long interregnum. This was one of the flashpoints for the Left-leaning and other unions opposed to the BJP against the Union Government.During the discussion, AITUC and CITU representatives alleged that the government had betrayed the workers by leaving them in lurch - jobless and without money to starve. The BMS demanded, among others, framing of a National Register of Migrant Workers and formulation of a National Policy on them.BMS representative also demanded arrangement of transportation for workers at factory units when they start resumption of their operations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-ordinance-to-amend-labour-laws-gangwar-81194

Because States have been opposing that.So, this is not the time to discuss or take a decision to bring them under GST”, the former Union Oil Minister told PTI.The former Karnataka Chief Minister said he does not expect forward movement on the proposal for a year or two due to unwillingness of the states.BJP Spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member G V L Narasimha Rao said the Union Government had on many occasions proposed bringing petroleum and liquor under GST but the states were reluctant contending that they were their major source of revenue and they cannot allow these two items.“So, the Central government was always willing and keen."But the State Governments had put their foot down."So, obviously, all decisions are made by GST Council by consensus. We could not arrive at a consensus with State governments on this”, Rao told PTI.He, however, said, “This is a matter that can be considered in future GST council meetings. GST Council, whenever it meets, may relook at the possibility but States are reluctant."So, I don’t think this fructifying in the near future”.Industry body ASSOCHAM said on Tuesday sooner petrol and diesel are brought under the GST (Goods and Services Tax), better it would be for the Indian economy.According to ASSOCHAM Secretary General Deepak Sood, governments, both at the Centre and States have been over- dependent on petrol and diesel for revenue.“While this over-dependence needs to be brought down, there is a strong case for a national parity for the prices of the automobile fuel”, Sood said.“Otherwise, the broader objective of a single market under the GST remains unfulfilled”.He said the industry has been seeking a bold stimulus package for providing immediate relief as it was reeling under the 42-day lockdown, due to the Covid-19 crisis.One of the main reasons for the stimulus is to revive the demand by way of tax reductions.“But, on the contrary, if taxes are raised, demand would be further depressed, giving a jolt to the economy”, Sood said.In any case, the crude oil prices have crashed to unprecedented lows, without the pump prices being reduced, against the spirit of the market-driven pricing policy, the ASSOCHAM said.

06-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Council poll to mark Uddhav Thackeray’s debut as legislator||The upcoming biennial election to the Maharashtra Legislative Council will provide an opportunity to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to mark his debut as a legislator, and it will also be interesting to see if there there will be a contest for nine seats which are up for grabs.Efforts are on to ensure nominees for the nine vacancies are elected unopposed, a Congress leader said.But, if the situation of a contest arises, all the 288 MLAs, who form the electoral college for the Council polls, will have to come to Mumbai to cast their vote.If the lockdown is extended beyond May 17, it could be difficult for MLAs to travel to Mumbai.“All the parties will have to take a decision on avoiding a contest and efforts are on in that direction,” a Congress leader said, adding that state party unit president Balasaheb Thorat met NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday.Later, leaders of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress), including Chief Minister Thackeray, held a meeting to discuss the strategy for the Council polls.Thorat told PTI late on Tuesday night that the MVA allies have decided to contest the polls together and field six candidates, two from each alliance party.The opposition BJP is also firm on contesting four seats, and it is up to the government to ensure nominees get elected unopposed, a source in the saffron party said.“If the MVA contests six seats, there will be an election. The BJP will field four candidates. There is no doubt about it,” the source said.Elections to the nine Council seats which fell vacant on April 24 were postponed in view of the coronavirus outbreak, but last week the Election Commission (EC) set May 21 as the poll date.This was after Governor B S Koshyari acted on a letter of the chief minister and urged the EC to hold the elections to allow Thackeray, who is at present not a member of either of the House of the Legislature, to fulfil the constitutional obligation of getting elected as a legislator.Thackeray took oath as chief minister on November 28 last year and per constitutional norms, he has to become member of the legislature within six months to continue in the post.The Shiv Sena has decided to field Thackeray and Council Deputy Chairperson Neelam Gorhe in the polls.The NCP is likely to retain Hemant Takle for another term, but has not declared its candidates so far.The Congress has also not announced its nominees, but senior party leader Naseem Khan, who lost the last year’s Assembly polls, is among the front-runners.Senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse said he has conveyed to his party that he is interested in being a member of the Legislative Council.“I am interested in state politics and I want to be a member of the Legislative Council,” he told PTI.Khadse said the BJP can win four seats as it has 105 members in the Assembly, and 11 members of smaller parties and Independents are also supporting the BJP.“These members have given in writing that they will be with the BJP on the floor of the House,” he said.The quota for a winning candidate is 29 votes.If the MVA contests six seats, it will need 174 votes while the BJP will need 116 votes.During the MVA government’s trust vote in the state Assembly last year, the ruling alliance had got 169 votes.The MLCs whose terms ended on April 24 are - Neelam Gorhe (Shiv Sena), Chandrakant Raghuvanshi and Haribhau Rathod (Congress), Kiran Pawaskar, Hemant Takle, Anand Thakur (NCP), Smita Wagh, Prithviraj Deshmukh and Arun Adsad (BJP).In the 288-member state Assembly, party-wise position is as follows: BJP-105, Shiv Sena-56, NCP-54, Congress-44, Bahujan Vikas Aghadi-three, Samajwadi Party, Prahar Janshakti Party and AIMIM-two each, Peasants and Workers Party, Swabhimani Paksh, Krantikari Shetkari Paksh, Rashtriya Samaj Paksh, Jansurajya Shakti Party, CPM, MNS-one each and Independents-13.The notification for the Council polls on issued on May 4. The last day of filing nominations is May 11. The scrutiny of papers will be done on May 12 and nominations can be withdrawn till May 14.The polls are scheduled for May 21 and results will be announced the same day.

Highly scurrilous and scandalous allegations have been levelled against the two judges of this court. In our view, the entire contents of the complaints amount to contempt," it had said, adding the contemnors were fighting a proxy battle for Nedumpara.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-gives-three-month-jail-to-3-men-for-scandalous-allegations-against-judges-81147
06-05-2020||New Delhi||Paying for migrants to return home, Rs 870 a ticket: Amarinder||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh on Wednesday told the meeting held by Congress President Sonia Gandhi that the Railways were charging Rs 870 a ticket to take migrants to their native places and the state government was paying the amount.All Congress-ruled states said arrangements were being made to ensure migrants returned home free.Pegging the April revenue shortfall for the state at 88 per cent, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said with all tax revenues dried up and only 1.5 per cent of the industry currently operational, Punjab was facing a difficult financial situation, which was compounded by absence of aid from the Central government.Participating in a video conference of chief ministers of Congress-ruled states with party president Sonia Gandhi, along with Dr Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi, Capt Amarinder shared his state’s Covid containment strategy and the roadmap for economic revival.During the meeting, Sonia asked the chief minister to convey her congratulations to the farmers of Punjab for a smooth procurement season, with the latter disclosing that more than 100 lakh MT had arrived in the mandis already, and the entire procurement process was expected to be completed by mid-May.States assured Sonia Gandhi that they had decided to pay for the travel of migrant labourers and had asked the Railways for special trains.Punjab CM said that Rs 35 Crore had been set aside and Railways was charging Rs 870 per ticket, which the state was paying.Singh on Wednesday said that the state had set up two committees, one to strategise on how to come out of lockdown and another on economic revival.Singh made the remarks during Congress President Sonia Gandhi's interaction with the Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled states on the management of COVID-19 and the post-May 17 challenges.“Concern is people sitting in Delhi are deciding on classification of zones without knowing what’s happening on the ground,” added Singh. Also read: ‘Centre should let the CMs do what they know best’: Capt Amarinder SinghAddressing the CMs, Gandhi asked what criteria the government would adopt to continue or discontinue the lockdown.“After May 17th, what? And after May 17th, how? What criteria is GOI using to judge how long the lockdown is to continue?” she asked.Former PM Manmohan Singh, who also joined the web meeting, seconded Gandhi and said, “We need to know, as Soniaji said, what will happen after lockdown 3.0?”Speaking first Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot demanded a stimulus package.He said, “Until an extensive stimulus package is given, how will states and country run? We have lost Rs 10,000 crore of revenue. States have repeatedly requested PM for a package but we are yet to hear from GOI.”Capt. Amarinder Singh says, “We have set up two committees, one to strategise on how to come out of lockdown & other on economic revival.”“Concern is people sitting in Delhi are deciding on classification of zones without knowing what’s happening on the ground.”  Live updates:Gandhi also thanked farmers, particularly of Punjab and Haryana, for “ensuring food security by bumper wheat crop, despite all odds.”Puducherry CM SV. Narayanasamy says, “Government of India is deciding on zones without consulting the States and this is creating anomalous situation. People sitting in Delhi can’t tell the States, No State or CM is consulted. Why? PM isn’t saying a word on economic package for States.”Manmohan Singh says, “Sonia Gandhi has already pointed out. CMs need to deliberate and ask as to what is the strategy of Government of India to get the country out of lockdown?”Rahul Gandhi says, “The central piece of strategy to fight covid is to protect the elderly as also those who are diabetic and with heart condition.”Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel says, “States are facing dire economic crisis. They need to be provided immediate assistance.”“Chattisgarh is one state where 80% of Small Industries have restarted & nearly 85,000 workers have returned to work.”Former minister P. Chidambaram said,"States are bleeding in terms of finances but no money is being allocated by GOI. A number of newspapers have brought out the unavailability of finances with States.”Senior Congress leader Veerappa Moily said, "Strategy to declare lockout or come out of it hasn’t been stated at all by Prime Minister or changed at all.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/paying-for-migrants-to-return-home-rs-870-a-ticket-amarinder-81143

Team Aarogya Setu assures everyone that no data or security breach has been identified," the government said through the app's Twitter handle.The tweet gave point-by-point clarification on the red flags raised by the hacker."We discussed with the hacker and were made aware of the following...the app fetches user location on a few occasions," it said, but added that this was by design and is clearly detailed in the privacy policy.The app fetches users' location and stores on the server in a secure, encrypted, anonymised manner - at the time of registration, at the time of self-assessment, when users submit their contact tracing data voluntarily through the app or when it fetches the contact tracing data of users after they have turned COVID-19 positive, it said.On another issue that users can get COVID-19 stats displayed on the home screen by changing the radius and latitude-longitude using a script, Aarogya Setu said all this information is already public for all locations and hence does not compromise on any personal or sensitive data."We thank the ethical hacker on engaging with us. We encourage any users who identify a vulnerability to inform us immediately...," it said.Responding to Aarogya Setu's clarification, Alderson tweeted, "I will come back to you tomorrow".

06-05-2020||New Delhi||Nationwide tally crosses 50k ; Health workers, security personnel among infected||The nationwide tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases crossed the 50,000 mark on Wednesday with a large number of healthcare professionals and security personnel testing positive amid the worsening spread of the deadly virus, while authorities also flagged high fatality rate in states like West Bengal, Gujarat and Maharashtra.While some positive news came from Kerala with no new infection getting detected there despite the state being among the first ones to witness the spread, Maharashtra reported a record daily increase of more than 1,200 in its number of cases. The economic cost of the pandemic also began to hit the people with a sharp increase in fuel prices.Looking to shore up their dwindling resources, more states announced higher taxes on liquor sales, while Punjab pegged its overall revenue loss for the month of April at 88 per cent due to all its tax revenues having dried up and only 1.5 per cent the industry being operational.Industry sources in various parts of the country said they were wary of opening their plants and offices due to concerns over movement of their staff, suppliers, transporters and vendors till the nationwide lockdown, which has been in force since March 25, gets completely lifted.While announcing the third phase of the lockdown till May 17, the government had given several relaxations for getting industrial and agricultural activities restarted, but not much have changed on the ground with only a few companies, especially in the manufacturing sector, resuming their operations in a limited way.The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India on Wednesday said it would resume operations at its Manesar plant in Haryana from May 12.There are widespread fears that the virus spread may get worse with easing of the lockdown measures as yet, as the number of cases have been rising continuously across most of the major urban centres of the country.While the Union Health Ministry stopped giving an evening update of the COVID-19 tally from Wednesday, its morning update showed the death rising to 1,694 and the number of cases climbing to 49,391, registering an increase of 126 deaths and 2,958 cases since Tuesday morning. It also showed more than 15,000 people having recovered, giving a recovery rate of nearly 29 per cent.However, a PTI tally of figures reported by different states and union territories till 9 PM put the total number of confirmed cases at 51,435 and the death toll at 1,694.While Maharashtra has reported the maximum number of cases and fatalities, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka and Punjab are among other major states affected badly by the virus.Kerala also has reported more than 500 confirmed cases so far, but it did not report a single new case on Wednesday and the state government officials said the number of active patients is now only 30 as a big majority of COVID-19 patients have recovered.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan also expressed concern over the high fatality rate among COVID-19 patients in some districts of Maharashtra and Gujarat and asked the states to focus on early surveillance, aggressive contact tracing and early diagnosis to reduce the number of deaths in the areas.Maharashtra reported 1,233 new COVID-19 cases -- a new single-day high -- taking its tally to 16,758, while 34 more deaths raised the toll to 651, a health department official said. Mumbai alone has more than 10,500 cases now.Gujarat reported 380 new cases and 28 more deaths during the day, taking its total case count to 6,625 and the number of fatalities to 396. This included 291 new cases and 25 more deaths in Ahmedabad alone, where the civic authorities have ordered closure of all shops except those selling milk and medicines for a week.Separately, the Union Home Ministry wrote to the West Bengal government that the COVID-19 response in the state was characterised by a very low rate of testing and a very high rate of mortality of 13.2 per cent, which it said was by far the highest for any state.The ministry also flagged instances of overcrowding in markets, free movement of people in large numbers without masks, bathing of people in rivers, people playing cricket and football, serious laxity in enforcing lockdown measures in containment zones, plying of rickshaws without any restriction, saying these were grave violation of lockdown instructions and social distancing norms.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said her government has identified over 92,000 cases of influenza-like illness and 870 people with severe acute respiratory illness across the state, findings that serve as "early warning signals" in the fight against COVID-19.Banerjee said the results were the outcome of her government's extensive door-to-door surveillance over the last one month, covering over 5.5 crore households, and the exercise will continue "till the virus is defeated".Official sources said around 548 doctors, nurses and paramedics across the country have been found to be positive for the virus infection so far. This includes 69 doctors in the national capital. However, this figure does not include field workers, ward boys, sanitation workers, security guards, lab attendants, peons, laundry and kitchen staff among others and the figures may be much higher after taking these people into account.Also, at least 154 personnel of the Border Security Force (BSF) have tested positive for coronavirus, including 85 cases that were detected on Wednesday. These include more than 60 deployed for law and order duties in the Jamia and Chandni Mahal area of the national capital, and six from the escort team of the inter-ministerial central team (IMCT) that toured West Bengal to check COVID-19 containment measures in the state.At least 37 infected personnel are from the Tripura frontier of the force.In the meantime, the Delhi government ordered the release of 4,000 Tablighi members who have completed their required quarantine period in centres in the national capital, sources said. A huge congregation of 'Tablighi Jamaat' in Delhi's Nizamuddin area earlier in March was seen as a major hotspot for the virus spread, after which there were also several cases of Muslims getting targeted and blamed by some for the pandemic.Thousands of the Jamaat members were subsequently traced in various parts of the country and quarantined, including around 4,000 in Delhi itself.While nearly 900 of those being released from quarantine are from Delhi itself, the rest are from other states and would be sent back to their home states. A majority of them hail from Tamil Nadu and Telangana. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nationwide-tally-crosses-50k-health-workers-security-personnel-among-infected-81132

06-05-2020||Vibha Sharma||Gujarat govt faces criticism as Covid-19 cases surge||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 6While the pandemic politics rages in the TMC-ruled West Bengal — where the BJP is accusing the “inefficient” Chief Minister of a “Covid-19 data cover up” — in the saffron-ruled Gujarat, which is close to the top in the list of states with the highest number of coronavirus cases and mortality, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani is facing no such visible political crisis.  The home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah has also been witness to unrest and violent protests by migrant labourers. On Monday, a large group clashed with the police in Surat demanding that they be sent home. It was the fourth such instance in the city where a large number of migrants from other states work in diamond and textile industries. Rupani's response to the crisis as also the time his government “wasted” in organising the ‘Namaste Trump’ event and “engineering defections” to deny the Congress party one seat in Rajya Sabha is under criticism. But with rivals seemingly in disarray, especially after the Rajya Sabha episode, there is no immediate threat to the government.Prime Minister Modi’s “popularity” and Home Minister Shah’s “direct control” is holding Gujarat for the BJP, say state leaders. “Gujarat is being run by officials handpicked by Modi and Shah," they say.Despite these advantages, observers warn that the BJP will have to redefine itself if it wants to retain the state. The Lok Sabha elections may be four years away but a CM not seen delivering at the time of a crisis is bad news, they say, citing the example of the non-BJP CMs like Amarinder Singh in Punjab, Pinarayi Vijayan in Kerala, Uddhav Thackeray in Maharashtra and Ashok Gehlot in Rajasthan, who all have been appreciated for their proactive response. “Something will have to be done in Gujarat before it goes to poll, like putting up a strong face. Voters are reacting differently in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. They may want Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister but they also want a strong Chief Ministerial face in the state,” they say.In fact, the Covid-19 response of the respective Chief Ministers is expected to reflect in the Assembly elections due next in Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-govt-faces-criticism-as-covid-19-cases-surge-81125

We are still talking about 1 per cent of the GDP. The US has gone for 10 per cent of the GDP. — Abhijit Banerjee, Nobel LaureateIn a 25-minute conversation with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Banerjee argued for putting money in the hands of bottom 60 per cent people to spur demand. He also said had Aadhaar-linked entitlements been used, much of food insecurity around Covid and related misery could have been avoided. The noted economist was not too excited about Congress engagement with a credit package for MSMEs and said money in the hands of people was better.Cautioning against a hasty retreat from the current lockdown, Banerjee said any decision in this respect must depend on the time path of the disease.“We should try to be optimistic about the survival of the overall wellbeing of the country. We need a stimulus package. That’s what the US and Japan is doing. We haven’t yet decided about a large stimulus package. We are still talking about 1% of the GDP. The US has gone for 10% of the GDP,” he said.On MSMEs he called for cancellation of debt payments for the quarter.When Gandhi cited minimum income guarantee plan to the poorest as a solution in Covid times, Banerjee pitched for a broader base for a financial package.“Targeting is extremely costly. Give the bottom 60 per cent of the population. Nothing bad will happen. It would work as a stimulus,” Banerjee said adding that the government should not worry too much about checking people’s locus standi to get the money.The ace economist also warned the government against inducing a mismatch of demand and supply by giving people spending power where the entire retail sector is shut down. That will burn the money, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/large-stimulus-package-needed-says-banerjee-80865

Another two ships could soon be sailing off to bring back people from countries around the Persian Gulf.Also, Air India will operate 64 international flights from May 7 to 13 to bring back some of the stranded Indians from a dozen countries, including the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the US, Singapore and the UK.Passengers will have to pay for their tickets which, as per initial announcements, from Indian missions in two countries, are at least 25 per cent higher than normal fare. However, unlike the trains for migrants, some flights will carry those who are in India but have long term visas and work opportunities outside and want to return.Sources clarified that this was not a government-sponsored operations but one meant to facilitate the return of distressed Indians, who are paying for their passage.Making the announcement, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri held out the hope of private airlines joining in the extraction of Indians stranded in several other countries. The minister’s hint about involving private airlines will not just lift the spirits of stranded Indians, but also provide business to them. All domestic airlines have shelved operations since March 25 leading to losses.The initiative is being coordinated by the Ministries of Defence, External Affairs, Home Affairs and Health besides various other agencies of the Central and state governments. The MEA will appoint senior nodal officers for all the states and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla will hold a videoconference with state chief secretaries on arrangements.If the world-wide lockdown on international flights continues, India may have to mount several hundred flights to evacuate just the most distressed of its nationals.The announcement left stranded Indians in several other countries complaining of neglect on social media. But it has also come as a major relief for many such as the pregnant wife of one Hemant Tripathi who was stuck in Jeddah.The Indian Navy has launched Operation Samudra Setu by sending two ships to Maldives to bring back some of the emergency cases under phase I.10 flights for UAEMaximum 10 flights are planned to the UAE, followed by seven each to the UK, the US, Bangladesh and Malaysia, five each to Kuwait, Singapore Saudi Arabia and the Philippines, and two each to Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.

06-05-2020||9% daily rate of growth in cases||194 deaths in a day, 72 in West Bengal alone||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 5The country saw its highest 24-hour spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths today with the Centre attributing the surge largely to delayed reporting by states like West Bengal that had so far not been disclosing the data in detail.The new cases of infection rose by 3,875 today, taking the national disease burden to 46,711 and the 24-hour increase in mortality was a whopping 194, more than double the count of 83 deaths reported yesterday. The death toll has risen to 1,583.People’s support mustWe need community ownership to break the chain of transmission. As lockdown is eased, the responsibility of both people and the govt increases. Lav Agarwal, Health Ministry Joint Secretary In worrying signs, the daily rate of growth in cases today clocked 9 per cent, the highest in two weeks. Another concern was the gradually peaking disease graph that had flattened and stabilised for days until the eve of lockdown 2.0. For the fourth day in a row today, daily new infections have risen, setting new records and baffling experts who had predicted regression in the disease curve after a stable flat spell.Harsh Vardhan, Union Health MinisterNo community spreadBehavioural changes we have adopted will become the new normal. We have so far been able to avoid community transmission of the virus.“We have noted the highest increase in cases and deaths today. Timely reporting of cases is very important. Some states did not report the data initially. These gaps have now been addressed and late reporting by states streamlined. You are witnessing this increase because of reporting of previously hidden cases,” Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said today, explaining the curious surge amid the ongoing lockdown.Government sources said West Bengal was the main state hiding data from the central reporting system. Health Ministry sources said Bengal had not shared information with the Centre from May 1 until last evening, when the spike in cases and deaths became obvious.The mortality figures in Bengal alone rose by 72 in a day – from 61 yesterday to 133 today. Although part of the case surge could be linked to lockdown relaxations with people queuing up outside liquor vends, and some movement becoming visible in green and orange zones, the Health Ministry said the increase in case burden was due to previously hidden data becoming public now.Agarwal said timely reporting of cases was critical as it was the first step towards initiation of contact tracing, containment and management.Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary also accused the TMC- led Bengal Government of instructing local hospitals against reporting Covid deaths or mentioning Covid as the reason in death certificates of patients.Earlier the Inter-Ministerial Central Team that visited Bengal to help the state with Covid containment also faced hurdles in operation.With the disease curve surging for four days now, the Centre today pressed for community responsibility to fight the virus.“We need community ownership to break the chain of transmission. As lockdown is eased and relaxations set in, the responsibility of both the people and the government increases,” Agarwal said, not ruling out some of the infection surge to dilution in lockdown.The national recovery rate increasing to 27 per cent. The mortality rate, however, surged beyond 3.2 per cent.Israel lab develops coronavirus antibody Indian-origin scientist ‘identifies’ 4 drugsIndian-origin researcher Kamlendra Singh and his team have identified four antiviral drugs, including remdesivir, 5-fluorouracil, ribavirin and favipiravir, which may inhibit replication of coronavirus.
