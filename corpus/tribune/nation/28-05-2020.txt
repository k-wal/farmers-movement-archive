Pakistan’s Foreign Office may take time out and read its own constitution to realise the difference,” said the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson.The spokesperson also replied back to the statement casting aspersions on the Supreme Court for its November 9, 2019, judgment clearing the way for construction of a Ram Temple on two counts – failing to uphold the demands of justice and making clear that the minorities are not safe in India.“Given its record, Pakistan should be embarrassed to even mention minorities. After all, numbers don’t lie even if they do,” said the spokesperson.“As for the judiciary, Pakistan must realise that theirs is thankfully not the norm. There are others elsewhere with credibility and integrity that Pakistan understandably finds difficult to recognise,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-hits-out-at-pak-over-ram-temple-comment-91188

28-05-2020||Bengaluru||Karnataka for scaling down flights from 5 states with high prevalence of COVID cases||The Karnataka Government on Thursday pitched for down scaling air travel from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, saying a large number of people arriving from these states have tested positive for COVID-19 and it would be difficult to manage quarantine if more arrived.The government has requested the Civil Aviation Ministry to reduce the number of flights from these states in view of high prevalence of coronavirus cases there, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister JC Madhuswamy said in a statement.Earlier, speaking to reporters after a Cabinet meeting, the minister said the government had decided to "suspend" air traffic from these states."People are coming from other states to Karnataka.... we have decided to suspend air traffic from five states, as cases here (Karnataka) may further increase," he said.In the statement released later, he clarified that the government has not sought a ban on flights emanating from these five states."Karnataka has appealed to the Civil Aviation Ministry to take steps to lessen the air traffic to the state, with the sacred intention that there may not be adequate quarantine facilities, if there is huge turnout at a short span of time,” said the minister.Domestic air travel resumed in the country only on Monday after nearly two months of COVID-19 induced lockdown with Karnataka stipulating seven days institutional quarantine for passengers coming from seven states, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, which have high prevalence of cases.During the media interaction, Madhuswamy also said the existing restrictions on entry of people by road from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat into Karnataka would continue until further orders."...because large number of people who have come from these states have tested positive and it will be difficult to manage quarantine if more people come. Until some people who are currently in quarantine go home after their quarantine period ends, we have decided to stop (arrivals) by imposing restriction," the minister added.Karnataka had on May 18 barred entry of people from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, which have COVID-19 cases in five figures.The government is likely to decide on allowing trains from these states once the services resume on June 1.However, responding to a question, Madhuswamy said there would be restriction on entry of people by road, air and train from Maharashtra for some time as the recent spike in positive cases in Karnataka was due to returnees from the western state.Pointing out that the load of cases has increased, particularity among those coming from Maharashtra, he said asymptomatic cases had gone up and it has become inevitable to test all those in quarantine.He said those already in quarantine were also unhappy over passengers arriving fresh being accommodated along with them."So the plan is that after the current set of people are relieved, we will allow the next set of people from these states, until then we will have restrictions," he said.

The summit was to be an annual affair, but has not been held for over two years due to a stalemate on talks for a free trade agreement (FTA).New Delhi was keen on tapping the EU for higher technology as well as stave off criticism over Kashmir and Citizenship Amendment Act by positioning itself for greater intensity in EU-India ties. After the Covid pandemic, the EU urgently needs a step in trade which could thaw the freeze in talks on the FTA.Borrell thanked Jaishankar for India’s assistance in facilitating the repatriation of over 11,000 EU tourists and both agreed on the need to ensure the flow of crucial medical supplies, and on keeping global trade and value chains open.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-eu-discuss-preparations-for-summit-meeting-91172
28-05-2020||New Delhi||HCQ should be used as per guidelines, its benefits outweighs risks: Niti Aayog member||As per the current available data, benefits of anti-malarial drug Hydroxychroloquine (HCQ) "outweighs" the risks, if any, Niti Aayog member V K Paul said on Thursday, asserting it should be used as per guidelines and recommendations made by the scientific community.The drug has been recommended by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) as prophylaxis for COVID-19 among healthcare and frontline workers, and also for clinical management of patients, he said.Responding to a question over the government's stand on the use of HCQ in COVID-19 cases after the WHO temporarily suspended its use in the clinical trials citing safety concerns, Paul said it can be used as per the guidelines issued by the ICMR, taking all precautions as mentioned by the apex health research body."According to current available data and knowledge, the benefits of Hydroxychroloquine outweighs risks if any. We want it to be used as per guidelines and recommendations made by the scientific community," Paul, who is also the chairman of Empowered Group-1, said.He said that the World Health Organisation (WHO) was not the only platform where the drug was being tried. The medicine was being tried and looked at in several other countries as a potential treatment for COVID-19, Paul said.He said Hydroxychloroquine is a familiar drug and is widely used for malaria and in other auto-immune disease like rheumatoid arthritis.It is produced in large quantities in the country, is inexpensive and has strong plausibility, he said, adding that research will reveal new things."And, we will get to know more about its effectiveness against the coronavirus as it a new virus. At this stage, whatever guidelines have been provided by the scientific community, we consider it appropriate and it should be used by healthcare workers and frontline workers as a preventive medication against the coronavirus infection as per the prescribed guidelines,” Paul said."The drug is also being used in clinical management of COVID-19 as per clinical protocol. As per the emerging relevant data we will keep advising further accordingly. Have faith, we are using it responsibly based on current available knowledge," he said.Paul said several other drugs favipiravir, itolizumab, phytopharmaceutical (a plant-based drug), convalescent plasma, remdesivir and the BCG vaccine are being looked at and are in advance stages of trials."Eight vaccine candidates in the world, of which four are in relatively advanced stages," he said In response to a question on whether the novel coronavirus has mutated over the last few months, Principal Scientific Adviser K Vijay Raghavan said, "We have not seen any change in the fundamental properties of the virus till now." Highlighting the importance of the RT-PCR test in detection of COVID-19, Raghavan said it tests for the presence of the virus' genetic material."It is agnostic to whether you have symptoms or not. Even you are asymptomatic, if the virus is there in the body, the RT-PCR will pick it up with great likelihood,” he said.On Tuesday, DG ICMR Dr Balram Bhargava had said that no major side-effects of the anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been found in studies in India and its use can be continued as prophylaxis for COVID-19 under strict medical supervision.He said it has been "clearly advised that HCQ should be taken with food, not on empty stomach"."We also emphasised that one ECG should be done during the treatment. We expanded use of HCQ from healthcare workers to front-line workers also, considering the potential benefits," he added.The ICMR in its revised advisory on May 22 recommended use of the drug as a preventive medication for COVID-19 for asymptomatic healthcare workers working in non-COVID hospitals and frontline staff on surveillance duty in containment zones and paramilitary/police personnel involved in coronavirus infection related activities.The drug is also recommended for all asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in containment and treatment of COVID-19 and household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.The Union health ministry on March 31 in its ''Clinical Management of COVID - 19' had also recommended use of the drug Hydroxychloroquine in combination with Azithromycin on COVID-19 affected patients suffering with severe disease and requiring ICU management.

During the search, a man, later identified as Rohit, was found hiding in the house,” Chauhan said.“When the police questioned the accused why he entered the house and tried to steal things from there, he said that he used to work as a driver in the city before the lockdown.However, he was rendered jobless ever since the lockdown came into force two months back,” she said.“The accused told us that his financial condition is very bad and his family is finding it hard to arrange food. He said that the Indore Municipal Corporation had provided free ration to his family once, which was now over,” she said.According to her, when the police visited Rohit’s house as part of the probe, they found his elderly mother and young brother there. The police found that what the accused had told them about his family’s financial condition was true.“After coming to know about their situation, we made arrangements of ration for the poor family on humanitarian grounds,” Chauhan added.However, since theft is a criminal act, appropriate legal action was taken against the accused, she said.“He could have asked for help from other people instead of trying to steal,” she said.A case was registered against the accused under IPC sections 380 (theft), 454 (forcible entry into the house) and section 511 (attempt to commit offenses punishable with life imprisonment or other imprisonment), Chauhan said.He was produced in a local court on Wednesday, which remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days, she added.

And for the Congress at this time to indulge in political slander is unfortunate but expected,” Irani said.The Congress president in a video message, posted as part of her party’s ‘Speak Up India’ campaign launched on Thursday, also demanded that the government should provide Rs 7,500 to each needy family for the next six months.

A rescue team was then summoned for the operation to nab the cat.Two weeks earlier too, on May 14, a leopard was spotted on a road in Mailardevpally area near here creating panic among the local residents. But it was never captured and it escaped into the jungle.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/leopard-strays-into-habitation-injures-two-during-rescue-in-telangana-91162
28-05-2020||New Delhi||India acted as ‘pharmacy of the world’ in response to COVID-19: MEA||India has acted as the “pharmacy of the world” and healthcare supplier to all parts of the globe in response to COVID-19, the External Affairs Ministry said on Thursday.In a virtual address on ‘Enhancing Economic Engagement with Diaspora in and post-COVID-19 world’, Sanjay Bhattacharyya, Secretary (overseas Indian affairs and consular passports visas) in the External Affairs Ministry, said India had the ability to be a bridge between the developed and developing world and facilitating a two-way flow of information, products and expertise.“India has acted as the pharmacy of the world and healthcare supplier to all parts of the globe. India has the ability to be a bridge between the developed and developing world and facilitating a two-way flow of information, products and expertise. There is growing interest in yoga and ayurveda,” he said.He said on the diplomatic front, India had been actively engaged through the new medium of virtual contacts on phone and video.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi and EAM (S Jaishankar) have had discussions with their counterparts in various countries not only to share experiences of coronavirus and ways to deal with it but also to develop a positive agenda for the post COVID-19 period,” a statement by the External Affairs Ministry quoted him as saying.“We have engaged to give new momentum to regional and plurilateral groupings such as SAARC, BRICS, G-20 as well as in UN agencies. Bilaterally, EAM has even held Joint Commission meetings and we are preparing for a Summit meeting soon,” he said.Bhattacharyya said these exchanges had also helped shape informed and coordinated responses to the COVID—19 pandemic, such as evacuation of stranded nationals from each other’s territories; maintenance of critical supplies of life-saving medicines and food; extension and facilitation of visas for each other's nationals; and sharing of best practices by partner countries.He said in the initial assessment, based on inputs from Indian missions, it was found that India’s record of managing the pandemic of this scale with decisive and early steps — and a low per capita incidence and death rate — has drawn favourable international attention to its resolve and capabilities.“There is a significant market for food, agricultural products and food-processing industries. Indian automobiles, particularly low-cost automobiles, including two and three-wheelers will have an augmented market in developing countries. Textiles, garments and consumer durable industries will have export opportunities as many markets look to diversify their sources of supply,” he said.He further said that Indian e-commerce, IT and IT-enabled service industries had demonstrated that they could work through a crisis of this magnitude.“These are obviously the businesses of the future. Digital highways can be used to leverage our higher education capabilities through tele-education onto a much larger market,” he said.A major economic opportunity for India would arise from the drive to diversify global supply chains. The attractions of investing in India were obvious. It was a major opportunity and needed to be grasped, he added.“My own assessment is India will remain one of the fastest growing economies in post-COVID-19 scenario and economic growth will gain momentum in the medium to long-term," he said.

The ongoing second phase that will last till June 16, plans to bring back another one lakh Indians.So far in phase two, over 45,000 Indians have returned, including about 8,000 migrant workers, 7,656 students and over 5,000 professionals. About 5,000 have returned through land border immigration checkpoints from Nepal and Bangladesh.“A total of 3,08,200 persons have registered with our missions abroad for repatriation to India on compelling grounds,” said government sources. Unless international flights do not resume, the third phase will mean a logistical exercise that will dwarf phase two.In the current phase, 429 Air India flights from 60 countries will land in India. Besides, the Indian Navy will make four sorties to bring back returnees from Iran, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.The government is also assisting in the return of stranded Indians from remote locations in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and parts of Europe. This is being done by taking advantage of foreign carriers flying to India primarily for the evacuation of their nationals.Recently, about 300 stranded Indians from Peru, Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Portugal and Netherlands were brought in. We will be exploring more such options, said government sources.Private airlines have now been included and chartered flights have also begun to operate.“The numbers are expected to go up in the coming days with the permission for chartered flights and more efficient use of quarantine capacity,” said the sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-plans-for-third-phase-of-vande-bharat-mission-as-3-lakh-indians-want-to-return-91155

In this respect, said Shrivastav, the interlocutors scrupulously follow the consensus reached by the two leaders, Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping.Asked specifically about Trump’s offer for mediation, Shrivastav instead pointed out that India and China are engaged to peacefully resolve the issue. Trump had on Wednesday tweeted that he had spoken to both Beijing and New Delhi to mediate in, what he called, a “raging’’ dispute on the Sino-Indian border.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-for-direct-talks-with-china-on-lac-stand-off-91154

So, the focus of the lab is to ensure timely testing, therefore their focus is on detecting, preventing and treating the disease with timely as well as affordable testing.It can be noted that the council has also set up COVID-19 Taskforce under the chairmanship of K Vijay Raghavan, an IIT Kanpur alumnus and the principal scientific officer to the Centre, with 20 IIT directors as members, along with many other distinguished alumni of the institutes.“The IIT Alumni Council has decided to set up the largest genetic testing laboratory for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases after consulting global experts in the areas of virology, RT-PCR machine manufactures, test kits, pooling algorithms, AI, machine learning, robotics and microfluidics.“A dedicated team has already started work on designing the MegaLab Mumbai with a capacity of 10 million RT-PCR tests per month,” said Ravi Sharma, president of the IIT Alumni Council.“The MegaLab will be based on the end-to-end Kodoy indigenous technology stack and will have adequate capacity for testing the entire population of Mumbai for infectious diseases, once a month,” he added.The COVID-19 Taskforce, announced on March 25 itself — the day the first phase of the now-nine-weeks long national lockdown was announced, has various working groups involving over 1,000 dedicated alumni spread all over the world to finding/creating appropriate solutions to fight the pandemic.Apart from these, the council also set up digital Xray systems at the Poddar Hospital that uses AI to detect coronavirus for the first time in the country on April 23; on May 1, it also launched the country's first COVID Test Bus in the city and from May 10, they started the work on indigenising the test kits.The MegaLab Mumbai is the latest initiative of the IIT Alumni Council with an aim to design and establish the largest genetic testing laboratory for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases like tuberculosis with an end-to-end capacity to carry out over 10 million tests a month. It will comprise three independent lines – 1 million tests per month, 3 million and 6 million tests per month.The MegaLab will be based on the end-to-end Kodoy indigenous technology stack, and for implementation, the Kodoy stack is divided into 64 steps from (collection of) virus in the throat to the virus being ultimately zapped/disinfected by UV at the completion of testing in an RT-PCR.The testing infrastructure will comprise the vehicle-mounted automated sample collection stations in cars or cabs and COVID test buses, while the MegaLab will comprise robotic contactless sample transport from the vehicles to the testing line with robotic pooling followed by high-speed RNA extraction using magnetic bead technology.The IIT Alumni Council is the largest global body of alumni, students and faculty across all the 23 IITs with over 100 city chapters.

The California-based engineer Varun began chatting with the woman who identified herself as Keerthi Madhavaneni as a result both became close and would frequently chat over social media.The woman Malavika Devati and her son Venkateshwara Pranav Lalith Gopal Devati (22), both natives of Ranga Reddy district conspired and told Varun that the bride to be was a wealthy doctor and owner of several properties. Gradually she told the engineer that her mother was torturing her to give up the properties she owned after the death of her father. She told Varun that she needed Rs 65 lakh to hire lawyers to protect her properties and that since they would marry, he too would benefit from the properties.After the money was transferred she broke contact with Varun, who on getting suspicion approached the police and the lady and her son were arrested.The police said the woman lured the software engineer into believing the false story and made him transfer Rs 65 lakh. The accused have been arrested, but Malavika’s husband Devati Srinivas is absconding.Giving details the police, Malavika created a profile on a popular matrimonial site under the fictitious name of Keerthi Madhavaneni and contacted many men who were looking for prospective alliances. The profile introduced Malavika as Keerthi, a doctor living in Jubilee Hills and the owner of several properties.Malvika alias Keerthi managed to convince Varun of her genuineness and sought his financial help for fighting a court case to prevent the property being transferred onto her mother’s name.  Varun realised that he was duped when the woman started avoiding him and gave evasive replies about the money he had sent. He then approached the police, who arrested Malavika and her son.The police said the family was previously involved in similar cases registered in the Nallakunta and Marredpally police stations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nri-techie-duped-of-rs-65-lakh-by-prospective-bride-91148

The data reveal the scale of the challenge as teachers are forced to adapt to remote learning when many lack the training needed,” said Stefania Giannini, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education.“I, therefore, welcome these nine new teacher task forces launched by the Varkey Foundation as a member of UNESCO’s Global Education Coalition. These task forces will examine a number of crucial issues in India, not least training for teachers to teach online, providing reliable internet access for all, and finding solutions to keep children learning where there is no internet,” she said.The nine task forces will lend governments and international bodies the expertise and varied perspectives of teachers from every continent on key policies such as providing reliable internet access for all, solutions to keep children learning where there is no internet, and a safe environment for teachers and students to return to when schools reopen.“In examining these key issues, it is vital that we are able to hear from teachers in India who can provide their unique perspectives from the frontlines in these unprecedented times,” added Giannini.The nine areas to be covered include reliable internet access for all; solutions to keep children learning where there is no internet; no education cuts; a safe environment for teachers and pupils; lost school days should not turn into a lost generation; training to teach online; training to safeguard children online; nutritious free meals; and fast-track ed-tech strategies.The virtual summit to unveil these was opened by Sunny Varkey, the Indian-origin Founder of the Varkey Foundation and the Global Teacher Prize.During the session, the UNESCO’s Teacher Task Force also presented teachers with a draft toolkit of practical tips and checklists for school leaders to ensure they are supported and protected as schools begin to re-open.Participants were able to provide feedback to help improve this toolkit before a wider release.

28-05-2020||Lucknow||Babri demolition: CBI court to record statements of Advani, Joshi, Bharti from June 4||The special CBI court hearing the Babri mosque demolition case is set to record the statements of the accused, who include BJP leaders L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti, from June 4 onwards.Special judge S K Yadav on Thursday asked the defence to start producing the 32 accused from that date.It is not immediately clear if they have to be present in court or can appear through a video conference due to restrictions imposed to fight the spread of coronavirus.The court will record their statements under section 313 of the CrPC, giving them a chance to claim innocence.This stage of the trial is also meant to explain to the accused the evidence gathered against them by the prosecuting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation.The Babri Masjid was demolished in December 1992 by “karsevaks” who claimed that the mosque in Ayodhya was built on the site of an ancient Ram temple.The accused include former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, former deputy prime minister L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar, Sadhvi Rithambara, Sakshi Maharaj and Ram Vilas Vedanti.The prosecution had wrapped up the examination of its witnesses by March 6 and the court asked some of the accused to appear before it on March 24 for recording their statements under section 313 of the CrPC.But the proceedings did not take place as the court in Lucknow closed due to the coronavirus crisis.When the proceedings resumed on May 18, the defence counsel moved an application to summon three prosecution witnesses in order to cross examine them. This was allowed.The accused include former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, former deputy prime minister L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar, Sadhvi Rithambara, Sakshi Maharaj and Ram Vilas Vedanti.On April 19, 2017, the Supreme Court had ordered the special judge to conduct a day-to-day trial, concluding it in two years.Calling the demolition of the disputed structure a crime which shook the “secular fabric of the Constitution”, it allowed the CBI plea on restoration of criminal conspiracy charge against the VIP accused.The court had termed the Allahabad High Court’s February 12, 2001 verdict dropping conspiracy charge against Advani and others as “erroneous”.On May 8 this year, the top court set a new deadline for the special judge, asking him to deliver the verdict by August 31.Before the 2017 verdict of the apex court, there were two sets of cases relating to the demolition, going on in Lucknow and Raebareli.The first case involving unnamed “karsevaks” proceeded in a Lucknow court and the second set of cases relating to eight VIPs was being heard in a Raebareli. The cases were then clubbed.Last year, another bench of the Supreme settled the land dispute over the site where the mosque stood.The SC allowed the construction of a Ram temple at the site and ordered the allocation of a separate plot in Ayodhya for building a mosque.

Are those local authorities going to take responsibility in case of loss or injury?” Gupta asked in the letter.The association also requested the Railways to allow reasonable time for reopening of the static platform stalls.“It is, therefore, earnestly requested to kindly allow reasonable time for reopening of the static units, restrict officials from creating panic and building pressure, and collecting data in respect of reopening of the same which is causing fear in the mind of all concerned,” the letter said.It also said there was no point in opening food stalls at the moment as very few trains were operational.“Only 100 pairs of passenger trains are scheduled to be operated from June 1. In absence of the proper restoration of all trains and normalised situation, there are hardly any possibilities of availing vending services by bonafide passengers,” the letter said.Food vending services on platforms are an important source of meals for passengers at this time, especially for those on Shramik Special trains who are undertaking long journeys and running out of food and water.These trains have around three stoppages. There are around one lakh static units or stall at 9,000 railway stations.

Due to this, many people have been seen becoming alienated from their national ethos and fundamental duties, and also becoming enemies not only of their own country, Dharma, society and justice system but also of themselves,” Parande said. Parande said innumerable websites, videos, web series, applications, Tik Tok, etc had their merits and demerits but there is no one to critique or assess their substance.“These are part of a completely unruly, wilful anarchy. There is a Film Certification Board to certify films and also TV serials are closely scrutinised prior to their telecast. But, unfortunately, there is no such mechanism for the Web world,” he said demanding a proper system for checking and certifying the contents of “all material uploaded or shown in India to prevent its side effects or shortcomings and make it completely useful for all citizens”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vishva-hindu-parishad-demands-regulatory-board-for-world-wide-web-91120

"There are different mechanisms for different states. How do you ensure that nobody asks the migrant to pay or troubles him? What we are saying is that the migrants should be least concerned with the means of payment," it said."The state shall oversee the registration of migrant workers and states to ensure that after registration, they are made to board the train or bus at an early date," the Bench said."We further direct that those migrant workers found walking on the roads, immediately be taken to shelters and provided food and all facilities should be provided to them," it said, adding, "As and when the state governments put in a request for trains, railways has to provide them.""All necessary details regarding number of migrants, plan for transportation mechanism of registration and other details should be brought on record in the reply," the Bench said.After hearing Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, senior counsel Kapil Sibal, Colin Gonsalves, Indira Jaising, PS Narsimha and other advocates representing various states, the Bench went on to issue the directions saying, "At present we are looking at the miseries of the migrant workers, we are of the view that some interim directions need to be issued.""We believe that the centre and state governments require to be given some time to bring the steps taken by them on record, it said directing them to file detailed replies by June 5 -- the next date of hearing.During the hearing, the Solicitor General faced a volley of questions from the Bench on food, shelter, transportation and as to who would foot the bill.Terming it an "unprecedented crisis", Mehta said around 91 lakh migrant workers had been transported to their native states since special trains started on May 1.However, Sibal, Jaising and Gonsalves contradicted him saying the way migrant workers were being sent back to their native states it would take several months to complete the process.At the very outset, Mehta said, "We are immensely grateful to he Supreme Court for taking cognisance of the issue. Due to this, states and Centre have an August forum now to discuss the migrant crisis issue. Some unfortunate things have happened and it is being flashed again and again."We are not disputing the fact that Centre has not taken steps. But whoever needs help is not getting that help. States are not doing their bit," the Bench said.Mehta assured the Bench that the government will not stop its efforts until every willing migrant labourer is sent to his village. He, however, said many of the migrants didn't want to go back as lockdown has been relaxed and activities have resumed.The Solicitor General said a large number of steps were taken by the government and the Supreme Court was fully satisfied about it earlier. "We have something called prophets of doom who only spread negativity. All these people writing on social media, giving interviews cannot even acknowledge what is being done," he said.Mehta said people are working tirelessly. From the safai karamcharis to the PM... State governments and ministers are working over night. None of these people acknowledge that. Human race is facing a difficult challenge."On intervention applications, Mehta said, "Don't let anyone use this platform to become a political platform."He also drew the court's attention to a letter written by some senior advocates to the CJI onnthe issue.

28-05-2020||New Delhi||FM Sitharaman chairs FSDC meeting, takes stock of economy amid COVID-19||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Thursday, reviewed the state of the economy at the meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC), in view of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.This was the first meeting of the FSDC, which comprises RBI Governor and other financial sector regulators, since the COVID-19 outbreak.The 22nd meeting of the FSDC, which was held via video-conferencing, assumes a greater significance considering that the economy is expected to contract by 5 per cent by some estimates amid the virus crisis.Various measures to maintain financial stability in the context of COVID-19 had been reviewed, an official said after the meeting.The meeting also took note of the activities undertaken by the FSDC sub-committee, chaired by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, and the initiatives taken by various regulators in the financial sector.The FSDC is the apex body of sectoral regulators, headed by the Finance Minister.Besides the RBI governor, SEBI chief Ajay Tyagi, IRDAI chairman Subhash Chandra Khuntia, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) chairman MS Sahoo and PFRDAI chairman Supratim Bandyopadhyay were present in the meeting.Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, Financial Services Secretary Debasish Panda and other top officials of the Finance Ministry also attended the meeting.This was be the third meeting of the FSDC after the Narendra Modi government returned for the second term in May last year.The RBI last week said the impact of COVID-19 was more severe than anticipated and the GDP growth during the current financial year was likely to remain in the negative territory. It projected some pick-up in growth impulses from the second half (October-March) of 2020-21 onwards.On Tuesday, rating agencies Fitch and Crisil drastically cut India’s economic growth forecast for the current fiscal year due to a prolonged lockdown.Fitch forecast 5 per cent contraction in 2020-21, a sharp decline from 0.8 per cent growth projected by the global rating agency in late April.Crisil also predicted the economy to shrink by 5 per cent in the current fiscal. Earlier, it projected a growth of 1.8 per cent.Earlier this month, the government announced about Rs 21-lakh crore stimulus package to help the nation tide over the economic crisis induced by the coronavirus and the lockdown to curb its spread.The mega economic package includes the Reserve Bank's Rs 8.01-lakh crore worth of liquidity measures.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced this economic package in five tranches, which included a Rs 3.70-lakh crore support for the MSMEs, Rs 75,000-crore for the NBFCs and Rs 90,000-crore for power distribution companies.Besides, free foodgrains to migrant workers, increased allocation for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), tax relief to certain sections and Rs 15,000-crore allocation to the healthcare sector to deal with the pandemic, were also announced as part of the economic package.

As you will agree that civil aviation is of paramount importance in today’s context and, therefore, it is extremely necessary to boost the aviation industry and restore normal operations at the earliest, which is crucial for the economy to stabilise. In view of this, we request you to kindly grant Air India a financial package of Rs 50,000 crore which will go a long way in ensuring that Air India emerges as the strongest and best airline of India,” the joint forum said in the letter.Stating that Air India has once again played a crucial role for the nation by bringing back stranded Indians from all parts of the world including several offline stations at a time when airlines all over the world had ceased operations due to the pandemic, the Forum said the carrier “even at peak of the COVID 19 pandemic operated flights to and from Wuhan which is the origin and centre point of COVID-19.”Besides, Air India staff went out of the way at considerable “personal risk” to ensure smooth operations of several cargo and charter flights all through this period, thereby facilitating the smooth movement of medicines and medical equipment between India and many other countries including China, it said.Air India had always performed national duties irrespective of the serious risks involved, it said, adding that it had been established beyond doubt that Air India was a necessity for the country especially in times of crises.

We are all happy to return. I would like to thank everybody who facilitated our return,” he told reporters.Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren also expressed his gratitude to the alumni network of the Bengaluru law school for its noble initiative.“Iss punit karya ke liye mein Alumni Network of National Law School, Bengaluru dwara kiye gaye sahiyog ko saharaniya karte hein (I appreciate the effort of the alumni network of National Law School, Bengaluru),” Soren said in a statement.The state is committed to bring back all migrant workers stranded in different parts of the country, and the government is in touch with the Centre for the purpose, he added.

28-05-2020||Satya Prakash||Hearing on migrant workers' crisis is on in Supreme Court||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 28A three-judge Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan on Thursday commenced hearing via video-conferencing on migrant workers' crisis.Other two judges on the Bench are Justice SK Kaul and Justice MR Shah.Senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Indira Jaising, Colin Gonsalves, Sanjay Parikh and P Chidambaram were visible on the screen.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta represented the Centre.The Supreme Court had on Tuesday taken suo motu cognisance of the plight of migrant workers stranded in various parts of the country and asked the Centre, states and UTs to spell out measures taken to deal with the crisis. After that many intervention applications, including one by activist Medha Patkar, have been filed.Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala had filed an intervention application on Wednesday seeking to be heard in the matter.Some of the senior advocates are representing the intervenors, including Surjewala and Patkar, in the case.Many advocates are representing various states and union territories.Jaising and Gonsalves pressed for certain directions on Thursday itself, citing 'urgency' of the matter. But the Bench asked them not to speak simultaneously. "If all of you speak at the same time, we won't understand anything," the SC said."We are immensely grateful that this court has taken cognisance. The Centre and states are willing to show all steps taken. Some isolated incidents have taken place but they are shown repeatedly. We have filed a preliminary report on the steps taken,” Mehta told the SC."No doubt the governments have taken steps but those persons are not getting the benefits from the state governments," the SC said.Mehta explained how and why the movement of migrant workers was allowed after two phases of the COVID19 lockdown.Mehta thanked the top court for taking cognisance of the issue. He said the Centre and states had a responsible and august forum where they could point out steps.Mehta told the SC that the Centre and states had done a lot to control the Covid situation and help migrant workers. But certain unfortunate incidents were repeatedly telecast or reported to shadow the good work by governments, he added.The court asked if food and shelter was being provided to migrant workers."With food surpluses available with the FCI, if even during the time when these people are waiting to be transported, is food being supplied to these people or not? Why should there be a food shortage among people?" the SC asked."We accept that it's not possible to transport everyone at the same time. But food and shelter must be given till they can get transport," said Justice Kaul."Food will have to come either from the originating state or the Centre. The destination state can't give them food till they get there. It would have to be origin state or the Centre. Who is supplying food?" asked Justice Kaul."This is an unprecedented crisis and we are taking unprecedented measures," Mehta told the Bench.It’s not that the government is not doing anything but looking at the number of stranded migrants, some concrete steps need to be taken, the SC said."We need to ensure that till the time the migrants are transported back to their homes, food and other essentials for them should be taken care of," the top court said.The Bench said, "Look into the future. How much time do you need to shift the migrants to where they want to go? What will be monitoring mechanism to ensure that food and basic necessities are taken care of. States have to provide information."The Bench sought to know how many further days would it take to shift the migrant workers.Mehta said approximately one crore had already been shifted. Several opted not to shift due to the reopening of activities. States would be in a better position to estimate that, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hearing-on-migrant-workers-crisis-is-on-in-supreme-court-91103
28-05-2020||New Delhi||Cabinet Secy holds meeting with municipal commissioners, DMs of 13 Covid-hit cities||Ahead of the completion of nationwide lockdown 4.0, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba on Thursday held a meeting with municipal commissioners and district magistrates of 13 COVID-19 hit cities in the country including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai, officials said.The meeting bears significance as these 13 cities are considered to be the worst Coronavirus affected locations and constitute about 70 per cent of the positive cases in the country.Chief secretaries and principal secretaries (health) of all states and Union Territories have attended the meeting through video conference with the agenda of ‘Public Health Response to COVID-19’.Municipal commissioners of Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi/New Delhi, Ahmadabad, Thane, Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata/Howrah, Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Jaipur, Jodhpur, Chengalpattu (Tamil Nadu) and Thiruvallur (Tamil Nadu) attended the meeting, a Home Ministry official said.District magistrates or collectors of the 13 cities also joined the meeting, the official said. The measures taken by the officials and the staff of the municipal corporations for the management of COVID-19 cases were reviewed in the meeting.The central government has already issued guidelines on management of COVID-19 in urban settlements.Highlights of this strategy include work on high risk factors, indices such as confirmation rate, fatality rate, doubling rate, tests per million people etc, another official said.The strategy defined the factors to be considered while mapping the containment and buffer zones, the activities mandated in containment zones like perimeter control, active search for cases through house-to- house surveillance, contact tracing, testing protocol, clinical management of the active cases.It also dealt with the surveillance activities in the buffer zones like monitoring of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) or Influenza Like Illness (ILI) cases, ensuring social distancing, promoting hand hygiene etc.              The Centre has been pushing for geographic area of containment zones to be defined based on factors like mapping of cases and contacts, geographical dispersion of cases and contacts.It said the area with well demarcated perimeter and enforceability should be enforced.For municipal corporations, residential colony, mohallas, municipal wards or police-station area, municipal zones, towns can be designated as containment zones, as appropriate.The cities were advised that the area should be appropriately defined by the district administration and local urban body with technical inputs from local level.Along with the containment zones, buffer zones around containment zones also must be demarcated to break the chain of transmission. Maintaining high vigilance and monitoring in areas of old cities, urban slums and other high density pockets along with the camps for migrant workers are other key factors for the COVID-19 strategy for the high-risk areas.The nationwide lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to combat the coronavirus pandemic. It was first extended till May 3 and again till May 17. The lockdown has now been extended till May 31.

28-05-2020||Hyderabad||Muslim man buried in 'shamshan ghat' after 'kabristan' denies entry||The mortal remains of a Muslim man had to be buried in a Hindu shamshan ghat or cremation ground after caretakers of at least five Muslim graveyards allegedly denied him a place for burial over the fear that he could have died of Covid-19.Some Hindu residents of the area came forward to help the relatives of Mohammed Khawja Mian (55) and helped bury him in a shamshan ghat at Gandmguda on the outskirts of Hyderabad.The incident came to light after five days.Khawja died of cardiac arrest at his residence on May 22 and his relatives approached at least five graveyards in the city for the burial.Mutawallis or caretakers of the graveyards refused to allow the burial citing him to be a non-local or expressing apprehension that he could have died of coronavirus."We had to run from one graveyard to the other to seek the place for burial but we received the same response," said Khawja Mian's son Mohammed Basha.The incident sparked outrage with demands from different quarters to take action against the caretakers of the graveyards.In a separate incident, a caretaker of a graveyard at Mallapur refused to allow the burial of another person on the ground the deceased was non-local.The relatives of the deceased Saleemuddin Siddiqui approached Muslim leaders of Congress party, who arranged the burial in a Muslim graveyard in another area.Taking serious note of the incidents, Telangana State Waqf Board has threatened criminal action against managing committees and caretakers of graveyards if they refuse to allow the burial of Muslim bodies on any ground.Telangana Waqf Board chairman Mohammed Saleem sent teams to the graveyards which denied burial place to deceased Muslims.Voicing his anger over the incident in which a Muslim had to be buried in shamshan ghat, he made it clear that managing committees or caretakers of graveyards can't deny a place for burial even if the man died of Covid-19 or was a non-local or a traveller."Graveyards are not the personal property of managing committees or custodians. They are mere caretakers. Demanding money for the burial or denying the place for burial will not be tolerated," he said.Saleem felt that the incident had maligned the city. There have been many incidents over the last two months during which graveyards were reluctant to allow burial over doubts that they could have died of Covid-19.He said the caretakers can't deny the burial of any Muslim irrespective of the area he comes from and the disease he had.Saleem said it was unfortunate that caretakers of graveyards were denying burial over extraneous considerations."When Saudi Arabia allows burial of all Muslims in the holy places irrespective of their nationalities, there is no reason why Muslim graveyards in India deny resting place to Muslims irrespective of their place of birth, social or economic status," he said.Saleem called a meeting of the Waqf Board on June 6. A resolution will be passed in this meeting for taking action against committees and custodians demanding money for burial and resorting to other unfair practices.

28-05-2020||---||Govt must immediately open its coffers and help the needy: Sonia||New Delhi, May 28Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday led the party’s Speak up India campaign asking the government to come to the rescue of lakhs of labourers and small traders who continue to battle the severe economic crisis caused by the COVID pandemic and the resultant lockdown.In a video message, Sonia said the government must immediately open its coffers and help the needy.Gandhi cited the travails of migrant labourers who continue to walk back home thousands of kilometres without food and water and asked the government to arrange their free transport back to their home states.Gandhi said the migration of the scale being witnessed these days was unprecedented and the first since Independence.“It is for the first time since Independence that the country has witnessed such a scale of pain and trauma with lakhs of famished labourers forced to walk hundreds of kilometres in the absence of transport,” Gandhi said, accusing the government of not doing enough for the poor.She said jobs had been lost and businesses closed down with farmers having to toil hard to sell crops.The Congress chief said her party would run a social campaign to give voice to the poor and urged everyone to join it.She urged the Centre to unlock its coffers and help the needy and repeated her party’s old demands — cash transfer of Rs 7,500 per month in the account of every family for the next six months; safe and free return of labourers; employment, rations: 200 days under MNREGA to facilitate jobs in villages.Later, Rahul Gandhi in a post repeated the same demands.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-must-immediately-open-its-coffers-and-help-the-needy-sonia-91081

Next day they re-introduced the bond but reduced the interest rate from 8 per cent to 7.75 per cent,” he noted.He said effectively, after tax, the bond will yield only 4.4 per cent. “That is now taken away. Why? I deplore this action,” he said.He said every government is bound to provide at least one safe risk-free investment option to its citizens and “it was the RBI bond since 2003”.The government discontinued the 7.75 per cent Savings (Taxable) Bonds scheme, 2018, by issuing a notification that said that they shall cease for subscription with effect from the close of banking business on May 28.

28-05-2020||Washington||US, India must develop plan to counter China's efforts to strengthen its position in Indian Ocean, says US think-tank||The US and India must develop a plan to counter a possible effort by China to strengthen its position in the Indian Ocean by deepening ties with Pakistan and Sri Lanka by taking advantage of their economic woes due to the coronavirus pandemic, an American think-tank has said.There have been considerable concerns in India over China's growing presence in the Indian Ocean region. India has been trying to expand maritime cooperation with countries of the region including Sri Lanka, Maldives, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Singapore, primarily with an aim to check the growing Chinese assertiveness.According to the Hudson Institute think-tank, the coronavirus pandemic threatens not only lives and livelihoods in South Asia; it could also be the precursor of significant political and strategic shifts in the region.The Bangladesh and Indian economies will survive the devastation, but their governments will have to restore growth by protecting and encouraging investment, the think-tank said in a report jointly authored by Indian-origin Hudson research scholar Aparna Pande and former Pakistan Ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani."Pakistan and Sri Lanka will likely move in the direction of negative growth and will need debt relief from their international creditors. Without it, Sri Lanka faces the prospect of a sovereign debt default. Both countries are likely to look to China as their benefactor, as their leaders have tended to do for a while," it said.According to the report titled "Crisis from Kolkata to Kabul: COVID-19's Impact on South Asia", China will most likely press its advantage by bailing out South Asia's indebted governments, "in exchange for its pound of flesh"."This would come at the expense of India's security and US influence in the region. India and the United States must develop a plan to counter efforts China will likely make to strengthen its position in the Indian Ocean by deepening ties with Pakistan and Sri Lanka," said the Hudson report, released this week.Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been a target of Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road (BRI) scheme, criticised for creating 'debt traps' by burdening fiscally weak countries with unsustainable debt.The BRI is Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature global infrastructure policy.First announced in 2013, the project promises to build ports, roads and railways to revive the ancient Silk Road and create new trade corridors linking China to Asia, Africa and Europe. The BRI also includes the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which India opposed as it goes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).In December 2017, Sri Lanka handed over the control of the southern seaport of Hambantota to China on a 99-year lease, triggering concern over Beijing's efforts to expand influence in the Indian Ocean region.Beijing has recently granted an "urgent" loan of USD 500 million to Colombo to help it fight the virus, which has infected over 1,465 people and claimed 10 lives in the country.Earlier this month, China inked a USD 5.8 billion deal with Islamabad to build a dam in Gilgit-Baltistan, a move strongly opposed by India which said that carrying out such projects in territories under Pakistan's illegal occupation was not proper.The IMF has recently approved a loan of USD 500 million to cash-strapped Pakistan to cope with the economic crisis being posed by the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected over 59,000 people and killed more than 1,220. The country has also sought additional loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to tide over the crisis.The report said India's initiative to develop a regional response to the threat posed by COVID-19 has been undermined by Pakistan's insistence on raising the Kashmir issue even in this challenging time."Given that Pakistan has fewer resources to further its military buildup against India, it is likely to escalate the use of sub-conventional warfare (terrorism) in an effort to gain the upper hand against much-larger India," the report noted.Pakistan, it said, might seek relief from terrorism-related strictures on grounds that it needs space to deal with the coronavirus emergency.International pressure, especially Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey-list sanctions targeting Pakistan, might be needed to restrain the worst anti-Indian impulses of its civil and military leaders, the report added.In the past, Pakistan has used natural disasters to expand terrorist infiltrations into Kashmir and India. Indian officials are concerned that Pakistan could use the COVID-19 crisis as a distraction to do the same, the report observed."Although a full-blown war in the subcontinent is unlikely, tensions between India and Pakistan will probably continue to impede efforts for regional cooperation. Such cooperation could ease the task of economic reconstruction that will almost certainly take place when the pandemic has died down. India could, and probably will, try to work with other countries in the region, but not Pakistan," the report said.

28-05-2020||Yash Goyal Our Correspondent Jaipur||To maintain equality, urgent need of separate policy for migrants in rural areas: Experts||It is time to recognize the identity of migrants as there are more questions than answers. A separate policy for migrants is needed in rural areas to maintain equality, says an expert panel at IIHMR University, Jaipur, during a Webinar debate on COVID-19 on Wednesday evening. "As India failed its own citizens especially migrants, Covid-19 brought the issue of migration in limelight in India. One out 3 Indians are migrants and Coronavirus is now turning into a +disease of migration+", warns Dr S Irudaya Rajan, Professor at the Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala) during the discussion. Speaking on Covid-19: Consequences and Challenges of Reverse Migration of Labourers in India organised by IIHMR, further said: "The exodus of migrants due to the lockdown will hit this vulnerable class the most. If the migrants could go back to their own place of origin at the time of announcement of Janta curfew, we would be able to avoid this current situation". Dr Ram B Bhagat, Professor and Head of Department of Migration and Urban Studies, International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) Mumbai has said: “There is an urgent need to integrate migration into rural development. The 3 lack cr. package given to MSME should be encouraged to set up their operation in rural areas. Issues of rural connectivity, rural planning, facilities for running business and development of the area should be immediately addressed so that migrants are able to survive.” Dr Dhirendra Kumar, Professor at IIHMR said: “The imposition of the lockdown as a measure to contain the exponential progression of the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the unskilled, and semi-skilled migrant worker’s the most. In the last few weeks, we have all been a witness to disturbing, nerve-wrenching, and bone-chilling images of the exodus of these marginal and invisible drivers of the informal economy of urban India.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-maintain-equality-urgent-need-of-separate-policy-for-migrants-in-rural-areas-experts-91072

The reverse trend of "correcting the mistake" has started with first UP Government followed by Rajasthan Government, a statement by BMS said, asking other state governments also to follow it.However, BMS president CK Saji Narayanan also added that without trade union representatives on board it will remain an exercise merely to supply “cheap labour” to industries, "looking at the general attitude of the policy advisors in the Government".The UP Government needs to redraft the terms of reference to include dignified treatment to migrant labours, according to Narayanan, president of the right wing trade union."Prime Minister Modi in his speech on stimulus package gave thrust to labour, farmers and small scale industries which are a deviation from his predecessor’s economic packages which were benefiting big business houses and corporates."Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman during her declarations on the financial package categorically said Government will not take the ordinance route for a change of labour laws; which is a clear reply to the four states that took ordinance route to change labour law."Rajeev Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Ayog, also said ‘reforms do not mean complete abolition of labour laws’."The Labour Ministry has also objected the states’ ordinance route on the suspension of labour laws.Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar also has said the complete suspension is not labour reforms based on settled national and international positions."All these expose the blunder of ordinance route adopted by four states and a clear direction that it is time to withdraw the ordinances."UP, MP, Gujarat states have brought ordinances to suspend labour laws and Kerala Government brought ordinance to nullify a High Court order prohibiting compulsorily cut of one month’s salary of its employees.” Further, the trend of increasing working hours from eight hours to twelve hours was started by Rajasthan Government and adopted by nearly 15 state Governments, according to the BMS.Narayanan said now the reverse trend of "correcting the mistake" has started with first UP Government reverting to 8 hours followed by Rajasthan Government. BMS demands other state governments also to follow it."India should not discard its noble tradition of social dialogue and Governments should not be shy of talking to trade unions. Every change in labour laws should be made only by consulting with trade unions. BMS will continue to exhaust all democratic means to persuade governments to address the concerns raised by it," the BMS said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-affiliate-bms-welcomes-trend-of-correcting-mistakes-91070

28-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi farmer buys plane tickets to send 10 workers to Bihar||Their dreams of returning home finally taking wing after two months of lockdown, 10 migrant workers are flying to Bihar thanks to their employer, a Delhi farmer, who bought their plane tickets.Their flight to the Bihar capital Patna is at 6 am on Thursday and the men, who planned to go home in April, can't believe they are going to their villages in Samastipur – not walking or cycling thousands of kilometres, or scrambling for a seat on a bus or train, but on a plane.“I never imagined in my life that I will be travelling in a plane. I don't have words to express my happiness. But I am also little bit nervous about what I have to do when we reach the airport tomorrow," Lakhinder Ram, who will be returning with his son, told PTI.He is grateful to Pappan Singh, a mushroom farmer in Delhi's Tigipur village who is helping rewrite the migrant narrative, so far about unpaid dues, hunger and arduous journeys home resulting in illness and even death.When Lakhinder called his wife to tell her he will be leaving for Bihar on a flight, she didn't believe him.It was only when Pappan intervened and spoke to her that the truth dawned – her husband and son Naveen Ram, who had been working for eight years in Pappan's field, would be flying home.Lakhinder, 50, who has been working for Pappan for 27 years, said the farmer has been taking care of their food and accommodation since the lockdown began on March 25.Pappan said he has booked tickets worth Rs 68,000 and is also giving each Rs 3,000 in cash, so they don't face any problems when they reach their home state.He will also drop all his workers in his vehicles to the IGI Airport early on Thursday while following social distancing norms."These 10 workers would have left for their homes in Bihar in the first week of April on the train, but they could not go due to the lockdown," Pappan told PTI.He said he had made several attempts to send them back to their home state in a Shramik Special train but could not manage to do so."I could not have taken a risk by allowing my workers to walk thousands of miles as it would have put their lives in danger because we are getting to know these days that migrants meet road accidents while going home," he said.Pappan said he has completed all their medical formalities, in accordance with the requirements specified, so they have a smooth journey home."Medical fitness certificates have been issued by authorities to all 10 workers, and they are fit to travel in a plane," he said. "I have been doing mushroom farming since 1993, which has a season between August and March,” added the employer with a difference. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-farmer-buys-plane-tickets-to-send-10-workers-to-bihar-91061
28-05-2020||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||'I failed my family': Doctor's heartfelt note after testing coronavirus positive is heartbreaking||A doctor, who had tested positive for coronavirus, wrote a heartfelt note after he exposed his family to the deadly disease.He talked about how infecting his family made him feel guilty.Sharing the incident on the Facebook page of Humans of Bombay, the doctor said even after the pandemic broke out, he continued to treat his patients and followed all precautions. Yet, he ended up getting infected with the virus."After Covid-19 broke out, I knew my patients needed me more than ever. So I kept going to work, seeing 5-10 patients everyday. I was out of the house for 10 hours, and took every precaution for my family's safety.But on March 18th, I got a fever. I’d seen it coming, but when my wife got a fever too, I was worried. We both started medication–she got better, but my condition worsened. I shivered all night, lost my appetite and started burning up. So I got myself tested- and it was positive"."My wife was terrified. On our way to the hospital, I told her, 'We have to be strong to fight this'. I asked to get herself and our daughter tested. The next day, I saw them in the Covid Ward– that broke me. I felt so guilty. As a doctor, I’d done everything in my power to help my patients, but I felt like I’d failed my own family"."Fortunately, they were both asymptomatic, but everyday, I checked their reports. From time to time, I'd see my daughter too! She'd smile and wave through the glass whenever she passed by. It felt good, even if I wasn't with her. It gave me hope that we'd get through it together.The hospital made our recovery easy–and within a week, we were both discharged. But my wife kept testing positive and was still at the hospital.In all honesty, that time apart was the most stressful"."Every time her recovery got extended, she felt low. So I'd joke, 'Come back already! You have so much work to do!' And she'd laugh a little.But I was restless and couldn't wait to see her. No one knew why she still tested positive, so that added to our anxiety"."But our neighbours were really helpful. They sent us cooked meals everyday via the lift, so my daughter and I didn't have to stress over food. But we were constantly worried about my wife–we just wanted her to test negative. Finally, on her fourth attempt, she tested negative and could come home"."She was discharged on Easter, so one of our neighbours sent us a grand meal. And as soon as my wife set foot in the door, I greeted her with, 'Welcome home boss!'She was weak, but smiled softly–and I knew that we'd be okay. We'd beat the virus and were finally together"."As a doctor who's survived this virus up close and personal, only I know the days I've had, constantly worrying about my family and patients. Truth is, it doesn't spare anyone. Still, we must continue the fight– humanity has been through pandemics before, but we’ve always won. And we will this time too".The post has collected over 7,000 'likes' since being shared on Facebook. "After Covid-19 broke out, I knew my patients needed me more than ever. So I kept going to work, seeing 5-10 patients...||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-failed-my-family-doctors-heartfelt-note-after-testing-coronavirus-positive-is-heartbreaking-91056

We’re, obviously, looking at the situation, and we would urge all the parties involved to avoid any action that would make the situation even more tense,” Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General, said at the daily press briefing on Wednesday.Dujarric was asked about the tensions on the border between India and China and how concerned is the UN and the Secretary General. He was also asked if the Secretary General thinks that Trump would make a good mediator in the situation.The nearly 3,500-km-long LAC is the de-facto border between India and China. Several areas along the LAC in Ladakh and North Sikkim have witnessed major military build-up by both the Indian and Chinese armies recently, in a clear signal of escalating tension and hardening of respective positions by the two sides even two weeks after they were engaged in two separate face-offs.India has said that the Chinese military was hindering normal patrolling by its troops along the LAC in Ladakh and Sikkim and has strongly refuted Beijing’s contention that the escalating tension between the two armies was triggered by trespassing of Indian forces across the Chinese side.“Any suggestion that Indian troops had undertaken activity across the LAC in the Western sector or the Sikkim sector is not accurate. Indian troops are fully familiar with the alignment of the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border areas and abide by it scrupulously,” Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at an online media briefing last week.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/guterres-urges-avoiding-action-that-would-increase-tensions-on-india-china-border-un-spokesperson-91055
28-05-2020||New Delhi||India’s COVID-19 tally crosses 1.6 lakh; death toll surpasses 4,600||The nationwide tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases crossed 1.6 lakh on Thursday to make India the world’s ninth worst hit country by the deadly virus infection, while the death toll went past 4,600 to near China’s official count of 4,634 fatalities.The first case of the deadly virus infection was discovered in China last December and since then it has spread to virtually all parts of the world infecting more than 57 lakh people globally. More than 3.5 lakh have died too across the world, but very few new cases are being reported in China for the last few days.According to China’s official tally, its total number of confirmed cases stood at nearly 83,000 while the deadly virus has claimed 4,634 lives so far there.In its morning 8 am update, the Union Health Ministry said the death toll due to COVID-19 across India has risen to 4,531 and the number of cases has climbed to 1,58,333, registering an increase of 194 deaths and 6,566 cases in the 24 hours since Wednesday 8 am.It put the number of active COVID-19 cases at more than 86,000 and recoveries at 67,691, giving a recovery rate of around 42.75 per cent.However, a PTI tally of figures announced by different states and union territories, as of 9.30 pm, showed the number of confirmed cases rising by more than 7,000 to 1,60,666 and the death toll increasing by 187 to 4,633. It also showed more than 70,000 recoveries.However, an online real-time map maintained by Johns Hopkins University & Medicine, put India’s death toll further higher at 4,653, as of 9.45 pm, and ahead of China’s count of fatalities at 4,638 as per its tracker.India has now overtaken Turkey as the ninth worst hit country in terms of total number of cases. India’s count of recoveries is the tenth largest now after the US, Brazil, Germany, Russia, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Iran and China.In terms of total number of confirmed cases, the US is the worst hit with over 17 lakh cases, while other countries with more cases than India are Brazil, Russia, UK, Spain, Italy, France and Germany. While Turkey is now ranked 10th, China is at 14th place and below Iran, Peru and Canada.The US also tops the death toll with more than 1 lakh fatalities, followed by UK, Italy, France, Spain, Brazil, Belgium, Mexico, Germany and Iran in the top ten. India is ranked 13th now after Canada and Netherlands at the 11th and 12th places, respectively.In terms of active case, India’s tally is the fifth biggest in the world after the US, Russia, Brazil and France. However, India has also done better than many other countries in terms of the absolute number of tests conducted cumulatively and is placed at the seventh place globally. However, when it comes to the quantum of tests in proportion to the population, India does not figure even among the top-100 countries.More than 33 lakh tests have been conducted so far in India, as compared to over 1.5 crore in the US, over 97 lakh in Russia, nearly 40 lakh in Germany, close to 38 lakh in the UK, over 36 lakh in Italy and over 35 lakh in Spain.In China, more than 65 lakh people have been tested and now the country has a total of 413 asymptomatic cases under medical observation, including 344 in Wuhan, known as the epicentre of the deadly virus infection.  The lockdown has been in place since March 25, which was initially imposed for 21 days but has been extended thrice already and the fourth phase will end on May 31.A decision on the future course of action on the lockdown is expected soon. The Union Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba also held a meeting with municipal commissioners and district magistrates of the 13 worst hit cities in the country, including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai.Delhi reported a record number of 1,024 new cases to take its tally to 16,281, while its death toll rose to 3165. This is the first time that the national capital has witnessed 1,000-plus new cases for a day.According to an official estimate, nearly 23 lakh people, who have moved within the country or arrived from international destinations during the ongoing nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, are currently in quarantine facilities arranged by states and union territories.While the majority of the state governments and union territory administrations have made at least seven days’ quarantine compulsory for anyone arriving in their jurisdiction, a few of them have opted for home quarantine for those reaching their administrative limits.Maharashtra has the highest number of people in quarantine facilities -- 6.02 lakh—followed by Gujarat, which has kept a total of 4.42 lakh people in quarantine centres.According to the government, a total of 91 lakh migrant labourers were transported by trains and buses from various places to different destinations across the country during the lockdown till Wednesday.The states that have been attributing the surge in cases to the influx of people from outside include West Bengal, Kerala, Assam, Bihar, Odisha, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.West Bengal recorded its biggest single-day spike of 344 fresh COVID-19 cases on Thursday, taking its tally to 4,536.The worst-hit state Maharashtra reported 2,598 new cases to take its tally to 59,546, while its death toll rose to 1,982 with 85 more fatalities reported during the day.

He said every state should have at least one city (either the capital city or any renowned tourist destination) which is fully solar-powerd using rooftop solar power generation.Emphasis was also made on ecosystem development for manufacturing of ingots, wafers, cells and modules in India, which would also help generate employment in addition to various other advantages.Modi also felt that the plan for carbon-neutral Ladakh should be expedited. The prime minister also batted for drinking water supply in coastal areas by harnessing solar and wind energy, the statement said.

Considering the fact that a majority of the students have only smartphones and basic Internet facility, only a few can opt for it. Nearly 50 per cent of students said they had not received material and also cited an inability to access it. According to the survey, only 28 per cent of students have been able to attend more than 50 per cent of the online classes.Many students said they left for home for mid-semester break, which included Holi and were caught unaware during the lockdown. The students said they did not have access to books, notes or e-resources.The DUTA has been arguing that the OBE is faulty and discriminates against those without books, notes and online resources. Further, it does not take care of the special needs of many students, especially the differently-abled ones.The teachers’ association demanded that the university should explore alternatives.It's faulty, says teachers' association.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/85-du-students-against-open-book-exams-90981

28-05-2020||New Delhi||Notice to Centre on mercy petitions||The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notice to the Centre on a petition seeking direction to the government to frame guidelines for time-bound disposal of mercy petitions. A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde asked the Centre to respond in four weeks to the petition filed by Shiv Kumar Tripathi. The Bench, which wanted to know if there was any timeline for disposal of mercy petitions by the President, said the only thing it may consider was directing the Ministry of Home Affairs on time limit for placing the mercy petition before the President. Tripathi has contended there were no guidelines for disposal of mercy petitions within a particular time frame. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said he needed time to seek instructions from the government and respond to the court’s queries. The power to grant pardon was an extraordinary power and it had to be exercised by the authority concerned with “great care and caution”, the petitioner said. “The principle of natural justice demands that this power shall be exercised uniformly in each case. Its beneficiaries ought not to be extraordinary persons but all deserving individuals,” he said, describing delay in disposal of mercy petition by the President as a “big problem”. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/notice-to-centre-on-mercy-petitions-90985

These are things that later become problems,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre. The Bench, which specifically wanted to know about alleged violation of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act by news channels, gave two weeks to the Centre and the PCI to respond to the PIL.As senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing in a connected matter, said the issue should be taken seriously, the CJI said, “We take all matters seriously. Don’t say repeatedly that take these matters seriously.”Dave said there were lots of fake news on Markaz incident, which had “damaged” the secular fabric of India. “Why is the government silent?” Dave asked.Contending that these broadcasts amounted to offences under the law, he urged the court to take action against media organisations.The Supreme Court on April 13 refused to restrain the media from reporting on alleged role of Tablighi Jamaat congregation in spreading Covid in the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/respond-to-pil-against-demonising-muslims-sc-90978

The locust could turn back with the change in wind direction.After damaging crops in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, swarms of locusts entered Uttar Pradesh's Jhansi district on Wednesday and could head towards Maharashtra. Punjab has also been put on alert.“Climate change is facilitating breeding and movement of locusts. Untimely rains and increased cyclonic activity have helped them breed faster. A locust attack never occurred in December but there was one in 2019,” says agricultural expert Devinder Sharma.Soumya Dutta, EnvironmentalistTimely spraying could have helped in RajasthanThere are hundreds of kilometres of desert, arid and semi-arid land the swarms crossed before coming into fields of Rajasthan. Timely aerial spraying could have helped.Environmentalist Soumya Dutta says the “extremely severe cyclone” Amphan and the “biggest in a quarter century locust swarm threatening Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and MP” are some of the climate change-driven disasters. “Even though the UN had forewarned, preparations by India fell short,” adds Dutta.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/worst-locust-invasion-in-25-yrs-govt-ill-prepared-say-experts-90909

As the mother still lay still, he wobbles away from her, announcements continuing in the background about the arrival and departure of trains that would bring in tens of thousands of people in a rush to get away from hunger and hardship they face in large cities that could sustain them no more.“This child doesn’t know that the bedsheet with which he is playing is the shroud of his mother who has gone into eternal sleep. This mother died of hunger and thirst after being on a train for four days. Who is responsible for these deaths on trains? Shouldn’t the opposition ask uncomfortable questions?” tweeted Yadav. — PTIDeath due to pre-existing ailment: RailwaysNew Delhi: The Railways on Wednesday defended its handling of migrant specials after a heart-rending video surfaced online showing a toddler attempting to wake up his dead mother.

28-05-2020||---||No map changes for now: Nepal||New Delhi, May 27Nepal has put on hold a constitutional amendment to update its political map to include three disputed areas in India.A week ago, Nepal was all set for a cartographic confrontation with India when it unveiled a new political map that placed Kalapani within its border.An understanding to tackle the situation diplomatically instead of belligerence was reached at an all-party meeting held at Baluwatar, the seat of the Nepal Government, late on Tuesday evening.While Nepal announced that it had started printing the new political maps, the ruling party ran into problems when it sought to change the image of Nepal’s map on the coat-of-arms to incorporate the new changes.Such a step, however, required more than an administrative decision and the ruling party realised it was short of the required two-thirds majority to amend the constitution to include Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani in the image of the map on the coat of arms.The pro-India Nepali Congress was ambiguous at the all-party meeting and sought a meeting of its policymaking body to evaluate the issue. At least 35 members of Madhesh parties also sought their pound of flesh, forcing the ruling party’s managers to press the issue at some other opportune time.India and Nepal re-opened their differences on a triangle of land bordering China about six months ago when New Delhi published a political map to show the change in countours of Jammu and Kashmir from a single state to two UTs of J&K and Ladakh. Nepal felt the new map seemed to have included three areas which were its territory.The issue intensified again early this month when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a blacktopped road to Lipulekh Pass that seemed to traverse areas claimed by Nepal.New Delhi cautiousWe are carefully following developments in Nepal. Border issues are sensitive by nature and require trust and confidence to be resolved to mutual satisfaction. We note that there is a larger ongoing debate on this matter in Nepal. It underlines the seriousness of this issue. It also demonstrates the value being attached to relations between Nepal and India. We continue to monitor the situation. — sources||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-map-changes-for-now-nepal-90903

They said as a case study, the MHA had shared the National Investigation Agency’s report on the Pulwama terror strike, which unravelled the entire logistics chain behind the attack.In the blueprint, the MHA also noted that latent terror modules mostly functioned out of rented accommodation and, therefore, individuals and businesses that dealt with renting processes must be scrutinised closely. The states and the UTs should follow the Maharashtra model, which was quite robust in tracking renting business, they said.Sources said the inputs also indicated that terrorists may use locally made explosives and, thus, the states and the UTs had been asked to keep an eye on dealers of explosives and make them accountable for their stocks and sale.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-told-to-check-latent-terror-modules-90902

We are capable of resolving the issues properly though dialogue and consultation,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, while confirming quiet diplomacy, away from public glare, was on to defuse the border tensions.“This includes communication between border troops and between our diplomatic missions,” he explained.At the same time, Zhao indicated tough bargaining in the days ahead by reiterating China’s commitment to safeguarding its territorial sovereignty and security.There was a flutter in the strategic community when Trump sought to step in as the peacemaker days after Alice Wells, his top diplomat for the region, did the opposite by accusing China of causing problems from the land border with India to the South China Sea.“We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute. Thank you!” tweeted Trump. There was no response from the Indian and Chinese governments.Trump previously offered to mediate between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, a proposal rejected by New Delhi maintaining there was no role for third party in bilateral issues.In a different context, the Chinese Ambassador said India and China must never let the differences shadow the overall situation of bilateral cooperation. “We should adhere to the basic judgment that China and India pose no threat to each other,” he stresssed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-softens-us-offers-to-mediate-90879
