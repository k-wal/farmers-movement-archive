17-06-2020||Chandigarh/Hyderabad/Baripada||Wave of grief as mortal remains of soldiers reach their native places||A wave of grief swept across the country as the mortal remains of the soldiers who laid down their lives fighting the Chinese Army in Galwan Valley in Ladakh were taken to their native places on Wednesday.Anti-China protests were held in several parts of the country, including the national capital, though restrictions were in place on assembly of people due to the coronavirus lockdown.For many of the bereaved families the agonising wait started on Tuesday evening when they were informed by senior Army officials about the sacrifice of the 20 soldiers in the clashes with the Chinese Army along the Line of Actual Control a day earlier.In heart-wrenching scenes reminiscent of the aftermath of the 2019 Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed, coffins of soldiers arrived in several states for the last rites with full military honours.Even as they struggled to come to terms with the shocking news and grieved over the lives cut short, family members of the soldiers said they were proud of their sacrifice.The body of Colonel B Santosh Babu, which was brought to Hyderabad by a special aircraft, was taken to his native Suryapet town by an ambulance as people holding the tricolour showered flowers on it.Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan and state IT and Industries Minister K T Rama Rao were among those who paid their last respects.A large number of people assembled and shouted anti-China slogans in sepoy Ankush Thakur’s Karohta village in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.The 21-year-old was recruited to the Punjab Regiment in 2018 and was a third-generation soldier.“We feel proud that he has laid down his life for the motherland,” said Karunakar Pradhan, the father of 28-year-old Chandrakanta Pradhan from Odisha’s Kandhamal district.Chandrakanta belonged to a tribal community and hailed from Biarpanga village.“My son was highly sincere towards his duty. He was courageous, simple and hard working. We got the information about his martyrdom on Tuesday night. We are waiting for his body,” said Karunakar Pradhan in a choked voice.A marginal farmer, Pradhan said his unmarried son was the breadwinner. The soldier has three siblings.Chandrakanta joined the Army in 2014 and had last visited home around two months ago. He was popular in the village, the soldier’s father said.Deepak Kumar from Madhya Pradesh told his grandmother Phool Kumari on phone a few days ago that he will come home after the coronavirus lockdown ends.“I spoke to him just a few days back and at that time he told me that after the lockdown ends, he will take leave and come home.“But after the lockdown ended, we got the news of his martyrdom,” Singh’s 85-year-old inconsolable grandmother said.Kundan Kumar Ojha from Jharkhand was blessed with a daughter just 17 days ago. He had promised his mother over the phone that he would be home as soon as he got leave from duty.On Wednesday, his parents were too overcome with grief to even speak.Naib Subedar Nanduram Soren, 43, from Rairangpur area of Mayurbhanj was also among the slain soldiers from Odisha.After completing Class 12 from Rairangpur College, Soren joined the Army in 1997 as he was very keen to serve the motherland. He was sincere in his duty and worked in a dedicated manner, his elder brother Doman Majhi said.Soren has left behind his wife and three school-going daughters, he said.In West Bengal, the family of Rajesh Orang, who joined the Army in 2015, said they were planning his marriage.“My son served the country and gave his life for it,” was all his grieving father Subhas could say on Wednesday morning at his modest home.Subhas said that he was informed by the Army authorities on Tuesday evening about the death of Rajesh, who was in his early 20s.Sepoy Gurbinder Singh, 22, who had joined the Army just two years ago, was among four soldiers from Punjab who were martyred in Ladakh.“We received a call at 6:30 am today that Gurbinder Singh has attained martyrdom,” said Gurpreet Singh, elder brother Gurbinder.  The body is expected to reach the village on Thursday.A pall of gloom descended on the Tolawal village in Sunam subdivision in Sangrur and mourners started assembling at Gurbinder’s house.He talked to his family around 15 days back.Gurbinder, who belonged to 3 Punjab Regiment, got engaged last year when he came back home on a brief leave, said Jagseer Singh, Gurbinder’s maternal uncle.“We had his plans for his marriage this year when he returns home on leave,” Jagseer told PTI.Sepoy Ganesh Ram Kunjam, 27, who hailed from Gidhali village in Kanker district of Chhattisgarh, had finalised his marriage during his last home visit and planned to solemnise it next year, his relatives said.After completing his education till Class 12, Ganesh Kunjam had joined the Army in 2011 as he wanted to serve the nation, his paternal uncle Tiharu Ram Kunjam said.Ganesh had come home on leave in February-March this year during which his marriage was fixed with a girl of a village in Kanker.42-year-old Naib Subedar Satnam Singh’s father Jagir Singh, a farmer, said he returned to duty in Ladakh just a month ago.“He is a great martyr and I am proud of him. He last talked to us on Monday but no one knew that was his last call,” said Jagir.Satnam’s younger brother Sukhchain Singh, who is also serving in the Army, said his brother sacrificed his life for the nation and he was proud of him.Naib Subedar Mandeep Singh and Sepoy Gurtej Singh are the other two soldiers from Punjab.Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the nation in paying tributes to the soldiers.India wants peace but is capable of giving befitting reply if instigated, he said and asserted that the sacrifice of the army men will not go in vain.Lt Governor of Ladakh R K Mathur  took part in the wreath-laying ceremony for three army personnel from the Union Territory.Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday announced Rs 25 lakh each as ex-gratia to the families of two slain soldiers  from the state.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh declared an ex-gratia compensation of up to 12 lakh, along with a government job to a next of kin of the deceased.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh and a government job for kin of each of the two soldiers from the state.Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami had announced a solatium of Rs 20 lakh to the family of the slain soldier, K Pazhani of Kadukkalur village in Ramanathapuram district.Protest were held by various organisations including Shiv Sena Dogra Front, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Rashtriya Bajrang Dal in several places in Jammu.Angry people burnt tyres and blocked the Jammu-Poonch Highway for over half-an-hour.Protesters also took to the streets in several cities like Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat in Gujarat, and in Uttar Pradesh, shouting anti-China slogans and demanding a boycott of its goods.A group of ex-armymen gathered near the Chinese embassy in Delhi to protest and were later dispersed.

We are not going to fight for that”.The TMC supremo hit out at the Centre saying, “Why do you consider Bengal so weak? If we have not been participated in one meeting, it will not decide our future.“Remember, what Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow,” she said, quoting Gopal Krishna Gokhale, liberal political leader and social reformer during the Independence movement.“We are always for the cause of the people... Maybe one day Bengal will invite everybody for a meeting,” Banerjee, who has been one of the most strident critics of the BJP, said.Calling her review meeting a “bigger” one for better management of the disease in the state, the chief minister said it looked into the cause of the people amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.“They (central government) are holding big meetings and I am holding meetings at a very grassroots level to look into the needs of the people—how to give them good treatment, how to involve everybody to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.“If there is a meeting somewhere else, it does not mean that another meeting cannot be held in another place. I did not waste time. I think the review meeting was a bigger one since we held it with COVID-19 warriors,” she said.Modi held the first round of consultation with chief ministers of Punjab, Assam, Kerala among several others states and Union Territories on Tuesday as the country gradually emerges out of the coronavirus lockdown.Chief ministers of Maharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were among those who attended the meeting on Wednesday.

17-06-2020||Suri (WB)||Bengal mourns death of two brave hearts in Ladakh faceoff||West Bengal on Wednesday mourned the loss of two of its brave sons—Rajesh Orang of Birbhum and Bipul Roy of Alipurduar—who were killed in clashes with Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.“My son served the country and gave his life for it,” was all that Subhas, Orang’s distraught father, could say.The brave heart’s mother, Mamata, was so overwhelmed with emotion that she could hardly speak. The family was hoping to get Orang married when he came home on his next leave from duty.Orang, who joined the Army in 2015, belonged to the Bihar Regiment.Subhas was informed by the Army authorities on Tuesday evening about the death of his son, who was in his early 20s.“From his childhood, my brother wanted to serve the country,” Orang’s sister Shakuntala said.“He came home on leave a few months ago and talks about his marriage were on,” she added.Subhas, a marginal farmer in Birbhum district’s Belgoria village, raised his children amid poverty.Roy was a native of Bindi village in Alipurduar district’s Totopara. He lived in Meerut with his wife and five-year-old daughter.Roy (36) had joined the Army 19 years ago and was a havildar in the Bihar Regiment.“He had come home about five months ago and had plans to construct a pucca house for the family here,” Roy’s brother said.Orang and Roy were among the 20 Indian Army personnel killed in a fierce clash with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley on Monday night, the biggest military confrontation between the two countries in over five decades that has significantly escalated the already-volatile border standoff in the region.

17-06-2020||New Delhi||18 soldiers injured in Galwan Valley clash undergoing treatment||Eighteen Army personnel sustained injuries during the violent clash with Chinese troops in Galwan Valley on Monday night and they are undergoing treatment at a military hospital, people familiar with the matter said.Out of 18, four personnel were critically injured but they are responding to treatment and are stable now, they said.Twenty Indian Army personnel including a Colonel were killed in the fierce clash in Galwan. The Chinese side also suffered casualties. China has not yet talked about the number of casualties suffered by the People’s Liberation Army.However, government sources, citing a US intelligence report, said Chinese Army suffered 35 casualties during the clash, adding it could be a combination of total number of soldiers killed and injured.The clash in Galwan Valley on Monday night is the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La in 1967 when India lost around 80 soldiers while over 300 Chinese army personnel were killed in the confrontation.People said another 58 personnel who sustained minor injuries have also been kept under supervision, adding they will be ready for joining their units in two weeks.The two armies were engaged in a standoff in Galwan and several other areas of the eastern Ladakh since May 5 when the two sides clashed on the bank of the Pangong Tso.After the standoff began, the Indian military leadership decided that Indian troops will adopt a firm approach in dealing with the aggressive posturing by the Chinese troops in all disputed areas of Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie.The Chinese Army has been gradually ramping up its strategic reserves in its rear bases near the LAC by rushing in artillery guns, infantry combat vehicles and heavy military equipment.The trigger for the face-off was China’s stiff opposition to India laying a key road in the Finger area around the Pangong Tso Lake besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.The road in the Finger area in Pangong Tso is considered crucial for India to carry out patrols. India has already decided not to stall any border infrastructure projects in eastern Ladakh in view of Chinese protests.The situation in the area deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.Prior to the clashes, both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

If you don’t treat the soldiers well then how will you win the war?”The Bench expressed strong displeasure over the Delhi Government’s decision to suspend doctors. “Stop harassing doctors and registering FIRs.

17-06-2020||New Delhi||Govt’s wheat procurement touches record high of 38.2 million tonnes||Procurement of wheat by the government agencies reached an all-time high of 382 lakh metric tonnes this year with Madhya Pradesh emerging as the largest contributor to the central pool with 129 LMT, surpassing Punjab with 127 LMT.The record was achieved on June 16 when wheat procurement surpassed the earlier record of 381.48 LMT during 2012-13 with Haryana contributing 74 LMT, Uttar Pradesh 32 LMT and Rajasthan 19 LMT, according to the Food and Consumer Affairs Ministry.In the period, 119 LMT paddy was also procured, the maximum, 64 LMT, being from Telangana followed by Andhra Pradesh (31 LMT) and Odisha (14 LMT).While there is no official explanation for increase in wheat procurement in Madhya Pradesh, experts say there could be many reasons, one of which may be lower participation of private players due to COVID-19 lockdown.Agriculture expert Sudhir Panwar explains: “Usually, private players prefer MP wheat, which is considered of better quality. This year, private participation may have been less because of the lockdown.”“Wheat production in MP has been rising because of good incentives by the state government. The area of MP is also more than Punjab. Besides, the MSP announced by the Centre was more than open market price. The government also allocated more money for purchase,” says Panwar.The proximity of MP to Mumbai and southern states also makes it a better purchasing place for private players, he adds.Meanwhile according to the Centre, all over India, 42 lakh farmers benefitted and a total amount of about Rs 73,500 crore was given as Minimum Support Price for wheat.The hefty inflow of food grains into central pool ensured that FCI is ready to meet any additional requirement of food grains for the people of the country in the coming months, it says.This has been accomplished during the trying times of COVID-19 pandemic when the whole country was under lockdown. The commencement of procurement was delayed by a fortnight due to the first lockdown and kicked off only from April 15 in most of the wheat surplus states as against the standard April 1. Extraordinary efforts have been made by state governments and all government procuring agencies led by Food Corporation of India (FCI) to ensure that wheat is procured from farmers without any delay and in a safe manner.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govts-wheat-procurement-touches-record-high-of-38-2-million-tonnes-100497
17-06-2020||New Delhi||Will shortly take decision on conducting remaining exams of Class XII: CBSE to SC||The Central Board of Secondary Education on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that it will “very shortly” take appropriate decision on the issue raised in a plea that has sought quashing of the notification for conducting remaining examinations of Class 12 from July 1 to July 15 amid the increase in number of COVID-19 cases across the country.The counsel appearing for the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) requested a bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar, which heard the matter through video-conferencing, for a short adjournment so that he could apprise the apex court about the decision on the issue.“During the course of argument, Rupesh Kumar, counsel appearing for Central Board of School Education, informed the court that Central Board of School Education is in the process of taking appropriate decision with regard to the subject matter of this petition very shortly,” the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, noted in its order.The top court was hearing a plea, filed by some parents of students who are appearing in Class 12 examination, which has sought a direction to CBSE to declare the results on the basis of exam already conducted and to calculate it on an average basis with internal assessment marks of remaining subjects.The Bench, while taking into account the submissions of the board’s counsel, posted the matter for hearing on June 23.Raising concern over the safety of lakhs of students, the plea has said that they might be exposed to COVID-19 infection if they have to appear in the examinations amid the increase in number of cases of virus infection.It has urged the apex court to quash the May 18 notification of the CBSE by which the date sheet for remaining exams of Class 12 was declared and also to stay it till the plea is decided by the court.“The said petition would also demonstrate the extent of discriminatory and arbitrariness conduct of the respondent/CBSE in issuing the notification for holding of the remaining examination and that too in the month of July, 2020 wherein as per the AIIMS data, the said COVID-19 pandemic would be at its peak,” the plea has said.It has alleged that considering the gravity of COVID-19 pandemic, the CBSE has cancelled the examinations of Class 10 and 12 for around 250 schools abroad and has adopted the criteria of awarding marks on the basis of either practical exams conducted or the internal assessment marks.“It is highly regretful that the respondents (CBSE and Ministry of Human Resource Development) herein have no genuine concern about putting the lives at peril of all the students pan India and have no explanation whatsoever in insisting upon holding the said examination in India,” the plea claimed. It said that in April this year, the CBSE had directed the schools to promote students of Classes 9 and 11 to the respective next grades on the basis of school based assessments.It also said that on May 25, the Ministry of Human Resource and Development had announced about conducting of exams for classes X and XII class students in almost 15,000 exam centres as against 3,000 centres which were used earlier.“Ensuring proper cleanliness and safety standards as prescribed by the concerned government in COVID-19 situation in those 15,000 exam centres spreading over length and breadth of the country including rural sectors would not only be risking health and life of children but also would be an exercise in futility and an eyewash,” the plea said.It said even if it is to be assumed that 50 per cent of coronavirus cases are asymptomatic then the students, who will appear in the exams, could be potential careers posing a great risk to themselves and also their family members. The plea said that several premier educational institutes like Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) have cancelled its exams, including those of final year students, because of the pandemic situation.The plea has also raised concern over the issue where an examination centre might fall within the COVID-19 containment zone.

17-06-2020||Beijing||Chinese foreign minister calls Jaishankar; both leaders agree to ‘cool down’ tensions||Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and the two leaders agreed to “cool down” tensions on the ground “as soon as possible” and maintain peace and tranquility in the border area in accordance with the agreement reached between the two countries, an official statement said here.The telephonic conversation between the two ministers came after 20 Indian Army personnel were killed in the clashes with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on Monday night, the biggest military confrontation in over five decades that has significantly escalated the already volatile border standoff between the two countries.During the telephonic conversation, Jaishankar conveyed to Wang India’s protest in the strongest terms on the violent face-off and said the unprecedented development will have “serious impact” on bilateral ties. He asked the Chinese side to reassess its actions and take corrective steps, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement in New Delhi.“The Chinese side took pre-meditated and planned action that was directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties. It reflected an intent to change the facts on ground in violation of all our agreements to not change the status quo,” Jaishankar told Wang.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement here that the two sides agreed to deal “fairly” with the serious events caused by the conflict in the Galwan Valley, jointly abide by the consensus reached at the military-level meetings between the two sides, “cool down the situation on the ground as soon as possible”, and maintain peace and tranquility in the border area in accordance with the agreement reached so far between the two countries.During the conversation, Wang said the two sides should follow the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries and strengthen the communication and coordination on the proper handling of the border situation through the existing channels so as to jointly maintain peace and tranquility in the border area, according to the statement.India on Tuesday said the violent face-off between the armies of India and China in eastern Ladakh was the result of an attempt by the Chinese side to unilaterally change the status quo in the region.The Ministry of External Affairs said both sides suffered casualties that could have been avoided had the agreement arrived earlier at the higher level been scrupulously followed by the Chinese side.Wang emphasized that both China and India are emerging powers with a population of over one billion people, and accelerating “our own development and revitalisation is our respective historical missions”.For this reason, mutual respect and mutual support is the right direction for the two sides, which is in the long-term interests of the two countries; “mutual suspicion and mutual friction are evil paths, and contrary to the fundamental aspirations of the two peoples,” he said.The Chinese foreign minister also alleged that on the evening of June 15, the Indian front-line frontier troops “blatantly broke the consensus” reached at the military-level meeting between the two sides.Once the situation in the Galwan Valley has calmed down, they “crossed the LAC again and deliberately provoked and violently attacked” the officers and soldiers who negotiated on the spot, leading to fierce physical clashes, resulting in casualties, he claimed.He said this “dangerous act of the Indian army seriously violated the agreement reached between the two countries on the border issue and seriously violated the basic norms of international relations”. Wang demanded the Indian side to conduct a “thorough investigation” on this, “severely punish those responsible” for the incident, “strictly control the frontline troops”, and “immediately stop all provocative actions” to ensure that such incidents cannot occur again.“The Indian side must not misjudge the current situation, and must not underestimate China’s firm will to safeguard the territorial sovereignty,” he added.A large number of Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in an eyeball-to-eyeball situation in Galwan Valley and certain other areas of eastern Ladakh for the last five weeks, including in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh.Monday’s face-off was the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La when India lost around 80 soldiers while over 300 Chinese army personnel were killed in the face-off.The Indian Army has been fiercely objecting to the transgressions, and demanded their immediate withdrawal for restoration of peace and tranquillity in the area. Both sides held a series of talks in the last few days to resolve the row.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC). China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.

17-06-2020||---||Moratorium on loan: You can’t leave everything to banks, SC tells Centre||Satya PrakashTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 17Noting that everything can’t be left to banks, the Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Government to consider interfering on the issue of interest waiver for the loan moratorium announced in view of the COVID-19 lockdown.“The Central Government can’t raise its hands in helplessness... After announcing moratorium, it can’t now say it’s between banks and customers. If you announced the moratorium, you must ensure the benefits are given to customers purposefully,” a three-judge Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said.Announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in March for three months, the loan moratorium is a legal authorisation to debtors to postpone the payment of the EMIs. It has now been extended to six months till August 31, 2020.The RBI and the Centre maintained that a complete interest waiver was not possible as the banks, too, had to pay interest to depositors.Responding to a PIL filed by Gajendra Sharma, the RBI had told the court that forced waiver of interest on term loans would jeopardise the financial health and stability of banks and would also harm debtors’ interests.The Bench, however, said many customers didn’t avail of the moratorium as they knew they weren’t getting any benefits.“Our limited concern is to ease the burden on borrowers during these trying times,” it said.“You (Centre) took time to find a way out but nothing has happened. The Centre can’t leave it to the banks now,” said the Bench which also included Justice SK Kaul and Justice MR Shah.The Apex Court asked the Centre and the RBI to review the situation and clarity if banks could come up with new guidelines for specific sectors such as agriculture, auto, business and home loans in this regard.It wanted to know if banks can forgo interest on the outstanding loans or if the Centre could share the burden.It posted the matter for further hearing in the first week of August after senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, representing the banks, said the case should be taken up after three months as they will know the burden of moratorium by then.Earlier, the Supreme Court had asked the RBI to examine if the benefits of its policy decisions were being passed on to the borrowers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/moratorium-on-loan-you-cant-leave-everything-to-banks-sc-tells-centre-100482

The alleged fraud came to light when the bank’s officials ordered a forensic audit by Ernst & Young, according to the company.Cases of forgery have also been registered against the businessman-politician, who was in the news recently for trying to lure away NCP MLAs to help Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP to form the government in Maharashtra earlier this year.The CBI officials on Wednesday said five premises, including several owned by Kamboj and his associates, had been raided and several incriminating documents recovered from them.Later this afternoon, Kamboj issued a statement saying that he had availed of the one-time settlement facility and repaid Rs 30 crores to the bank in 2018.“The bank has filed a case one-and-half-years after the case has been closed,” Kamboj said.However, in its complaint with the CBI, Bank of India has alleged that some of its own officials had permitted the one-time settlement with Kamboj and his companies as part of a criminal conspiracy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-books-mumbai-bjp-leader-for-defrauding-bank-of-india-of-rs-57-cr-100478

According to a new survey, majority of Indians think living in an area with high air pollution increases the risk of “catching Covid -19, be severely ill and making it harder to recover”.There are also “high levels of support” for measures to limit air pollution, including stricter laws, when the pandemic comes to an end.Majority of Indians have noticed an improvement in air quality since lockdown and think air quality in their local area should be improved. There is overwhelming support for policy measures to support clean air, says a public perception survey on air pollution by the Clean Air Fund (CAF) in partnership with global market research firm YouGov.The report “Breathing Space” based on e-samples from countries like India, UK, Poland, Bulgaria and Nigeria also makes recommendations for governments to put clean air strategies at the heart of plans to rebuild from Covid-19.According to the survey, the majority of respondents in India think air pollution directly affects their general health and is the number one public health concern alongside infectious disease. Therefore as many as 85 percent in the survey also supported stricter laws and/or enforcement of regulations on air quality.Incentives to help people and businesses use cleaner forms of transport (e.g. cleaner vehicles, public transport, walking and cycling) and more Clean Air Zones in cities (e.g. where the most polluting vehicles are charged more) got the support from 84% respondents.Improved public transport services (including greater service frequency) assuming effective and proportionate infection control measures are in place from 83%, repurposing roads in cities to allow more space for walking and/or cycling from 82% and the same percentage for more investment in the electric vehicle sector.Incentives to help people use cleaner fuels in their home for cooking and heating was supported by 80% of the respondents in India according to the survey, a government scheme to replace gas boilers with electric ones by 78% and restrictions on the use of polluting fuels in homes for cooking and heating by 76%.As much as 73% supported switching spending on new roads to spending on public transport and 59% to road pricing for private/individual’s vehicles “where you pay per mile driven”.According to the survey all Indians think air pollution affects their general health; 94% think air pollution affects general health; 60% think it affects their general health a ‘great deal’ while 30% think it affects it ‘a fair amount’.Vast majority of Indians are concerned about air pollution as a public health issue, putting it on a level with concern for infectious disease. As much as 86% were worried about air pollution as a public health issue. As many as 80% believe it to be on a level with infectious disease and ahead of climate change, mental health (73%), drugs and alcohol (71%), smoking (68%) and obesity (65%).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/85-indians-support-stricter-laws-to-improve-air-quality-survey-100462

If an FIR can be filed against me, the MP CM should also be booked. We demand that the MP Police register an FIR against him just as they did against me,” Digvijaya told reporters outside the crime branch office.“I had written a letter to Chouhan that the tribals in his constituency Budhni were duped of Rs 450 crore. I wrote to him that if no action is taken in this case, I will be forced to sit on a dharna outside the CM's residence. After this, an FIR was filed against me,” he said.Digvijaya Singh also accused the state government of harassing his party workers, who were booked along with him.“The Congress workers are being harassed by the police. The police should first investigate the source of the video and who edited it and then take action,” he added.In the letter submitted to the crime branch, Singh alleged that Chouhan had tweeted a fake video of Rahul Gandhi on May 16, 2019 “to malign his image” in the public.The Congress leader also submitted links of some prominent news portals along with this complaint.As per the complaint, Chouhan’s tweet read: “What is this? Rahul ji, you have changed the Madhya Pradesh’s Chief Minister for not waiving off loans of farmers on time, at least in speech. Only a great person like you can do such things in a jiffy.”Chouhan had also shared a video of Rahul Gandhi with the tweet.According to the news report attached with the complaint, Chouhan’s reaction was to the 13-second video of Rahul Gandhi in which the latter purportedly says: “Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Bhupesh Baghel ji, Chhattisgarh’s Chief Minister Hukum Singh Karada ji.”The speech was reportedly given by Rahul Gandhi at a poll rally in MP’s Neemuch on May 14, 2019.The news item tagged by Singh also mentions a link of Rahul Gandhi’s “original” speech, in which he purportedly said: “Kamal Nath ji, Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Bhupesh Baghel ji, Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Hukum Singh Karada ji, PC Sharma ji.”By re-tweeting this tweet of Chouhan, Union Minister Smriti Irani helped the MP CM in this criminal conspiracy, Digvijaya Singh’s complaint said.The Congress leader demanded that a case against Chouhan, Irani and their associates be filed under the IPC Sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 469 (forgery to harm the reputation) 500 (defamation), 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory), 505 (2) (public mischief) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and relevant sections of the IT Act.Meanwhile, Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Crime branch, Nischal Jharia, told PTI that a letter had been received in this regard and "suitable action would be taken after an investigation into the matter.”Reacting to the development, state Home Minister Dr Narottam Mishra said: “It would have been better had he (Digvijaya) filed the complaint against the cheating with the farmers in Rs 2-lakh farm loan waiver, in providing unemployment allowance, giving scooty and laptops to girls. He will vanish after the Rajya Sabha polls.”Farm loan waiver, giving unemployment allowance, giving scooty and laptops were the poll promises given by the Congress ahead of the last state assembly polls held in November 2018.On Monday, Digvijaya Singh, MP Congress’ social media coordinator Avinash Kadbe and 10 others were booked under the IPC Sections 500 (defamation), 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory), 505 (2) (public mischief) and 465 (forgery) on a complaint lodged by BJP leaders.

17-06-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Do not wish to see more clashes in Galwan Valley: China Foreign Office||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 17The Chinese Foreign Office on Wednesday said it did not wish to see more clashes with Indian troops in the Galwan Valley, a day after both sides suffered casualties in a physical face-off.India has confirmed 20 deaths while China usually does not release its casualty figures.At the same time, a wide gulf remained between the two sides on the trigger for the clashes at the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “The incident happened on the Chinese side of LAC and China is not to blame for it,” said Zhao Lijian, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson.On the other hand, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastav, in his statement on Tuesday was categorical that China had reneged on an understanding between army commanders at a meeting on June 6. “While it was our expectation that this would unfold smoothly, Chinese intransigence led to the events taking a different turn,” he had said.In the Chinese media, though the hawkish Global Times kept up a steady stream of articles on the LAC tensions but analysts took a particular note of the People’s Daily terming the clash as “the most severe in decades”. The official newspaper of the powerful Central Committee of the Communist Party of China said it was “a provocative military operation staged by Indian troops to capture Chinese territory and shift domestic pressure”.Both Foreign Office spokespersons also differed on the location of the clash. “India is very clear that all its activities are always within the Indian side of the LAC. We expect the same of the Chinese side,” Srivastav had said.Zhao also made similar assertions. “The right and wrong of this is very clear. The sovereignty of the Galwan Valley area has always belonged to China. The Indian border troops flip-flopped and seriously violated our border protocols on border-related issues and the consensus of our commander-level talks,’’ he observed and added that both sides are in communication through diplomatic and military channels.Meanwhile, the US State Department condoled the loss of lives on the Indian side saying it was closely monitoring the situation between Indian and Chinese forces along the LAC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/do-not-wish-to-see-more-clashes-in-galwan-valley-china-foreign-office-100449
17-06-2020||New Delhi||Private hospitals in Delhi ask for manpower, time for augmenting COVID beds||A leading private hospital has requested the Delhi government to provide it with the paramedic and other healthcare workers to supplement its existing staff in manning the additional COVID beds being added to the facility, according to sources.The request has been sent by Fortis Hospital authorities nearly a week after the city government had ordered 22 hospitals to enhance bed capacity by 20 per cent to add a little over 2,000 additional COVID beds in total for patients.Fortis Group’s three hospitals located at Shalimar Bagh, Vasant Kunj and Okhla are among these 22 facilities.“We have limited manpower, and the bed expansion has been ordered. It will difficult to get extra manpower, especially at this time since many healthcare workers are themselves falling ill after getting infected by COVID-19. So, we have requested the Delhi government for some paramedic and other staff,” a source at the hospital said.At the Shalimar Bagh facility, Fortis had to expand the COVID beds from 52 to 100, while total COVID beds at Vasant Kunj and Okhla facilities after expansion would be 200 and 100 respectively, according to the government order.Meanwhile, sources at the Apollo Indraprastha Hospital said they have sought more time to augment the bed capacity.“We have requested the Delhi government to grant us a bit more time to expand our number of beds as per the revised requirement, which is 300 COVID beds,” a source at the facility said.The existing capacity at Apollo hospital as per the order is 133.However, a source at Max Healthcare said increasing the number of beds is a challenge but “we had prepared ourselves from day one, anticipating the growing requirements”.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal recently had said Delhi would need 1.5 lakh beds in healthcare facilities by July 31 once people start coming to the city for treatment from other states.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had said that around 7,000 beds will be occupied by June 15, and 15,000 beds will be occupied by June 30.India registered the highest-ever spike of 2,003 COVID-19 fatalities pushing the death toll to 11,903 on Wednesday after Maharashtra and Delhi added earlier deaths that were not attributed to the disease.

But in a late evening statement, it revised the figure to 20, saying 17 others who “were critically injured in the line of duty and exposed to sub-zero temperatures at the standoff location succumbed to their injuries.”Government sources said the Chinese side too suffered “proportionate casualties” but chose not to speculate on the number.It is the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La when India lost around 80 soldiers while over 300 Chinese army personnel were killed in the confrontation.

This poses an enormous risk for millions across India who have only recently emerged from poverty.”The support to India also aims to ensure economic resilience to prevent long-term damage to the productive capacity, including human capital, of the country's economy, Pandian added.The AIIB’s total sovereign loans to India that have already been approved amount to $3.06 billion, including a recent $500 million COVID-19 emergency response.The current loan will be the second for India under the AIIB’s COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility (CRF).While the AIIB does not have a regular instrument for policy-based financing, the Bank is extending such financing on an exceptional basis under the CRF to support its members through projects co-financed with the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank.As per the statement, the AIIB is currently reviewing projects from its members.The AIIB began operations in January 2016 and has 102 approved members worldwide.

After that the trio was arrested,” he said.All of them were booked under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and further investigation into the matter was underway, he added.Five elephants have so far died in the state since June 9.Last week, carcasses of two elephants were recovered from the Pratappur forest range of Surajpur district on June 9 and 10, while another jumbo was found dead in neighbouring Balrampur district on June 11.Later, three state forest officials and a guard were suspended, while a show-cause notice was issued to a divisional forest officer in Balrampur for alleged dereliction of duty.In another incident on Tuesday, an elephant calf was found dead in a marshland near Urputi (Mongri) village in Dhamtari district.

The job requires him to handle bodies of those dying of coronavirus. The shift runs from 12 noon to 8 pm.“I took the job after I exhausted all my options to find work. This is a dangerous job, as I am at a higher risk of contracting the infection, but I need the job. "Our family, including three sisters, two brothers and parents, is struggling without money. Right now, we need food and medicines for my mother,” Chand says.“Kayin din ghar me khana ek hi baar bana (On many days, we cooked food only once). There is a possibility that we may survive the virus, but we cannot escape hunger,” he says.Chand says his three sisters are in school. He, a class 12 student himself, is yet to pay the school fee. "Paisa chahiye padhai ke liye (you need money to study),” he says.Chand hopes that his first salary will set things right to a certain extent. "I offer ‘namaz' before I step out of home for work. I have faith in the almighty. He will take care of me and show me the way,” Chand, who wants to study medicine, says. But what bothers the youngster is that employees like him who are into high-risk jobs do not get any insurance from the private companies employing them.         “The most dangerous job in the world right now (handling bodies of COVID-19 patients) pays around Rs 17,000 per month,” he sighs. Every day, Chand handles around two to three bodies along with another sweeper."We are required to put the bodies inside the ambulance, take it to the crematorium and put it down on a stretcher once we reach the crematorium,” he says.“And, you have to do all this wearing the personal protection equipment (PPE), which is very heavy. It limits movement and suffocates a person. In this heat, you end up bathing in your own sweat,” he says. On Tuesday evening, Chand handled a body on his own. "I had no help. So, it took me some time, I was gasping for breath at the end,” he says."I heard a doctor saying the body had been lying in the mortuary for a month and that nobody claimed it. The person who packed it did not do his job properly. When I tried taking it down from the ambulance, the cover came off and some liquid spilled on my thighs," he says.  Desperate to get some money, Chand says he has approached people giving money on low interest rates. "I took my Aadhaar card and voter identity card, hoping to get some money on low interest rates," he says. Chand's family is worried about his safety, but they are also aware that this is the only way for them to survive at present.  “My parents inquire about my work daily. They pray for my safety.

Venkata Subbaiah had never thought life would suddenly take a bitter turn. Subbaiah was teaching Telugu at a leading corporate school in Andhra Pradesh's Nellore town, but lost the job to corona-induced lockdown and was forced to sell bananas for a living and to feed his wife and two children, aged five and six years.He was reportedly told by his school management to ensure admission of six to seven new students for the new academic year to get the salary and to retain the job, which he could not do. Despite the struggle, he is not able to earn even Rs 200 a day. His monthly salary as a teacher was Rs 16,000 and he was spending half the amount to repay Rs 3.5 lakh loan he had taken for his child's medical treatment.Moved by his plight, some of his former students started raising funds to help him out and have already gathered about Rs 87,000.Thanking the former students for their gesture, Subbaiah said he started selling bananas to tide over the current crisis but if given a chance, he would love to return to the profession he loves the most.

The top court asked the union health secretary and state chief secretaries to issue guidelines in this regard.The court was dealing with a PIL filed by Udaipur-based doctor Arushi Jain who alleged that frontline healthcare workers were not being paid salaries or their salaries had been reduced or delayed. She also questioned the Centre’s new SOP making their 14-day quarantine non-mandatory.Taking serious note of non-payment of salaries and lack of proper accommodation for doctors and medical workers amid COVID19 pandemic, the Supreme Court on June 12 asked the Centre to address their concerns at the earliest.“In a war, you do not make soldiers unhappy. Travel an extra mile and channel some extra money to address their grievances. The country cannot afford to have dissatisfied soldiers in this war against Corona,” it had told Mehta.“We saw report that doctors went on strike. In Delhi, some doctors have not been paid for past three months. These are concerns that should have been taken care off. It should not require court intervention," the Bench had said, adding, the government needed to do more to address their concerns.The top court had earlier said doctors and medical staff were the “first line of defence of the country” in the battle against COVID19 and directed the Centre to ensure appropriate PPEs were made available to them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-centre-states-to-ensure-timely-payment-of-salaries-to-doctors-health-workers-100428

They were snatched by their families. China has snatched our land from us. Where are you Mr Prime Minister. Why are you hiding? Come out of your hiding. The whole nation is standing with you. Don’t fear. Come out and take the nation into confidence. We are all with you,” Gandhi said in a recorded video.देश के वीर शहीदों को मेरा सलाम।https://t.co/hikmIWBADa  Why is the PM silent? Why is he hiding? Enough is enough. We need to know what has happened. How dare China kill our soldiers?How dare they take our land?  Earlier this morning, Gandhi tweeted “Enough is enough. We need to know what has happened. How dare China kill our soldiers?How dare they take our land?" The Army initially said on Tuesday that an officer and two soldiers were killed. But in a late evening statement it revised the figure to 20, saying 17 others who "were critically injured in the line of duty and exposed to sub-zero temperatures at the standoff location succumbed to their injuries." Government sources said the Chinese side too suffered "proportionate casualties" but chose not to speculate on the number.It is the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La when India lost around 80 soldiers, while over 300 Chinese army personnel were killed in the confrontation.Our land, our sovereignty is being threatened, our soldiers and officers have been martyred, are we just going to remain silent?

17-06-2020||Arun Joshi||China warns India on borders in Ladakh, says ‘fears no conflicts’||Jammu, June 17China has warned India of staying within its borders for any violation would invite repercussions saying New Delhi while dealing with China should get rid of what it called two misjudgements - working at the behest of the US and to think that the Indian Army is more powerful than the Chinese Army.In a hard-hitting editorial in Global Times in the wake of Galwan Valley, it has stated it clearly and in an unveiled threatening tone, “The gap between China's and India's strength is clear,” implying that it has superior army, weaponry and fighting skills in fighting in all terrains in all-weather conditions.Global Times is a mouthpiece of the Communist Party of China that rules the country. The Chinese government sells its intentions and propaganda mostly through this newspaper, more than the official channels. It is a well-established practice in China, because it helps in China to live in official denial on sensitive issues without losing the opportunity to say what it wants to through this newspaper.Read also:Do not wish to see more clashes in Galwan Valley: China Foreign OfficeGalwan Valley clashes: Modi to hold all-party meet on FridayLoss of soldiers in Galwan deeply disturbing and painful: RajnathWhy is PM 'silent', why is he 'hiding', asks Rahul on India-China face-offThe editorial read, “China does not want to turn border issues with India into a confrontation. This is goodwill and restraint from China. But China is confident in the situation at the border. It does not and will not create conflicts, but it fears no conflicts either.” This was a warning of sorts that China wanted to deliver to India. It sought to serve a strategic goal for its own people that China has a robust policy and military that can change anything on the ground. It is evidenced from these words in the edit, “This policy is supported by both morality and strength. We will not trade our bottom line with anyone.”It, however, meddles with the Indian foreign policy as also raises questions about the Indian Army’s strength. It has asked India against the backdrop of Ladakh clashes not to serve the US interests and noted that the US resources to invest in India-China relationship are quite limited.China has not revealed, nor will it ever, the casualties it suffered during the physical clashes in the Galwan Valley, for this approach sits pretty with its time-tested policy of erasing history that could cause it embarrassment, militarily or politically.The newspaper’s line echoes the Chinese official line that the clashes took place because India undertook a “provocative” action of intruding into its territory. This charge has been rejected by India.The Chinese newspaper, in short, has asked India not to exercise its right on the territory in Galwan Valley, which is part of India, and had witnessed no contesting claims from China until May this year.China is tweaking the narrative to browbeat India through its propaganda machinery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-warns-india-on-borders-in-ladakh-says-fears-no-conflicts-100398
17-06-2020||United Nations||India set for comfortable victory in UN Security Council elections||India is expected to register a comfortable victory in the Security Council elections on Wednesday that will bring the country to the UN high-table as a non-permanent member for the 2021-22 term.The 193-member UN General Assembly will hold elections for President of the 75th session of the Assembly, five non-permanent members of the Security Council and members of the Economic and Social Council under special voting arrangements put in place at the UN headquarters due to COVID-19 related restrictions.India is all set to join the powerful 15-nation Security Council as a non-permanent member. India is a candidate for a non-permanent seat from the Asia-Pacific category for the 2021-22 term.India's victory is certain since it is the sole candidate vying for the lone seat from the grouping. New Delhi's candidature was unanimously endorsed by the 55-member Asia-Pacific grouping, including China and Pakistan, in June last year.President of the UN General Assembly Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on Monday circulated a letter to member states with the names of candidates for the various elections. For the two vacant seats from among the African and Asia-Pacific States, three candidates have been communicated, namely, Djibouti, India and Kenya.Of those three candidates, India and Kenya are endorsed candidates. For the one vacant seat from among the Latin American and Caribbean States, one endorsed candidate has been communicated, namely, Mexico.For the two vacant seats from among the Western European and other States, three candidates have been communicated, namely, Canada, Ireland and Norway.Each year the General Assembly elects five non-permanent members (out of 10 in total) for a two-year term.The 10 non-permanent seats are distributed on a regional basis as follows: five for African and Asian States; one for Eastern European States; two for the Latin American and Caribbean States; and two for Western European and other States.To be elected to the Council, candidate countries need a two-thirds majority of ballots of Member States that are present and voting in the Assembly.India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti has said that India's presence in the Security Council will help bring to the world its ethos of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam', as he underscoring that the United Nations as well as multilateralism need to change to reflect contemporary realities and remain credible as the world organization marks its 75th anniversary this year,        “India's journey with the United Nations is quite a remarkable one. As a founding member of the United Nations, India's contribution to implementing the goals of the United Nations Charter and to the evolution of UN specialised agencies and programmes has been substantial. In many ways, quite extraordinary,” Tirumurti said in a video message ahead of the elections. “I'm confident that at a time when we are poised to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations and later the 75th anniversary of India's independence in 2022, India's presence in the Security Council will help bring to the world our ethos that the world is one family - Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,” he said.Ahead of the elections, India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar outlined New Delhi's priorities for its candidature to the Council. Termed as NORMS, India's focus will be on ‘New Orientation For A Reformed Multilateral System.'            India's priorities include new opportunities for progress, effective response to international terrorism, reforming multilateral systems, comprehensive approach to peace and security and technology with a human touch.Tirumurti said as the UN commemorates its 75th anniversary this year, “it is clear to us that the United Nations and indeed multilateralism itself need to change to reflect contemporary realities to enable them to remain effective and credible.”                         The Indian envoy referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for reformed multilateralism and reform of multilateral system as essential to ensure that the international system is inclusive and caters to requirements of all countries, which will in turn facilitate stronger action. “We also believe that the current crisis that we face, especially in the context of COVID-19, provides the seed for new opportunities,” Tirumurti said.Previously, India has been elected as a non-permanent member of the Council for the years 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985, 1991-1992 and most recently in 2011-2012.India has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the Security Council saying it rightly deserves a place as a permanent member of the Council, which in its current form does not represent the geo-political realities of the 21st Century.

While the “strategic silence” could be explained as part of a calculated effort by New Delhi not to escalate the situation, the absence of authentic information saw several other claims of greater number of casualties on the Indian side being circulated till late evening.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/strategic-silence-in-era-of-info-warfare-100286

The media has misinterpreted the reporting, as a result, the authors have withdrawn from the website,” stated the PGI spokesperson.The study claimed that the peak stage of Covid-19 pandemic in India had been delayed by the eight-week lockdown, along with strengthened public health measures, and it may now arrive around mid-November during which there could be a shortage of isolation facility, ICU beds and ventilators.Dr Shankar Prinja could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/icmr-refutes-mid-nov-peak-study-withdrawn-100094

In the afternoon, the Army had announced that Col Santosh Babu, Commanding Officer of Bihar Regiment’s 16th Battalion, Havildar K Palani and Sepoy Ojha had been killed in action. Later, it said 17 others had succumbed to injuries.More than 900 troops on each side were involved in a physical clash, which started Monday night and ended in the early hours of Tuesday. Most of the deaths occurred as soldiers during a physical fight fell off the cliff into the river in the narrow Galwan valley. While some died of hypothermia, the others due to injuries.Stones, iron and bamboo poles with nails embed on them were used by the Chinese to attack the Indian troops. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) also suffered fatal casualties, however, their number was not confirmed. The Indian Army categorically said “no bullets were fired in the clash”. The casualties would have been manifold had bullets been fired.Sources said the clash occurred at an altitude of 15,000 feet. The PLA, which was in talks with the Indian Army to de-escalate the 40-day standoff, had build a fresh post and set up arctic tents at vantage points on the south bank of the Galwan river.The post gave a clear view to the Chinese of the vital 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Baig Oldie (DSDBO) road, India’s only link to Depsang, Murgo and Karakoram Pass. The post was 5 km from the DSDBO road, the Galwan river flows in an east-to-west direction and joins the Shyok river.Troops noticed the fresh post near Patrol Point 14 and asked the Chinese to vacate. The number of Indian troops was higher on the spot and a clash ensued. The PLA sent in reinforcements and another clash ensued. The disengagement plan decided on June 6 at the meeting of Corps Commander level was to ask both sides to withdraw from the valley. However, PLA’s Western Theater Command spokesperson Col Zhang Shuili made a fresh claim on Tuesday, saying “China always owns sovereignty over the Galwan Valley region.” Till now, the Indian side had maintained there was no dispute at Galwan and LAC, which is not demarcated on ground, matched the Chinese claim line proposed in 1956.900 men on both sides, but ‘No bullets fired’More than 900 troops on each side were involved in the clash, which started on Monday night and ended early on Tuesday. Most of the deaths occurred as soldiers fell off the cliff into the river. Some died due to hypothermia while others due to injuries.

We expect the same of the Chinese side.Both sides suffered casualties that could have been avoided had the agreement at the higher level been scrupulously followed by the Chinese side, said the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.He pointed out that the clash happened as a result of an attempt by the Chinese side to unilaterally change the status quo there.Giving a rundown of the events that led to the violence, MEA said both sides had been discussing through military and diplomatic channels the de-escalation of the situation in the border area in eastern Ladakh.Senior commanders had a productive meeting on June 6 and agreed on a process for such de-escalation. Subsequently, ground commanders had a series of meetings to implement the consensus reached at a higher level. “While it was our expectation that this would unfold smoothly, Chinese intransigence led to the events taking a different turn,” said Srivastava. “We remain firmly convinced of the need for maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-bid-to-unilaterally-change-status-quo-mea-100241

Layoffs on cards?A teacher working at a prestigious school in the city says all employees at her school have been working without pay for the past three months. “I am the sole breadwinner in my family comprising my children and elderly parents.

This DBO area is known in the Army as Sub-Sector North.The Darbuk-Shyok-DBO linkIndia is raising border infrastructure in this area, including the all-weather 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road. This road runs almost parallel and at places very close to the LAC and extends up to the base of the Karakoram pass, which when complete, will reduce the travel time from Leh to DBO from the present two days to just six hours. Road and bridge construction works have recently been speeded up with a large number of labourers being ferried in.The valley connects with Shyok on the road under construction and lies between DBO and Chushul to the south near Pangon Tso, another hotspot, providing convenient access to Shyok and the areas beyond.Control of the ridgeline along the valley also allows domination of the road. Looking eastwards, control of the Galwan valley gives access to the Aksai Chin plateau, through which part of the Xinjiang-Tibet highway passes. While the road is highly prone to Chinese interdiction or long-range artillery, it serves a vital peacetime role in maintaining forward posts and building up reserves. An alternative route to DBO is being developed from a different axis in Ladakh that has adequate depth from the LAC.The Galwan river flows westwards from the disputed Aksai Chin region into Ladakh after originating in Samzungling area on the eastern side of the Karakoram range and joins the Shyok river, one of the tributaries of the Indus. The fast-flowing river runs for about 80 km.The Galwan river is to the west of China’s 1956 claim line in Aksai Chin. However, in 1960 China advanced its claim line to the west of the river along the mountain ridge adjoining the Shyok river valley. India had established some military posts in this sector. During the 1962 Sino-Indian conflict, Indian posts in the Galwan Sector were attacked by the Chinese, resulting in casualties. After the war, this sector remained dormant till the recent face-offs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/proximity-to-dbo-road-link-makes-galwan-vital-100283
