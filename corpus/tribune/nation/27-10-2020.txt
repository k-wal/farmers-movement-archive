Punjab is ruled by the Congress. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chhattisgarh-house-passes-agri-bill-to-counter-centres-farm-laws-161947

27-10-2020||New Delhi||‘Baba ka Dhaba’ fame couple get free cataract surgery||Kanta Prasad and his wife—the elderly couple owning the ‘Baba ka Dhaba’ that made headlines after a video about their struggle making ends meet in the pandemic went viral—on Tuesday underwent cataract  surgery.The medical procedure has been offered to the couple by Delhi’s Sharp Sight Eye Hospital free of charge.“We spent so many years with hazy, unclear vision. But now we can see everything crystal clear. It’s like getting a new eye. Our economic condition is such that we could have never afforded cataract removal,” Kanta Prasad said.Prasad and his wife’s plight came to light last month after a social media influencer captured the 80-year-old owner of the Malviya Nagar food stall tearing up while narrating the challenges his family had been facing since the lockdown, and posted it on social media requesting people to help the couple.Soon after the video went viral, help poured in from across the city, and the country for the couple.“We saw the video and more than his helpless state, we were moved by the spirit of the old man and his wife to fight hunger and earn livelihood for their family during these challenging times,” said Deepshikha Sharma, CEO, Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals.“While many of us are confined to our homes fearing COVID-19, here’s a couple who have a bigger worry and that is to survive and have no choice but to open their eatery every single day,” Sharma said.According to the statement from the hospital, their objective was to help the couple recover their vision so that they wouldn’t have to be dependent on others.“Our team escorted the old couple to our hospital, and did a thorough eye check up and during investigations realised that their vision had deteriorated due to cataract. We decided to perform cataract surgery along with implantation of the latest type of intraocular lens as our way of giving them support,” said Samir Sud, director and senior ophthalmologist, Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals.“As a result, the old couple can lead a new life independent of glasses and see the world around them brighter and clearer once both their eyes are operated,” he said.Sud added that surgery had been performed on one eye for both of them and the second eye was scheduled to be operated on next week.

Results are to be declared on November 10.“Right before the Bihar Legislative Assembly elections, the State Bank of India, in the XIV Phase of sale, has been authorised to issue and encash Electoral Bonds through its 29 authorised branches with effect from October 19 to October 28, 2020,” stated the plea filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan.The NGO’s petition against the 2018 Electoral Bonds Scheme is already pending before the top court which had earlier refused to stay it ahead of Delhi Assembly polls earlier this year.However, it had asked the Centre and the Election Commission to respond to the NGO’s plea which has not been listed for hearing since then.Now, demanding urgent hearing, ADR said even though notification of January 2, 2018, stipulated the sale of electoral bonds in months of January, April, July and October months of each year and the “window was not opened in April and July but has been opened in October (this year) right before the Bihar legislative election”.It said in view of the passing of more than nine months since the last date of hearing of the PIL and new developments relating to Bihar legislative election having taken place, the instant plea required an urgent hearing.The NGO pointed out that it had filed the PIL on September 4, 2017, on the issue of corruption and subversion of democracy through illicit and foreign funding of political parties and lack of transparency in the accounts of all political parties.“Certain amendments made through Finance Act, 2017, and earlier Finance Act, 2016, both passed as money bills and which have opened doors to unlimited political donations, even from foreign companies and thereby legitimising electoral corruption at a huge scale while at the same time ensuring complete non-transparency in political funding,” it said.“The scheme has opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate donations to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy,” it submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/electoral-bonds-adr-moves-sc-for-urgent-hearing-in-view-of-bihar-polls-161924
27-10-2020||New Delhi||SC terms as ‘unfair’ Maharashtra’s claim that it was not heard fully in Maratha quota case||The Supreme Court on Tuesday termed as “unfair” the submission that Maharashtra was not heard fully when it had stayed the implementation of the state law to provide reservation to Marathas in jobs and education.A Bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta, and Ajay Rastogi listed the pleas seeking to lift the stay on the quota law for hearing after four weeks.During the brief hearing, senior lawyer Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Maharashtra Government, said the state was not heard fully at the time of the passing of the order.“This is not fair,” the Bench observed during the hearing conducted via video-conferencing.The apex court had stayed the implementation of the 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs last month, but made it clear that the status of those who have availed of the benefits will not be disturbed.The Maratha community accounts for 30 per cent of the population in Maharashtra and it cannot be compared to marginalised sections of the society, it had said, adding that as mandated by Article 145 (3) of the Constitution, these appeals challenging the high court order on the Maratha quota require to be considered by a larger bench.“In view of our decision to refer these appeals to a larger bench, we do not consider it necessary to adjudicate on the other points raised by the applicants,” the top court had said.According to the 102nd amendment to the Constitution, reservation can be granted only if a particular community is named in the list prepared for the purpose by the president.Earlier, the Maharashtra government had filed an application, seeking vacation of the apex court’s stay on the implementation of the Maratha quota in jobs and education amidst protests by pro-quota organisations representing the community in parts of the state over the issue.The apex court had said it is of the prima facie opinion that the Maharashtra government did not show any extraordinary situation for providing reservations to Marathas in excess of the 50 per cent cap fixed by the court in its 1992 verdict, also known as the “Mandal verdict”.It had said that appointments to public services and government posts and admissions to educational institutions for academic year 2020-21 shall be made without applying the 2018 state law providing for the Maratha quota.The Supreme Court had also said the implementation of the 2018 state law during the pendency of these appeals will cause an irreparable loss to the candidates belonging to the open category.The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, was enacted to grant reservation to the members of the Maratha community in jobs and education in Maharashtra.The Bombay High Court, while upholding the law in June last year, had held that a 16-per cent reservation was not justifiable and said the quota should not exceed 12 per cent in jobs and 13 per cent in admissions to educational institutions. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-terms-as-unfair-maharashtras-claim-that-it-was-not-heard-fully-in-maratha-quota-case-161922

The VHP has also smelled a "conspiracy" by the police and administration."The unprovoked, unnecessary and barbaric lathicharge on peaceful and unarmed devotees going for the immersion of Devi Durga idols is condemnable in the strongest terms. It is unfortunate that one devotee has died and six others seriously injured by the brutal lathicharge," said VHP's working president Alok Kumar.Munger police claimed 'elements' within the crowd who fired, which led to the death of a young man.But Alok Kumar claimed that the incident can be a "conspiracy of the local administration and police" to affect the Bihar Assembly election.In a four-part demand, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad asked for immediate suspension of the guilty police and administrative officers and inquiry against them. The VHP has also demanded that those personnel who may be found guilty in the enquiry shall be prosecuted "including under Section 302 of IPC in a fast-track court and punished". IPC 302 pertains to cases relating to murder.VHP's working President has also demanded adequate compensation for the persons "affected by the unlawful attack by the police" as well as "effective steps" to prevent the recurrence of such events in future.Earlier LJP chief Chirag Paswan, whose party is fighting against JDU, tweeted: "Munger police should be charged with murder. Devotees were fired upon in the 'Taliban-like' rule of Nitish Kumar. The area Superintendent of Police should be immediately suspended and an FIR should be registered. The family of the victim should be given Rs 50 lakh and a government job."

The distance between Sabrum and Chittagong is 75 km, and the bridge will ease the transportation of goods from Chittagong and Kolkata ports.An integrated check post is also proposed near Sabrum.The minister said construction of bridge over river Feni will improve connectivity to the international Border with Bangladesh.The four-lane bypass on western side of Agartala City is under DPR (detailed project report) preparation that will further improve the connectivity of NH-8 to NH-108B in Tripura, reduce traffic congestion in Agartala city, and connect Matabari from Airport, the statement said.The connectivity of Agartala city to Assam Border through NH-108B, 208 & 208A will provide shorter length connectivity, the statement said and added the upgradation work for Agartala to Khowai (NH 108B) and Kailashahar to Assam Border (NH-208A) has already been awarded and upgradation of balance section of Kailashahar to Khowai (NH-208) has been proposed under JICA funding.Bids for this section have already been received and work is likely to be awarded very soon.He added that the 4-laning of NH-08 from Agartala to Churaibari - the lifeline of Tripura - is under DPR preparation, which will provide faster and hassle-free Inter-state connectivity with Assam and other States with Agartala.The minister informed that DPRs for four projects of 367 km worth Rs 7,523 crore are under preparation for the state.Union Minister of State (I/c) for Development of North Eastern Region Jitendra Singh said that in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for New India, a new North East will play an important role, as all the eight states of the region are witnessing a series of developmental projects in all fields.He said that since 2014 massive steps were taken by Gadkari to bring the North Eastern Region at par with the other regions of the country and added that Centre is committed to develop all the eight states of the region in tune with the western states of India.Describing Tripura as a gateway of the “Act East Policy” of the central government, Singh said that very soon “we are also going to have a train to Bangladesh from Tripura heralding a new chapter and opening new vistas in the development of this region by providing the entire region access to the seaports”.Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways V K Singh said the projects, on completion, will provide faster and hassle-free inter-state and international connectivity to Bangladesh and will be a major stride towards strengthening tourism sector of the state.Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb also addressed the event.

27-10-2020||---||SC dismisses a PIL seeking directions to Govt to implement farm laws||New Delhi, October 27The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a PIL seeking directions to the government to implement recently enacted farm laws, saying it can’t issue such a general direction."You can't ask for a general direction to implement a law,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said while rejecting Hindu Dharma Parishad’s PIL that had also demanded banning all protests against the three farm laws.The Supreme Court had on October 12 issued notice to the Centre on petitions challenging the validity of the farm laws that have triggered protests in various parts of the country, particularly Punjab.It had the Centre to respond in six weeks to the petitions filed by Chhattisgarh Kisan Congress and others.There are several petitions against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, which were passed by the Parliament and assented to by President Ram Nath Kovind last month.The petitioners include Congress MP from Trissur in Kerala TN Prathapan, DMK MP Tiruchi Siva, RJD MP Manoj Jha and Bhartiya Kisan Party.In its petition filed on October 5, Bhartiya Kisan Party contended that the new farm laws violated the basic features of the Constitution.The party submitted that agriculture was a state subject under List II of Schedule VII of the Constitution and therefore, Parliament didn’t have the legislative competence to make laws on the subject.RJD MP Jha had contended the farm laws were “discriminatory” and would expose marginal farmers to exploitation by big companies.Siva had submitted the new farm laws would be disastrous for the farming community as they gave an "uneven edge over the farmers’ interest in favour of the sponsor or the farm service provider" while Prathapan said they opened the door for "corporate greed" of multinational companies to trample on the agriculture market.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-dismisses-a-pil-seeking-directions-to-govt-to-implement-farm-laws-161911
27-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Punjab farm laws: Instead of protecting farmers, they will limit their competitiveness, Centre’s assessment||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 27Instead of protecting farmers, Punjab farm bills “limit their competitiveness, disincentivise investment by the private sector in the state and hinder overall development of the agriculture sector", says an assessment by the Centre of counter-laws passed by the State Assembly last week.Pointing to "multiple contradictions" in Punjab's laws, including on the MSP,  it says the three Central Acts passed by the Parliament aim at providing “freedom and more choices to the farmers” through a “national framework for agreements and options of trade and commerce outside state-regulated markets in addition to existing choice of sale through state-regulated markets and under MSP”.However, “provisions in Punjab Bills are in contradiction to the Central Acts and defeat the very objective. They claim to have been passed to protect farmers but in reality do the opposite due to ambiguity and conflicting clauses".Further, the bills suggest implementation of the Central Acts will depend on the notification in the Official Gazette by the state government even when the Central Acts are already in force. "Such a change in date of implementation of Central Acts with a retrospective effect is completely unlawful," it adds.There is a clause in the Punjab law suggesting that no sale or purchase of wheat and paddy will be valid unless the price paid is equal to or greater than the MSP announced by the Central government whereas the Central Acts do not deal with MSP at all, it says.“Central Act provides for mutual agreement on the price between the buyer and the seller based on market forces and independent of MSP.“The intent behind the Central Acts is to ensure that farmers have a greater choice in the agreements they enter into and can mutually finalise prices with buyers based on quality, variety, etc., in addition to continued access to MSP procurement by the government.“Besides there is low probability that farmer agreements will be entered into for standard varieties of wheat and paddy, and hence there is no relevance of this addition by the state government,” it adds. Besides, clauses like “punitive action against buyer who pressurises a farmer to sell below MSP will create confusion among buyers and farmers regarding the crop below FAQ and not fit for procurement on MSP”.“Such provisions will lead to reduced competitiveness among Punjab farmers in comparison to other states.”Adding “any other situation” to the list of exceptional circumstances in the Essential Commodities Act "will lead to unlimited regulatory power in the hands of the state government”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-farm-laws-instead-of-protecting-farmers-they-will-limit-their-competitiveness-centres-assessment-161908

Despite me being an MP, the Siddipet Commissioner shoved me. We demand his immediate transfer.” Police put state BJP vice president D.K. Aruna, member of Telangana Legislative Council Ramachandra Rao, party’s lone MLA Raja Singh, Motkupalli Narasimhulu and others under house arrest. Security personnel were deployed at the residence of Aruna to prevent her from leaving the residence.  Rao alleged that a worried Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government planted money at the residence of a relative of BJP candidate M. Raghunandan Rao and then sent the Siddipet tehsildar and executive magistrate along with the police to seize Rs 18.67 lakh. The police, however, had a different narration of the incident saying that the police personnel accompanying the raiding party were attacked by the BJP workers. The incident triggered tension in the town following which the police prevented Bandi Sanjay from entering Siddipet and forcibly sent him back to Karimnagar. Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy rushed to the town on Monday night and called on a BJP worker who was allegedly injured in the incident during the cash seizure. The leaders accused the police of manhandling their leaders and demanded the suspension of the police commissioner and registration of criminal case against him. BJP sources said Bandi Sanjay spoke to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and apprised him of the incidents in Siddipet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-bjp-leaders-put-under-house-arrest-over-fear-of-clash-with-police-161907
27-10-2020||New Delhi||Facebook India’s Ankhi Das steps down to pursue 'public service'||Facebook India's controversial public policy head Ankhi Das is leaving the company with immediate effect "to pursue her interest in public service", the social networking giant announced on Tuesday."Ankhi has decided to step down from her role in Facebook to pursue her interest in public service. Ankhi was one of our earliest employees in India and played an instrumental role in the growth of the company and its services over the last nine years," Ajit Mohan, Vice President and Managing Director, Facebook India, said in a statement. The resignation comes after a Wall Street Journal report on August 14 said that the top leadership at Facebook's India office refused to apply the company's own rules to politicians from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), despite clear violations of Facebook's policies against incitement to violence, hate speech and misinformation.Das reportedly "told staff members that punishing violations by politicians from Mr. Modi's party would damage the company's business prospects in the country".   She also filed a police complaint for harassment and vicious online trolling after the report.Following the report, the Congress raised the issue of what it calls "unholy nexus" of the ruling BJP with Facebook and WhatsApp.International media have fully exposed Facebook’s & WhatsApp's brazen assault on India's democracy & social harmony.No one, let alone a foreign company, can be allowed to interfere in our nation's affairs.They must be investigated immediately & when found guilty, punished. pic.twitter.com/5tRw797L2y   Mohan said that Das "has been a part of my leadership team over the last two years, a role in which she has made enormous contributions."   "I have decided to step down from Facebook after long service to its mission of connecting people and building communities to pursue my personal interest in public service," Das said in a post.Last week, deposing before the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on personal data protection Bill 2019, Das was asked how much funds are spent by the social media giant on data safety, according to sources.The executives were also questioned on the quantum of Facebook's revenue as well as the profit they are making in India.Das, who was recently alleged to have ignored hate speech on its platform, along with other representatives, gave a detailed presentation.Last month, Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had written a hard-hitting letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, blaming the Facebook India management of alleged bias against people supporting the right-of-centre ideology.The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, empowers the government to ask companies for both anonymous personal and non-personal data.

27-10-2020||Patna/Darbhanga/Muzaffarpur||Modi, Rahul Gandhi in Bihar on Wednesday for second round of campaigning||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will visit Bihar on Wednesday to campaign for their respective alliances in the high-voltage state assembly polls.This will be the second electoral visit of the two leaders to Bihar. Both of them had plunged into campaigning for the three-phased state assembly elections on October 23 and addressed a series of rallies.Modi will address three public meetings at Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur and Patna to garner support for the NDA nominees in constituencies that will go to the polls in the second phase on November 3.Rahul Gandhi, who will visit Bihar on the same day as the prime minister, will address rallies at Valmiki Nagar and Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga district to canvass for the Grand Alliance.The by-poll to Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha seat will be held on November 3 along with the second round of voting in the state elections.Modi and Rahul Gandhi had kicked off their campaign in battleground Bihar on Friday last week. While Modi had addressed three back to back rallies at Dehri-On-Sone in Rohtas district, Gaya and Bhagalpur, the Congress leader had his meetings at Hisua in Nawada and Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur district.The two leaders had gone for each other’s jugular over the Chinese intrusion in Ladakh and both cried “insult” to soldiers and their families. The abrogation of Article 370, farm sector reform laws, “jungle raj” during the 15 years of RJD dispensation, the migrant crisis and joblessness too figured prominently in the bitter electoral discourse.With the rallies taking place at a time when COVID-19 is raging in Bihar, elaborate arrangements have been made keeping in mind the regulations for the deadly virus.A report from Darbhanga said that senior officials of the Special Protection Group (SPG), who provide security to the prime minister, held meeting with Darbhanga district magistrate S M Thyagrajan to ensure COVID guidelines are followed at the rally venue.Officials said that no one will be allowed inside the venue without face masks and people who will be on the dais with the prime minister have undergone RT-PCR tests.NDA candidates from across the district will sit on a separate dais near to the main one, they said.Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and BJP general secretary Bhupendra Yadav will be present on the occasion.In Muzaffarpur, the prime ministers rally will be held at Motipur, around 30 km from the district headquarters.A limited number of chairs have been put in the field where the rally will be held. The chairs have been placed inside circles marked at a distance from each other.In capital Patna, the public meeting will be held at the Veterinary College ground near the airport.Incidentally, the Veterinary College premises had been home to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad who had stayed for a long time in the early part of his early life in the quarters of his brother, who was a peon in the college.When Prasad was sent to jail in the multi-crore rupees fodder scam in July 1997, he was initially kept in the college guest house before being forwarded to Beur jail here. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-rahul-gandhi-in-bihar-on-wednesday-for-second-round-of-campaigning-161897
27-10-2020||Ahmedabad||Rahul Gandhi exempted from court appearance in defamation case||A court here on Tuesday granted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi a permanent exemption from appearance in a criminal defamation case he is facing over remarks against Union Home Minister Amit Shah.Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate RB Etaliya allowed Gandhi’s plea seeking exemption, his lawyer said.The Congress leader is facing the case for calling Shah a “murder accused” at an election rally in Rajasthan before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Gandhi’s lawyer had last September sought permanent exemption from appearance before the court for his client, stating that he was a leader of a national political party and had a busy schedule.Hearing on the plea was delayed first due to adjournments sought by the lawyer for the complainant, BJP corporator Krishnavadan Brahmbhatt.When Brahmbhatt’s lawyer S V Raju was appointed Additional Solicitor General of India, and consequently needed permission of the Union Ministry of Law and Justice to appear in the case, it caused further delay.The order on Gandhi’s plea for permanent exemption from appearance in another criminal defamation case, filed by Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank and its Chairman Ajay Patel, is also reserved for order by another city court, said Gandhi’s lawyer P S Champaneri.In the present case, Brahmbhatt has said in his complaint that the slur used by Gandhi was slanderous as Shah was discharged in the Sohrabuddin Shaikh fake encounter case in 2015.In January 2020, Gandhi appeared before the court and pleaded ‘not guilty’. He was granted bail.Ajay Patel’s complaint of defamation is about Gandhi’s claim that the cooperative bank was involved in a ‘scam’ where scrapped currency of Rs 750 crore was swapped with valid currency within five days of demonetisation in 2016.

This challenge has been gradually growing in the past decades and has taken a formidable form in the country.“This is the challenge of dynastic corruption (bhrashtachar ka vanshwaad), that is, corruption which is carried forward by one generation after another,” Modi said.He said in the past decades it has been seen that when one generation involved in corruption escapes punishment, the next generation tends to be more brazen in committing such acts.“He sees that when nothing has happened to the one who earns crores of rupees at home, then his confidence is further enhanced,” Modi said in his address in Hindi.The prime minister said there is a need to have systemic checks, effective audits, capacity building and training against corruption.“Fighting corruption is not a job of a single agency but is a collective responsibility,” Modi said after inaugurating the national conference on vigilance and anti-corruption.The three-day conference, inaugurated via video conference on Tuesday, is being organised by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dynastic-corruption-growing-challenge-for-the-country-pm-narendra-modi-161890

27-10-2020||New Delhi||Ex-CEO of Religare Enterprises Ltd held in connection with siphoning of funds: Police||The Delhi Police arrested a former CEO of Religare Enterprises Limited (REL) and one of his accomplices on Tuesday in connection with alleged siphoning of money to the tune of Rs 2,397 crore, officials said.Maninder Singh (56), a resident of Greater Kailash-II, and Narendra Kumar Goushal (56), a resident of Faridabad and the promoter-director of Arch Finance Limited, were arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police, they said.According to the police, Maninder Singh was the director and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Religare Group in 2017. He was also a member of the Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the group for disbursement of loans.Singh and one Kavi Arora allegedly sanctioned and disbursed 13 corporate loans amounting to around Rs 700 crore to sham entities, resulting in pecuniary benefits to the promoters of the Religare Group.Singh was allegedly part of a larger criminal conspiracy with Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh, the promoters of the Religare Group.Goushal, the promoter-director and majority shareholder of Arch Finance Limited, Decent Financial Services Limited and Nishu Finlease Private Limited, allegedly facilitated the financial transactions between Religare Finvest Limited (RFL) and the sham entities, a senior police officer said.He added that a substantial chunk of the loan amounts disbursed to the sham borrower entities ultimately landed in the bank accounts of companies controlled and managed by Goushal and his associates.The matter came to notice after Manpreet Singh Suri of RFL filed a complaint against Malvinder Mohan Singh, Shivinder Mohan Singh, Sunil Godhwani and others holding key managerial posts in the company, alleging that having an absolute control on REL and its subsidiaries, the said people had put RFL in a poor financial condition by disbursing loans to companies having no financial standings, the police said.In his complaint, Suri alleged that these companies wilfully defaulted in making repayments and caused a wrongful loss to RFL to the tune of Rs 2,397 crore.Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW) O P Mishra said following a preliminary enquiry, a case was registered in March, 2019 under section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and an investigation was initiated.In view of the sufficient incriminating evidence on record, Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh, along with three others holding key managerial positions in RFL, were arrested and chargesheeted, he added.During further investigation, the roles of other key managerial officials, including Maninder Singh and those of the entities through which public money was allegedly routed and re-routed for diversion or misappropriation, were also ascertained and arrests were made, the police said.The accused, in connivance with the promoters of the company, systematically siphoned off and diverted public money in a clandestine manner for their own benefit, they added.

27-10-2020||Noida (UP)||North India gets first Metro station dedicated to transgenders||The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) on Tuesday officially renamed one of its stations here as "Pride Station" dedicated to the transgender community, a first for Metro services in northern India.Gautam Buddh Nagar MP Mahesh Sharma, Noida MLA Pankaj Singh and NMRC Managing Director Ritu Maheshwari unveiled the new name of the station, earlier known as the Sector 50 station.Six members of the transgender community, who have been recruited by NMRC through contractors for services at the Metro station, were present at the station."These members have been provided the necessary training by NMRC before deployment," NMRC's Deputy General Manager for Corporate Communications Sandhya Sharma said.According to the NMRC, which operates the Metro between the twin cities of Noida and Greater Noida in western UP, it is a first-of-its-kind initiative introduced by a Metro network in northern India."This step has been taken by the NMRC for the inclusion and meaningful participation of the members of the transgender community. As per Census 2011, there are 4.9 lakh transgenders in India, out of whom around 35,000 are staying in NCR. These numbers may have increased manifold in the present scenario,” the operator said.The initiative was inspired by the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, passed by the Centre for the protection of the rights of the transgender people and working towards their welfare, it added.The NMRC had on June 19 announced its decision to convert the Sector 50 station into a “She – Man” station that shall have special facilities and employment for the transgenders. The operator had earlier thought of renaming the station as “Rainbow”.Earlier in 2017, the Kochi Metro Rail Limited in Kerala had taken a similar step by employing 23 transgenders, breaking a new ground in gender justice.“The station has been named 'Pride' as the NMRC feels extremely proud and privileged to have qualified members of the transgender community as part of the NMRC family. It also instils a sense of pride among the community and this step by NMRC is bound to be a ray of hope to uplift the members of this community and help in breaking stereotypes about them so that they too can live a dignified life with their head held high,” the NMRC said in a statement.The name, it said, was selected after receiving suggestions from the general public and various NGOs and other organisations that work for the community.Suggestions were called online from people on NMRC's website and maximum people suggested the name “Pride”.The “Pride” station, though dedicated to the transgenders, will be open for all passengers. It will also provide employment opportunities for the transgender community, it added.The artwork and look of the Pride station has also been done to signify the essence and spirit of the members of the transgender community.To provide the community with employment opportunities and to enable their meaningful inclusion in the society, NMRC had also come up with six vacancies—four for ticket vending operator and two for housekeeping staff—for the transgender community.“These vacancies were specifically for deployment at the 'Pride' Station. The candidates were asked to submit their applications to NMRC's contractors responsible for deploying staff at NMRC's stations,” the operator said.

We will know in 10 to 12 days whether we acted responsibly at the onset of festive season although it appears that we did,” said Paul, adding that the national task force on COVID vaccine was still working out the modalities for delivery of vaccine to priority groups as and when the vaccine is ready.Responding to comments by some states about free vaccines to all, Paul said, “We have urged states to take a national approach while decoding their priority groups for vaccination. Resources will not be a problem in terms of delivery of vaccine to priority groups.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/focus-on-5-states-super-spreading-events-as-pandemic-decline-continues-govt-161883

27-10-2020||New Delhi||Intensive irrigation in India enhances deadly 'moist heat stress', study finds||Intensive irrigation in India is increasing atmospheric moisture levels and enhancing potentially deadly extreme 'heat stress' conditions where people's bodies do not cool down easily, a new study says.The research, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, noted that heat stress occurs when the human body cannot cool itself, and can result from high environmental temperatures alone—dry heat stress—or from high temperatures with humidity—moist heat stress.It noted that India's irrigation area has doubled in recent decades, and the related increase in moist heat stress is closely linked to human mortality.According to the researchers, including Vimal Mishra from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar, the ongoing human-induced climate change is expected to intensify temperature extremes in India that could exacerbate this heat stress, affecting nearly 46 million people in South Asia—especially among those working outdoors."Both the warming climate and irrigation contribute to the increased extreme moist heat in parts of India," the scientists wrote in the study.While cooling due to water evaporating from irrigation systems might partially counteract dry heat stress, the study noted that the associated changes in humidity that could affect moist heat stress are poorly understood.In the research, Mishra and his colleagues analysed the influence of irrigation on both dry and moist heat stress using a variety of in situ and satellite observations, together with state-of-the-art numerical simulations.They found that although irrigation causes land surface cooling, it also leads to substantially higher surface humidity by reducing the height of the lowest part of the atmosphere, known as the planetary boundary layer.As a result, irrigation mitigates dry heat stress, but enhances moist heat stress, the scientists said.The researchers said recent intensification of irrigation practices in India has enhanced moist heat stress, and the associated risks to human health, across the local region and neighbouring countries of Pakistan and Afghanistan."Our findings have direct implications for the reported benefits of green roofs and green cities to mitigate heat and urban heat island effects," the scientists wrote in the study.They said the excess moisture from plants on a green roof can provide evaporative cooling and mitigate dry heat.However, the scientists cautioned that under a warming climate, green roofs and green urban areas—due to increased moisture—can increase the surface humidity and worsen the extreme heat stress conditions, likely affecting about 37-46 million people in South Asia."Our results show that intensive irrigation over the Indo-Gangetic Plain increases the extreme heat stress in Pakistan, as well as western parts of Afghanistan, which indicates that the transboundary implications of irrigation induced heat stress," the researchers wrote in the study.Similar impacts from irrigation are also expected in other regions with similar semi-arid and monsoonal climates, they said.

27-10-2020||Mumbai||Dismiss plea of Sushant Singh Rajput's sisters for quashing FIR: Rhea Chakraborty to High Court||Actress Rhea Chakraborty on Tuesday requested the Bombay High Court to dismiss a petition filed by late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's two sisters to quash the FIR lodged against them for forging and procuring fake medical prescription for their brother.Chakraborty is accused of abetting the suicide of Rajput, who was her boyfriend.The actress, who is the complainant in the case against Rajput's sisters Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh, filed an affidavit in the HC on Tuesday opposing their plea and said the allegations against them are serious.Chakraborty also said since the probe in the case aginst Rajput's sisters is at a nascent stage, time needs to be given to the investigating agency.In the affidavit filed through her advocate Satish Maneshinde, the actress said a forged and fabricated medical prescription was used to help Rajput procure medicines that are banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act."Rajput died merely five days after he obtained the said prescription, wherein he was unlawfully prescribed psychotropic substances at the behest of his sister (Priyanka) and Dr Tarun Kumar," Chakraborty said in her affidavit.It needs to be investigated whether Rajput consumed the medicines prescribed, which may have contributed to his death and/or further deteriorated his mental health, the affidavit said.The petition (of Rajput's sisters) should be dimissed, it said.The petition came up before a division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik which posted it for further hearing November 4 after both the CBI and the Mumbai Police, which had registered the FIR, sought time to file their affidavits.The Bandra police here on September 7 lodged the FIR against Rajput's sisters and Dr Tarun Kumar of the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi, who signed the medical prescription.Rajput's sisters in their petition filed on October 6 sought the case to be quashed and by way of interim relief prayed for a direction to the CBI, to whom the case was handed over by the city police, not to take any coercive steps against them.The CBI is already probing a complaint lodged by Rajputs father K K Singh accusing Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetting his sons suicide.Chakraborty in her affidavit said Rajput had a "tumultuous relation" with his family and was also suffering from mental problems for which he was undergoing medical treatment.In November 2019, Rajput was examined by three psychiatrists who all opined that he was suffering from bipolar disorder and prescribed him medications, the affidavit filed by the actress said, adding that Rajput was fine till he was having his medicines regularly."In January 2020, Rajput went to Chandigarh to meet his family. After he returned, he said he was discontinuing his medications and treatment," the affidavit claimed."In March 2020, when the country was hit by COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown was announced, Rajput appeared stable initially, but with each passing day his mental health started deteriorating," it said."The death of actors Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan also had a tremendous impact on Sushant Singh Rajput who seemed to have spiralled into depression. He (Rajput) also refused treatment and/or medication," the affidavit said.However, he (Rajput) continued consuming drugs, the affidavit claimed.Rajput (34) was found hanging at his residence in suburban Bandra on June 14 this year.

27-10-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala first state in the country to fix floor price for vegetables||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said Kerala had become the first state in the country to fix the floor price for vegetables.The floor price will be 20 per cent above the production cost of the vegetable. Even if the market price goes below the floor price, the produce will be procured at the floor price from the farmers.He said this while launching the scheme announcing the floor price for 16 varieties of vegetables, which would come into effect from November 1, often referred to Kerala Formation Day.“This is the first time in the country that the floor price is being fixed for vegetables produced in the state. This is going to provide relief as well as support for the farmers. The produce will be graded and the floor price will be fixed based on the quality. Sixteen varieties of vegetables would be covered in the first phase and there is a provision to revise the floor price on a regular basis,” said Vijayan.He said the local self-government bodies will have an important role to play in this scheme as they would be coordinating the procurement and distribution of vegetables.“Farmers can register on the agriculture department’s registration portal after insuring the crop to get the benefit of the floor price. The scheme also envisages setting up the entire supply chain process like cold storage facilities and refrigerated vehicles for transporting the produce,” added Vijayan.Kerala over the years has been solely dependent on neighbouring states for its vegetable requirements and in recent times the state’s production has doubled to 14.72 lakh metric tonnes.With this new feature, the target is to increase the production by an additional 1 lakh metric tonne each of vegetables and tuber crops this year. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-first-state-in-the-country-to-fix-floor-price-for-vegetables-161863

The real factor was that there was growth in relationships in every domain.“It has been very, very remarkable in the last 20 years, but especially in the last few years. It serves both our interests but Indo-US collaboration can be a force of good. It is truly global, comprehensive and strategic,” Jaishankar noted.Pompeo in his remarks began by assailing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which is “no friend to democracy, rule of law, transparency and a prosperous India Pacific”.Dwelling on his trip in the morning to the martyr’s memorial, he pointedly noted that he paid respects to all those who had laid their lives including “the 20 who died in the Galwan Valley” to defend the world’s largest democracy.But he corrected to observe that “all threats are not posed just by the CCP”.The two nations will also work to meet the region’s infrastructure needs.The US strongly supported the “Blue Dot” initiative that will check against mega infra projects becoming environmentally unsustainable or debts traps. The newly created US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has set up a liaison office in India.“This will set the stage for more economic work together,” he said.Shifting the focus from security issues, Pompeo said the joint Indo-US effort to fight the pandemic had sent a “strong signal that the two nations are committed to working together and expanding the partnership across all fronts”.“The US valued India as a multilateral partner ranging from Quad to settling the Afghan problem and supporting its candidature as a permanent member of the UNSC,” he said.The range of areas in which both sides are working together is “reflective” of the Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, said Jaishankar.The two Ministers said they were also committed to shaping more trusted and resilient global supply chains.“Together, we can make a real difference when it comes to regional and global challenges, whether it is in respecting territorial integrity, promoting maritime domain awareness, counterterrorism, or creating prosperity,” Pompeo said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indo-us-ties-transcend-china-threat-say-jaishankar-pompeo-161854

27-10-2020||New Delhi||Rape trial against Tarun Tejpal: SC extends deadline for completion of trial till March 31||The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended till March 31 the time for completing trial in the sexual assault case against Tehelka magazine founder Tarun Tejpal.Tejpal is alleged to have sexually assaulted a former woman colleague inside an elevator of a five-star hotel in Goa in 2013. He has denied the allegations levelled against him.He was arrested on November 30, 2013 by the crime branch after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the court. He has been out on bail since May 2014.The matter came up for hearing on Tuesday before a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, that the trial judge has made a request for extension of time.The Goa government had earlier moved the top court seeking extension of time to complete the trial.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Tejpal, said the apex court had already extended the time till December 31 this year for completion of trial and the bench may put up the matter for hearing in last week of December or in January. “If the trial is completed by December end, then this application by the trial judge would become infructuous and if it is not completed, then time can be extended,” Sibal said. “There is no question of completion of trial by December 31 as there are witnesses to be examined. It will be better if we extend it till March 31,” the bench observed.The bench said, “The problem is Mr Sibal you are not even ready for video-conferencing or it would have got completed in two months”.The apex court, while taking the application seeking extension of time on record, extended it till March 31 next year.The trial court in Mapusa town of Goa had framed charges against Tejpal under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including alleged sexual harassment. The apex court had last year dismissed Tejpal's plea seeking quashing of charges framed against him in the case.

27-10-2020||Lucknow||The poor now linked to banking system, have access to loans: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said his government had acknowledged the honesty and hard work of street vendors by offering them loans that were inaccessible to the poor in the past.Addressing beneficiaries of the PM Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) Scheme in Uttar Pradesh via video conferencing, he said: “Those doing politics in the name of the poor had created an atmosphere that if a loan is given to the poor it would not be returned.”Modi today said the poor had been linked to the banking system and loans had been given to street vendors who are repaying them in time.“Those who had themselves been involved in scams, had always put the blame of all dishonest things on the poor, but I have always been saying that the poor of the country have never compromised with honesty and self-respect,” he said.“Through the PM Svanidhi Yojna, the poor have once again presented the example of their honesty before the country. The street vendors of Uttar Pradesh are repaying loans through their hard work besides earning their livelihood. This is the will power and hard work and honesty,” he said.The Prime Minister interacted with three beneficiaries of the scheme hailing from Agra, Varanasi and Lucknow and enquired about how it has helped them. He said they have all presented an example which should be replicated by all.Modi, who explained the scheme in detail, also took the opportunity to attack those who had questioned the government’s move of linking the poor with the banking system.“The doors of the banks which have today been opened for you have not happened in a day. It is the result of the ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas’ policy,” he said.The PM said the scheme was a reply to those who were sceptical about linking the poor with the banking system.He claimed that when the jan-dhan accounts were opened, many people had questioned and laughed but now those accounts had come to the help of the poor.“The street vendors are helping in taking the poor forward, they are getting connected to banks, the mainstream of the economy. In such a global pandemic which forced big nations to bow before it, the common man of the country bravely did it,” he said.The PM SVANidhi scheme was launched on June 1 this year to help poor street vendors, impacted by economic distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in resuming livelihood activities. Around 25 lakh applications have been received of which 12 lakh have been sanctioned.Modi said almost 6.50 lakh applications had been received from UP of which 3.75 lakh were sanctioned. He lauded the banks and their employees in making an important contribution in achieving this target.

27-10-2020||Hyderabad||Hyderabad Airport rolls out e-boarding for international passengers||GMR-led Hyderabad International Airport on Tuesday announced launch of end-to-end paperless e-boarding for international flights, thus becoming the first airport in India to do so.The service is currently available for select international flights of IndiGo Airlines. The airport rolled out its e-boarding services for international flights after the government's nod based on a rigorous and successful pilot.IndiGo Airlines became the maiden carrier to commence this facility when their Sharjah-bound passengers e-boarded themselves from Hyderabad on the 6E 1405 flight on October 2.Other scheduled international carriers operating out of Hyderabad are in the process of integration with the airport's e-boarding system, which will be rolled out soon, airport operator GHIAL said.Hyderabad International Airport went live for its domestic e-boarding facility in December 2015.It claims to be the first and only airport in India to offer truly e-boarding to all its domestic passengers across all flights."We are delighted to announce that after about five years of successfully operating e-boarding for domestic flights, we have launched the e-boarding solution for international operations as well -- another first for any Indian airport."In the present scenario of the coronavirus pandemic, automating the passenger journey provides more pleasant airport experience. After the success of pilot project and all regulatory approvals, we have used our internal capabilities to take up e-boarding solution for international operations," said Pradeep Panicker, CEO, GHIAL.He said he is confident that very soon they will get all international carriers operating out of Hyderabad onto their e-boarding platform.The e-boarding solution is fully backwards-compatible, and passengers will be free to choose between using conventional paper boarding passes or electronic boarding passes on their mobile phones to use the system.International e-boarding offers various benefits like reducing queue waiting time at the airports, removing redundancies at check points, helps airlines to optimise their processes and improve their resource utilisation.The real-time data availability of all passenger checkpoints helps airports to continuously enhance operational efficiency. The e-boarding enhances overall safety and security of the airport, it said.Any passenger boarding an international flight using e-boarding service will have to book the ticket online and do a web check-in. At departures entrance gate, he has to display the digital/printed boarding card at the e-boarding scanner; CISF validates the documents and allows passenger entry. At the check-in counter, check-in agent scans the boarding card and passenger drops the luggage at the counter. The passenger then completes passport verification formalities by officials of Bureau of Immigration.At the security screening zone, he puts hand baggage on the Automatic Tray Retrieval System (ATRS) and moves for security check. He scans the boarding card on e-boarding scanner and moves on.At the announcement of boarding, he scans the boarding card on e-boarding scanner and moves towards the gates for boarding the aircraft.

27-10-2020||New Delhi||Air pollution law: Experts say enough laws in place, lack of political will main challenge||As the Centre prepares to roll out a comprehensive law to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR, environmental experts do not appear too optimistic about the prospect.Stating that there are enough laws to deal with the situation, they feel multiplicity of laws and institutions may end up creating even more confusion and friction.Besides, both the State and Centre has enough powers under existing laws and the biggest struggle is the lack of political will to implement them. Therefore, more than new legislation there has to be actual action on pollution sources while implementing existing rules and regulations, they say.While it is not clear as to what the Centre means by the new law, an Ordinance, Act or Notification, environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta says Ordinance is not the best route to take for enacting environmental legislation."As of now, the Central Government has been using its powers under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 in order to issue directions to control pollution. In case it intended to issue a Notification under the Environmental Protection Act, it needs to seek public comments which is 60 days. Both the State and Centre has enough powers under existing laws, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to take preventive and remedial measures to deal with air pollution."In case the Centre intends to enact a law regulating farming practice, it will have to ensure that it does not encroach on the domain reserved for the state - agriculture is state subject, while the environment is in the concurrent list. In case it directly impacts agricultural practices, it is likely to face both social opposition as well as legal challenges.Dutta says that between the Supreme Court, EPCA, NGT, CPCB and SPCB no one is clear as to what needs to be done. If the government is keen to resolve the issue, it must undertake a thorough review of the various laws and institutions in order to look at their efficacy and utility. Enacting laws or issuing directions without any assessment, consultation only ends up as a way to divert attention from long term comprehensive solutions to short term myopic intervention."Polash Mukerjee, Air Quality Researcher, also says lack of law is not a problem in India, whether it is about paddy stubble burning, providing subsidies or penalising the polluter."The problem lies in the fact that political will is missing when it comes to implementation. Having said that, it will be welcome if there is a specific provision to deal with crop residue burning at a national level, and not leave it contained as a problem in Punjab and Haryana only. Satellite images from central and southern India show the extent of crop residue burning in these parts as well, which have an impact on local climate resilience."According to Sunil Dahiya from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, "biggest struggle is the political will to actually implement the existing laws and notifications, which is clearly shown with the implementation level of all the regulation existing today on the environment and air pollution"."So, coming up with new legislation alone is not going to help clean the air, it has to be actual action on pollution sources while implementing the rules and regulations, which will help us clean the air, Dahiya adds||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-pollution-law-experts-say-enough-laws-in-place-lack-of-political-will-main-challenge-161835

27-10-2020||New Delhi||NGO moves SC against electoral bonds scheme ahead of Bihar assembly polls||Ahead of Bihar Assembly elections, an NGO has moved the Supreme Court seeking urgent hearing of its 2017 PIL challenging the 2018 Electoral Bonds Scheme meant for funding political parties.The NGO, ‘Association for Democratic Reforms’, had earlier also moved a similar plea seeking stay on the scheme ahead of Delhi Assembly polls in January this year.The Apex Court had refused to grant the interim stay on the scheme.The top court, however, had sought response of the Centre and the Election Commission within two weeks on the interim application filed by the NGO on January 20 and since then the PIL has not been listed for hearing.The three-phase elections in Bihar will be held from October 28 to November 7 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The counting of votes will be on November 10.“Right before the Bihar legislative assembly elections, the State Bank of India, in the XIV Phase of sale, has been authorised to issue and encash Electoral Bonds through its 29 Authorized branches with effect from October 19 to October 28, 2020,” said the fresh plea, filed through lawyer Prashant Bhushan.Seeking urgent hearing, it said even though notification of January 2, 2018, stipulated the sale of electoral bonds in months of January, April, July and October months of each year and the “window was not opened in April and July but has been opened in October (this year) right before the Bihar legislative election”.It said in view of the passing of more than nine months since the last date of hearing of the PIL and new developments relating to Bihar legislative election having taken place, the instant plea required an urgent hearing.As the reason for urgency, the NGO said that it had filed the PIL on September 4, 2017, on the issue of corruption and subversion of democracy through illicit and foreign funding of political parties and lack of transparency in the accounts of all political parties.“Certain amendments made through Finance Act, 2017, and earlier Finance Act, 2016, both passed as money bills and which have opened doors to unlimited political donations, even from foreign companies and thereby legitimizing electoral corruption at a huge scale while at the same time ensuring complete non-transparency in political funding,” it said.“The scheme has opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate donations to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy,” it said.“The Finance Act of 2017 has introduced the use of electoral bonds which is exempt from disclosure under the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951, opening doors to unchecked, unknown funding to political parties,” it said.The amendments to the law had removed the existing cap of 7.5 per cent of net profit in the last three years on campaign donations by companies and have legalised anonymous donations, it said.Earlier, the Apex Court had refused to grant interim stay on the 2018 Electoral Bonds Scheme ahead of Delhi assembly polls.The poll panel filed its reply in February and had told the top court that it had received the status of filing of electoral bonds from various political parties, including the BJP and the Congress, in a sealed cover.The EC had filed the affidavit in pursuance to the top court’s direction asking the political parties to furnish all details of funds received through electoral bonds to the poll panel in a sealed cover.The government had notified the Electoral Bond Scheme on January 2, 2018.As per provisions of the scheme, electoral bonds may be purchased by a person, who is a citizen of India or incorporated or established in India.An individual can buy electoral bonds, either singly or jointly with other individuals.Only political parties registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and which secured not less than one per cent of votes polled in the last general election to the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of the State, are eligible to receive electoral bonds.As per the notification, electoral bonds shall be encashed by an eligible political party only through a bank account with an authorised bank.

27-10-2020||United Nations||India calls for complete ceasing of support to terrorist forces in Middle East||India has called on all concerned parties to completely stop supporting terrorist forces, like the ISIL, while urging all stakeholders in the Middle East to work constructively for peace, stability and development.India underscored that it has invested considerably in the peace and stability of the region by deploying its personnel as part of UN peacekeeping forces, through humanitarian assistance, development cooperation, capacity building, and will continue contributing towards peace-building in the Middle East.“India calls on concerned parties to completely stop support to terrorist forces, like ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) and others. India also urges all parties in the region to work constructively and in good faith to promote peace, stability and development for the benefit of all people in the Middle East,” India said in a written statement on Monday on the Security Council's open debate on 'The Situation in the Middle East'.India said the truce between Israel and the Hamas has eased the humanitarian situation in Gaza and expressed hope that the temporary truce is converted into a permanent ceasefire, which can save precious human lives on both sides and create a conducive environment for talks."It is an unfortunate reality that the interlinked and mutually reinforcing challenges faced by the people of the Middle East have not yet been resolved. Political instability, long-festering conflicts, sectarian divides, issue of refugees and terrorism continue to plague the region. The COVID-pandemic has only exacerbated the threats posed by these challenges,” India said.The statement made India's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador T S Tirumurti will go as part of the official record of the Council.India said it appreciates the agreement between Fatah and Hamas for holding Parliamentary and Presidential elections and also elections for the Palestinian National Council, which will help fulfil the democratic aspirations of the Palestinian people.India also welcomed the agreements for normalisation of relations between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain. “India has always supported peace and stability in West Asia, which is our extended neighbourhood,” India said.Further, India said the commencement of discussions on the disputed border between Israel and Lebanon is a significant development, expressing hope that this will provide an opportunity to resolve the longstanding issue between the two countries.India highlighted that Palestinian aspirations for a sovereign and independent state are yet to be fulfilled and stressed that New Delhi has been unwavering in its commitment to the Palestinian cause and continues to remain supportive of a peaceful negotiated resolution of the Palestinian issue."India has supported the two-state solution as a just and acceptable solution to the conflict. Establishment of a Palestinian State living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel, within mutually agreed borders, should be achieved through negotiations directly by the two parties,” India said adding that any stalemate could strengthen the hands of extremists and shut the door to cooperation thereby jeopardising the security, stability and prosperity of the people on both sides and the region. Accordingly, India urged Israel and Palestine to resume direct negotiations at the earliest and called upon the international community to take concrete steps towards resuming and facilitating these negotiations quickly.India noted that the decade-long armed conflict in Syria has claimed over 400,000 lives, displaced 6.2 million people internally and compelled another 6.3 million people to seek shelter in neighbouring countries.“While we are heartened to see return of normalcy to major parts of the country, we are also reminded of the enormous resources that would be required to provide urgent humanitarian aid, rebuild infrastructure, enable return of the refugees and restore a normal and dignified life of all Syrians,” the statement said.India said in the statement that it is not only contributing to the return of normalcy and rebuilding of Syria, but has also consistently called for a comprehensive and peaceful resolution of the Syrian conflict through a Syrian-led dialogue, taking into account the legitimate aspirations of the people of Syria.India voiced concern over the security and humanitarian situation in Yemen and said the recent exchange of prisoners by the Government of Yemen and Ansar Allah, who had been detained in connection with the conflict, is a welcome development."India hopes that the parties will take more confidence-building measures to provide the necessary impetus for the full implementation of the Stockholm Agreement," the statement read.India also hopes for peace and stability in Iraq with full respect for Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.India noted that in the aftermath of the August blast that brought destruction to vast swathes of Beirut and inflicted heavy loss of lives, India stood in solidarity with Lebanon.New Delhi sent emergency humanitarian aid of over 58 metric tons to Beirut. “We look forward to the swift formation of a new government that can offer political stability and also tackle the grave socio-economic challenges being faced by the people of Lebanon,” the statement said.

27-10-2020||New Delhi||Loan moratorium: Lenders to credit ‘interest on interest’ to borrowers by Nov 5, Centre tells SC||The Centre has informed the Supreme Court that lenders have been directed to credit in the accounts of eligible borrowers by November 5 the difference between compound interest and simple interest collected on loans of up to Rs 2 crore during the RBI’s loan moratorium scheme.The Ministry of Finance has said that after crediting this amount, the lending institutions would claim reimbursement from the Central Government.In an affidavit filed in the Apex Court, the government has said that the Ministry has issued a scheme as per which lending institutions would credit this amount in the accounts of borrowers for the 6-month loan moratorium period which was announced following the COVID-19 pandemic situation.“Under the scheme, all lending institutions (as defined under clause 3 of the scheme) shall credit the difference between compound interest and simple interest in the respective accounts of eligible borrowers for the period between March 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020,” the affidavit said.It said: “The Central Government has directed that all lending institutions described in clause 3 thereof shall give effect to the scheme and credit the amount calculated as per the scheme in the respective accounts of borrowers by November 5, 2020.”The affidavit was filed in the top court which is hearing a batch of pleas which have raised issues, including that of ‘interest on interest’, concerning the loan moratorium period.The affidavit said the amount shall be credited by lending institutions irrespective of whether such eligible borrowers have “fully availed or partially availed or have not availed of the moratorium viz. deferment in payment of instalments as per the circulars dated March 27, 2020, and May 23, 2020, issued by RBI”.“After crediting the said amount in the respective accounts of eligible borrowers, the lending institutions would claim reimbursement from the Central government through the nodal agency of State Bank of India as stipulated under the scheme,” it said.It said the decision has been taken “after careful consideration, keeping in mind the overall economic scenario, the nature of borrowers, impact on the economy and such other factors as a policy decision earmarking the above-referred class of borrowers for grant of benefits”.On October 14, the Apex Court had observed that the Centre should implement “as soon as possible” the interest waiver on loans of up to Rs 2 crore under the RBI’s moratorium scheme and had said that the common man’s Diwali is in the government’s hands.The Centre had earlier told the court that going any further than the fiscal policy decisions already taken, such as waiver of compound interest charged on loans of up to Rs 2 crore for moratorium period, may be “detrimental” to the overall economic scenario, the national economy and banks may not take “inevitable financial constraints”.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had also filed an affidavit in the Apex Court saying that loan moratorium exceeding six months might result in “vitiating the overall credit discipline”, which will have a “debilitating impact” on the process of credit creation in the economy.These affidavits were filed following the top court’s October 5 order asking them to place on record the KV Kamath committee recommendations on debt restructuring because of the COVID-19 related stress on various sectors as well as the notifications and circulars issued so far on loan moratorium.It has also said that the Apex Court’s interim order of September 4, restraining classification of accounts into non-performing accounts in terms of the directions issued by the RBI, may kindly be vacated with immediate effect.The Kamath panel had made recommendations for 26 sectors that could be factored by lending institutions while finalising loan resolution plans and had said that banks could adopt a graded approach based on the severity of the coronavirus pandemic on a sector.Initially, the RBI on March 27 had issued the circular which allowed lending institutions to grant a moratorium on payment of instalments of term loans falling due between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, due to the pandemic.Later, the period of the moratorium was extended till August 31 this year.

This is being further investigated, it added.The CBDT said the beneficiaries had been found to have made huge investments in real estate properties in prime cities and in fixed deposits to the tune of several hundred crores of rupees.

27-10-2020||Patna||First phase of Bihar assembly elections on Wednesday; 71 seats go to polls||More than two crore voters in Bihar will decide the fate of 1,066 candidates on Wednesday across 71 assembly segments in the first phase of elections.Guidelines have been issued by the Election Commission for the safe conduct of the electoral exercise, which takes place in the midst of the raging COVID-19 pandemic.These include lowering the cap on the maximum number of voters for a polling booth from 1,600 to 1,000, staggering of polling hours and postal ballot facility for those aged above 80, or those afflicted with or suspected to be carrying the contagion.Besides, sanitisation of electronic voting machines, wearing of masks and other protective gear by polling personnel and availability of thermal scanner, hand sanitiser, soap and water will be ensured.Of the 2.14 crore voters who will exercise their franchise, 1.01 crore are women and 599 belong to the third gender, according to data provided by the Election Commission.The candidates include 952 men and 114 women, the maximum number (27) being in the fray at Gaya Town and the minimum (5) at Katoria in Banka district.Among the major political parties, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) is contesting in 35 of the 71 seats, followed by its ally BJP (29), while the opposition RJD has fielded its candidates in 42 and its coalition partner Congress is in the fray in 20 assembly segments.Lok Janshakti Party, headed by Chirag Paswan, is in the fray in 41 seats, which include all the 35 contested by the JD(U), in keeping with the call given by the young party president, who recently pulled out of the NDA in the state, to “dislodge” the Chief Minister from power.Prominent candidates include Shreyasi Singh, the Commonwealth Games gold medallist shooter who is making her debut at the age of 27 as the BJP candidate from Jamui.Chirag Paswan, who represents Jamui Lok Sabha and insists that he remains loyal to the BJP under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has assured full support of his party to the young debutant.Shreyasi Singh is pitted against Vijay Prakash Yadav of the RJD, the sitting MLA whose elder brother Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav is a former Union minister and a close aide of party supremo Lalu Prasad.Notably, the former Union minister’s 28-year-old daughter Divya Prakash is also making her debut in the adjoining Tarapur constituency as the candidate of her father’s party.Six members of the state cabinet Prem Kumar (Gaya Town), Vijay Kumar Sinha (Lakhisarai), Ram Narayan Mandal (Banka), Krishnanandan Prasad Verma (Jehanabad), Jaikumar Singh (Dinara) and Santosh Kumar Nirala (Rajpur) are in the fray in the first phase.Of the six, Verma, Singh and Nirala belong to the JD(U), while the remaining are from the BJP. The JD(U) ministers seek to win their seats contending with the LJP factor.Moreover, Verma, who has held key portfolios like education and social welfare, faces the additional challenge of wresting an RJD bastion for his party, having been asked to shift base from Ghosi where the JD(U) has fielded Rahul Kumar.Kumar’s father Jagdish Sharma, disqualified upon conviction in the fodder scam, had formerly represented the Ghosi assembly seat as well as the Jehanabad Lok Sabha constituency.The reserved Imamganj seat in Gaya district, which falls under Aurangabad Lok Sabha constituency, will see a proverbial clash of titans.Former chief minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha president Jitan Ram Manjhi, who is the NDA candidate, is the sitting MLA.His bid to retain the seat is challenged by his predecessor Uday Narayan Chaudhary who had been associated with the JD(U) till a few years ago but is now in the fray as the RJD nominee.

27-10-2020||New Delhi||India, US ink military pact, set stage for expanding collaboration||India and the US on Tuesday signed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), a military pact reserved for close Pentagon allies, and resolved to undertake joint developmental and infra projects abroad to beat back Chinese aggression in the security and economic domains.In a joint statement at the end of the third Indo-US 2 + 2, the four Ministers---Rajnath Singh, S Jaishankar, Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper --- welcomed both the BECA and the move to enhance maritime information sharing and domain awareness.Later the two visiting US Ministers called on PM Narendra Modi. They also met NSA Ajit Doval.The security side occupied centre-stage and dominated the joint statement, but the two sides also touched on a wide array of issues including greater partnerships in health, space, nuclear energy, supply chains, trade, people to people ties and energy where in a matter of years, the US has emerged as the fourth largest supplier to India.The meeting took place barely a week before the US polls and a month before India and the US will be joined by Japan and Australia for a combined show of naval strength under the Malabar series of war games.The four Ministers welcomed this Quad cooperation and resolved to impart economic content through a dialogue among the development organisations of the four countries.A new India-US Counter-Narcotics Working Group will add to the partnerships in counter-terrorism and narco trafficking. The four Ministers emphasised the need for concerted action against all terrorist networks and called on Pakistan to bring to justice the perpetrators and planners of all attacks, including Mumbai, Uri and Pathankot.The Ministers also committed to exchange of information about sanctions and designations against terrorists as well as countering radicalism and terrorist use of the internet.Though Defence Minister Rajnath Singh hoped US defence companies would manufacture in India in tune with PM Modi’s call for Atmanirbhar Bharat, there was no reciprocation from the US side. Instead the joint statement spoke of fast-tracking discussions for identification and development of joint projects.In health, India and the US are discussing an inter-Ministerial MoU to enhance cooperation as also a MoU between ICMR and US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to collaborate on infectious diseases including Covid.The joint statement devoted considerable space to the fine print of defence cooperation as well as formulations on South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific. The intention behind the Quad as well as consultations with countries on the fence such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka (the next stopovers for Pompeo) was to secure the “economic and security interests of all stakeholders having a legitimate interest in the region”.India and the US also resolved to jointly build up the deterrence capacity of regional countries. One such is in the works after the US signed a defence framework pact with the Maldives which has extremely close defence ties with India.The US said it was willing to accommodate the Indian desire to expand security ties with other US regional military commands such as the Central Command and Africa Command.Another military agreement, the Communications, Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), that preceded BECA, has led to expansion of secure communications capabilities to include secure conversations between the Foreign and Defense Ministries.The Ministers also referred to ongoing trade discussions which, however, have belied South Block’s expectations of a mini trade deal.In energy, apart from a MoU on Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPRs), the Ministers touched on a long-pending US project to set up nuclear power stations. Cyber governance and defence was another topic of discussion.In a sign that the talks had gone well, the US said it looked forward to hosting the next 2+2 Ministerial in 2021.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-ink-military-pact-set-stage-for-expanding-collaboration-161806
27-10-2020||New Delhi||Govt to bring new law to curb air pollution in Delhi-NCR||With Delhi continuing to grapple with increasing levels of pollution, the Centre has decided to soon bring in new legislation to curb air pollution in the city and NCR, a top official from the Ministry of Environment said.  “The new law will be only for Delhi and NCR. It will come out soon. I cannot comment on what penalties it will entail. It is a new law to curb pollution in Delhi NCR region only. Air Act is for the nation and it will be as it is,” Environment Secretary, R P Gupta, told PTI.The response from him came after the Supreme Court, which had raised concern over the worsening air quality in Delhi-NCR, was told by the Centre on Monday that it will bring the new legislation to curb pollution and submit a proposal before it in four days.Delhi's air quality has been in 'very poor' category and is predicted to remain so till October 31.The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration was 16 per cent on Monday. It was 19 per cent on Sunday and 9 per cent on Saturday.NASA's satellite imagery also showed a very dense cluster of fires in Punjab, Haryana and nearby regions.  In its October 16 order, the top court had ordered the deployment of National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme and Bharat Scouts and Guides for assisting in the monitoring of stubble burning in the agricultural fields of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi-NCR, saying all it wants is that “people of Delhi-NCR can breathe fresh air without any pollution”.

27-10-2020||New Delhi||Marginal improvement in Delhi’s AQI as wind speed picks up||Pollution levels reduced marginally in the national capital on Tuesday morning but the air quality was still recorded in the “very poor” category.A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department said the air quality index (AQI) was likely to improve with the wind speed picking up.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground while favourable wind speed help in their dispersion.The city recorded an AQI of 335 at 10 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 353 on Monday. It was 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday.An AQI between 0and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’,201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, the wind direction and speed were favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions.It, however, said an improvement in local wind speed will counter the effect.The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was 16 percent on Monday. It was 19 percent on Sunday and 9 percent on Saturday.NASA’s satellite imagery also showed a very dense cluster of fires in Punjab, Haryana and nearby regions.According to the Punjab Pollution Control Board, the state has recorded 14,461 incidents of stubble burning between September 21 and October 25 as compared to 9,796 during the corresponding period last year.Haryana has recorded around 4,284 incidents of stubble burning this season so far.The Central Government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi’s air quality was likely to remain “very poor” till October 31.The air quality warning system said the ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was expected to be around 11,500 metre square per second on Tuesday — favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.The Centre had on Monday told the Supreme Court that it will bring a legislation to curb air pollution in the Delhi-NCR.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most — 18 to 39 per cent — to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 per cent), followed by industries (2 to 29 per cent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 per cent) and construction (8 per cent). PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/marginal-improvement-in-delhis-aqi-as-wind-speed-picks-up-161800
27-10-2020||Washington||US senators seek removal of high tariff on import of pecans from India||A bipartisan group of five influential senators has urged the Trump administration to seek removal of high tariffs on import of pecans by India, asserting that it is impacting a large number of American farmers.The growing middle class in India has demonstrated its desire for consumer-oriented agricultural products, like tree nuts, and the Indian market represents one of the most dynamic and fastest growing in the world, the senators wrote in a letter to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer."Unfortunately, the current high tariff (36 per cent) that India charges on pecan imports makes it difficult for American producers to compete in this important market," said the letter that was written by Senators Kelly Loeffle, David Perdue, Doug Jones, John Boozman and Tom Cotton."In contrast, we understand that the current Indian tariffs on US pistachios and almonds is much lower (10 per cent), which highlights how disproportionately high the pecan tariff is," said the latter dated October 23 that was released on Monday.Lowering the tariff on pecans would provide the Indian people with more economical access to tree nut varieties, while providing a much-needed economic boost to rural America. The pecan industry contributes over USD 3.57 billion to the economies of the 15 pecan producing states in the United States, it said.Over the last 10 years, exports alone have pumped an additional USD 1.25 billion in economic activity into rural America. Reducing trade barriers into India is an opportunity to strengthen the economy of rural America, the senators wrote."As you continue discussions with Prime Minister Modi's Administration to reach a trade deal and potentially reinstate India's Generalized System of Preference Status, we would like to stress the importance of removing existing barriers to the export of US agricultural products, specifically pecans," the senators wrote."As you may know, American pecan producers have faced many challenges due to rising imports from Mexico, Chinese tariffs, natural disasters like Hurricane Michael, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaining access to new markets for pecans will help ease the pain while orchards are replanted and a trade deal is negotiated with China," they said.Loeffler, who grew up on a farm and who serves on the US Senate Agriculture Committee, also spoke with members of the Georgia Pecan Grower's Association about international trade and the multiple factors currently affecting pecan prices.Georgia is the nation's leading pecan-producing state.

27-10-2020||Jalna||Marathas want reservation under SEBC, not OBC category: BJP MP||BJP MP Sambhaji Chhatrapati has said the Maratha community in Maharashtra wants reservation under the Socially and Economically Backward Classes (SEBC) category and not under the Other Backward Classes (OBCs).Speaking at a meet on Maratha reservation in Jalna district on Monday, the Rajya Sabha member said it was the responsibility of the state government to defend the case in the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court last month stayed the implementation of the 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs but made it clear that the status of those who have availed of the benefits will not be disturbed.The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, was enacted to grant reservation to people of Maratha community in Maharashtra in jobs and admissions.“The Maratha community wants reservation under the SEBC and not the OBC category,” said the BJP leader, who is a descendant of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.He asked state minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the Maharashtra cabinet sub-committee on Maratha quota, to prepare well to defend the case during hearing in the Apex Court.He said Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had established ‘Swaraj’ which comprised all communities. Chahtrapati Shahu Maharaj carried forward his legacy and gave reservation to the OBCs, Dalits and even Marathas, he noted.“Why the Maratha community is deprived of reservation today?” he asked.After the Supreme Court’s judgement last month, the state government took several measures to give relief to the agitating Marathas, including giving the community members benefits meant for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS).The state cabinet also decided to offer jobs in the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation to the heirs of those who lost lives during the Maratha quota protests.The BJP MP also demanded that the Maharashtra government declare wet-drought in the state and seek financial assistance from the Centre.Earlier this month, heavy rains and floods claimed at least 48 lives in Pune, Aurangabad and Konkan divisions while crops on lakhs of hectares were damaged.

One of the epic fightbacks in warfare was scripted by the battalion at the battle of Rezang La. The Battalion’s ‘C-company’-- some 120 soldiers-- led by Major Shaitan Singh had held back the PLA from capturing Chushul and also the Dungti-Leh road. Major Singh was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, the highest gallantry honour of the country.Rezang La top is part of the 70 km frontage in South Pangang Tso which was occupied by Indian troops in late August as part of countermeasures to push back the PLA in the ongoing border tensions.Infantry day is observed on Oct 27 to mark the landing of Indian Army troops at Srinagar airfield in 1947. This was a day after the Maharaja of Kashmir signed the instrument of accession.What made the ceremony unique was that the Army Commanders were present at the ongoing Commanders conference in New Delhi and they joined in. Also, this was the first time that the CDS – the office was established in January this year -- was laying a wreath on infantry day. The NWM is at the India Gate in central Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/infantry-day-cds-army-chief-pay-respects-at-national-war-memorial-161787

In 28 constituencies, the Congress is directly fighting the JD-U.A significant number of seats the Congress is contesting in the first phase are also against BJP candidates with both parties eyeing upper caste votes. The RJD is fighting on 42 seats and the Congress on 21.In the 2015 state poll, the Grand Alliance (RJD-JD-U and Congress) had won 54 of these 71 seats and the NDA only 15. While the RJD had bagged 27 of the 29 seats it fought, the Congress had won nine out of 13. Both the RJD and the Congress are contesting many more seats this time.That the Congress is wooing upper castes is apparent from the fact that a majority of its candidates for the first phase are from upper caste, pitted against BJP rivals from the same caste.Tejashwi a crowd-pullerTejashwi Yadav for his part, has cast a great first impression on his adversaries. Crowds at his rallies have unsettled Nitish Kumar enough to snap at voters in public. Political observers are now watching if the mammoth crowds at Yadav’s meetings translate into votes. They agree that for Yadav to make an impact, the Congress must do well in Bihar, at least as well as it did in 2015 when it won 27 of the 41 seats fought.Covid caution goes for toss in Bihar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/high-stakes-for-rahul-tejashwi-allies-banking-on-anti-incumbency-161747

27-10-2020||---||Indian military to get access to US satellite data, agreement today||New Delhi, October 26The Indian military is set to get access to the satellite network of the United States, allowing it to target enemy positions with more precision. The key pact will be signed tomorrow to share real-time geo-spatial intelligence, information on maps and satellite images for defence.Called the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), it will allow geo-spatial mapping of the land mass. The imagery generated from it can be used to accurately operate drones and long-range missiles. The contours of the land mass have to be known accurately to achieve precision strike from huge distances.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh met with his US counterpart Mark T Esper in New Delhi on Monday for talks. An Indian statement after the meeting said: “The two ministers expressed satisfaction that agreement of BECA will be signed during the visit.” Esper is in India along with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the 2+2 ministerial dialogue slated for Tuesday. The BECA will be signed at that meeting.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had a “productive” dinner engagement with Pompeo during which they discussed maritime security, counter-terrorism, open connectivity and resilient supply chains.The BECA, meanwhile, would be the last of the three ‘foundational agreements’ defining the bilateral ties. The first pact — Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Association — was signed in August 2016, permitting the respective militaries to replenish material and fuel from each other’s bases.The Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement inked in 2018 facilitates access to advanced defence systems and enables India to optimally utilise its existing US-origin platforms. In December last, India and the US escalated their strategic ties by inking the Industrial Security Annex.In June 2016, the US recognised India as a “major defence partner”. Rajnath and Esper reviewed bilateral defence cooperation spanning military-to-military cooperation, secure communication systems and information sharing and industrial issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-military-to-get-access-to-us-satellite-data-agreement-today-161522
27-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Nitish missing from BJP posters||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 26Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally in Patna on Wednesday, three-time Chief Minister Nitish Kumar appears to have gone missing from the BJP posters there.Sources say the Chief Minister, who was recently seen losing his cool at rallies, appears to be on slippery ground in the state. Apart from Patna, the PM will also cover Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur. At Sakra in Muzaffarpur district today, a slipper was flung towards Nitish by some protesters while he was going towards his helicopter after completing his speech at an election meeting.The police took four persons in custody on the charge of creating disturbance at the rally, police sources said.The Sakra incident is one of the many protests Nitish has faced during his rallies in different parts of the state. At many places, Nitish lost his cool and chided protesters for “acting on behalf of political rivals” and telling them that nobody was bothered even if they didn’t vote for him.For Nitish, the anti-incumbency factor is all too obvious. The BJP-JD (U)-Hindustani Awami Morcha (S)- Vikassheel Insaan Party alliance was counting heavily on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said sources.To divert attention from the anti-incumbency being faced by Nitish, the BJP is trying to make these elections into a ‘Modi versus the rest’ with liberal sprinkling of the BJP-style electioneering revolving around “nationalism”, “development” and “double engine growth under the NDA” vis-a-vis the “anti-national Opposition”.“The fact that people are equally angry with the Opposition as they are with the ruling coalition, Modi’s popularity might save the day for Nitish on November 10 (day of counting),” say observers.

The order came on petitions filed by the EC and BJP candidate from Gwalior Pradyumn Singh Tomar, challenging the High Court’s order.The poll panel had contended that the conduct and management of elections were overseen by it and Article 329 of the Constitution put an express bar on judicial interference in the midst of electoral process.Bypoll to decide Shivraj govt fateAs senior advocate, Rakesh Dwivedi, submitted that the High Court’s order interfered with the electoral process and paralysed the entire exercise, the Bench said the poll panel should have been proactive.On behalf of Tomar, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi pointed out that with barely five days left for voting, there was a need to increase the voting hour by three-four hours. But the Bench chose to ignore it.In his petition, Tomar submitted that the impugned HC order violated his right to conduct election campaign through physical gatherings as permitted by the EC, the Central Government and the state authorities.A former Congress MLA, Tomar is currently Energy Minister in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government.Kamal Nath, Digvijaya ‘gaddars’: ScindiaNew Delhi: Accusing former CMs Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh of being the “biggest traitors” in Madhya Pradesh, BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia on Monday said they betrayed voters’ trust by running a “corrupt” government and he had to leave the Congress after people’s issues raised by him were not addressed despite approaching “every port of call”.
