He was arrested by the Jodhpur Police on August 31, 2013 and has been in jail since then.According to reports, Asaram's followers had come to the jail from Lucknow, distributed blankets and held a prayer meeting in which Asaram's photograph was placed.The probe was ordered after photos of the programme went viral on social media.

02-01-2021||Ghaziabad||Farmer protesting against agriculture laws kills self||A 75-year-old farmer protesting against the Centre’s new agri laws allegedly hanged himself at the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi border in Ghazipur on Saturday morning.Sardar Kashmir Singh, a native of Bilaspur in Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur district, hanged himself in a mobile toilet using a rope, police said.Deputy Superintendent of Police of Indirapuram Anshu Jain told PTI that a suicide note written in Gurumukhi was found on him.Singh wrote in the suicide note that the government must repeal these farm laws as these are against the interests of farmers, according to a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).The BKU and several other farmer unions have been spearheading the protest against the legislations at various border points of Delhi for over a month now.In the purported suicide note, Singh expressed anguish that though some people from Punjab died during the agitation, no one from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand has sacrificed his life for the cause.He also requested the Sikh community to help his family marry off his two granddaughters and to address the domestic problems being faced by his married daughter.His body was handed over to his grandchildren who too were part of the protest in Ghazipur, police officer Jain said.BKU national spokesman Rakesh Tikait expressed his profound grief at the death of Kashmir Singh.He demanded that the government provide an ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh each to the families of Kashmir Singh and another farmer who died of heart attack at the protest site on Friday.Tikait alleged that the government was testing the patience of farmers. Till now 47 farmers have sacrificed their lives during the protest in the country, he claimed, adding that their sacrifice would not go in vain.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at various borders of the national capital for more than a month demanding repeal of the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.The government has presented these laws, enacted in September, as major agriculture reforms aimed at helping farmers and increasing their income, but the protesting unions fear that the new legislations have left them at the mercy of big corporates by weakening the MSP and mandi systems.Meanwhile, BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik said in a press statement that they will gherao the Uttar Pradesh Assembly from January 10 if dues of sugarcane farmers are not paid immediately.Arrears of Rs 4,000 crore of sugarcane growers are pending, but the government is not helping them and is favouring sugar mills, Malik claimed. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-protesting-against-agriculture-laws-kills-self-192704

I do not have any relationship with any political party."    Irani's legal counsel had said last week that the case was based on "the most bizarre and mischievous set of falsehoods" and that "political patronage" was writ large on the matter.Days after she was herself was named in a police complaint, the shooter had alleged that people close to the minister issued her a fake letter, appointing her as a member the central women's commission, a possible reference to the National Commission for Women.Vartika alleged that Vijay Gupta and Rajnish Singh, the two aides of the Union Minister, initially demanded Rs 1 crore from her and then brought the amount down to Rs 25 lakh. She also alleged that one of the men talked to her in an obscene manner.On November 23, however, Gupta had lodged a complaint against the shooter and another person at Musafirkhana police station in Amethi district, accusing them of levelling unfounded charges against him and trying to spoil his image, following which police had lodged an FIR against her.Vartika though claimed that the complaint was lodged after she threatened to expose "corruption".

02-01-2021||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeks direction to Centre, states to publish draft legislations on govt websites||A PIL seeking a direction to the Centre and states to publish draft legislations prominently on government websites and in the public domain at least 60 days before they are introduced in Parliament and state assemblies has been filed in the Supreme Court.The plea filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay has also sought a direction to the Centre to ensure that all the draft and final legislation are put in the public domain in all regional languages.“In today’s democratic process, with the advent of advanced media and technology, it is no longer appropriate for Governments, both Central and State, to suddenly pass laws overnight with scarcely any legislative debate and no wider consultation at all, the plea, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, said.Protests against the farm reforms show how the message of a law is lost in the legal jargon and the consequences of lack of such a discussion prior to the bills being tabled in the legislature, it said.The petition said any draft legislation, except those related to national security, must be published on government websites at least 60 days before they are introduced in Parliament or state legislature.As far as central laws are concerned, it said, the proposed legislations should be translated into regional languages and published online at least 60 days prior to their introduction in Parliament so that citizens have a complete understanding of them.Referring to the protests against the new farm laws, the PIL stated that farmers have been misguided by politicians as the draft laws were not published for wide consultation and feedback before being introduced in Parliament.This has led to a lot of misinformation and protest among the farmers and people with vested interests are using this chaos to advance their cause, using the farmers as a front, it said.“The injury caused to the public is large because the existing law-making process is not only undemocratic but also unconstitutional. Secretaries of the respective departments draft the bill and cabinet approves it without wider public discussion and feedback. It is only after the Parliament/Assembly debate that the public is made aware of it.“Moreover, many times, the government makes new laws even when amending the existing law would suffice. It not only exhausts the public resources but also is a complete waste of legislature’s time,” it said.

02-01-2021||---||Buta Singh — Quintessential politician who sailed through turbulent years of Indian politics||New Delhi, January 2With his ear to the ground and eye on the national  politics, Congress veteran Buta Singh was the quintessential politician who sailed through the most turbulent years of Indian politics with deftness and diligence, and went on to become the virtual No. 2 in the Rajiv Gandhi government in the late 1980s.Singh, a prominent Dalit face of the grand old party and a staunch loyalist of Rajiv Gandhi, died at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here on Saturday morning after being comatose for several weeks. He was 86.In a chequered political career spanning over five decades, Singh often found himself at the centre of major controversies, but he always found a way to bounce back.Born into a humble ‘mazhbi’ Sikh family in Mustafapur in Punjab’s Jalandhar district on March 21, 1934, Singh was a member of Lok Sabha for eight terms, held several positions in varied ideological dispensations at the Centre and became the Governor of Bihar in 2004.He rose to national prominence in the 1980s as he was the lone Sikh face in the Rajiv Gandhi cabinet in the period after the Operation Bluestar and the anti-Sikh riots of 1984. He succeeded P V Narasimha Rao as the home minister in 1986 and served in that position till 1989 when the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress lost the election.Before Rajiv Gandhi, Singh was close to his mother and predecessor Indira Gandhi and held several positions in her government. He also played a role in selecting the Congress’s new poll symbol—“hand”—after the party split in 1978.But, Singh had to pay a price for his close association with the Gandhis and his positions in the successive Congress governments—he was excommunicated from the socio-religious order of the Sikhs in April 1985 for his role in the Operation Bluestar that caused damage to the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of the Sikhism.Nearly 10 years after the events at the Golden Temple, he sought atonement and returned to the Sikh fold. In March 1994, he was granted pardon.Pictures of him undergoing the punishment of dusting shoes, washing dishes and sweeping floors at the Golden Temple and other gurdwaras, with a plaque around his neck declaring him a sinner, went viral at the time.He also had his fair share of controversies—over consecration of bricks for a Ram temple in Ayodhya in 1989 and over dismissal of many state governments during his tenure as home minister.As the Union home minister in 1989, Singh had a role in the consecration of bricks inscribed with Lord Ram that were brought to Ayodhya for the temple construction even when the land was disputed.Years later, he had to quit as Bihar Governor after the Supreme Court was critical of his role in recommending the dissolution of the state Assembly in 2005. He resigned in 2006.In his initial political life, Singh was associated with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). He joined the Congress in the early 1960s. He was first elected to the Lower House of Parliament in 1962 from Punjab. Later, he represented Rajasthan’s Jalore constituency in Lok Sabha.He switched over to the BJP briefly and became the Minister for Communications in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet in March 1998.He was indicted in the JMM bribery case in 1998 and had to resign as the Union communications minister thereafter.He, however, switched back to the Congress and was made the Governor of Bihar.A prominent Dalit leader, he started as the convenor of the All India Congress Committee’s (AICC) Harijan cell in 1973-74, after which he became the AICC general secretary in 1978.Singh became the Union deputy minister, railways in 1974 and the Union deputy minister, commerce in 1976. In 1980, he became the Union minister of state, shipping and transport and was also given the portfolio of sports (independent charge) in 1982.In 1983, then prime minister Indira Gandhi elevated him as the cabinet minister for parliamentary affairs, sports and works and housing.In 1984, he was made the Union minister for agriculture and rural development and in 1986, the Union home minister in the Rajiv Gandhi cabinet.Under P V Narasimha Rao, Singh was the Union minister of civil supplies, consumer affairs and public distribution from 1995 to 1996.He was appointed the chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) by Manmohan Singh in 2007. He held that post till 2010.Singh was instrumental in building and re-building many gurdwaras in the country and abroad, especially the Akal Takht, after Operation Blue Star in 1984. He was involved in the reconstruction of many gurdwaras in Delhi after the anti-Sikh riots of November, 1984.He was also the chairperson of the Asian Games organising committee when the competition was held in India in 1982.

02-01-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh dubs country’s anti-Covid vaccine as BJP’s, draws sharp criticism||Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday termed the anti-Covid vaccine to be rolled out in the country a “vaccine of the BJP” and said he would not take the shot, prompting a sharp reaction not only from the ruling party but also from NC vice-president Omar Abdullah.While the ruling BJP accused Yadav of “insulting” doctors and scientists, Abdullah said vaccines don’t belong to any political party, but humanity.Hours later after terming the anti-Covid vaccine as a “vaccine of the BJP”, Yadav, however, said in a tweet that he had full faith in scientists but not in the “taali and thali wali” unscientific thinking of the BJP. (Click here for the latest developments on Covid-19 epidemic)“How can I trust the vaccine, which will be used for vaccination by the BJP? We cannot get vaccinated by the BJP’s vaccine,” he told reporters earlier in the day.Yadav’s remarks prompted an instant retort from BJP leader and Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya who termed his statement an “insult to the doctors and scientists of the country”.“Akhilesh Yadav does not have trust in the vaccine and people of Uttar Pradesh do not have the trust in Akhilesh Yadav. His raising questions on the vaccine is an insult to doctors and scientists of the country. He should tender an apology,” Maurya told reporters.Taking to Twitter, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister too later said, “I don’t know about anyone else but when my turn comes, I’ll happily roll up my sleeve & get a COVID vaccine.”The more people get vaccinated, the better it will be for the country and the economy, the National Conference (NC) vice president said.“No vaccine belongs to any political party, they belong to humanity & the sooner we get vulnerable people vaccinated the better,” he tweeted.During his press conference, Yadav also said his party will come to power in the state after 2022 elections and everybody will get the vaccine free.Later in a tweet in Hindi, Yadav said, “We have full faith in the efficiency of scientists but do not trust the unscientific thinking of the BJP and the medical arrangements of the BJP government administering vaccines which had been lying almost inactive during the corona times.”    “We will not take the political vaccine of the BJP. The SP government will provide free vaccines,” he asserted later too in his tweet.In reaction to his remarks, the president BJP’s Uttar Pradesh unit, Swatantra Dev Singh also took aims at the SP chief in a tweet.“The ‘BJP vaccine’ has proved effective in eliminating corruption and hooliganism. What vaccine are you talking about?” SwatantraDev Singh asked, tagging Akhilesh Yadav too with his tweet.A trial drill for distribution of COVID-19 vaccine began across the country on Saturday, officials said.The Centre had on Thursday stated that the exercises aim to test the linkages between planning and implementation, and identify challenges.

02-01-2021||Visakhapatnam||Tension in Andhra's Ramateertham over idol desecration||High tension prevailed at Ramateertham in Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh on Saturday as leaders of opposition and ruling parties resorted to protests and counter protests over desecration of an idol of Lord Ram at Sita Lakshmana Kodandarama temple.The area around the hill shrine was rocked by unrest while additional police force was rushed to prevent any untoward incident.Leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) sought permission to go up Bodikonda hillock after leaders of ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) visited the temple to see the desecrated idol.When YSRCP MP Vijay Sai Reddy and other leaders of the ruling party coming down the hill, leaders and workers of opposition parties who had gathered there raised slogans.At one stage supporters of the three parties nearly came to blows. They pushed and jostled each other and in the melee BJP's district unit president Reddy Pavani fell unconscious.Some protesters pelted stones on Vijay Sai Reddy's convoy. Police had a tough time in escorting him and other YSRCP leaders to safety.BJP leaders, who were on hunger strike at downhill, raised an objection to the visit by the ruling party leaders to the temple. They said the YSRCP leaders had no right to visit the temple as the government has failed to protect the temples.Meanwhile, police tried to stop TDP president and leader of opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu and other party leaders on their way to Ramateertham.The former chief minister, who flew into Visakhapatnam from Vijayawada, left for Ramateertham by road along former deputy chief minister Chinnarajappa and others. However, as the convoy reached Vizianagaram, police stopped them. There was heated argument between the TDP leaders and police officers.Naidu and Chinnarajappa got down from their vehicles and sat on the road to stage protest against the police's action. The police later allowed them to proceed to Ramateertham.The priests of the ancient temple on Tuesday found the doors broken. The idol in the sanctum sanctorum was desecrated and the severed head portion of the idol was later recovered from a nearby pond the next day.Police formed five teams to nab the culprits. A police officer said they detained five suspects and have been questioning them.The desecration, the latest in a series of incidents in the state, triggered public outrage. The opposition parties targeted the YSRCP government and alleged that its inaction showed its tacit support.The BJP called for 'Chalo Ramatheertham' to protest against the repeated desecration of temples.BJP secretary and state co-incharge Sunil Deodhar warned that Jagan Mohan Reddy government will have to pay huge price for such desecration activities.He stated that every attack on temples in the state is testing the patience of the Hindu community.Jagan government "is failing to arrest culprits while tacitly showing love for a particular religion", he alleged.Deodhar said the party has decided to take their protests to streets against "the attacks on temples, temple lands and on Hindutva" in Andhra Pradesh.The incidents also led to a war of words. Vijay Sai Reddy alleged on Saturday that former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and his followers was behind the Ramatheertham incident. He alleged that the TDP leaders have resorted to the act to malign YSRCP government.He pointed out that TDP leader and former minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju is still the chairman of the temple board.Cabinet minister Botcha Satyanarayana slammed the BJP for making baseless allegations against the government for political gain.---IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tension-in-andhras-ramateertham-over-idol-desecration-192668
02-01-2021||Mumbai||Cong’s opposition to rename Aurangabad won’t affect MVA: Sena||Two days after Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said his party would strongly oppose any proposal that seeks to rename Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar, the Shiv Sena on Saturday said its resistance will not affect the three-party MVA government in the state.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut expressed confidence that the issue would be resolved when all the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies -- Sena, NCP and Congress -- sit together and talk.On Thursday, Thorat had asserted that the Congress would oppose any proposal to rename Aurangabad, saying that changing the names of places was not part of the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) of the three ruling parties.It was the Shiv Sena, which had first made the demand to rename Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar over two decades ago.A proposal to that effect had been passed in the general body meeting of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in June 1995, which was challenged by a Congress corporator in the high court and later in the Supreme Court.In its party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, the Sena said, “The Congress has opposed the proposal of renaming Aurangabad to Sambhajinagar. It has made the BJP happy. But the Congress’s opposition to the proposal is not new and therefore, linking it to the MVA government is foolishness.”“Even if the name has not been changed in the government records, Shiv Sena supremo late Balasaheb Thackeray had renamed Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar when there was Congress’s chief minister in the state. The people had also accepted it,” it said.“But some people feel that the issue of renaming Aurangabad will create friction within the ruling alliance,” the Sena said in a veiled attack on the BJP.“Thorat announced that if any proposal for renaming Aurangabad comes up before the MVA government, his party would oppose it. It is his claim. After his statement, BJP leaders started demanding that the Sena should make its stand clear on the issue. But the Sena has not changed its stance on it.”“Balasaheb Thackeray had renamed Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar 30 years ago, which was accepted by the people.And it will soon be changed officially as well,” it said.The Uddhav Thackeray-led party said BJP leader Chandrakant Patil asked that if Allahabad’s name can be changed to Prayagraj, Faizabad’s to Ayodhya, why can’t Aurangabad’s name be changed to Sambhajinagar.“But we want to ask why the party did not do so when it was in power in Maharashtra,” the Sena added.“Any state requires a foundation of self-respect and even the Congress will agree that Aurangazeb was not a secular person. The Muslims in Maharashtra have stood behind the Shiv Sena. They want development and welfare,” it said.“It is an insult to the memory of Chhatrapati ShivajiMaharaj that a city in Maharashtra should bear Aurangazeb’s name, who brutally killed ChhatrapatiSambhaji Maharaj,” it said.“But what Thorat is saying is right. The Maharashtra government is duty-bound to implement the CMP of giving justice to the downtrodden and the farmers,” it added.Congress’s opposition to the renaming proposal will not affect the MVA alliance, it said.Meanwhile, Raut said, “Thirty years ago, Balasaheb Thackeray gave the name Sambhajinagar. Only paper work is left now. When all the MVA allies sit together and talk, the issue would get resolved.”The renaming of Aurangabad was not a political issue, he said.Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam said the MVA government has been formed to work and not change the names of cities.“The CMP doesn’t mention changing name of Aurangabad,” he said.

02-01-2021||New Delhi||Does India have the doses to fulfil Phase-1 Covid vaccine goals?||Given that India has set the goal of vaccinating 30 crore people with Covid-19 jabs by July, can the country procure enough doses to fulfil that goal?To vaccinate 30 crore people, the country will need 60 crore doses as the two vaccines that are leading the race to get the approval from the government require two-doses per person for protection.These two vaccines that the government is currently considering giving the approval are "Covishield" and "Covaxin" While the Pune-based Serum Institute of India has partnered with Oxford-AstraZeneca for conducting clinical trials and manufacturing "Covishield", Bharat Biotech has collaborated with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for "Covaxin".Approval for Covishield is expected soon as the Subject Expert Committee of the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation on Friday recommended its emergency use.However, it now appears that the Serum Institute of India is planning to supply the government with 30 crore doses by July, enough for vaccinating 15 crore people, according to media reports.If it works out that way, the government will be able to reach just half way of fulfilling the phase-1 goals with Covishield alone."For rolling out the vaccination campaign, cold chain equipment such as walk-in coolers, walk-in freezers, refrigerators, deep freezers are already procured and distributed to the states," Harshal R. Salve, Associate Professor at Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, told IANS."Vaccine storage capacities at airports and major railway staions are being created."You may have approval for another vaccine too in the meanwhile that can be included in the mass the vaccination drive," Salve added.It now appears that the success of India's vaccination drive may rely on the efficacy of Covaxin in protecting people against Covid-19.This is specially in view of the fact that India did not sign early procurement deals for the other two vaccines that have got approval in several countries including the US -- the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.As these two vaccines are now in great demand, they appear unprepared to supply India huge number of doses quickly even if New Delhi fast-tracks their approvals.Pfizer has already sought the emergency use authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine in India.Now experts believe that to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19, about 70 per cent of the country's population will have to be vaccinated, meaning about 90 crore people.If other vaccines that are approved in the future also require two doses per person, this will mean that India will need 180 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan earlier this month said that about 30 vaccines against Covid-19 are in different stages of development in India.How many of them get the required approval may say a lot about how quickly India achieves herd immunity against Covid-19.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/does-india-have-the-doses-to-fulfil-phase-1-covid-vaccine-goals-192661

02-01-2021||Mumbai||SEBI imposes fine on Mukesh Ambani, RIL for ‘manipulative trading’||The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has imposed a penalty of Rs 25 crore and Rs 15 crore, respectively, on Reliance Industries (RIL) and its chairman, Mukesh Ambani, for manipulative trading.The SEBI order observed that RIL had entered into a well-planned operation with its agents to corner the open interest in the RPL (Reliance Petroleum) futures and to earn undue profits from the sale of RPL shares in both cash and futures segments and to dump large number of RPL shares in the cash segment during the last 10 minutes of trading on the settlement day resulting in a fall in the settlement price.The case pertains to 2007.It also observed that Mukesh Ambani, being the chairman and managing director of RIL, was responsible for its day-to-day affairs and thereby, liable for the “manipulative trading” done by RIL.The order noted that Navi Mumbai SEZ Private Limited and Mumbai SEZ Limited have allegedly aided and abetted RIL by providing funds to one of the agents appointed by RIL, who in turn provided funds to other 11 agents for making the margin payments for the short positions in RPL November Futures. The capital market regulator imposed penalties of Rs 20 crore and Rs 10 crore on Navi Mumbai SEZ and Mumbai SEZ, respectively.As per SEBI, it was observed that a resolution was passed by the Board of Directors of on March 29, 2007, which approved the operating plan for the year 2007-08 and resource requirements of the next two years — around Rs 87,000 crore. Thereafter, RIL decided to sell approximately 5 per cent of its shareholding in RPL (up to 22.5 crore RPL shares) in November 2007.Subsequently, RIL admittedly appointed 12 agents, between October 30, 2007, to November 3, 2007, to undertake transactions in the November 2007 RPL Futures (settlement period November 1 to 29, 2007) on its behalf.The said 12 agents appointed by RIL took short positions in the F&O Segment on behalf of RIL while RIL undertook transactions in RPL shares in the cash segment.During the period of November 1 to 29, 2007, various transactions were undertaken by RIL in the cash segment and by RIL through the agents in the F&O segment. From November 15, 2007, onwards, RIL’s short position in the F&O segment constantly exceeded the proposed sale of shares in the cash segment.Further, the probe showed that on November 29, 2007, RIL sold a total of 2.25 crore shares in the cash segment during the last 10 minutes of trading resulting in fall in the prices of RPL shares, which also lowered the settlement price of RPL November Futures in the F&O Segment.RIL’s entire outstanding position of 7.97 crores in the F&O Segment was cash settled at this depressed settlement price resulting in profits on the said short positions. The said profits were transferred by the agents to RIL as per a prior agreement, said the order dated January 1.SEBI noted that an order noted dated March 24, 2017, had directed RIL to disgorge an amount of Rs 447.27 crore, along with interest calculated at the rate of 12 per cent per annum, from November 29, 2007, onwards till the date of payment.Further, RIL was prohibited from dealing in equity derivatives in the F&O segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the date of the said Order.“I find it appropriate to consider the direction in the nature of debarment and the disgorgement that has already been passed against RIL herein as a relevant factor while deciding the quantum of penalty,” it said.“I have also considered the quantum of loans advanced by Noticee-3 (Navi Mumbai SEZ) and Noticee-4 (Mumbai SEZ) to the agent appointed by RIL. Considering the above, I proceed to impose an appropriate penalty on each of the noticee that serves as a deterrent to the noticees and others indulging in such fraudulent trade practices.” IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sebi-imposes-fine-on-mukesh-ambani-ril-for-manipulative-trading-192646

They objected to his comments and created ruckus over it. They also forced the event to stop."A case was filed late on Friday night against stand- up comedian Munawar Faruqui, a resident of Junagadh in Gujarat, and four Indore-based persons based on a written complaint filed by Eklavya Singh Gaur, who also submitted a controversial video footage of the comedy show," in-charge of Tukoganj police station Kamlesh Sharma said."All the five accused were later arrested," he said.As per the complaint, indecent remarks were passed against Hindu gods and goddesses and Union Home Minister Amit Shah during the show, Sharma said.Four other arrested persons were identified as Edwin Anthony, Prakhar Vyas, Priyam Vyas and Nalin Yadav, the police said.All of them were booked under IPC sections 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), section 269 (unlawful or negligent act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and other relevant provisions.Meanwhile, talking to reporters, Gaur said, "After purchasing the tickets, my associates and I went to the comedy show, where Faruqui was performing as the main comedian. The show mocked the Hindu deities by passing indecent comments.The Godhra incident and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were also mentioned inappropriately during the show.""Such objectionable talks were going on during the comedy show.

Then we caught the comedians and organisers of the show and took them to Tukoganj police station," he said.Gaur, who is also the convener of local outfit Hind Rakshak, alleged that the instruction to maintain physical distance was also not being followed during the comedy show, and it was organised without the permission of the authorities.At least 100 spectators were sitting in a small hall of the cafe, he said.Some media reports said that the stand-up comedian was also thrashed by the workers of Hind Rakshak during the ruckus in the cafe.However, Gaur denied the charge. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/comedian-among-5-held-for-indecent-remarks-on-hindu-deities-192645

02-01-2021||Washington||Bipartisan Congressional provision condemning China’s military aggression towards India becomes law||A bipartisan Congressional provision condemning China’s aggression towards India has become a law as the US Congress overrode President Donald Trump’s veto on the $740 billion defence policy bill which among other things included calling out the Chinese government for its actions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA), 2021, which became a law on Friday after Congress overrode Trump’s veto, included a resolution urging the Chinese government to end its military aggression towards India along the LAC.President Trump, on December 23, vetoed the NDAA, which had bipartisan support, arguing it had provisions that would damage national security.As Congress dealt a humiliating blow to Trump in his last days in office, Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said: “Through today’s New Year’s Day vote in the Senate, Congress has made the National Defence Authorisation Act into law, including elements of my resolution calling on China to end its military aggression towards India and others in the broader Indo-Pacific region.”The US House of Representatives and the Senate on December 15 passed the $740 billion NDAA, which included key components of Krishnamoorthi’s resolution language urging the Chinese government to end its military aggression against India along the LAC.China and India have been locked in a military standoff along the LAC in eastern Ladakh since May this year. Several rounds of talks between the two countries to resolve the standoff have not yielded any concrete outcome.Krishnamoorthi said: “The Chinese military’s violent aggression along the Line of Actual Control with India and elsewhere is unacceptable, and the passage into law of this legislation sends a clear message of support and solidarity to India and our other partners across the world as we enter the New Year.”The inclusion of this provision, which Krishnamoorthi led as an amendment when the bill passed the House of Representatives, reflects the American government’s strong support for its allies and partners like India in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.Expressing “significant concern” over the continued military aggression by China along the border with India, the NDAA says that China “should work with” India toward de-escalating the situation along the LAC through existing diplomatic mechanisms and refrain from attempting to settle disputes through coercion or force.Attempts by China to advance baseless territorial claims, including those in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and with respect to Bhutan, are destabilising and inconsistent with international law, says the bill.China is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.

They warned of multiple actions if their main demands were not met.Narendra S Tomar, Agriculture MinisterNo soothsayer... expect positive resultI am not an astrologer, but am hopeful of a positive outcome at the next meeting. There’s a possibility of positive results in the interest of the country and farmers.Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav said the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway tractor march, planned on December 31 but deferred due to the December 30 talks, would now be held on January 6 if the next round of talks failed to end the deadlock. Farmers protesting at Shahjahanpur on the Haryana-Rajasthan border would move towards Delhi, he said.“From January 6 to 20, we will organise ‘Jagriti Abhiyan’ across the country by holding rallies to create awareness on farmers’ issues. We will observe January 23, the birth anniversary of Subhas Chandra Bose, as ‘Chetna Diwas’,” said Yadav.Vikas, a farm leader, said after January 4, they would announce dates for shutting all malls and petrol pumps in Haryana. Gurnam Singh Charuni, BKU leader from Haryana, said, “The government is not yet ready to give anything in writing on MSP. At the last meeting, it wanted to set up a panel on the issue, which we rejected. The Centre claims the MSP will continue but if facts are checked, only 6 per cent of the crops are being purchased at MSP. Over Rs 3 lakh crore that should have come into farmers’ pockets is being denied to them by not buying crops at MSP,” he said.Union leader Darshan Pal said the boycott of the products of certain corporates would continue and that they were also planning to launch a nationwide campaign against MPs and MLAs.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar, meanwhile, struck a note of hope saying he expected a “positive outcome”. Steering clear of a definitive answer as to whether a final resolution would be reached at the next meeting, he said he was no soothsayer. “I cannot say for sure right now as to what will happen. I am not a soothsayer… I am hopeful whatever decision is taken, will be in the larger interests of the country and the farmers,” said Tomar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/firm-steps-if-january-4-talks-fail-warn-unions-192361

Most shelter homes, incidentally, are usually found near the main bus stand. When this correspondent visited the raen basera during a bitingly cold evening recently, he found the shelter locked. When he contacted the mobile number put up at the gate, a staff member at the other end said he was on leave for the last 2-3 days but another staffer had been deployed at the home. He also wrongly claimed that the shelter was shut during morning hours but remained open in the evening.Arun Sihag, a social activist in the city, alleged that there were no arrangements for the homeless. He said he found people sleeping in the red square market area every day. A farmer from Kitlana village, Naresh, claimed that he could not locate the raen basera and had to take shelter at the railway station.

The earlier peak was Rs 1.14 lakh crore in April 2019.The final figures surprised analysts and government officials, who were expecting the figure to marginally exceed collections of about Rs 1.05 lakh crore each in the previous two months.The break-up shows that almost Rs 6,000 crore additional GST in December as compared to November has come from imports. During the month, revenue from the import of goods was 27 per cent higher and the revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) are eight per cent higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year.The government attributed the new peak in the GST revenue to a combined effect of the rapid economic recovery post pandemic and a concerted drive against evaders and fake bills. Several systemic changes introduced recently also led to improved compliance, said an official news release.Analysts, on the other hand, attributed the rise to pent-up demand and the Diwali festive season. The RBI and analysts have sought support after the festive season as they fear that February and March will be difficult.The government sought to underline the significance of the collections in December by pointing out that the previous high was in the month of April, when revenues normally tend to be high, since they reflect the returns of March, which marks the end of the financial year.Of the gross GST revenue collected in December, the CGST is Rs 21,365 crore (Rs 19,189 crore in November), SGST is Rs 27,804 crore (Rs 25,540 crore last month) and the IGST is Rs 57,426 crore (Rs 51,992 crore in November), including Rs 27,050 crore collected on import of goods (Rs. 22,078 crore). The cess is Rs 8,579 crore (Rs 8,242 crore), including Rs 971 crore (Rs 809 crore) collected on import of goods.Till now, the GST revenues have crossed Rs 1.1 lakh crore three times. This is the third month in a row in the current financial year after the economy has started showing signs of recovery post pandemic that the GST revenues have been more than Rs 1 lakh crore. The average growth in GST revenues during the last quarter has been 7.3 per cent as compared to (-) 8.2 per cent during the second quarter and (-) 41.0 per cent during the first quarter of the financial year.What the govt saysThe government has attributed the new peak in the GST revenue to a combined effect of the rapid economic recovery post pandemic and a concerted drive against evaders and fake billsPent-up demand led to rise: AnalystsAnalysts, on the other hand, attributed the rise to pent-up demand and the Diwali festive season.

They signal the government’s new approach to housing, an approach that asks why the poor cannot have sustainable and high-quality houses.”Asking ministries to create fit “start-up like” structures rather than unwieldy sluggish ones, the PM said the Light House Projects would give India a scope to innovate and incubate with new technology.He urged students, planners and architects to visit project sites and grasp new technologies for future alterations to suit domestic needs.The projects will use a range of modern housing technologies from France, US, Finland, Germany, New Zealand and Canada to build earthquake-resistant units and save construction time.“Thousands of houses will be built in 12 months at every location,” the PM noted, announcing a certificate course for construction sector workers to upgrade their skills related to new housing technology.Adding that housing for the poor and middle classes was government’s priority, PM Modi said 60,000 real estate projects had been registered under the Real Estate Regulation Act, which was inspiring among people the “previously lost confidence that they could own a house by making due investments”.“In the past, people had no faith in legal support should they face a crisis with housing investments, but that has changed now,” the PM said, listing government’s measures to restore people’s confidence in owning a house, including interest subsidies on home loans.The PM also announced plans for affordable rental housing complexes in cities to give dignity to migrant workers whose worth, he said, had been well acknowledged during the Covid times.Shares new year poemThe PM greeted the nation on New Year on Friday and shared a poem:, “Aasman mein sar uthakar, ghane badlon ko cheer kar, roshni ka sankalp lein, abhi to suraj uga hai...,” “Let’s start our first day of the new year with a mesmerising and motivating poem written by our PM Modi,” MyGovIndia said in a tweet.

According to Section 3 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, divorcing a Muslim woman using instant triple talaq by her husband is illegal and it attracts imprisonment up to three years under Section 4 of the Act.Husband’s kin can’t be bookedThe top court also said the husband’s relatives could not be booked under the Act as the offence could only be committed by a Muslim man.“On a preliminary analysis, it is clear that the appellant as the mother-in-law of the second respondent cannot be accused of the offence of pronouncement of triple talaq under the Act as the offence can only be committed by a Muslim man,” the Bench said, granting anticipatory bail to an accused from Kerala who was relative of the husband facing charges under the new law.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-bar-on-granting-anticipatory-bail-under-triple-talaq-law-says-supreme-court-192389
