The flight landed safely in Ahmedabad. It is not clear what was the reason for this snag,” the source said.Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said on September 15 that GoAir had 46 A320neo aircraft and the modified PW engines were installed on 30 of those.Earlier in the year, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had asked both IndiGo and GoAir to replace the unmodified PW engines by May 30.It had said the unmodified PW engines contained an “unsafe condition, which is prone to undesirable outcomes” and therefore, need to be dispensed with.In June, the DGCA extended the deadline due to the coronavirus pandemic and asked the airlines to replace all unmodified PW engines on their planes by August-end.When contacted, a GoAir spokesperson told PTI, “We would not be able to comment, pending investigation.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modified-pw-engine-on-goairs-hyderabad-ahmedabad-flight-on-sep-19-developed-midair-snag-155231

They also send ‘follow requests’ to random people on social media as a means of advertisement and promotion. They have also been posting comments on the posts of public figures inviting people to subscribe to their illegal services,” the petitioners submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-govt-on-pil-against-graphic-content-on-social-media-155227

To appear for JEE Advanced, it is mandatory to clear JEE Main.Currently, a candidate is allowed only two attempts at IIT entrance exam, however, those in their final year or second attempt who could not take the exam this year will be given a relaxation. The demand for extending the number of attempts has been raised by students and academicians several times.“It has been decided to allow all the candidates, who had successfully registered to appear for JEE Advanced 2020 but were absent in the exam, to appear for JEE-Advanced next year, as a one-time measure.“To ensure equal opportunities to all, it has also been decided that these candidates will not have to qualify JEE Main again and will be allowed to directly appear on the basis of their successful registration to appear in JEE Advanced this year,” said IIT Delhi Director V Ramgopal Rao.Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi was responsible for conducting JEE Advanced this year.“This relaxation of the existing eligibility criteria will be in addition to proportionate relaxation of age bar. These candidates would be considered in addition to and not as part of the total number of candidates who would qualify from JEE Main in 2021 for appearing in JEE Advanced,” Rao said.Of the 2.5 lakh students who were eligible to appear for JEE Advanced, only 1.5 lakh had taken the exam. Over 43,000 candidates, including 6,707 girls, have cleared the exam.JEE Main for admission to engineering colleges was conducted from September 1 to 6 and JEE Advanced on September 27 amid strict precautions in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.Staggered entry and exit of candidates, use of sanitisers at gates, distribution of masks and social distancing as candidates queued up, were followed at examinations centres across the country.

13-10-2020||Lucknow||Hathras woman's late-night cremation violation of human rights: HC||The Allahabad High Court has observed that the late-night cremation of the Hathras woman who died after alleged gang-raped was a violation of human rights for which the responsibility should be fixed.The Lucknow bench of the high court also directed the state government to lay down modalities for cremation in Hathras-like situations.Considering the sensitivity of the issue, the court directed Uttar Pradesh officials, political parties and all others to avoid making any statement in public on it.A division bench of Justice Pankaj Mithal and Justice Rajan Roy also expected the electronic and print media to observe restraint while reporting and discussing the matter.The order was issued Tuesday, a day after it was reserved when the bench heard the victim's family and government officials.It said the cremation in the middle of the night without following rituals violated the victim's human rights as well as those of her family and relatives.The 19-year-old Dalit woman died at a Delhi hospital a fortnight after her alleged rape by four men from her village in Hathras district on September 14.She was cremated in the middle of the night in her village. Family members claimed that the cremation, which took place well past midnight, was without their consent and they were not allowed to bring home the body one last time.The hurried cremation fuelled outrage over the incident and the high court took suo motu cognizance of it.

He was responding to a question related to the 44 new bridges India has built near the LAC with China in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh, which were inaugurated recently.“First I want to make it clear that China does not recognise the Ladakh Union Territory illegally set up by the Indian side and Arunachal Pradesh. We stand against the development of infrastructure facilities aimed at military contention along the border areas,” Lijian told the media.“Based on consensus, neither should take actions along the border that might escalate the situation that is to avoid undermining the efforts by the two sides to ease the situation,” he added.Blaming the Indian side for ramping up infrastructure development along the border and stepping up military deployment “for the tensions between the two sides”, he urged India to “earnestly implement our consensus and refrain from actions that might escalate the situation and take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquility along the border”.Pompeo had said on Friday, “The Indians are seeing 60,000 Chinese soldiers on their northern border”, adding that each of the three major Indo-Pacific democracies—India, Australia and Japan—are under threat from the Chinese Communist Party.Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a face-off in eastern Ladakh since May. In June, 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese troops were killed in a bloody clash in the Galwan Valley. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-pompeo-reveals-60k-pla-troops-along-lac-china-calls-ladakhs-ut-status-illegal-155223

It is also a candid confession that the earlier so-called Rs 20 lakh crore package was a massive failure,” former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said.He said the numbers claimed this time too are a hoax.The stimulus is not of a value of Rs 73,000 crore nor is it of the value of Rs 1,00,000 crore, Chidambaram said adding that the fiscal impact of these announcements is estimated by analysts to be 0.1 per cent of GDP.Questioning the FM’s phrase ‘demand infusion’, Chidambaram said, “I wonder if such a phrase exists.”He said the government is parenting people by telling them what to buy and what not.He said the Rs 10,000 crore interest-free festival advance to government servants is not additional expenditure as it will be recovered in 10 monthly installments.“The Rs 12,000 crore offered to the states is not a grant but a loan. The offer of a tax concession to 35 lakh Central government employees on LTC is a pathetic attempt to induce them to spend twice that amount out of their own money to gain a small benefit on tax,” he said lamenting that the most deserving people who need the money—the poor and the marginalised—have once again been left in the cold.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chidambarams-dig-at-sitharaman-dug-a-mountain-found-a-mouse-155220

Governors letter to the Chief Minister invokes the connotation as if written to the leader of a political party," Pawar tweeted, after releasing the letter to Modi."In the very Preamble of our Constitution the word Secular is added that equates and shields all religions and hence the Chair of the Chief Minister must uphold such tenets of the Constitution," the NCP chief added.Pawar said he has conveyed his views to Modi regarding the letter by Koshyari."I am sure he too would have noticed the intemperate language that has been used and also the kind of language used in the letter which does not behove well for a person who holds a constitutional position," Pawar said.

13-10-2020||New Delhi||Media attempting to influence outcome of cases: AG tells SC||Amid allegations of unethical conduct on the part of some media outlets, Attorney General KK Venugopal on Tuesday raised serious questions over the manner in which journalists report on matters of public importance, particularly cases pending before courts.“Today, print and electronic media are freely commenting on pending cases, seeking to influence the judges and public perception... This is causing great damage. It amounts to contempt of court,” Attorney General KK Venugopal told a three-judge Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar that is hearing an 11-year-old case of criminal contempt against activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan.Noting that the issue of sub-judice needed to be considered, he said the legal propositions required a fresh look.Venugopal also expressed concern over ‘media trial’, saying, “Today, when I watch TV, I see comments about the bail application based on statements made to police…In a case like Rafale, on the day when the Bench is taking up the case, there is an article commenting about the case…This issue needs to be addressed”.Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, who represented Bhushan pointed out that the issue of sub-judice was already covered by the Supreme Court’s 2012 verdict in SEBI-Sahara case.Quoting Lord Reid, Dhavan wondered: “When Shylock’s case is on, can we tell the Press not to talk about it?”Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Tejpal, said the issues have to be examined in the light of the changed scenario.The Bench posted the matter for hearing in the first week of November after Dhavan said the 10 questions of law submitted by Bhushan and the three framed by the court were required to be refined and reformulated.The top court had on August 10 decided to go ahead with criminal contempt proceedings against Bhushan as it refused to accept his ‘regret’ in connection with his 2009 statement allegedly scandalising the judiciary.In an interview to Tehelka magazine Bhushan had alleged that half of the 16 former CJIs were “corrupt”. The top court is now considering the question of conflict between right to free speech and suo motu contempt powers of court.In another criminal contempt case, Bhushan was fined Re 1 in August.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/media%C2%A0attempting-to-influence-outcome-of-cases-ag-tells-sc-155210
13-10-2020||---||India, US to advance strategic ties||New Delhi, October 13Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla met US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun on Tuesday for bilateral consultations over a diverse range of issues, said the Ministry of External Affairs.“They highlighted convergences and shared interests between India and the US. Both sides reiterated their commitment to Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership. They discussed ways to strengthen cooperation in the UN,” it added.China was not mentioned, but on Monday Biegun while participating in the opening session of the 4th India-US Forum with Shringla, called it “an elephant in the room”. Three days earlier, US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien referred to the situation on the LAC and said “the time has come to accept that dialogue and agreements will not persuade or compel China to change”.Building on Secretary Pompeo’s October 6 meeting with Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar and ahead of the US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue later this year, Biegun’s engagements will also “focus on how the US and India can work together to advance peace, prosperity, and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe,” said a US State Department statement.In a display of cooperation, India has welcomed the US plans to pursue a defence relationship with the Maldives. So far, India has occupied the major space in Maldives’ security calculus. Its welcome of US intentions indicates its willingness to cede some of that space to the US to keep China at bay. Biegun will on Wednesday travel to Dhaka. Shringla had visited Dhaka in August for a 90-minute conversation with PM Sheikh Hasina to sort out festering issues against the backdrop of China promising $ 25 billion in investments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-to-advance-strategic-ties-155206
13-10-2020||New Delhi||392 festival special trains from Oct 20-Nov 30; fares 10-30 pc higher than mail/express trains||The Railways on Tuesday announced that it will operate 392 festival special trains between October 20 and November 30 in view of the upcoming festive season.It also said the fares of these trains will be similar to those applicable for special trains, which means 'special charges' will be levied making the tickets costlier by 10-30 per cent as compared to the fares of mail/express trains, depending on the class of travel.The decision was taken as the national transporter is anticipating a passenger rush during the upcoming festive season, the Railway ministry said in a statement.The special trains will be run for destinations such as Kolkata, Patna, Varanasi, Lucknow among others to cater to the growing demand during the ensuing holiday period of Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali and Chhatt puja, it said.Till now, the railways has pressed into service 666 mail/express special trains which are now running regularly across the country. Additionally some suburban services are also being operated in Mumbai as well as certain services of the Kolkata Metro.These new festival special trains, however, will operate only till November 30 and will not have a continued run, officials said.In an order issued on Tuesday, the Railway Board said these festival special trains will be operated at a speed of 55 kmph.The Railways has suspended all its regular services due to the coronavirus pandemic since March and is operating trains as per demand and necessity.From May 12, Railways started running limited special trains to help stranded people across the country to reach their homes in different states.It started with 15 pairs of premium Rajdhani special trains connecting Delhi with different parts of the country, followed by 100 pairs of long-distance trains on June 1. It also started 80 trains additionally on September 12.Earlier this month, Railway Board Chairman and CEO, VK Yadav had said Railways will take stock of passenger services on a daily basis depending on the needs of the state governments and the status of the pandemic."We have conducted meetings with the general managers of zones and instructed them to speak with local administration and review the status of coronavirus. They have been asked to give us a report after which we will decide how many trains can be introduced during the holiday season," Yadav had said.While the Railway Board has approved the festival special trains, it will be up to the zones to finalise their details and schedule.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/392-festival-special-trains-from-oct-20-nov-30-fares-10-30-pc-higher-than-mail-express-trains-155205

The Finance Minister, who was echoing the thoughts of Chief Minister K Chandershekhar Rao (KCR) said the Centre was over-stretching itself and had for the first time taken a unilateral decision without taking the states into confidence. “We demand that the Centre release Rs 723 crore as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission. This is the one time compensation recommended for the losses incurred by Telangana on account of reduction of the state’s share in the central devolution taxes from 2.43 per cent to 2.13 per cent”. Rao said the unilateral decision of the Centre would hurt the financial interests of states like Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka. “We demand a discussion on consolidation of borrowings suggested under option 1 and option 2 proposed by the Centre, which have a difference of Rs 73,000 crore,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-unhappy-over-centre-forcing-states-to-borrow-to-make-up-for-gst-shortfall-155202
13-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi records worst air quality in 8 months||The national capital’s air quality hit an eight-month low and was recorded just a notch shy of the “very poor” category on Tuesday, largely due to calm winds and low temperature that allowed accumulation of pollutants.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, an increase was also observed in farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions of Pakistan, but its impact on the capital’s air quality was marginal.The city’s air quality index (AQI) hit “very poor” levels in the morning and stood at 306 at 11 am. Thereafter, the pollution levels dipped slightly due to an improvement in the ventilation index.The 24-hour average AQI was recorded at 300 at 4 pm, which falls in the “poor” category. The last time the air quality hit such a poor level was on February 12 when the AQI was 320.It was 261 on Monday, 216 on Sunday and 221 on Saturday.Dwarka Sector-8 (AQI 390) Wazirpur (AQI 372), and Mundka (AQI 352) recorded the highest pollution levels on Tuesday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.V K Soni, a senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department, said the dip in the air quality can be attributed to low wind speed which allowed accumulation of pollutants.“The ventilation index has improved slightly and no drastic change is expected in the AQI,” he said.Ventilation index is the speed at which pollutants can get dispersed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR dropped from 300 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 9 am—the highest this season so far—to 293 by 5 pm µg/m3.PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 128 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of fires near Amritsar and Firozpur in Punjab and Patiala, Ambala and Kaithal in Haryana.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, SAFAR, said, “The development of strong surface-level inversion and sudden local, calm surface wind conditions led to a low ventilation coefficient and accumulation of pollutants near the surface.”  Around 675 farm fires were observed on Monday around Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring border regions, but the wind direction is not favourable for transport of pollutants. Hence, only marginal contribution in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration is expected, it said.On Tuesday, the minimum temperature was 19.8 degrees Celsius. During daytime, the maximum wind speed was 12 kmph and the direction was southeasterly, according to the IMD.Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the Covid-19 pandemic.Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 per cent—to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).This year, the Delhi government has launched a massive anti-air pollution campaign—“Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh’—which is being led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Environment Minister Gopal Rai.A “green war room” with a 10-member expert team has been set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor the steps being taken to deal with high levels of air pollution in winters.The environment department has also taken stern action against project proponents at large construction and demolition sites flouting dust control norms.The government also started the spraying of “Pusa bio-decomposer” solution in non-basmati rice fields in the national capital, on Tuesday.The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning. Starting October 15, stricter measures to fight air pollution will also come into force in Delhi and its neighbourhood as part of the Graded Response Action Plan, which was first implemented in Delhi-NCR in 2017. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-records-worst-air-quality-in-8-months-155201

13-10-2020||New Delhi||Record buying of paddy on MSP, wheat to be similarly procured: Hardeep Puri||Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday accused “some people” of “spreading lies, fake propaganda and inciting farmers” against the government by calling the new agriculture laws anti-farmer “despite knowing benefits of these laws for farmers to increase their income”.Interacting with scientists, professors and senior persons related to agriculture from Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Puri, while elaborating on the steps taken by the government, said there has been an increase in paddy procurement at MSP in Punjab.“In the ongoing kharif season, Punjab registered unprecedented increase of procurement from 7.4 LMT last year to 26.1 LMT this year as on October 11, more than 251 per cent increase from the Kharif procurement compared to last year.“The number of farmers who have benefited from paddy procurement at MSP has increased by 72 per cent between 2017-18 to 2019-20,” he said. Asserting that wheat will also be procured in similar manner, Puri said: “The MSP is going to stay. The current paddy crop is being bought on MSP basis. There has been record buying by government agencies this season. Similarly, wheat will be procured in the season and no farmer will face any issue.”Puri said legislations “will also create new opportunities for arhityas who can provide better seeds, inputs, knowledge, supply chain assistance apart from their existing roles in mandis. Investments will drive change across the supply chain benefiting all stakeholders to reduce the agriculture wastage which is currently at 30 per cent.”The number of procurement centers for Kharif season this year increased from 30,549 (2019-20) to 39,130, nearly 30 per cent hike, he said. “The number of procurement centers (rabi and kharif seasons combined) gone up from 48,550 in 2016-17 to 64,515 in 2019-20, increase of nearly 33 per cent over just four years,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/record%C2%A0buying-of-paddy-on-msp-wheat-to-be-similarly-procured-hardeep-puri-155190

13-10-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 graph has plateaued but severe 2nd peak possible in winter, unless people mask up: Govt||The government on Tuesday said India’s COVID-19 graph had plateaued but warned against a more severe second wave in winters than the first one if people became lax and disregarded COVID appropriate behaviour.India’s recoveries have surged to 86.78 per cent of total COVID cases and active cases remain below nine lakh for the fifth day, besides daily and cumulative positivity rate falling in spite of high testing in signs of disease stabilisation.Cumulative positivity rate is now 8.07 per cent while daily positivity rate is even lower at 5.16 per cent.Positivity has been reducing even when India is testing around 11 lakh samples daily.Active cases have declined on a week on week basis from 92,380 in the week between September 9 to 13 to 70,114 in the latest week ending October 13.“There are consistent trends of decline in active cases, positivity rate and rise in recoveries,” Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.Member Health NITI Aayog VK Paul, however, warned against laxity and said the 1918 pandemic had caused greater havoc in winters.“Respiratory viruses tend to become more virulent in winters and the US and Europe are already witnessing a second peak and many nations are again ordering lockdowns. A second COVID peak is plausible in winters and can be more severe unless people wear masks, keep six feet distance and maintain face and hand hygiene. Masks alone can reduce transmission between 36 to 50 per cent and masks have to be worn properly with nose and mouth covered. People must avoid festive gatherings which can prove to be super spreader events,” Paul said seeking people to launch an unprecedented community campaign against COVID-19.The government has already launched its COVID behaviour campaign with a target to reach 90 crore people between now and next March through the festive season.“An unprecedented campaign is needed for this unprecedented challenge of COVID in winters and in festivals. We have to avoid a second peak,” Paul said noting that youngsters had become overconfident and were spreading the virus thinking they are fit and fine.Mortality data for COVID however shows 35 per cent of all deaths in people aged 45 to 60 years proving that the younger population is not immune to the virus.Overall case fatality rate in India is 1.53 per cent but the same is a whopping 17.9 per cent in people with do morbidities.More than half of all deaths have happened in 60 plus people and 10 per cent in 26 to 44 year olds.Mortality proportion in those below 17 years and 18 to 25 years is one per cent.India today saw 55,342 fresh infections in 24 hours, the lowest daily cases in two months since August 18.Total cases are 71.75 lakh and total recoveries are 62,27,295. Daily new recoveries have been 77,760.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-graph-has-plateaued-but-severe-2nd-peak-possible-in-winter-unless-people-mask-up-govt-155183

13-10-2020||Bhopal||MP CM Chouhan says ‘Bhooke-Nange’ slur shows Cong ‘culture’||Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday lashed out at the Congress over the jibe “Bhooke-Nange Ghar Ka”, and said it exposes the opposition party’s “culture” and its attitude to the poor.At an election rally on Sunday, Congress farmers’ cell leader Dinesh Gurjar had called Chouhan “Bhooke-Nange Ghar Ka” (somebody from a very poor household) while comparing him to “big industrialist” Kamal Nath.Speaking to reporters, Chouhan said the Congress once questioned the credentials of a “chaiwala” or tea-seller (referring to a term used by a Congress leader to mock Narendra Modi), but it led to a discussion on the issue in the entire country, and now they were calling Chouhan ‘Bhooke- Nange Ghar Ka’.“Look I am not hurt by it, but it has hurt the poor and when the poor get hurt, then automatically I get hurt...They have started it, we will end it,” the chief minister added.Earlier, addressing party workers here ahead of November 3 Assembly by-elections, Chouhan said Gurjar’s remark “reflects their attitude, their culture and expression of their inner thoughts about the poor”.“They are also mocking me for launching development works by saying that Shivraj always carries a coconut in his pocket and whenever he gets the opportunity, he takes it out and breaks it to launch some work.“They don’t have a problem with coconut, they have a problem with development. We have ensured development even during the coronavirus period and never cried about shortage of funds,” he said.“When we work for the development of the state, they say he always carries a coconut with him. What else should I carry? Coconut is a part of our culture,” Chouhan added.Chouhan alongwith state BJP president Vinshu Dutt Sharma also flagged-off high-tech ‘raths’ (chariots or vans) for the campaign.Asked by reporters about senior BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia’s photo missing from the posters on the chariots, Chouhan said Scindia is a “respectable leader of the party”.“He is an inseparable member of the BJP team and we are formulating strategies and working together,” the chief minister said.On the Congress questioning Scindia’s properties, Chouhan said, “When Madhavrao Scindia (Jyotiraditya’s father) was in Congress they took advantage of his popularity. Then they did not point fingers.“He (Jyotiraditya) was a good person as long as he was with you. But when he ensured the fall of your government because of your bad deeds, then he became the worst person for you all,” Chouhan said.Jyotiraditya Scindia’s exit from the Congress alongwith several MLAs led to the fall of the Congress government in the state in March. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-cm-chouhan-says-bhooke-nange-slur-shows-cong-culture-155178

13-10-2020||Kolkata||Turban episode a blatant human rights violation: Dhankhar||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who has been at loggerheads with Mamata Banerjee- headed TMC government in the state, Tuesday termed the alleged pulling off of a turban of a Sikh during scuffle between the police and BJP protestors as a "blatant human rights violation".He asked the administration for 'rectification' rather than justifying the action.Dhankhar, who often posts his views on Twitter, took to the microblogging site yet again on Tuesday and said Mamata Banerjee government must take note of the widespread "outrage" over the "ill treatment," of the Sikh man."Time ?@MamataOfficial? to relook #BalvindraSingh implication ?@WBPolice? & engage in rectification rather than justification. Already Balvindra poster boy for blatant Human Right violations in WB. Must appreciate Extensive Outrage at the ill treatment #BalvindraSingh," Dhankhar tweeted tagging a video of himself speaking on the same issue.The governor had earlier slammed the state police for the "disgraceful" act during a BJP Yuva Morcha march to the secretariat on October 8.Balvindra Singh was arrested after a licensed loaded firearm was found in his possession during a scuffle with the police at the BJP Yuva Morcha rally in Howrah on October 8.His turban had fallen to the ground during the scuffle and the video of it went viral triggering protests by the community.Dhankhar said that Akal Takht, the highest Sikh body, had protested against the treatment meted out to Singh, who is said to be a former armed force personnel and is currently body guard of a BJP leader. He said it (message from the Sikh body) "must be impactful @MamataOfficial." Listing the cases and sections of IPC slapped on Singh under the Disaster Management and Arms Act, the governor said, "Implication @WBPolice #balwindersingh in offences that provide even Life Imprisonment as punishment is shocking and unconscionable. High time @MamataOfficial to take sane stance and send human right and rule of law friendly signal by withdrawing such allegations."In a video message attached to the tweet the governor said, "Home department and police should not justify wrong things. They should go for rectification. They should now apply the much needed balm. What happened is wrong." In this context he referred to Rabindranath Tagore's renouncing of knighthood after Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 which took place thousands of miles away in Punjab.Dhankhar had told a Sikh delegation from Delhi on Sunday that he was "deeply hurt" by the episode."In no civilised society such blatant abuse of police power @WBPolice in disregard of Supreme Court directives ....can be countenanced or condoned," he had tweeted citing an apex court order.Reacting to it, state Education Minister and TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee had alleged that Dhankhar was "maligning" the post of the governor with his remarks and shirking responsibilities as the constitutional head of the state.He said Sikhs and members of other communities have been living in harmony in West Bengal for ages "and no conspiracy will be able to create rift between them."

We have to work together to find a solution to the issue… All agencies and governments need to take it seriously now,” he told reporters in Hiranki village in Narela where the spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer solution started on Tuesday.The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and, therefore, can prevent stubble burning.Kejriwal said that if the Delhi government can make efforts to prevent stubble burning, so can other state governments.“When the process was in its initial phase, I made attempts to contact the Central government and if they wanted, they could have worked with us to address the issue,” he said.“We got to know about the technology developed by the Pusa Institute in September, and so did they. We have to work together with sincerity,” he said.The Pusa bio-decompose' is being sprayed free of cost in around 800 hectares of land in Delhi where non-basmati rice is grown.The chief minister said he was worried about farm fires in neighbouring states."The smoke has started affecting Delhi's air quality…Air pollution was under control for the last 10 months, but it has started increasing again,” he said.Imagine the impact of stubble burning on the families of farmers who have no option but to burn the crop residue. Farmers don't burn it willfully, he said.“While the farmers of neighbouring states and the people of Delhi are bearing the brunt of stubble burning, governments have shut their eyes. I hope that they take concrete steps so that the entire north India gets rid of high levels of air pollution,” he said.The national capital's air quality hit the “very poor” category on Tuesday morning, the first time since February, with calm winds and low temperatures allowing accumulation of pollutants.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, an increase in farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions of Pakistan is also going to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 303 at 8:30 am, which falls in the “very poor” category.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.NASA's satellite imagery showed a large cluster of fires near Amritsar and Firozpur in Punjab and Patiala, Ambala and Kaithal in Haryana.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, farm fires contributed 3 percent particulate matter to Delhi's PM2.5 concentration on Monday.

13-10-2020||Chandigarh||'Dust could reduce the effect of nuclear bombs', says Delhi scientist's research||Dust, which is present omnisciently, could become one of the ways to reduce the effect of nuclear weapons. This has been propounded in a research paper by a woman scientist from the Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi.In her study, Dr Meera Chadha has shown for the first time—through mathematical modelling—that the deadly effects of nuclear weapons can be partially mitigated or reduced with the help of dust particles.The study, published in the Proceedings of Royal Society A, London, illustrates the reduction in the energy released and the damage radius from an intense explosion (nuclear explosion in particular) by the introduction of dust particles.It has shown how the blast waves from the explosion decayed in the process.Dr Chadha, along with another scientist, J Jena studied the impact created by the introduction of up to five per cent dust particles in enhancing the decay of blast waves produced by a nuclear explosion.The enhancements in decay caused by varying the quantity of dust were studied. The blast energy and damage radius are found to decrease with time with an increase in the dust parameters.A statement issued by the Ministry fo Science and Technology on Tuesday said that returned to the science mainstream after a hiatus of one year due to domestic reasons.The Women Scientist Scheme fellowship of the Department of Science and Technology provides opportunities to women scientists and technologists who had a break in their career but desire to return to the mainstream.Such a break is common among Indian women who prioritise family over their career due to various circumstances, which are usually typical to the gender.The Women Scientist Scheme (WOS-A) fellowship of the Department of Science & Technology (DST) provides opportunities to women scientists and technologists who had a break in their career but desired to return to the mainstream.She utilised the break in her career to studying explosions and the possible effects of dust particles on them.WOS-A gave her the flexibility of time and resources in terms of equipment and funds to carry out her research.“During my Ph.D., I studied about shock waves and how dust particles contribute to reducing their strength. I came across a book, Science towards Spirituality, in which former President, Late Dr Abdul Kalam, was asked whether science could create a ‘cool bomb’ that can defuse or deactivate the deadly atom bomb. This got me thinking,” said Dr Chadha in a statement issued by the ministry while explaining the trigger behind her research.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dust-could-reduce-the-effect-of-nuclear-bombs-says-delhi-scientists-research-155156
13-10-2020||Dubai||49 stranded Indian workers repatriated from UAE: Report||A total of 49 Indians, who were stranded for several months in the UAE after being abandoned by their employers, have been repatriated after the Indian mission here helped them secure their passports and security deposits from two companies, a media report said on Tuesday.The expats were abandoned and unpaid for the last six months after two Dubai-based carpentry firms owned by Indians shut during the coronavirus pandemic without informing their staff, the Gulf News reported.Left to fend for themselves, the expats reached out to the Indian Consulate in Dubai in July and sought help to return home.“The workers had been in dire straits after the companies were shut and the Indian employer went unreachable. They had not been paid for about six months and they reached out to the consulate for help to return home,” Neeraj Agrawal, Consul for Press, Information and Culture, was quoted as saying in the report.He said the mission had provided food supplies to the workers since July.“However, the workers' passports were still under the custody of the companies. Though the owner was not reachable, the consulate somehow contacted the PROs of the firms and the workers' passports and security deposits (3,000 dirhams each) were taken with the support of Dubai Police and Al Adheed Centre of Dubai Courts which provides services related to labour disputes,” he said.Following the intervention by the Consulate, the expats were able to return home safe.“Consulate is #HappyToAssist more than 45 Indian labourers who were abandoned by their employers. CGI provided them with rations for more than 3 months & helped to retrieve their passports from their employer. The labourers returned in batches to India with the support of the Consulate,” the mission said in a tweet.Agrawal said the final group left for Lucknow on October 10.

13-10-2020||New Delhi||NGT notice to Centre on plea for quashing notification on groundwater extraction||The National Green Tribunal on Tuesday issued notice to the Centre and the CPCB on a plea seeking quashing of a notification on groundwater extraction on the grounds that its commercial use was adversely affecting the flow of rivers and availability of drinking water in the country.A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) was repeatedly issuing notification liberalising ground water extraction in water scarcity areas in spite of the need for stringent action, contrary to the very purpose for which it was setup.There was no effective mechanism to check violation by recovery of adequate compensation which was laid down by this tribunal based on expert studies, it said.“We find that the impugned order is statutorily appealable under Section 16 (g) of the NGT Act, 2010. Thus, instead of an application, proper remedy of the appellant is an appeal. We direct conversion of the application to Appeal.“The Registry may accordingly register the matter as Appeal. We are of the view that there are arguable points which are raised in the appeal which will require reconsideration. The appeal is admitted. Issue notice to the Ministry of Jal Shakti,” said the Bench.The tribunal also issued notice to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), and said water was a scarce resource on which life was dependent and its extraction has to be duly regulated.In areas where there is water scarcity, extraction can be allowed on stringent conditions of ensuring recharge, it said.“The appellant may serve notices with complete set of papers and file an affidavit of service within one week. The response may be filed within six weeks,” said the Bench.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by environmentalist Devi Das Khatri challenging the notification issued by CGWA which issued guidelines to regulate and control the ground water extraction in the country under Section 3 (3) read with Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.The plea said that extraction in scarce water areas for commercial purposes was against the principle of 'Sustainable Development'.The applicant has pointed out that without any study of carrying capacity, the policy allows concession to micro and small enterprises drawing ground water less than 10 cubic metre per day as well as for bulk water supply. There is no uniform policy for monitoring ground water recharge mechanism and to check the depleting ground water levels in the country, said the petitioner.Extraction for commercial purposes was adversely affecting not only the river flow but also availability of water for drinking purposes, the plea said, adding that no effective regulatory mechanism had been set up.According to the applicant, the impugned notification, instead of complying with the directions of the tribunal, is in reverse direction and destructive of concept of 'Sustainable Development'.

13-10-2020||New Delhi||India continues to be among countries with lowest per million Covid cases, deaths||With focussed strategies and calibrated measures, India has sustained its global position of being the country with one of the lowest COVID-19 cases per million and reported deaths per million, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday.From the last five weeks, there has been a continuous decline in the average daily new cases.  "The weekly average of daily new cases fell from 92,830 cases in the 2nd week of September to 70,114 cases in the 2nd week of October," the ministry said.India is reporting a consistent slide in the new confirmed cases with 55,342 fresh infections being  registered in a span of 24 hours in the country.  The new low in daily cases is the result of collaborative action by states and UTs under the Centre's strategy of comprehensive and aggressive testing, prompt tracking and surveillance, hospitalization and adherence to the Standard Treatment Protocol which has ensured a standardised quality of medical care across the public and private hospitals and for home isolation, the ministry said.  While the global figure for COVID-19 cases per million is 4,794, India is clocking 5,199 infections.  The UK (8,893), Russia (8,992), South Africa (11,675), USA (23,072) and Brazil (23,911) are reporting higher numbers of cases per million, the ministry said.The deaths/million in India are 79, while the world average is 138."As far tests for detection of COVID-19 are concerned, India is one of the topmost countries," the ministry highlighted."With 10,73,014 tests being conducted on Monday, the cumulative number of tests done so far stand at 8.89 crore (8,89,45,107).Higher numbers of testing on a sustained basis have aided the early identification and timely treatment which leads to higher recoveries and lower fatality rate, the ministry underlined.  "It would be unfair to compare India with high income countries such as USA, UK, Russia, France etc. as they are not on an equal footing. This is primarily because of its population dynamics which results in a lopsided distribution of resources.  "On parameters such as on the availability of doctors and nurses per million, as also the percentage of GDP spent on health, India's comparison with the other high income countries would present a skewed analysis. Given the larger context, India's targeted strategies in COVID-19 management and the public health response over the last several months have resulted in encouraging outcomes," the ministry said.  India continues to report a trend of steadily decreasing active cases, the ministry underscored. Presently the active cases comprise merely 11.69 per cent of the total COVID-19 caseload of the country standing at 8,38,729.  The active cases have been below the 9 lakh mark for the fifth consecutive day, the ministry said.The ministry said that 76 per cent of new cases are from 10 states and UTs. Karnataka has overtaken Maharashtra with the highest number of new reported cases. Both still are contributing more than 7,000 new cases. The States which are reporting spurt in cases are Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh.  Also, 77,760 new recoveries were added in a span of 24 hours, according to data updated at 8 am.  With this, the total number of recoveries has surged to 62,27,295.  "Higher number of single-day recoveries is also reflected in the continuous increase in the national recovery rate, which is at present 86.78 per cent," the ministry said.Besides, 78 per cent of the new recovered cases are in 10 States and UTs.Maharashtra contributes more than 15,000 to the single-day recovery followed by Karnataka with more than 12,000 recoveries. The number of fatalities due to COVID-19 has been lower than 1000 mark for the successive days. A total 706 case fatalities have been reported in a span of 24 hours. Of these, nearly 79 per cent are concentrated in ten states and UTs, the ministry said.More than 23 per cent of new fatalities reported are from Maharashtra (165 deaths).Maharashtra contributes more than 15,000 to the single-day recovery followed by Karnataka with more than 12,000 recoveries.   India's total COVID-19 caseload mounted to 71,75,880, with 55,342 infections being reported in a day, while death toll climbed to 1,09,856 as the virus claimed 706 lives in a span of 24 hours, the data updated at 8 am showed.

13-10-2020||New Delhi||Certain media reporting in pending cases forbidden, may amount to contempt, AG tells SC||Certain kind of media reportage in pending matters was critically referred to before the Supreme Court by Attorney General KK Venugopal on Tuesday who said it was "totally forbidden" and may amount to contempt of court.The top law officer was appearing before a Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar to assist it in the hearing of the 2009 contempt case against activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan and journalist Tarun Tejpal.Venugopal was granted time to reformulate certain issues for its consideration in the contempt case in which the apex court in November 2009 had issued notices to Bhushan and Tejpal for allegedly casting aspersions on some sitting and former top court judges in an interview to news magazine 'Tehelka'. Tejpal was the editor of the magazine.Venugopal, during the brief hearing via video conferencing, referred to the comments of "electronic and print media" in pending court cases and said that they were "totally forbidden"."Today electronic media and print media are commenting on cases which are pending and it is seeking to influence the court," he said.Today, in big cases when bail applications are about to come up for hearing, TV reports are shown which are very "damaging for the accused who has filed the bail application", he said.He also referred to the media reporting in the Rafale case and said that such comments about pending cases should not be made."These things are totally forbidden and may amount to contempt of court," Venugopal said, adding that he would like to discuss it with senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, counsel for Bhushan, and all other lawyers appearing in the matter.The Bench, which also comprised Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, took note of the submissions of Venugopal and said that he could consider reformulating the points which were required to be dealt by the Bench and listed the case for further hearing on November 4."In the meantime, the Registrar judicial to get in touch with Harish Salve" to discuss the case and request him to appear before it on the next date of hearing, read the order.Dhavan, at the outset, said that perhaps some questions were needed to be reformulated in the case.Venugopal agreed to the views and said that perhaps a fresh look at the proposition given by Dhavan was needed.Earlier, the top court had accepted the plea of Bhushan to seek assistance of the Attorney General in the contempt case against him and Tejpal.Prior to this, a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra (since retired) had decided on August 25 to refer the matter to another Bench to deal with certain larger questions related to freedom of speech and levelling of corruption charges against the judiciary.Dhavan had told the court that 10 questions of constitutional importance had been raised by them and they needed to be dealt with by a Constitution Bench.The court had then not agreed to Dhavan's submissions that it should seek assistance of the Attorney General in dealing with the issues raised and said that “it is best left to the appropriate Bench" which will be set up by the Chief Justice of India.Dhavan had said that questions raised by Bhushan included the issue whether bona fide opinions of corruption also constitute contempt of court and whether it is enough to show bona fide of opinion or it is necessary for the person to prove the allegation of corruption.They also included whether a complainant is barred from discussing in public domain the contents of his complaint if an in-house inquiry is started, among others, he had said.On August 17, the top court had framed certain questions and asked the parties to address it on three issues – whether such statements about corruption against judges or judiciary can be made, in what circumstances they can be made and what is the procedure to be adopted with respect to sitting and retired judges.Bhushan had also filed 10 questions on his own and sought adjudication by a Constitution Bench."Whether the expression of a bona fide opinion about the extent of corruption in any section of the judiciary would amount to contempt of court," Bhushan's plea had said."If the answer to the question is in the affirmative, whether the person who expresses such an opinion about the extent of corruption in a section of judiciary is obliged to prove that his opinion is correct or whether it is enough to show that he bona fide held that opinion," read the second question.He had also given eight other questions related to freedom of speech and expression and the width and scope of contempt powers.In response to the 2009 contempt case, Bhushan had earlier told the apex court that making corruption charges against judges would not amount to contempt of court and mere utterance of corruption charge could not be contempt of court.

They also extorted Rs 3,000 from the girl by blackmailing her," the SSP said.District Magistrate A Vamsi Tuesday said orders have issued to rusticate all of them from the college. “The district administration is mulling to invoke the stringent National Security Act. At the time of the incident, an examination was underway at the Government Polytechnic and despite this, the accused indulged in the act. Hence, a strong message should go to society," he said.Under the NSA, an individual can be taken into preventive detention without a charge for up to 12 months if the authorities are satisfied that the person is a threat to national security or law and order.A Special Investigation Team has been formed at the local level to help the policemen from Sipri Bazar police station, under whose jurisdiction the crime spot falls, to probe the case, SSP Dinesh Kumar P said.A joint team of the Circle officer (city) and city magistrate are probing the matter.He said the girl was being offered to counsel so that she or her parents don't face any mental pressure.

13-10-2020||New Delhi||Fake call centre offering jobs busted in Noida; 3 held||Three people have been arrested for allegedly running a fake call centre in Noida and duping hundreds of job seekers by promising them jobs in an airline, police said on Tuesday.Those who have been arrested are the gangs' mastermind Shadab Malik, 26, and his accomplices Priyanka Goswami, 22, and Kumud Ranjan Kamlesh, 40.The accused targeted those who lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the police said.Malik and Goswami posed as husband and wife and lived at a rented apartment in Noida from where they ran the fake call centre, police said. The woman would introduce herself as an officer working with the HR department of Air India, they said.The matter came to light after a victim, Anwesha Datta Gupta, filed a complaint against a job fraud at the Palam police station here. Gupta told police that he was duped of Rs 71,875 by the accused persons on the pretext of a job opportunity with an airline.So far, police have received at least 10 complaints against the accused.To trace the suspects, police said they used technical surveillance and collected the bank account and call detail records of the accused. During an investigation, it was found that all the bank accounts and mobile numbers used in the commission of the offence were opened on forged identities.  Using cyber-surveillance and sourced based information, the police held Malik, who was earlier arrested by Uttarakhand Police for a similar offence, a senior officer said.Later, raids were conducted at all possible hideouts of other suspects, following which his associate Kumud Rajan Kamlesh was apprehended from East Delhi's Mayur Vihar and on his instance, Goswami was nabbed too, the officer said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southwest) Devender Arya said that during the investigation, it was found that Malik and his associates made an employer account on a job ad portal and obtained job seekers' details, including their email addresses, name and phone numbers.  The woman used to convince job seekers on phone to transfer the money, while her accomplice Kamlesh created fake documents, got multiple accounts registered in his name and also obtained SIM cards of many telecom service providers, he said.The accused contacted job seekers through email and telephonic calls and introduced themselves as HR, interviewer and verification officers.The accused would ask victims to deposit Rs 1,875 initially for arranging an online interview and job offer letter. After that, they asked the victim to transfer Rs 18,500 as security amount, Rs 15,700 for uniform and a verification fee of Rs 35,000, the DCP said.Twelve forged bank accounts of the accused persons have been identified so far. Out of these, details of seven banks accounts have been obtained and approximately Rs 60 lakh cheated amount has been credited in these accounts, police said.The police said Rs 47,000 has been frozen in their accounts and further details are being obtained from different banks.The police have recovered a laptop, 10 mobile phones, including SIM-cards, two Wi-Fi routers, 14 debit cards of different banks and two cheque books of fake bank accounts.

13-10-2020||Gonda (UP)||Three minor sisters injured in alleged acid attack in UP's Gonda; accused arrested||Three minor sisters suffered burn injuries in an alleged acid attack by a man when they were sleeping on the terrace of their house in Paksa village, police said on Tuesday.A senior police officer said the eldest sibling, who is 17 years old, has told them that the accused, identified as Ashish, had been stalking her.The accused was arrested after an encounter with police personnel later in the evening.The three victims, who belong to a Dalit family, were undergoing treatment at the district hospital and were stated to be out of danger.The eldest one, whose engagement was fixed for October 23 and who appeared to be the prime target of the Monday night attack, has suffered eye injuries.Condemning the incident, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, BSP supremo Mayawati and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav again targeted the Yogi Adityanath government over the law and order situation in the state. The BJP government is already facing a lot of flak over the Hathras gangrape-murder case.The father of girls has, in his complaint, alleged an acid attack on his daughters, aged seventeen, seven and five years, when they were sleeping on the terrace of their house."Prima facie the probe has revealed that Ashish had been trying to approach the eldest girl. The girl has said that Ashish was bothering her for some days and had pressured her to talk to him. We have got some other proofs to substantiate the girl's statement," Superintendent of Police (SP) Shailesh Kumar Pandey said."The accused has been arrested in an encounter," the SP later told PTI.Asked whether it was an acid attack, the SP said, "The chemical used in the attack is yet to be identified. It will be clear after an examination by experts." Chief Medical Officer Indubala said that all the three girls are "out of danger"."One of them has suffered injuries to her eyes. Our team is giving them the best treatment," she said.District Magistrate Nitin Bansal said that the eldest girl will be given Rs 5 lakh under a government scheme and the family will be provided assistance as per the norms.Attacking the Yogi Adityanath government after the incident, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleged that the state government's "politically motivated" narrative of "protecting" and justifying perpetrators of crimes against women has emboldened them.She tagged a video in which the father of the girls is narrating the incident to media persons.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav termed the incident as "unfortunate" and claimed that the law and order in the state has collapsed during the BJP regime.He also sent a delegation of local leaders from Gonda to the village of the affected girls, and on his direction, financial assistance of Rs 1 lakh was given to the family of the victims, SP leaders said.BSP supremo Mayawati tweeted, "After an attempt to kill a priest in Gonda, the incident of throwing of acid on three Dalit sisters is extremely sad and shameful." "Such a worsening of law and order in UP is a matter of great concern. After all, why is every type of crime going up in UP," she said in her tweet in Hindi.The Yogi Adityanath government is facing severe criticism for its handling of the Hathras case, particularly after the local police cremated the woman's body at night allegedly without the family's approval.However, officials said the cremation was done "as per the wishes of the family".The probe into the case has been taken over by the CBI. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/three-minor-sisters-injured-in-alleged-acid-attack-in-ups-gonda-accused-arrested-155135
13-10-2020||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray, Guv BS Koshyari exchange letters on meaning of secularism||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has informed Governor BS Koshyari that a decision on reopening places of religious worship will be taken after careful consideration of the COVID-19 situation in the state.Responding to a letter by Koshyari a day earlier, Thackeray on Tuesday wrote to the Governor, saying the state government will consider his request to reopen these places.In his letter, Koshyari had mentioned that he has received three representations from delegations demanding that places of religious worship be reopened.In response, Thackeray pointed out that it was a coincidence that all the three letters Koshyari mentioned were from BJP office-bearers and supporters.An RSS veteran, Koshyari has been BJP's vice-president and first president of that party's unit in Uttarakhand, where he also served as Chief Minister.In the letter to the Chief Minister, Koshyari had asked, "Have you suddenly turned secular?"Responding to this question, Thackeray wondered if to Koshyari Hindutva meant merely reopening places of religious worship and if not opening them was to him being secular."Isn't secularism a key component of the Constitution, by which you swore while taking oath as the state Governor," Thackeray said."While considering the sentiments and beliefs of the people, it is also important to take care of their lives and it is wrong to impose and lift lockdown suddenly," he said in the letter.

You could have given the ticket to someone else. As I said this, I was pushed by someone from behind. Can I not even put forth my point of view? These people want to destroy the Congress and end it," Yadav had said.

13-10-2020||Mumbai||Farm reforms will help turn farmers into entrepreneurs: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said his government's 'historic' farm reforms would create opportunities to take farmers to entrepreneurship and added that his regime is focused on increasing their income.Modi was speaking after releasing the autobiography of former Union minister Balasaheb Vikhe Patil and renaming the Pravara Rural Education Society in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra after the Padma Bhushan recipient, via video-conferencing.Terming the farm reforms as historic, the Prime Minister said, "Today opportunities are being created to take farming and farmers from the role of annadata (food provider) to entrepreneurship."Referring to high milk, sugar, and wheat production in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana and Punjab, Modi said such models of local enterprise would take the country forward.He said there was a time after Independence when the country did not have sufficient food stock."The government’s priority then was to increase food production. So the entire focus was on increasing production. Farmers toiled hard to achieve the objective," Modi said."But governments and policies did not pay attention towards profitability of farmers while being concerned about increasing productivity."People forgot about income for farmers. But for the first time, this thinking has been changed," he said and listed steps the Centre has taken for the welfare of farmers.Noting that the COVID-19 threat still persisted, Modi called for observing social distancing norms and maintaining effective personal hygiene.

This paddy was sold for up to Rs 3,500 in the Congress government," Priyanka Gandhi said. "Farmers are being exploited in the name of moisture. This is probably for the first time that paddy is selling cheaper than wheat," she said in a tweet in Hindi.In such a scenario, even the input costs of the farmers will not be met, Priyanka Gandhi said. How will the farmer sow his next crop, she asked. There is a "loot" happening in electricity bills as well and the farmer will keep getting entangled in the web of debt, she said."The UP government must immediately intervene and ensure proper prices for farmers' (produce) otherwise the Congress government will launch an agitation," she said.The Congress, many other opposition parties and several farmers organisations have also been protesting against the farm legislations passed by Parliament recently, claiming that these will harm the interests of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government.The Centre has asserted that these new laws will be beneficial for farmers and will increase their income. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ensure-proper-prices-for-farmers-paddy-crop-otherwise-cong-will-agitate-priyanka-to-up-govt-155118
13-10-2020||Chandigarh||Ladakh witnesses heavy deployment of tanks; Army modifies transporters for better high-altitude performance||Amid the ongoing stand-off with China, Ladhak has been witnessing a heavy deployment of tanks and armoured vehicles.The Army is modifying tank transporters to improve its performance at high altitude. The Army is procuring high altitude kits to improve the engine performance of the Tatra 8x8 tractor manufactured by BHEL, that hauls the tank transporter trailer."While the kits would be procured commercially, these would be retrofitted by local field workshops of the Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers," said sources."The Army has already been employing high altitude performance-enhancing kits on various types of vehicles. Since the numbers have now increased, additional numbers are required to maintain operational efficiency," said an officer.In the summers, a substantial number of armoured vehicles, including T-90 tanks and BMP mechanized infantry combat vehicles are airlifted to eastern Ladakh to beef-up capability against the Chinese. This also requires additional support elements to be brought in.In May, the Army had initiated a process for acquiring 36 new 8x8 tractors, that could haul loads up to 70 tonnes.Also, a move is underway to procure light tanks in 20-25 tonnes category—similar to those being used by China—that could be deployed in high altitude areas.These would be roughly half the weight of the 45-tonne T-90.The Army had three regiments of T-72 in Ladakh which were deployed earlier over a period of time.As the stand-off erupted, additional mechanized units from the western and central sectors were rushed up. Though the terrain in Ladakh is highly rugged, there are a few flatter areas like Depsang, Chushul and Demchok where armoured elements can be deployed.China too has deployed mechanised forces in the area.While some light vehicles are operating at heights of around 20,000 feet, tank transporters in the region are generally employed at altitudes up to 15,000 feet.Steep inclines, low temperatures and rarified air at that height affect engine performance.“In such environmental conditions problems such as loss of power and poor thermal efficiency in all types of vehicles crop up. Given the huge mass and large dimensions of a tractor-trailer and the limited manoeuvring area available, high engine performance becomes imperative,” an engineer said. Fuel combustion and consumption is another issue with conventional engines.In fact, last year a paper on ‘Impact of High-Altitude on Truck’s Climbing Speed: A case study in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Area in China,’ in the Journal of Advanced Transportation, a Canada-based peer-reviewed international publication said that within the altitude range of 10,000—16,000 feet, the altitude had an obvious influence on the truck’s decelerating and accelerating performance.The truck’s speed decreased faster on steep grades and increased slower on gentle grades with the increase of the altitude.Pointing out, that the stable speed that the truck could maintain on a certain grade was lower at a higher altitude, the paper added that compared with the theoretical crawl speed, a negative effect of altitude change was found on the truck’s climbing performance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ladakh-witnesses-heavy-deployment-of-tanks-army-modifies-transporters-for-better-high-altitude-performance-155117
13-10-2020||Aditi Tandon||Growing evidence of Covid co-infection with dengue, malaria: Centre asks hospitals to be ready; issues guidelines||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 13The government on Tuesday said Covid could co-exist with a range of seasonal diseases and asked hospitals to be geared to treat a potential high burden of severe dengue/malaria cases along with Covid.Issuing guidelines for the community and physicians on how to deal with Covid co-infections, the Health Ministry said that given the seasonal pattern of epidemic-prone diseases observed every year in the country, diseases like dengue, malaria, seasonal influenza, leptospirosis, chikungunya, and enteric fever cannot only present a diagnostic dilemma but may co-exist in Covid cases.“This poses challenges in clinical and laboratory diagnosis of Covid, and have a bearing on clinical management and patient outcomes,” the ministry said issuing the guidance document that seeks to provide guidelines on prevention and treatment of co-infections of Covid with diseases like dengue, malaria, seasonal influenza (H1N1), leptospirosis, chikungunya.The government said malaria and dengue could co-exist with other infections, and thus confirmation of malaria and dengue infection does not rule out the possibility of the patient not suffering from Covid and a high index of suspicion of malaria and dengue must be there when a fever case is diagnosed as Covid, particularly during the rainy and post-rainy season in areas endemic for these diseases.Both Covid and seasonal influenza can also present as influenza-like illness and so all such cases in areas reporting Covid cases must be evaluated and tested for both Covid and seasonal influenza, if both viruses are circulating in population under consideration.The ministry says chikungunya leads to acute onset of moderate to high grade continuous fever and malaise followed by rash, myalgia and arthralgia. Respiratory failure may ensue in late stages. Co-infection with Covid may be suspected in chikungunya endemic areas, in the months of monsoon.Leptospirosis apart from presenting as febrile illness also has the tendency to manifest as acute respiratory illness, leading to respiratory distress and shock. In areas where leptospirosis is known to cause outbreaks during monsoon and post monsoon, the possibility of co- infection should be considered, say the guidelines.They add that scrub typhus prevalent in foothills of Himalayas in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Manipur, Nagaland, Meghalaya has in recent past also been seen in Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.“The clinical picture consists of sudden high-grade fever, severe headache, apathy, myalgia and generalised lymphadenopathy. A maculopapular rash may appear first on the trunk and then on the extremities and blenches within a few days. The patients may develop complications that include interstitial pneumonia. Scrub typhus infection may co-exist with Covid, so can bacterial infection,” the ministry said recommending diagnostic and treatment techniques and asking all secondary- and tertiary-level hospitals to be prepared to manage severe dengue and Covid cases.The government said a concerted effort is required in prevention, surveillance, behaviour change communication and management of co-infections.Alert vigil, a high index of suspicion and constant awareness of the possibility of co-infections can help physicians avert the adverse outcome of cases with co-infection, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/growing-evidence-of-covid-co-infection-with-dengue-malaria-centre-asks-hospitals-to-be-ready-issues-guidelines-155116

13-10-2020||Aditi Tandon||Frame guidelines on disposal of cigarette, bidi butts in three months: NGT to Centre||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, Oct 13Focusing attention for the first time on potential environmental and health risks from the leftovers of smoking tobacco products, the National Green Tribunal has directed the Centre to frame guidelines for the disposal of cigarette and bidi butts within three months.The Tribunal passed the orders recently disposing of an application filed in September 2015 urging regulations for the disposal of cigarette and bidi butts.The NGT orders came after the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research in its research commissioned during the course of the hearing said studies on cigarette butts had shown only 37.8 per cent degradation in two years in the soil under ambient condition.“This means cigarette butts will persist in soil for a longer duration. The data is not available on the cigarette butts or cellulose acetate (a major component of cigarette butts) mediated human health risk assessment and toxic responses or the response on micro-flora in the soil.“The degradation studies under natural environmental conditions and laboratory simulating conditions will be required to conclude the safety and toxicity of cigarette butts to further correlate with human and environmental health risk assessment,” the Toxicology Institute said recommending recycling of cellulose acetate after recovery from the cigarette butts as an immediate solution to the problem until the degradation and safety data are generated.Taking note of the expert report NGT’s principal bench said, “While tobacco is undoubtedly harmful and the concerned authorities are seized of the remedial action, the Tribunal is mainly concerned with the manner of disposal of cigarette and bidi butts.”“An expert study has been conducted. We do not find any valid reason to reject the expert report. Accordingly, we direct that the Central Pollution Control Board may lay down guidelines for disposal of cigarette and bidi butts, in the interest of environment, within three months.”Earlier responding to the notice in the matter, the Ministry of Environment had said cigarette and bidi butts were not yet listed as hazardous in India and cellulose acetate, principal component of the butts, was essentially a biodegradable substance. The Environment Ministry had however admitted to NGT that the biodegradability of cellulose acetate was not necessarily satisfactory in practice.The Tribunal had then directed the CPCB to Commission an expert study to throw light on this little reviewed subject.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/frame-guidelines-on-disposal-of-cigarette-bidi-butts-in-three-months-ngt-to-centre-155103

13-10-2020||Mumbai||Shifting Mumbai car shed will affect Metro project, transport: Experts||The Maharashtra government's decision to relocate the Aarey Metro car shed to Kanjurmarg in Mumbai is "unwise" and will adversely affect the Metro-3 project and the city's public transport, say urban planners and transport experts.The decision to shift the car shed from Aarey Colony, the Mumbai's green lung, will delay the project and increase its capital expenditure and operational cost, they say.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced the scrapping of the Aarey Metro car shed. He said the project would now be shifted to a government land in Kanjurmarg and no cost would be incurred for the purpose.Experts, however, say it is not the right time to shift the car shed to Kanjurmarg when the Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ Metro-3 project that started in 2013 is near completion.Mumbai-based transport expert Paresh Rawal termed it as an "unwise" decision."Alternative ways of mitigating the environmental impact should have been considered rather than alternative sites," Rawal told PTI, adding that it is a "big blow" to the city's public transportation.He said it would delay the Metro-3 project and increase its capital expenditure and operational cost.The move to relocate the car shed from Aarey came amid reports that the state government was considering if two of the upcoming Metro lines could share maintenance facility.It had appointed Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to prepare a feasibility study on Metro 3 (Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ) sharing its car shed with Line 6 (Vikhroli-Lokhandwala).Rawal said the option of merger of the Metro-3 corridor with Metro-6 would reduce the line capacity of both, while building a parallel corridor till Kanjurmarg would increase the project cost.Urban planner Sulakshana Mahajan said the Metro car shed should have been built at the existing site in Aarey Colony as already a lot of money had been spent on the work and a complete DPR (detailed project report) is ready for the site."Since the new proposed car shed site in Kanjurmarg is close to the coastline and marshy land, it may require environment clearances, which could further delay the project," she said.Mahajan said the state government should reveal details of the Kanjurmarg car shed land in a transparent manner as it was under litigation in the Bombay High Court.Architect Nitin Killawala, however, welcomed the decision of relocating the Metro-3 car shed to Kanjurmarg, saying it will save 20 hectares of Aarey land.He also suggested that the Metro-3 line be further diverted beyond SEEPZ to Kanjurmarg via Saki Vihar, Chandivali and Powai."Infrastructure projects like the Metro lines are planned for next 100 years, hence in such mega projects a delay of a few years won't make much difference," he said.

Terming her exit unfortunate, Congress incharge of Tamil Nadu Dinesh Gundu Rao said the Congress would not lose focus due to this development and would focus on strengthening the state unit ahead of the elections. TNSAccusing some leaders of “dictating terms” and “suppressing” her, Khushbu, who was earlier also with regional satrap DMK, promised to do her best to fulfill her responsibilities in the BJP and make sure it sees victory in Tamil Nadu.Stating that the country needs someone like Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take it in the right direction, she said she would do her best at responsibilities given to her.The BJP, which lacks a charismatic leader in Tamil Nadu and has also been wooing megastar Rajinikanth for long, is hoping to improve its presence in the elusive state with Khushbu.So far, the saffron party has not received much traction there with its alliance with late J Jayalalithaa’s AIADMK. Speculations are rife of a “key role” for her in the 2021 Assembly election and also a RS seat.Observers say Khushbu makes “good optics” for the BJP, but to say she will make any major dent in rivals camp is “far-fetched”. “Khushbu has a good fan following, but she lacks personal base, thereby making no difference to real layers like DMK,” they say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-sets-tamil-nadu-plan-in-motion-khushbu-joins-saffron-ranks-155044

India has gone the extra mile to help the Maldives financially through a transparent mechanism. The RBI raised Treasury Bonds which were sold to the State Bank of India (SBI), Male, for handover to the Maldives Government.After the Galwan Valley clash, not only has India stepped up aid but welcomed the US signing a defence framework agreement with the Maldives.

Both LTC scheme and festival advance come with riders. As travel is restricted, the scheme mandates purchases worth three times the fare and one time the leave encashment by March 31, 2021. The vouchers will have to be spent on goods that attract 12 per cent or more GST — a condition that eliminates the possibility of the money being spent on food items.Helping the poorWe want to incentivise people to boost demand for the benefit of the less fortunate. — Nirmala Sitharaman, FMRs 450 cr for HIMACHALOf Rs 12,000 crore 50-year loans to states, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand will get an assured loan of Rs 450 crore each. The eight Northeastern states will also get Rs 200 crore each.The cost for the Centre will be Rs 5,675 crore and its extension to PSU and bank staff will cost another Rs 1,900 crore. The interest-free advance will be preloaded on RuPay cards and will be recoverable in 10 installments. The government will bear the bank charges. The expenditure is estimated at Rs 4,000 crore and Rs 8,000 crore more, if states follow suit. The two measures would generate a consumer demand of Rs 28,000 crore, said Sitharaman.The actual outgo from the today’s announcements is about Rs 11,500 crore for individuals and Rs 12,000 crore for states. An additional Rs 25,000 crore capital expenditure was passed by Parliament last month. The rest is based on the assumption of a three-time multiplier effect and the expectation that states and PSUs may give similar concessions.The 50-year loan to states will consist of three parts. The first provides for Rs 200 crore each for eight Northeast states and Rs 450 crore each for Himachal and Uttarakhand. The second allocates Rs 7,500 crore to other states as per the devolution formula. Under part three, Rs 2,000 crore will go to states fulfilling at least three out of four reforms under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Package. Sitharaman also included Rs 25,000 crore announced in the Supplementary Budget last month to this mini stimulus package.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ltc-cash-vouchers-fest-advance-to-spur-demand-155007
