29-07-2020||New Delhi||ITER a perfect example of age-old Indian belief ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’: PM||The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), a multi-nation project that aims to replicate energy of the Sun, is a perfect example of the age-old Indian belief ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said.The start of assembly of the ITER Tokamak, the world’s largest fusion device, was celebrated on Tuesday at Saint-Paul-Lez-Durance, France.Heads of states of all ITER member-countries participated either in person, or electronically through remote mode or conveyed their message.The celebration was hosted virtually by President Emmanuel Macron.Modi’s message was conveyed by India’s envoy to France’s Jawed Ashraf.“Taking note of the global participation of scientists and engineers, he (the prime minister) projected ITER to be a perfect illustration of the age-old Indian belief—Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam—the entire world is working together for the betterment of mankind,” a statement by the Ministry of External Affairs said.ITER Organisation (IO) is the central team responsible for construction at the site and operation, while the ITER partners created their own domestic agencies to deliver their commitments to ITER. ITER-India is the Indian domestic agency.Its partners are the European Union, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States.The European Union being the host party contributes 45 per cent while the rest of the parties contribute nine per cent each. Most of these contributions are through ‘in-kind’ procurement of ITER components.Modi added that India stands proud with its fair share of contributions in terms of its in-kind contributions, like the cryostat, in vessel shields, substantial contributions to the cooling water, cryogenic and cryo-distribution systems, auxiliary heating devices using RF and beam technologies, multi megawatt power supplies and several diagnostics to help ITER to achieve and demonstrate its goal.

It had also allowed adding the Union of India as a party as the petitioners have challenged certain provisions of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-speaker-moves-sc-again-challenges-july-24-hc-order-119567
29-07-2020||New Delhi||Will fight it out, says arrested DU professor Hany Babu’s wife||Delhi University Professor Hany Babu’s wife Jenny Rowena on Wednesday said they will not be broken by his arrest and will fight the case in court, a day after he was taken in custody by the NIA in the Bhima Koregaon-Elgar Parishad case.Rowena, who teaches at Delhi University’s Miranda House, learnt about her husband’s arrest around 5.30 pm on Tuesday.The NIA has accused Hany Babu Musaliyarveettil Tharayil (54), an associate professor in the Department of English, of propagating Naxal activities and Maoist ideology and being a “co-conspirator” in the Elgar Parishad case.Babu is also a member of The Committee for the Defence and Release of GN Saibaba, a former DU professor serving life sentence over charges of having Maoist links.“They were asking him (Babu) about his role in the defence committee,” Rowena told PTI over phone.“They also found in his computer a file which they said is highly incriminating... He was sitting with such a file on his computer for them? They are cooking up this fabricated story. They are using that file only to link him to Maoists,” she alleged.The case relates to an Elgar Parishad event of December 31, 2017, organised by the Kabir Kala Manch at Shaniwarwada in Pune, where alleged provocative speeches were made, promoting enmity between various caste groups and leading to violence resulting in loss of life and property and state-wide agitation in Maharashtra, an NIA official had said on Tuesday.The Pune Police had in September last year conducted a raid on Babu’s house and seized his laptop and some books.When asked about the file, Rowena said Babu told her that the police did not show it to him but claimed it had some letters exchanged among Maoists and his name was mentioned in them.“We are getting overwhelming support. I am not the kind of a person who will be broken by it and even Babu is not the kind of a person. We will stay strong and positive and will come out of it,” she said, adding they will “fight out the case in the court”.Writer Arundhati Roy, the Federation of Central Universities Teachers’ Association, the Jamia Teachers’ Solidarity Association and Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) also came out in support of Babu and slammed his arrest.In a statement, Roy alleged it is a manifestation of an understanding that the “anti-capitalist” politics that these activists represent poses the clearest threat to this government’s policies.The Federation of Central Universities Teachers’ Association (FEDCUTA) said the charges against Babu appear to be similar to those against other academics arrested in the case, like Prof Anand Teltumbde and Prof Shoma Sen.“It is evident that this is yet another attempt to muzzle academic freedom,” it alleged in a statement.The risk of catching COVID-19 infection during his incarceration is a real possibility, the statement said, expressing hope the judiciary would set Babu free.The Jamia Teachers’ Solidarity Association called Babu’s arrest “a blatant silencing of dissent”.The JNUSU appealed to students, academics and all progressive sections of the citizenry to stand together in solidarity with Babu.

29-07-2020||New Delhi||Cong welcomes arrival of Rafale jets, but questions govt over delay and high cost||The Congress on Wednesday welcomed the arrival of Rafale fighter jets in India, but questioned the delay and their high cost.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asked why each Rafale jet was purchased by the government at a cost of Rs 1,670 crore while the erstwhile Congress-led dispensation struck a deal for Rs 526 crore, and why the offset contract was given to a “bankrupt” private firm instead of the public-sector Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).“Congratulations to IAF for Rafale. Meanwhile, can Government of India (GOI) answer: Why each aircraft costs Rs 1670 Crores instead of Rs 526 Crores? Why 36 aircraft were bought instead of 126? Why was bankrupt Anil (Ambani’s firm) given a Rs 30,000 Crores contract instead of HAL,” he asked on Twitter.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said every nationalist should question why the Rafale aircraft are ‘Made in France’ and not in India and why was their arrival delayed by five years.“We welcome Rafale in India. Congratulations to the brave fighters of the Air Force. Every nationalist should ask why each Rafale was purchased for Rs 1670 crore instead of Rs 526 crore. Why only 36 Rafales instead of 126 are being purchased. Why are they ‘Made in France’ and not ‘Made in India’. Why is there a delay of five years,” Surjewala said in a tweet in Hindi.India on Wednesday received its first batch of new combat-proven fighter aircraft in two decades with the arrival of five Rafale jets, giving the country’s air power a strategic edge in the midst of a bitter border row with China in eastern Ladakh and frayed ties with Pakistan.The aircraft, having an undisputed track record and considered one of the most potent combat jets globally, landed at the Ambala Air Force base at around 3.10 PM after covering a distance of 7,000 km from the Merignac airbase in French port city of Bordeaux. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-welcomes-arrival-of-rafale-jets-but-questions-govt-over-delay-and-high-cost-119564

It is a big loss to the family as Sahebzadi Basheer Unnissa Begum Saheba was an epitome of Hyderabadi culture, tradition, and values.” “Born in September 1927, Basheerunnisa Begum was married to Nawab Kazim Nawaz Jung, better known as Ali Pasha,” he said. The VII Nizam, Mir Osman Ali was once believed to be among the richest people in the world.

29-07-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||France retains spot as India’s reliable strategic partner||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 29The five Rafale fighter jets that landed on Wednesday at Ambala do not constitute even half a squadron. But their delivery once again brings back the spotlight on France which has remained India’s trusted partner through the Cold War and beyond.Just two years after India’s independence and a year before US President Dwight Eisenhower’s “Atoms for Peace” speech that opened the doors for multi-country civil nuclear collaboration, France and India had collaborated in a project to extract thorium from monazite sand. It was a dead-end but it in turn led to a partnership that lasted till India conducted its first nuclear test in 1974.But when India conducted its second nuclear test in 1998, Russia and France were the only major powers that did not succumb this time to the Anglo-US pressure to cancel military and security exchanges.A year later, France made emergency supplies of ammunition during the Kargil war that was used by Mirage planes for accurate and debilitating strikes on Pakistani sangars on steep mountainsides.However, French military machines were doing yeoman’s service for the Indian armed forces much before the Mirages arrived. The Cheetah and the Chetak that feed and equip Indian soldiers in forbidding heights are also of French origin.Military ties, however, began just seven years after Independence. Over 100 Mystere fighter jets from France that joined the Indian Air Force were able to match the American Starfighters in dogfights during the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war.While more Rafale will keep arriving and some may eventually be assembled here, the close personal ties between French President Emmanuel Macron and PM Narendra Modi may eventually lead to a stronger partnership in the maritime domain, especially in the Western Indian Ocean where the Chinese threat is looming and the US is lukewarm about partnering with India.India and France have trod that path before. Paris had helped install two listening stations on India’s western coast. These were to be linked with similar ones in Iran and France for a comprehensive coverage of the western Indian Ocean. But the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran ended that initiative.With French origin Scorpene submarines being gradually inducted in the Indian Navy, India and France have been revisiting the possibility of partnering in the blue waters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/france-retains-spot-as-indias-reliable-strategic-partner-119552

The state currently has over a 1,000 containment zones. “We have 1,100 Covid-19 testing facilities across Telangana. However, everybody cannot visit government health facilities from their containment zones or slums. Our mobile testing buses, with each bus having at least 10 to 12 testing counters, will visit such places and offer Covid-19 tests for free,” the health minister said. The “Intelligent Monitoring Analysis Services Quarantine” (iMASQ) the facility is placed in specially designed buses developed by Hyderabad-based Vera Smart Healthcare. Each mobile center will have two sample collection teams and at least 10 sample collection counters. Such mobile centers will visit the pre-designated containment area and remain there from 8 am to 5 pm, so that local people can avail of the services. About 80 per cent of infected patients are recuperating in-home quarantine, while only five percent need critical care the minister said adding that adequate preparations had been made for the supply of Remdesivir, Favipiravir, and Tocilizumab for patients that needing critical care. The state has recorded 1,764 new COVID-19 infections and 12 deaths taking the number of dead so far to 492 and the cumulative number of positive cases in the State to 58,906.

29-07-2020||New Delhi||Rafale fleet will be a game changer for India: Experts||The Rafale jets, known globally as one the most potent strategic platforms with unmatched capability in carrying out a variety of roles, will significantly bolster India’s air combat capabilities when it is facing hostile neighbours like Pakistan and China, defence experts said on Wednesday.The timing of induction of the 4.5 generation combat jets assumed significance as it came in the midst of India’s tense border row with China, they said.Read also: 5 Rafale jets touch down at Ambala airbaseThey said the Rafales could be a game-changer for India after all the 36 jets join the Indian Air Force as no aircraft in possession of any country in the neighbourhood will be able to match their superior kinematic performance and powerful electronic warfare systems.The Rafale jet, which is often compared with the US’ stealth F-35 aircraft and F-22, is able to carry out all combat aviation missions like air superiority and air defence, close air support, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence at varied speed limits of up to 1.8 Mach.The aircraft proved its unmatched capabilities in air combat missions in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria in the last few years. India is the fourth country to have the strategic platform after France, Egypt and Qatar.The Rafale, manufactured by French defence giant Dassault  Aviation, entered service with the French Navy in 2004 and with the French Air Force in 2006.According to Dassault Aviation, the aircraft has a whopping 30,000 flight hours in €€€operations.In comparison to F-35, experts said the Rafale jet is more agile as it has long-endurance to fly at a higher speed while carrying a range of weapons for a longer period of time. However, the F-35 scores much ahead of Rafales in terms of on board avionics and electronic warfare systems.“It is one of the finest combat aircraft available in the global market. It is much more advanced and lethal then the current fighter aircraft available with China. It is definitely a boost to India’s defence preparedness. The timing of the arrival of the jets is perfect,” said defence expert De Laxman Behera.When asked about China’s fighter jet J-20, he said it cannot be compared with Rafale as the French manufactured jet is much more potent than the Chinese aircraft.Former Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major (retd) too echoed Dr Behera’s observations.“There was no comparison between Rafale and the J-20s. The world does not know about the J-20s. The Rafale jets will give the IAF superior air dominance capability,” the former IAF chief told PTI.European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile, Scalp cruise missile and MICA weapons system will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.The Indian Air Force is also in the process of procuring a new generation medium-range modular air-to-ground weapon system Hammer to integrate with the Rafale jets.The Hammer (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) is a precision-guided missile developed by French defence major Safran. The missile was originally designed and manufactured for the French Air Force and Navy.“India will have unmatched air power in the region when it has all the 36 Rafale aircraft. It will be a game changer for India,” said Dr Behera, who is a leading expert at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.He said both Pakistan and China must have taken note of induction of the fighter jets.The government on Monday said the delivery of all 36 aircraft will be completed by the end of 2021.India on Wednesday received its first batch of new multirole combat fighter aircraft in nearly two decades with the arrival of five Rafale jets.The NDA government had inked a Rs 59,000-crore deal on September 23, 2016 to procure 36 Rafale jets from French aerospace major Dassault Aviation after a nearly seven-year exercise to procure 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) for the Indian Air Force did not fructify during the UPA regime.The emergency acquisition was made primarily to check the depleting combat capability of the IAF as the number of its fighter squadrons had come down to a worrying 31 against the authorised strength of at least 42.The fleet, comprising three single seater and two twin seater aircraft, is being inducted into the IAF as part of its Ambala-based No 17 Squadron, also known as the “Golden Arrows”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rafale-fleet-will-be-a-game-changer-for-india-experts-119541

We will not entertain it any further,” the Bench said.The Supreme Court had on July 16 had deferred hearing on the petition challenging Soz’s detention to July 29 after J&K Administration said it needed more time to file its reply.The top court had on June 8 issued notice to Jammu and Kashmir Administration on a petition filed by Mumtazunnisa Soz challenging his detention since nullification of Article 370.Mumtazunnisa Soz had contended that her husband---a former MP from the Baramulla Lok Sabha constituency was picked up by the police on the morning of August 5 and he had been “illegally” detained without being informed about the grounds of his detention.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/saifuddin-soz-wasnt-under-detention-says-jk-sc-disposes-of-plea-for-his-release-119537
29-07-2020||New Delhi||Rafale deal: A saga of political dogfight to celebratory touchdown||The touchdown of five Rafale jets on Indian soil on Wednesday caps years of intense political dogfight, with the ruling BJP projecting the purchase as a huge boost to national security and the Congress alleging corruption, before a clean chit by the Supreme Court to the deal removed any hurdle in its acquisition.Senior BJP leaders were jubilant as the multirole combat jets arrived at the Ambala Air Base, but this denouement marked by celebrations follows a long saga of political fights, with detractors of the deal taking their battle to the apex court and losing it there. Even the Supreme Court’s dismissal in December 2018 of PILs demanding a court-monitored probe into the Rs 59,000 crore purchase of 36 fighter jets and assertion that it found nothing wrong in the deal, could not douse the political fire as the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi made his allegations of graft in the transaction a poll issue in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the opposition of compromising national interest by making “baseless” corruption charges and asserted that the French aircraft will bolster Indian Air Force capabilities manifold in a hostile neighbourhood.Most political observers believe that Gandhi’s charges did not find much traction with voters as the saffron alliance retained power at the Centre with a bigger mandate, taking the wind out of the opposition’s sails in its campaign against the deal.His diatribe against the prime minister with slogans like “chowkidar chor hai” (watchman is a thief) ended up boom-ranging, as the Congress was decimated in the elections.  The political row had erupted after the NDA government inked the Rs 59,000-crore deal on September 23, 2016 to procure 36 Rafale jets from French aerospace major Dassault Aviation after a nearly seven-year exercise to procure 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) for the Indian Air Force did not fructify during the Congress-led UPA regime.The emergency acquisition was made primarily to check the depleting combat capability of the IAF as the number of its fighter squadrons had come down to a worrying 31 against the authorised strength of at least 42.However, opposition parties, primarily the Congress, accused the Modi government of bypassing the due process and alleged that the cost per aircraft had turned out to be much more than what was being negotiated by the UPA dispensation.The then Defence Minister Arun Jaitley had asserted amid relentless protests in Parliament by the Congress that in reality the deal signed by the Modi government was 20 per cent cheaper than being negotiated by the UPA.The government, however, declined to reveal price breakdown of the deal, saying it will compromise national interest by disclosing the details of the aircraft’s security features.A CAG report in February last year also vindicated the government’s position to a large extent, saying it secured a 2.86 per cent cheaper price for the fighter jets than what was negotiated by the UPA regime.Earlier, the Supreme Court had on December 14, 2018 rejected plea for a probe into the deal, saying there was no occasion to doubt the decision-making process in the Rafale’s procurement.In November last year, the court rejected pleas for a review of its decision, putting a closure to the political controversy over the deal.

29-07-2020||New Delhi||CBI seeks 7-yr jail for ex-Samata Party president Jaya Jaitly, others in defence graft case||The Central Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday sought maximum punishment of 7-year jail term for former Samata Party President Jaya Jaitly and two others found guilty of corruption in a 2000-01 case related to a purported defence deal.Special CBI judge Virender Bhat, who had held Jaitly, her former party colleague Gopal Pacherwal and Major General (retired) SP Murgai guilty of corruption and criminal conspiracy in the purported purchase of hand-held thermal imagers, reserved the order for Thursday.The case stemmed out of a sting operation ‘Operation Westend’ aired by news portal Tehelka in January 2001.During the proceedings held in-camera, the CBI said the convicts should be dealt with firmly as the crime was of very serious nature and be given the maximum jail term of seven year jail term.The counsel appearing for the convict persons, however, sought leniency on the ground that they were aged, the court sources said.The court had held that all the three accused persons, along with Surender Kumar Surekha (who later turned approver), were a party to a criminal conspiracy that took place around December 2000 and January 2001 at Delhi.The court observed that while Jaitly accepted illegal gratification of Rs 2 lakh from Mathew Samuel, a representative of fictional company Westend International, Murgai received Rs 20,000.The illegal gratification was accepted for obtaining supply orders for hand held thermal imagers from the army.         All the three accused---Jaitly, Pacherwal and Murgai---were convicted of the offence of conspiracy (Section 120-B IPC read with Section 9 (taking gratification, for exercise of personal influence with public servant) of Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act.The court held that it is “proved beyond doubt that in the meeting in the hotel room on December 25, 2000, Surekha and Murgai assured their assistance to Samuel in procuring letter of evaluation for the product of his company from the Ministry of Defence and also to arrange a meeting between him and accused Jaya Jaitly who would provide political cover to them in this regard”.The court said it was agreed that Samuel would pay Rs 1 lakh each to Surekha and Murgai and Rs 2 lakh to accused Jaitly in this regard.“Thus there had been an agreement between them to obtain the evaluation letter for the concerned product by illegal means i.e. by resort to corruption and personal influence upon the concerned officials,” it said, adding that “accordingly, Pacherwal arranged the said meeting for December 28, 2000. He too was present in the said meeting in the room of Jaitly along with Surekha, Samuel and Murgai.”        The court said: “In that meeting, which took place in the official residence of the then Union Minister for Defence, George Fernandes, Samuel was introduced to Jaitly as a businessman whose company intends to enter the market of defence procurement”.  “Samuel offered the sum of Rs 2 lakh to Jaitly who instructed him to handover the money to Pacherwal and accordingly, the money was received by accused Pacherwal knowing that it was bribe money. In lieu thereof, Jaitly assured Samuel that in case the product of his company is not considered, she would intervene by making a request to ‘Sahib’ (purportedly the Defence Minister Mr. George Fernandes) to send a word to the concerned officer in this regard,” the judge observed.The court said both the accused, Pacherwal and Jaitly, are also guilty of the offence of conspiracy, the court said.“Jaitly received a sum of Rs 2 lakhs through Pacherwal from Samuel as a motive/reward for agreeing to accomplish the task given to her i.e. to exert personal influence upon the concerned Ministers/ Officers in pushing the product of the company of Samuel into the Indian Army,” it said.Similarly, Murgai received Rs 20,000 from Samuel on January 4, 2000 in lieu of the assistance rendered by him in arranging a meeting with Jaitly and securing letter of evaluation for the product of the company of by exercise of personal influence upon the concerned officers, the court noted.“Therefore, both of them have committed offence envisaged under Section 9 of the PC Act,” it said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-seeks-7-yr-jail-for-ex-samata-party-president-jaya-jaitly-others-in-defence-graft-case-119535

Private carriers have also operated a certain number of flights under this mission.“Passengers booking tickets for #VBM flights through travel agents, may please note that they should not pay more than the fares mentioned on the Air India website. Passengers facing issues of overcharging by travel agents may write to gmsm@airindia.in,” the ministry said on Twitter.India had on July 16 formed bilateral air bubbles with countries like the US, Germany and France that allows airlines of both the countries in the pact to operate special international charter flights.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic. All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and firing of employees in order to conserve cash.India resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. The airlines have been allowed to operate only a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights.However, occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around just 50-60 per cent since May 25.

29-07-2020||Howrah/Kolkata||Big B showers praise on Bengal boy for his composition on harmonica||Amitabh Bachchan, who is admitted to a hospital after testing positive for COVID-19, has praised a 17-year-old boy from West Bengal for his mellifluous composition on harmonica, saying he has never heard anything like it before.The megastar was so impressed by Subhraneel Sarkar, who has played a fusion of Raag Sarang and Raag Malhar, that he tweeted that the boy’s music was unique.“On a mouth organ never ever heard anything like this before!” Bachchan, who regularly connects with his followers and never hesitates to praise new talents, said.Bachchan has been sharing regular updates on his social media accounts, thanking his innumerable admirers for their well-wishes for his early recovery.“When I first got the tweet notification on mobile, I couldn’t initially believe that a personality like Amitabh Bachchan will have time to listen my composition and air his views,” the boy from Fuleswar area in Howarh district told PTI on Wednesday.“Then after rechecking the post and his account I was assured and broke the news to my parents,” the Class 11 student of Uluberia High School said.Subhraneel Sarkar has been playing the harmonica since he was in Class 2.He said he picked it up from his father who played the instrument with passion.“We are ecstatic that the acoustic effect created in the blending of Sarang and Malhar has been liked by no less than Amitabh Bachchan,” his mother Basabi Sarkar said.She said her son plays modern, classical and western music on his harmonica and posts his compositions on social media. Impressed by his skills, a Swedish harmonica-making company had sent him two mouth organs worth Rs 1 lakh each, she added.Father Subir Sarkar, who has been getting a number of phone calls after Bachchan’s tweet, said he will do everything to nurture his son’s talent.

29-07-2020||New Delhi||SC allows filing of plea against environmental clearance to Central Vista project||The Supreme Court Wednesday allowed filing of a fresh plea challenging the June 17 environmental clearance (EC) granted to the ambitious Central Vista project, covering 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens’ Delhi, for constructing a new Parliament House and other government buildings. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheswari and Sanjiv Khanna allowed senior advocate Shyam Divan to file within a week a fresh plea challenging the EC by the ‘Central Vista Committee’ to the project.The central government will respond to the petition a week after it is filed. The top court, which posted the petition to be filed for hearing in the week commencing August 17, said however that it was not sure whether physical hearing would commence by then. It has been holding hearing via video conferencing since the COVID-19 lockdown in March.“We permit a week to Divan to file the petition and a week to Centre to reply within a week of receiving the plea... Matter to be posted after two weeks,” the bench ordered.The bench was hearing as many as seven pleas, including two transfer petitions from the Delhi High Court, on the issue and they have been filed by persons like activist Rajeev Suri and retired Lt Col Anuj Srivastava against various permissions given to the project by the authorities including the nod to change the land use.At the outset, Divan, appearing for one of the petitioners, said the case was primarily against the permission on change of the land use and then “there was an environmental clearance granted on June 17 to the project”.He said there were multiple causes of action and the grant of the EC can be challenged before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the apex court cannot use its power to curtail that challenge to the EC before the NGT.The bench said there were two other petitions which raised the environmental issues and the fresh plea on EC will be governed by the orders of the apex court only.Lawyer Shikhil Suri, appearing for Suri, said one of the pending petitions challenged the grant of EC to the parliament project only, but now the issue of grant of EC to entire Central Vista project has come up.“There is no ‘We versus They’ here. Our parliament is being constructed. In future also defence and finance ministry buildings will be constructed,” said Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, adding that “private individuals” are before the court as also the “public spirited individuals”. “The project has to go through every level of scrutiny that a citizen can invoke. The clearance granted was for the construction of new and renovation of the existing parliament building,” Divan said. Opposing the grant of the EC, Divan said a piecemeal approach was adopted and the entire central vista project was needed to be registered as a township project and then the EC should have been granted. Recently, the CPWD has supported the project and sought dismissal of the pleas challenging it. Earlier, the apex court had said that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the Central Vista project will be “at their own risk”.It had made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.The pleas have challenged the grant of a no-objection certificate by the Central Vista Committee (CVC) and also the environmental clearances for the construction of a new parliament house building. One of the pleas was filed against a Delhi High Court order which had said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project. The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre’s ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista. The high court’s stay order on the single judge bench’s February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.The petitioners before the high court had opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building new Parliament and government offices.Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the Centre’s ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.The revamp, which was announced in September last year, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-filing-of-plea-against-environmental-clearance-to-central-vista-project-119524

29-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi HC quizzes civic bodies, DDA on steps taken for buildings in need of seismic stability||The Delhi High Court Wednesday asked the municipal bodies here and the DDA as to what steps they have taken after identifying and issuing notices to the high risk buildings in need of seismic stability.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan directed the municipal bodies and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to place before the court a report indicating steps taken by them after issuing notices to the owners of structures which require seismic stability.“You have to show us the progress,” the court said to the authorities and listed the matter for hearing on August 31.A direction was also issued to the Delhi government to inform the court whether any expert committee has been set up, as proposed by a notification of April last year, to look into seismic stability of the buildings in the national capital.The direction came in view of an application moved by the petitioner-advocate, Arpit Bhargava, seeking setting up of a monitoring committee to ensure timely implementation of the action plan for strengthening buildings in Delhi.Bhargava, in his application, has said that such a monitoring committee to supervise the authorities was necessary as they require constant “prodding” to make them work.He said that between April 12 and July 3, 14 earthquakes have struck the Delhi-National Capital Region.He also said that since the Centre has not filed any response or affidavit regarding steps taken by it, there is no clarity whether buildings like Vigyan Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan and others where high ranking officials work are seismically compliant or not.The municipal corporations, meanwhile, have filed similar additional affidavits stating that between the three of them they have employed 144 structural engineers to audit the stability of buildings under their jurisdiction.On June 18 the high court had pulled up the Delhi government and all the local authorities for non-implementation of the action plans for ensuring seismic stability of buildings in the national capital.Bhargava, in an earlier application, claimed that the authorities and Delhi government have not done anything despite several directions by the court to develop an action plan.The application was filed in Bhargava’s main petition filed in 2015 claiming that the seismic stability of buildings in Delhi was poor and in case of a major earthquake there could be large numbers of casualties.The petition is still pending before the high court which from time to time has directed the Delhi government and civic authorities to develop an action plan.In the earlier application, Bhargava contended that around 11 earthquakes have struck Delhi since April 12 and according to experts a big one was imminent which is why he has moved the court now for urgent directions.

29-07-2020||New Delhi||Naidu stresses on need to promote mother tongue||Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday called for protecting and promoting various Indian languages through the use of mother tongue in education and administration.Inaugurating a webinar on “Knowledge Creation: Mother Tongue” organised by the Department of Telugu, the University of Hyderabad, and the Telugu Academy, Naidu stressed the need for giving a special thrust to the respective official language by every state government.Observing that language was the lifeline of a civilisation, he said it denotes the identity, culture and traditions of the people. It plays an important role in preserving music, dance, customs, festivals, traditional knowledge and heritage.Calling for imparting education in mother tongue up to primary school level, he stressed that a language would gain popularity only through widespread usage.He said it was a fallacy to think that progress could be achieved only if education was pursued in English. Research has shown that those who are proficient in their mother tongue can learn other languages with equal ease, he said according to an official statement.Similarly, another survey of countries impacted greatly by globalisation showed that nations which accorded importance to mother tongue were among the top 50.Naidu said that it was also not correct to think that modern research could be conducted only if one was proficient in English. It should be noted that about 90 per cent of the top 40-50 countries in the Global Innovation Index are those in which education was imparted in their respective mother tongues, he said.Pointing out that many visiting foreign VIPs, despite knowing English, speak in their mother tongue during their discussions with top Indian dignitaries, the vice president said that by doing so they were conveying a message of self respect.

Home language, mother tongue or regional language to be medium of instruction up to Class 5”. She further said “school curriculum will be reduced to core concepts and there will be integration of vocational education from Class 6”.Flexible degree courses, single higher education regulator, common norms for public & pvt collegesChoice between 3 or 4 year undergraduate courses, multiple entry and exit options in degree courses, adding 3.5 crore seats in higher education institutions which will now have a single regulator, discontinuation of MPhil programmes and fixation of fees are among reforms for higher education reforms.Elaborating on the reforms, HRD Secretary Amit Khare said at a press briefing the policy aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio in higher education including vocational education from 26.3 pc (2018) to 50 pc by 2035 and 3.5 crore new seats will be added to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).The undergraduate degree will be of either 3 or 4-year duration with multiple exit options within this period, with appropriate certifications---a certificate after completing 1 year in a discipline or field including vocational and professional areas, a diploma after 2 years of study, or a Bachelor's degree after a 3-year programme."The 4-year multidisciplinary bachelor's programme shall be the preferred option since it allows the opportunity to experience the full range of holistic and multidisciplinary education in addition to a focus on the chosen major and minors as per the choices of the student," Khare said.As per the new policy, the system of affiliation will be phased out over 15 years and a stage-wise mechanism for granting graded autonomy to colleges, through a transparent system of graded accreditation, will be established.Over a period of time, it is envisaged that every college would develop into either an autonomous degree-granting college, or a constituent college of a university.The policy has called for a single higher education regulator called Higher Education Commission of India (HECI). However, medical and legal colleges will be kept out of its purview.Among the key reforms in the policy are common entrance exam for admissions to universities and colleges to be conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), discontinuation of MPhil programmes, common norms to be in place for private and public higher education institutions and fee fixation under a broad regulatory framework.  To ensure the preservation, growth, and vibrancy of all Indian languages, NEP has recommended setting an Indian Institute of Translation and Interpretation (IITI), National Institute (or Institutes) for Pali, Persian and Prakrit, strengthening of Sanskrit and all language departments in HEIs, and use of mother tongue or local language as a medium of instruction in more HEI programmes."An Academic Bank of Credit is to be established for digitally storing academic credits earned from different HEIs so that these can be transferred and counted towards final degree earned. Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs), at par with IITs, IIMs, will be set up as models of best multidisciplinary education of global standards in the country."The National Research Foundation will be created as an apex body for fostering a strong research culture and building research capacity across higher education.Internationalisation of education will be facilitated through both institutional collaborations, and student and faculty mobility and allowing entry of top world-ranked Universities to open campuses in our country," Khare said.  The new education policy was part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s manifesto ahead of the 2014 general election.In May 2016, a ‘Committee for Evolution of the New Education Policy’ under the chairmanship of TSR Subramanian, former cabinet secretary, submitted its report.  Based on this, the Ministry prepared a document called ‘Some Inputs for the Draft National Education Policy, 2016’. Then, a panel led by former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief K Kasturirangan had submitted the draft of the new NEP to Union Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ when he took charge last year.The draft was then put in the public domain to seek feedback from various stakeholders and over two lakh suggestions were received by the HRD Ministry about the same.

29-07-2020||New Delhi||Tobacco use accelerates transmission of COVID-19: Health ministry||Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as smoking increases possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth, the Union Health Ministry has said, warning that use of tobacco products can increase severity of respiratory infections and make people susceptible to coronavirus.In its document ‘COVID-19 Pandemic and Tobacco Use in India’, the ministry said experts have confirmed that smokers are more likely to develop severe symptoms or die from COVID-19, as it primarily attacks the lungs and warned against use of any such products.Smokers, it warned, are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smoking means that fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) are in contact with lips which increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth.“Further smoking products such as water pipes or hookah often involve the sharing of mouth-pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of COVID-19 in communal and social settings,” the ministry said.Tobacco use is a major risk factor for the four main Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) — cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes, which puts people with these conditions at higher risk for developing severe illness when affected by COVID-19. NCDs are estimated to account for 63 pc of all deaths in India and these are expected to rise further.        The chemicals in tobacco smoke suppress the activity of different types of immune cells that are involved in general and targeted immune responses.“Smoking impairs lung function, thereby reducing the immunity and making it harder for the body to fight off various diseases. Smoking, e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, pan masala and the like products use can increase risk and severity of pulmonary infections because of damage to upper airways and a decrease in pulmonary immune function,” it said.Evidence from countries reporting coronavirus infection related fatalities has highlighted that the people with pre-existing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are more susceptible to becoming severely ill with COVID-19, the document stated.Tobacco use poses a significant risk by accelerating the transmission of COVID-19 because the virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes.   Chewing tobacco products (khaini, gutkha, paan, zarda) increases the urge to spit. Spitting in public places increases health risks especially those of spreading the infectious and contagious diseases like, COVID-19, tuberculosis, swine flu, encephalitis, etc, the ministry underlined.“The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare warns against the use of any tobacco products,” it said, adding within 12 hours of quitting, the carbon monoxide level in the bloodstream drops to normal.          Within 2-12 weeks, circulation improves and lung function increases. After 1-9 months, coughing and shortness of breath decreases, it said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tobacco-use-accelerates-transmission-of-covid-19-health-ministry-119479

29-07-2020||New Delhi||5 Rafale jets touch down at Ambala airbase||New Delhi, July 29Nearly 23 years after Sukhoi aircraft were imported, a fleet of five French-manufactured Rafale multi-role combat jets touched down in India on Wednesday, giving the country’s air power a strategic edge over its adversaries in the neighbourhood.The aircraft, having an undisputed track record and considered one of the most potent combat jets globally, landed at the Ambala Air Force base after covering a distance of 7,000 km from the Merignac airbase in French port city of Bordeaux.Read also: 36 Rafale fleet will be a game changer for India: ExpertsThe Rafales were escorted by two Sukhoi 30 MKIs after they entered the Indian air space.“The Birds have landed safely in Ambala,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh tweeted.Singh said that “the touchdown of Rafale combat aircrafts in India marks the beginning of a new era in our Military History. These multirole aircrafts will revolutionise the capabilities of the IAF”.The Birds have landed safely in Ambala. The touch down of Rafale combat aircrafts in India marks the beginning of a new era in our Military History. These multirole aircrafts will revolutionise the capabilities of the @IAF_MCC.  The NDA government had inked a Rs 59,000-crore deal on September 23, 2016, to procure 36 Rafale jets from French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, after a nearly seven-year exercise to procure 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) for the Indian Air Force did not fructify during the UPA regime.The emergency acquisition was made primarily to check the depleting combat capability of the IAF as the number of its fighter squadrons had come down to a worrying 31 against the authorised strength of at least 42.The fleet, comprising three single-seater and two twin-seater aircraft, are being inducted into the IAF as part of its Ambala-based No 17 Squadron, also known as the ‘Golden Arrows’.A government statement on Monday said 10 Rafale jets were delivered to India and that five of them are staying back in France for training missions. The delivery of all 36 aircraft will be completed on schedule by the end of 2021, it added.The Rafale jets, known for air-superiority and precision strikes, are India’s first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 year after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The aircraft is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile, Scalp cruise missile and MICA weapons system will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.The IAF is also procuring new generation medium-range modular air-to-ground weapon system Hammer to integrate with the Rafale jets.  The Touchdown of Rafale at Ambala. pic.twitter.com/e3OFQa1bZY  Hammer (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) is a precision-guided missile developed by French defence major Safran.  The missile was originally designed and manufactured for the French Air Force and Navy.Meteor is the next generation of BVR air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden.The Meteor is powered by a unique rocket-ramjet motor that gives it far more engine power for much longer than any other missile, said an official.Though the jets are being inducted into the IAF on Wednesday, there will be formal ceremony in mid-August to welcome them into the force. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and top military brass of the country are expected to attend the event.The fleet landed at Al Dhafra airbase on Monday in the UAE after flying for over seven hours from the Merignac airbase. It was the only stopover by the jets while flying from France to India.The jets were also refulled mid-air from a French tanker at a height of 30,000 feet, according to the Indian Embassy in France.The first Rafale jet was handed over to the IAF in October last year during a visit to France by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.While the first squadron of the Rafale jets will be stationed at Ambala airbase, the second one will based at Hasimara base in West Bengal.The Ambala base is considered one of the most strategically located bases of the IAF as the Indo-Pak border is around 220 km from it.The IAF spent around Rs 400 crore to develop required infrastructure like shelters, hangars and maintenance facilities at the two bases.Out of 36 Rafale jets, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater and they will have almost all the features of the fighter jets.India began the process to buy a fleet of 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) in 2007 after the Defence Ministry, headed then by AK Antony, cleared the proposal from the IAF.The contenders for the mega deal were Lockheed Martin’s F-16s, Eurofighter Typhoon, Russia’s MiG-35, Sweden’s Gripen, Boeing’s F/A-18s and Dassault Aviation’s Rafale.After a long-drawn process, bids were opened in December 2012 and Dassault Aviation emerged as L-1 (lowest bidder). In the original proposal, 18 planes were to be manufactured in France and 108 in India in collaboration with the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.There were lengthy negotiations between the then UPA government and Dassault on prices and transfer of technology. The final negotiations continued till early 2014 but the deal could not go through. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/5-rafale-jets-touch-down-at-ambala-airbase-119464
29-07-2020||Gurugram||Pilot camp MLAs shift resort; change numbers, shun smartphones||Having caught too much media attention at two of their previous lodgings, the Sachin Pilot camp of MLA’s on Tuesday shifted base to another luxury resort in Manesar.The MLA’s changed their numbers and have gone off the radar from the 24-hour surveillance of the Rajasthan SOG after shiftng to Heritage Village resort and Spa. The MLA’s, according to a highly placedsource, are no longer using smartphones and have switched to a local provider.According to a senior official of the SOG, the resort’s front gate is closed, while the kitchen gate is operational. Three-tier security has been put outside the resort with casually dressed bouncers forming the first layer followed by a security cover of the Haryana police inside. The security is not allowing anybody near the resort.  The resort staff, too, is not being allowed to get out and has been retained there. Highly placed sources revealed that they managed to trace the MLA’s to Heritage through their social media updates on Kargil war anniversary and by intercepting calls of staff informing their families that they have been locked up inside with the VIP’s and will not be allowed to use the phone much.Speaking to The Tribune, ADG Ashok Rathore said, “They are neither at Best Western Country Inn and not ITC Grand Bharat. They are at this third resort and on our radar, we are trying to get through as it also has been fortified”.The resort has not issued any statement and sources at ITC grand Bharat and Best Western Country Inn revealed that they asked the MLA’s to shift after getting notice from SOG as they didn’t want to be entangled in any police litigation.It may be noted a team of ten cops of SOG have been staying put outside the resorts since a week now and working on a rotational basis.The team has changed thrice and now DSP Neeraj Pathak has joined the team. They have repeatedly been trying to get through to MLA’s but are being allegedly stopped by Haryana police that stands guard between them and the resorts. The team is reportedly followed and stopped at checkpoints erected before resorts. A DSP, who was formerly on duty, revealed that the notice served to the previous two resorts seeking CCTV footage and records were handed over to resort manager at Naaka only as the team was not allowed any further.Taking a stern stance of the same, Rajasthan DGP Bhupender Singh Yadav has shot a letter to Haryana DGP seeking immediate intervention in the matter and also seeking support in the investigation of the cases registered against the MLA’s ‘hiding’ in Manesar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pilot-camp-mlas-shift-resort-change-numbers-shun-smartphones-119463

29-07-2020||Mumbai||57% of Mumbai slum population has developed antibodies: Study||A sero-surveillance study done in Mumbai has revealed that 57 per cent of slum population and 16 per cent of non-slum residents in three civic wards had developed antibodies, indicating many people would already be affected by COVID-19 than the official tally suggests.The sero-surveillance had started on June 3 and 6,936 samples out of an estimated 8,870 were collected from slum and non-slum population of three civic wards - R-North, M-West and F-North - in the first half of July.It showed high proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in the city.The study revealed that 57 per cent of slum population and 16 per cent of non-slum residents in these civic wards had developed antibodies, the BMC said on Tuesday."These results will be valuable to learn more about herd immunity," stated a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) release.The civic body is going to conduct another survey that will provide information about infection spread and throw light on herd immunity as well, it said.The Serological Surveillance for SARS-CoV2 infection was jointly commissioned by NITI Aayog, the BMC and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR).A serological survey involves testing of blood serum of individuals to check for the prevalence of antibodies against an infection.The study found high proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in the city.The civic authorities claimed the sero surveillance result indicates that "asymptomatic infections are likely to be a high proportion of all infections"."Although prevalence in women was marginally higher than men, age-wise prevalence in the population was comparable in these wards," the BMC said.The BMC claimed that higher prevalence in slums could possibly be due to the population density and shared common facilities like toilets and water points, the release said.The civic body further claimed that although it is still unclear what level of prevalence leads to herd immunity, findings indicate that at least in slums this could be attained sooner than later, if the immunity exists and persists in a significant proportion of the population.The civic body said the sero-surveillance survey also indicates that the infection fatality rate (IFR) is likely to be very low, in the range of 0.05-0.10 per cent."Lower prevalence in non-slums could be due to better social distancing and access to better hygiene in addition to interventions by MCGM (BMC) to stem the spread of infection," the BMC stated.The BMC said that together with relatively low prevalence in non-slums suggests that social distancing and related precautions such as wearing masks are effective in slowing the infection spread and should continue as a new normal in all sections of society independent of prevalence.The study was carried out in collaboration with organisations like Kasturba Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), ATE Chandra Foundation and IDFC Institute.As on July 28, Mumbai has recorded 1,10,846 COVID-19 cases and 6,184 deaths.

Mumbai is the second Covid red zone after Delhi to show a decline in daily new cases.Member, Health, NITI Aayog, VK Paul said if the decline sustained over some days, one could conclude that Mumbai disease graph was peaking.Delhi started showing a similar decline in daily new cases about a fortnight ago, with AIIMS chief Randeep Guleria declaring about 10 days ago that the peak seemed to have arrived. Paul said the peak would come earlier in highly burdened states and later in other states where infections were surging now.Thanks to the drop in cases in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi, the national Covid surge in 24 hours remained less than 50,000, although the daily new cases nationally were higher than 45,000 for the sixth day today.The single-day rise in cases in the country was 47,703, taking the total load to 14,83,156 with the fatality rate falling further to 2.25 per cent from yesterday’s 2.28 per cent. With 9,52,743 recoveries, the cure rate rose to 64.24 per cent. Toll from the disease now is 33,425 with 654 deaths in 24 hours. As many as 35,176 patients were discharged.1st mother-child vertical transmission case in PuneThe country’s first documented case of vertical transmission of Covid from mother to child, leading to severe disease in the infant, has been reported by Pune’s BJ Medical College (BJMC) and Sassoon General Hospital.

29-07-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Naval sky watch to monitor Chinese movement on LAC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 28After the Chinese build-up along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, the Navy’s fleet of sophisticated surveillance planes, the Boeing P8I, has been regularly flying from Rajali near Chennai to scan the Himalayas and across.The sky watch adds to the satellite and local UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) imagery. The sweep and reach of the P8I is wider than that of a UAV. Also, it can be flown on demand at any time of the day or night, unlike the Indian satellites that have a schedule to cover.Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)-provided Data Link Communications allows the P8I to exchange tactical data live to ground stations, the South Block and the Navy data collation centre at Gurugram. The plane, designed for a maritime role, carries high-end electro-optical equipment that picks up minute details. It was also used during the Doklam standoff (June-August 2017) with China.“The planes remain at their home base and have not been moved northwards,” a top functionary said. They have an extended range of flying some 3,500 km with additional fuel tanks, which means a plane or a pair of them can scan the Himalayas, land at any of the IAF bases in North India, refuel, and go back to Rajali. The Navy has been using the Boeing P8I planes since 2013 and now has a fleet of eight, another four are set to arrive anytime and six additional ones are being negotiated for. The US Navy, Australian Navy and several allies of the US use the same plane, modified from the Boeing’s commercial planes 737-800ERX.Separately, the Indian establishment is making a push to provide assistance to Island countries in the Indian Ocean where China is facing a negative opinion due to the Covid-19 pandemic. India has sent doctors, medicines, PPE kits and food provisions to these islands amid the crisis. “To keep the Indian Ocean Region countries as cohesive as possible is the target,” said a top functionary. The presence of China in the Indian Ocean cannot be the new normal and the space created for human assistance due to the outbreak has to be filled up. Indian naval ships in the past two months have delivered aid to Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar and Comoros.Surveillance plane||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naval-sky-watch-to-monitor-chinese-movement-on-lac-119183
29-07-2020|| & PTI||Gehlot adamant on July 31 session||New Delhi, July 28The Rajasthan Government today wrote to Governor Kalraj Mishra for the third time, advising him to convene the Assembly session from July 31, as suggested by the Cabinet in its last note.The tug of war between the government and the Governor is likely to continue with sources saying even the latest Cabinet proposal does not make any mention of the floor test.On Monday, the Governor had returned the government note, asking it to specify if it wanted to take a floor test, because in that case the House could be called at a short notice.The Governor had said a 21-day notice would be needed if it was to be a routine session without any floor test. He also asked the Cabinet to list Covid safety measures to be taken for holding the session.Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, however, reiterated the July 31 date for the commencement of the session after chairing a Cabinet meeting in Jaipur today.“We have the majority and will prove it, if we think it is necessary,” Rajasthan minister Harish Chowdhry said.Asked about the agenda of the proposed session, state Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said it was for the business advisory committee of the Assembly to decide.On social distancing in the Vidhan Sabha in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the minister said it was for the Speaker to make arrangements.The minister was also dismissive of the 21-day notice requirement. He said “10 days” had already passed since the government proposed a session and asked why the Governor hadn't given a date himself.“We want permission to call the Assembly session, which is our right. We don’t want any confrontation with the Governor and hope he will give his approval this time,” Khachariyawas told reporters after the Cabinet meeting. “He has no right to raise queries. Yet we are giving a reply,” the minister said.Former Union minister P Chidambaram claimed the Cabinet need not specify the floor test issue in its note to the Governor. All that it needed to advise the Governor was to call the session for which the latter was constitutionally bound, he said.CM Gehlot has repeatedly said in public that he would take a test of strength in the House in the wake of rebellion by 19 Congress MLAs, including sacked Deputy CM Sachin Pilot.EPIC BATTLE IS ON, SAYS SURJEWALAAICC observer for Rajasthan Randeep Surjewala said an epic battle was on to determine who ‘wins between trust and fraud, people and traitors, and democracy and contractors of truth’. The Congress would fight this war in the interest of truth, Constitution and democracy, and emerge victorious, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gehlot-adamant-on-july-31-session-119185

29-07-2020||---||To consolidate OBOR, China resorts to health diplomacy||New Delhi, July 28While not much has been heard of India’s SAARC Covid initiative since Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched it four months ago, Chinese inroads on the pretext of a “health silk road” can lead to further consolidation of its One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative around India’s outer peripheries.SAARC Covid Fund with seed money of about Rs 1,500 crore was meant to put neighbourhood diplomacy back on the rails. The Centre had given up on SAARC five years ago because of Pakistan’s presence and started showcasing the BIMSTEC combination instead.However, while India focused on bilateral Covid aid with a few select neighbours, China has kick-started a “health silk road” that began with the ASEAN members and moved on to Central Asia. In both these regions, China has major plans for the OBOR.The ‘health silk road’ endeavour touched SAARC on Monday at a videoconference of foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China, Nepal and Pakistan. However, Beijing did not include half of SAARC, including Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh and Maldives.The joint statement indicated China’s subsidiary intentions behind including some SAARC countries that are not contiguous and leaving out others was linked to OBOR.The Chinese railway line from Shigatse to Kathmandu is making progress. The Indian hesitation in taking up the construction of a rail line from Iran to Afghanistan is in contrast with Beijing’s multi-billion dollar plan with Iran that may now be expanded to connect Afghanistan.The Chinese embassy here has indicated that the US has been the instigator in its troubles with India. Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong accused the US of seeking “containment, and ideological confrontation” with China.However, China continues to remain minatory on the issue of India banning 59 apps on grounds of data transfer and privacy violations.After India began narrowing the scope for Chinese products in government purchases, Beijing has repeatedly signaled it would be forced to take necessary steps. It may mean China pushing for closer ties with Nepal and Afghanistan where India has security stakes.US behind trouble with India: BeijingThe Chinese embassy has said the US has been the instigator in its troubles with India. It accused the US of seeking “containment, and ideological confrontation’’ with China while India adheres to strategic independence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-consolidate-obor-china-resorts-to-health-diplomacy-119161

This is India’s real strength and soft power. This is because of our ability to coexist and care for it.“India has 70 per cent of the world’s tiger population, it is our soft power,” the Environment Minister said, speaking on the eve of World Tiger Day. He also released the “Status of Tigers, Co-predators and Prey in India report for 2018”. According to the report, two reserves — Dampa in Mizoram and Buxa in West Bengal — don’t have any tigers left.“India has 50 tiger reserves. None of them are of poor quality,” according to Javadekar. The tiger population increased from 2,226 in 2014 to 2,927 in 2018 following efforts that included better corridors between isolated pockets of tiger territory, reduced poaching and building up prey numbers through habitat restoration.Status report on big cats2,967tigers in the country as per the latest census report.
