We have asked the guardians not to send their wards to the institute till asked,” Singh said.The institute would follow the advisories of the West Bengal and central governments regarding opening of campuses and assess the situation periodically on its own, he said.It may take two-three months more for the students to return to the campus though public transport has partially resumed, Singh said.“However, online classes for the next semester will not be delayed. It will start from September and students will be asked to attend those classes from home,” he said.Asked what would happen to those students living in remote areas with poor connectivity or those not having smart phones or computers at home, Singh said, “They will have a way out I think. They can use smart phones of others and avail network facility from a connected place nearby.”      Besides, if a student is unable to attend classes due to these issues, he or she would be allowed to have special classes later to clear the backlog after the resumption of campus activities.The institute has around 12,500 students and researches who stay at hostels.

19-08-2020||New Delhi||India, China expected to hold another round of diplomatic talks on Thursday||India and China are expected to hold a fresh round of diplomatic talks on Thursday to carry forward the disengagement process to resolve the over three-month-long border stand-off in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the developments said.The virtual talks are scheduled to be held under the framework of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, and both sides are expected to deliberate on ways to ensure early implementation of the disengagement process, they said.The Indian delegation at Thursday’s talks is likely to be led by Naveen Srivastava, Joint Secretary (East Asia) in the External Affairs Ministry, they said.In the last round of WMCC talks on July 24, the Chinese side was headed by Hong Liang, director general of the department of boundary and ocean affairs under the Chinese foreign ministry.After the talks, the Ministry of External Affairs had said both sides agreed that an early and complete disengagement of the troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in accordance with bilateral agreement and protocols was essential for overall development of bilateral relations.Following the diplomatic dialogue, armies of the two countries held the fifth round of Corps Commander-level talks on August 2 with an aim to expedite the disengagement process.However, the disengagement of troops from the friction points in eastern Ladakh has not moved forward as expected by India, according to military sources.At the military talks, the Indian side insisted on complete disengagement of Chinese troops at the earliest, and immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to May 5 when the standoff began following a clash between the two armies in Pangong Tso, they said.The Chinese military has pulled back from Galwan Valley and certain other friction points but the withdrawal of their troops has not moved forward in Pangong Tso, Depsang and a couple of other areas since mid-July, the sources said.The formal process of disengagement of troops began on July 6, a day after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tensions in the area.Even as both sides have been engaged in diplomatic and military talks, the Indian Army is making elaborate preparation to maintain its current strength of troops in all key areas in eastern Ladakh in the harsh winter months.Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane has already conveyed to all the senior commanders of the Army, overseeing operation of the frontline formations along the LAC, to keep up a significantly high state of alertness and maintain the aggressive posturing to deal with any Chinese “misadventure”, the sources said.The Army is also in the process of procuring a number of weapons, ammunition and winter gears for the frontline troops, they added.The temperature in some of the high-altitude areas along the LAC drops to minus 25 degree celsius in the winter months.The tension between the two sides escalated manifold after the violent clashes in Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed.The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.Following the Galwan Valley incident, the government gave the armed forces “full freedom” to give a “befitting” response to any Chinese misadventure along the LAC.The Army sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border following the deadly clashes. The IAF has also moved air defence systems as well as a sizable number of its frontline combat jets and attack helicopters to several key air bases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-expected-to-hold-another-round-of-diplomatic-talks-on-thursday-128460

19-08-2020||Allahabad||Allahabad HC adjourns hearing on plea challenging Dr Kafeel Khan’s detention till Aug 24||The Allahabad High Court on Wednesday adjourned hearing on the plea challenging the detention of Dr Kafeel Khan under the stringent National Security Act till August 24.The Gorakhpur doctor was arrested on January 29 for an alleged provocative speech against the Citizenship Amendment Act at Aligarh Muslim University in December last year. The Uttar Pradesh Government had earlier extended his detention by three months till November 13.Under the NSA, people can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if authorities are satisfied that they are a threat to the national security or law and order.The HC Bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Samit Gopal on Wednesday adjourned the hearing on the request of the counsel for the petitioner who sought time to file a reply to the affidavit submitted on behalf of the state government.Granting time to the petitioner’s counsel, the court said it will dispose of the plea on August 24. The petition was filed by Khan’s mother Nuzhat Parween.The court had earlier directed the Union and state governments to file a reply against the plea seeking the release of Khan.According to the plea, Khan was earlier granted bail by a court and he was supposed to be released. However, the NSA was imposed against him. Hence, his detention was illegal, the plea said. Khan is currently lodged in a Mathura jail.     The doctor had earlier faced arrest following the deaths of over 60 children in a week at a government hospital in UP’s Gorakhpur in 2017.About two years later, a state government probe cleared Khan of all major charges, prompting him to seek an apology from the Uttar Pradesh government.

19-08-2020||New Delhi||Diet, nutrition play key role in preventing deaths due to diseases including COVID: Vardhan||Highlighting the key role played by healthy food in combating morbidities and building one’s resilience and immunity towards various kinds of diseases, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday said people of the same household have been showing different responses to COVID-19 based on their immunity acquired through nutrition.Vardhan, who presided over an online orientation workshop organised by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) as part of its Eat Right Challenge, emphasised that 61.8 per cent deaths from non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular complications, etc are directly or indirectly related to faulty diet, a Health Ministry statement said.“Even communicable diseases like tuberculosis disproportionately affect people who are undernourished. People of the same household have been showing different responses to COVID based on their immunity acquired through nutrition,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.He also launched FSSAI’s ‘Eat Right India’ Handbook and the website eatrightindia.gov.in to help various stakeholders scale up ‘Eat Right India’ initiatives across the country.Addressing officials of 197 cities and districts, the Union Health Minister highlighted the pressing need for the campaign. He stated that of the 135 crore people inhabiting India, “196 million are victims of chronic hunger while another 180 million suffer from obesity. 47 million children have stunted growth while another 25 million are wasted. 500 million are deficient in micro-nutrients and 100 million suffer from food-borne diseases”. “This movement will sharpen our focus towards prioritising food, nutrition and awareness about our eating and dietary habits to prevent and address these challenges. This will also bring into sharper focus the problem of food wastage and disposal of food,” Vardhan said.The ‘Eat Right India’ movement initiated by FSSAI under the aegis of the Ministry of Health has been creating awareness among people about safe, healthy and sustainable dietary habits.           To achieve this end and to convert the program into a people’s movement, the FSSAI recently announced the ‘Eat Right Challenge’, an annual competition for 197 districts and cities in a unique way to strengthen the food safety and regulatory environment, build awareness among the consumers and urge them to make better food choices.     The Food Safety Commissioners and district officials such as District Magistrates and Designated Officers of the cities also joined  the online workshop.Releasing the ‘Eat Right Handbook’, a useful reference guide for officials to adopt and scale-up Eat Right India (ERI) initiatives in their respective jurisdictions,  Vardhan said, “Food is not only about hunger or taste but about health and nourishment. The workshop is unique in that it brings big restaurant chefs to roadside eatery owners under the same umbrella to achieve a single goal.”          Minister of State for Health, Ashwini Kumar Choubey highlighted the role of age-old wisdom and traditional Ayurveda in guiding people to right eating practices by categorizing food based on the effect they have on the body.             Reminding everyone of the Prime Minister’s commitment of creating a ‘new India’ by its 75th year of independence in 2022, Vardhan said, “The Prime Minister initiated Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan on October 2, 2014 to rid the country of diseases arising out of poor sanitation. Through the Jal Jeevan Mission aims to provide potable piped water which will aid in prevention of water borne illness in the country while the Ujjwala Yojana provides access to clean fuels to tackle smoke and lung diseases.”        Highlighting the importance of Poshan Abhiyaan, Anaemia Mukt Bharat and Fit India movement, he added that they are “cornerstones of Prime Minister’s New India by 2022.”The main focus of the Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness centres is on preventive, positive and promotive health, the minister stated. The HWCs form an integral component of the prime minister’s vision of a healthy India, he added.

19-08-2020||---||India to step up intelligence sharing with Bangladesh||New Delhi, August 19Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla wound up his two-day dash to Dhaka during which he discussed stepped up intelligence sharing, sharing of the Covid vaccine and a road map for Indian developmental assistance with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and his counterpart Masud Bin Momen.The importance of the visit can be gauged from the fact that this was Shringla’s first visit since the pandemic broke out. Similarly, Shringla was Hasina’s first overseas visitor since March.“I had a very satisfactory visit, a very short visit,” Shringla told the media in Dhaka. “When vaccine is developed, friends, partners, and neighbours will get it without any saying . . . for us Bangladesh is always a priority,” he said.“[The] reason is that our PM felt during COVID time there is not much contact, but the relationship (India-Bangladesh) must continue. We must continue to move forward towards our strong bilateral relations and I came primarily to look at that point,” he added.The Indian side opted to play up the intelligence sharing angle in view of the dire strait of Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh amidst reports that their poverty was a breeding ground for criminal activity as well as radicalisation. Given India’s sensitivity on Pakistan once again trying to revive its network, this time potentially through the Rohingyas, it was decided to hold a meeting between the two Foreign Ministers in the near future.Shringla also explained to Hasina the Indian approach to contributing to Bangladesh’s development including easy loans and the possibility of several projects being completed next year. He also discussed the plans for an air bubble between India and five of its neighbours including Bangladesh.A few weeks before the visit, India had sent 10 diesel locomotives to Bangladesh.They also discussed joint plans to observe Sheikh Mujibur Rahman centenary and the 50th anniversary of Indo-Bangladesh ties. India is likely to release a postage stamp of Sheikh Mujib. Shringla also spoke on the starting of a cargo ferry service and the possibility of quickly completing some projects such as the Akhaura-Agartala rail link and the Khulna thermal plant in time for the celebrations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-step-up-intelligence-sharing-with-bangladesh-128439
19-08-2020||New Delhi||Facebook row: Tharoor, BJP MP Dubey seek breach of privilege proceedings against each other||Congress leader Shashi Tharoor and BJP MP Nishikant Dubey have sought breach of privilege proceedings against each other after a spat on social media over Tharoor’s remarks on taking up the Facebook’s hate rules issue in the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology.Tharoor is the chairman of the panel while Dubey is a member.In his letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Tharoor alleged that the BJP MP made “disparaging remarks” on social media over his decision to summon a panel meeting to discuss alleged “misconduct” of Facebook.He also took strong objection to Dubey’s remarks on Twitter that “the Chairman of Standing Committee does not have the authority to do anything without discussion of the agenda with its members”.Hitting back, Dubey, in his petition to the Speaker, stuck to his stand that Tharoor has no powers to summon any entity or organisation before the panel without consulting its members.He said the agenda of any sitting of the Parliamentary Committee is decided after consultation with all the members of the parliamentary committee.But, Tharoor never consulted the agenda of summoning Facebook and/or WhatsApp in any of the meetings of the parliamentary committee, he said.“It is, therefore, a clear case, of Breach of Privilege by Dr. Shashi Tharoor in the capacity of Chairperson of the Departmentally Related Standing Committee on Information Technology,” he said in the notice.He alleged Tharoor has committed a serious breach of privilege to use the parliamentary committee platform not only to serve his political agenda but also to tarnish BJP and “sensationalise a small incident by misusing his official powers”.The political slugfest started between the two political leaders after Tharoor said on Twitter that standing committee would like to hear from Facebook officials about its hate speech rules in the wake of a report in the Wall Street Journal which claimed that the social media giant refused to apply such rules to certain ruling party politicians in India.Suggesting that Tharoor was using the committee’s platform for politics, Dubey alleged he decided to call Facebook officials to satisfy the ego of Rahul Gandhi who had alleged that BJP and RSS controlling  the social media platform.Anguished over the alleged “disparaging” remarks made by Dubey against his decision to call a meeting of the panel, Tharoor said it amounted to breach of privilege of his position as an MP and Chairman of the standing committee.“The matter pertains to the disparaging remarks made by Dubey on a social media platform regarding my decision to summon a Committee meeting to discuss the alleged misconduct of Facebook and seek clarity on the measures that it intends to undertake to curb the spread of hate speech and fake news,” Tharoor said.“Nishikant Dubey’s derogatory remarks have not only brought disrepute to my position as a Member of Parliament and Chairman but also to an institution that mirrors the will of the people of our country,” Tharoor alleged in the letter, a copy of which was also marked to Sunil Kumar Singh, chairman of Parliamentary Standing Committee on Privileges, Lok Sabha.Tharoor urged Birla to issue necessary directions to initiate proceedings against Dubey for “committing a breach of privilege on multiple accounts and contempt of the House”.Meanwhile, tagging a tweet on a media report about the rules and functioning of committees, Dubey on Wednesday tweeted, “In the last 11 years as an MP, I have neither violated any rules nor would I let anyone violate or abuse their power for their parties personal vendetta with agenda.” Referring to the recently published news report in the Wall Street Journal which claimed that Facebook refused to apply hate speech rules to certain ruling party politicians, Tharoor in the letter underlined the serious nature of allegations made against the social media platform and its far-reaching implications on the citizens’ Right to Information.Tharoor said he sought to convene the Committee meeting as part of the normal course of discussions on “safeguarding citizens’ rights and prevention of misuse of social/online news media platforms”.He alleged that Dubey’s remarks amounted to a three-fold breach of privilege.“The contemptuous words used by...Dubey have cast aspersions on the intent and integrity with which I fulfil my duties as an elected representative...,” he said.Such words constitute unwarranted vilification of the Committee’s name and the manner in which it discharges its functions, Tharoor alleged.“His actions have painted an ignominious picture of the revered institution of Parliament by indicating that its functionaries have circumvented the process that they are expected to follow,” he said.Citing rules and procedures of Parliament, Tharoor reiterated that the subject of the meeting had been unanimously approved by the committee members, Speaker’s and Lok Sabha secretary general’s offices and thereafter it was placed in public domain through publication in the bulletin.“Therefore, to claim that the chairman has acted in excess of his authority to convene a meeting on a pre-approved agenda, and has proceeded without seeking the necessary approvals, is tantamount to contempt of the due procedure followed by the House,” Tharoor said.Reacting to the controversy on the WSJ report, Facebook had on Monday said the company’s social media platform prohibits hate speech and content that incites violence, adding these policies are enforced globally without regard to political affiliation.“While we know there is more to do, we’re making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits of our process to ensure fairness and accuracy,” a Facebook spokesperson had said. —

19-08-2020||New Delhi||National Recruitment Agency to conduct online test for govt jobs twice a year: Jitendra Singh||Terming the setting up of a National Recruitment Agency as “historic”, Union minister Jitendra Singh on Wednesday said it will conduct an online Common Eligibility Test for shortlisting candidates for majority of Central government jobs twice a year.He said the multiple recruitment examinations are a burden on the candidates, as also on the respective recruitment agencies, involving avoidable or repetitive expenditure, law and order or security-related issues and venue-related problems.Singh, Minister of State for Personnel, said on an average 2.5-3 crore candidates appear in each of these examinations, but a Common Eligibility Test (CET) would enable these candidates to appear once and apply to any or all of these recruitment agencies for the higher level of examination.“This would indeed be a boon to all the candidates,” he said.Singh said there will be two tests per year under the NRA and the scores of the candidates will remain valid for three years.He said, besides Hindi and English, tests will be conducted in 12 languages in due course and efforts will be made to include all the languages mentioned in the eighth Schedule of the Constitution, according to a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.Singh said the decision of the Union Cabinet to set up a National Recruitment Agency to conduct a CET is a “historic, visionary and revolutionary reform” in the field of recruitment for Central government jobs.Briefing the media here, he said the decision marks a paradigm shift in the government recruitment process.Singh said the multi-agency body NRA will conduct a CET to screen or shortlist candidates for the Group B and C (non-technical) posts and will provide a level playing field to all candidates.The minister said the move will not only lead to ease of recruitment, selection and job placement, but will also ultimately ensure ease of living, as about 1,000 centres, one in each district will be set up, where candidates can take the test.He said the measure will immensely help the candidates from the far-flung and hilly areas and particularly the girl candidates, besides saving their valuable time and resources, the statement said.Singh said the NRA will come into force from next year and will be headquartered in Delhi.He said state governments will also be advised to come on board in a true spirit of cooperative federalism.Singh also hoped that in the near future the private sector will also join the NRA.He said the NRA will have representatives of the Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Finance/Department of Financial Services, Staff Selection Commission (SSC), Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS).It is envisioned that the NRA would be a specialist body bringing the state of the art technology and best practices to the field of the Central government recruitment, the statement said.

19-08-2020||New Delhi||Two ISIS operatives plead guilty before Delhi court||Two persons on Wednesday pleaded guilty before a Delhi court in a case of criminal conspiracy by the ISIS to establish its base in India by recruiting Muslim youths through different social media platforms in order to carry out acts of terrorism in the country.Accused Abu Anas and Najmul Huda made the submission before the court, which was scheduled to hear arguments on the quantum of punishment for six other accused who had earlier pleaded guilty in the case, their advocate Qausar Khan said.Special Judge Parveen Singh, meanwhile, Wednesday deferred for August 24 the hearing on the quantum of sentence for the six accused—Mudabbir Mushtaq Sheikh, Mohammad Shareef Moinudeen Khan, Asif Ali, Mohammad Hussain Khan, Syed Mujahid and Mohammad Azhar Khan—who pleaded guilty earlier.While pleading guilty, the accused told the court that they were “remorseful for the acts alleged against them”, and undertook not to indulge in similar acts and activities in future.They said they wanted to return to the mainstream society and rehabilitate themselves.“The accused are having clean antecedents, even their conduct in jail are satisfactory and there is nothing adverse against them... the accused are pleading guilty voluntarily without any pressure, threat, coercion, inducement or undue influence and he that he understands the consequences,” their plea said.The case, registered by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on December 9, 2015 under relevant sections of the IPC and the UA(P) Act, pertains to the larger criminal conspiracy hatched by the ISIS to establish its base in India by recruiting Muslim youths for the proscribed terror group through different social media platforms, the probe agency said.The accused had formed Junood-ul-Khilafa-Fil-Hind organisation, seeking to establish a caliphate in India and pledging allegiance to ISIS, to recruit Muslim youths to work for the ISIS and commit acts of terrorism in India at the behest of Syria-based Yusuf-Al-Hindi who is purportedly the media chief of ISIS, it said.The NIA had filed chargesheets against 16 accused in 2016-2017.After the six accused pleaded guilty on August 6, the court convicted them under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and various sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and Explosive Substances Act.This case was first of its kind in which terrorist conspiracy of this magnitude involving online radicalisation was effected on cyber space in the aftermath of declaration of Islamic Caliphate by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014, the NIA had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-isis-operatives-plead-guilty-before-delhi-court-128423

But if I had missed this opportunity, then my son’s one year would have gone waste. Therefore, I decided to take him for the examination on a bicycle, said Shobhram.Besides, we don’t have money or even a motorcycle. Nobody helps. But for improving my son’s life, I brought him to Dhar for appearing in the examination on the bicycle, he said.We carried food and other eatables with us for sustaining ourselves in Dhar for two-three days. We started on Monday and after spending a few hours of the night at Manawar town, we reached Dhar on Tuesday morning just before the start of the exam, he said.The boy, Ashish, aged 15, said: “I am studying in Class 10 and I came here on cycle with my father for appearing in the examination.”Ashish appeared in the examination held at the Government Bhoj Girls School in Dhar under the Madhya Pradesh Government’s ‘Ruk Jana Nahin’ scheme, which allows students to clear those subjects which they were unable to pass in the first attempt.

19-08-2020|| Hyderabad||14-year-old girl rescued after 3 weeks in captivity, sexual assault at Andhra's Guntur||A 14-year-old girl was rescued on Wednesday after three weeks of being held hostage at an isolated place in Gunter, Andhra Pardesh. She was allegedly raped repeatedly by a home guard personnel and his accomplice.  The horrific incident came to light when the police traced the girl following a missing person report. About three weeks ago, someone acquainted to the girl lured her to an isolated place and raped her. As the girl was in a state of shock, she did not go back home. She feared telling her mother what had happened.      Instead, the teenager decided to go to her friend's house at a nearby village. But on her way, the home guard personnel—Ashok Chakravarthy—found her alone in the middle of the night. He offered her help by showing his ID card. Believing that the home guard was a policeman, she agreed to accompany him. But instead of helping her, the home guard and one of his friends—Druga Rao—took her to another place, locked her up, and sexually assaulted her for twenty days. The Tenali Police sent out teams to look for the girl after a missing complaint was filed by the family.  Inspector M Rajesh said that "the minor girl has been married off later year, but she continued to live her mother in Muttemsetti Palem village of Tenali Mandal". "The girl's husband lived in another town, whose neighbour, Karlapalem Kumar got acquainted with the girl. He lured her on the pretext of dropping her home on his motorcycle, but he took her to the fields, where he raped her before leaving her alone". Based on the missing person report the Tenali Police tracked the girl to a confinement place in Gunter town. The police have arrested all the three men who had sexually assaulted the minor girl. The girl's mother took several days to file a missing person's report as the girl used to go away for brief durations without informing her. However, due to the long absence, the mother got worried and approached the police. Announcing the recovery of the girl, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Srilakshmi said the arrests were made on August 17 and August 18, and based on the confessions the girl was found. The accused have been booked under relevant sections of the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act, as well as Section 366 (abduction) and Section 376 (2)(a) (being a police officer commits rape).  He said that the Women Development and Child Welfare Department has been intimated about the child marriage, but a case is yet to be registered against the girl’s mother since the father is already deceased.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/14-year-old-girl-rescued-after-3-weeks-in-captivity-sexual-assault-at-andhras-guntur-128411
19-08-2020||New Delhi||All you need to know about National Recruitment Agency||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday decided to set up a National Recruitment Agency (NRA), a multi-agency body, for conducting a Common Eligibility Test (CET) to screen or shortlist candidates for the Group B and C (non-technical) posts.The NRA will have representatives of Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Finance/Department of Financial Services, the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS), according to an official statement.Why NRA?At present, candidates seeking government jobs have to appear for separate examinations conducted by multiple recruiting agencies for various posts, for which similar eligibility conditions have been prescribed.Candidates have to pay fee to multiple recruiting agencies and also have to travel long distances for appearing in various exams. These multiple recruitment examinations are a burden on the candidates, as also on the respective recruitment agencies, involving avoidable/repetitive expenditure, law and order/security related issues and venue related problems.On an average, 2.5 crore to 3 crore candidates appear in each of these examinations.A CET would enable these candidates to appear once and apply to any or all of these recruitment agencies for the higher level of examination. This would indeed be a boon to all the candidates.It is envisioned that the NRA would be a specialist body bringing state-of-the-art technology and best practices to the field of central government recruitment.Here are the salient features of the NRA and CET:Major relief to poor candidatesPresently, the candidates have to appear in multiple examinations conducted by multiple agencies. Apart from the  examination fees, candidates have to incur additional expenses for travel, boarding, lodging and other such activities. A single examination would reduce the financial burden on candidates to a large extent.Women candidates to benefit Women candidates especially from rural areas face constraints in appearing in multiple examinations as they have to arrange for transportation and places to stay when exam centres are far away. They sometimes also have to find suitable persons to accompany them to these centres that are located far away. The location of test centres in every district would greatly benefit candidates from rural areas in general and women candidates in particular.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-you-need-to-know-about-national-recruitment-agency-128410

I have full confidence in the Navy’s preparedness to meet any challenge through a proactive response in deploying its ships and aircraft,” the defence minister tweeted.All possible security challenges that the country may face including from China in the Indian Ocean Region were discussed at the conclave, people familiar with the issue said.“The Indian Navy has effectively carried out mission-based deployment to protect maritime interests by deploying naval ships and aircraft at major and sensitive locations,” Singh said, adding it has helped to increase maritime domain awareness and in extending rapid humanitarian aid and relief.The Indian Navy started rolling out its mission-based plan in June 2017 that involved deploying mission-ready ships and aircraft along critical sea lanes of communications with an aim to effectively counter China’s growing presence in the Indian Ocean region.Singh said it is inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of SAGAR (Security And Growth for All in the Region).He also highlighted the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff and Department of Military Affairs/MoD (DMA) as major milestones in bringing more synergy among the three services, especially in training, procurement and jointness in operations.The defence minister said that accepting the challenges arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic in the current financial year, the Indian Navy has continued to make progress in operational, administrative and modernisation efforts.   Notwithstanding these fiscal challenges, the government has invoked the Emergency Powers to meet the emergent requirements of the services, he added.    The key focus of the conclave included reviewing the Indian Navy’s operational readiness as well as issues relating to India’s security interests in the Indo-Pacific, officials said.The Indian Ocean, considered the backyard of the Indian Navy, is critical to the country’s strategic interests. Over the years, the region has witnessed an increasing Chinese presence.China has constructed the deep-sea Gwadar Port in southern Pakistan and a naval base in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa.In the last few weeks, the Navy has significantly expanded its deployment in the Indian Ocean Region, positioning a plethora of warships and submarines following the Galwan Valley clash with Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed.The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.In his address to the naval commanders, the defence minister also congratulated the Navy for carrying out the ‘Operation Samudra Setu’ under which around 4,000 Indians were evacuated from a number of countries including Iran and Maldives due to the coronavirus pandemic.“I congratulate the @indiannavy on the conduct of the biggest ever evacuation operation ‘Operation Samudra Setu’, which has contributed extensively to the national interest,” the defence minister said in another tweet.Singh also complimented the Navy for being at the “forefront” of the indigenisation process for defence platforms.At the conference, the naval commanders would also deliberate on ensuring tri-services synergy as well as functional reorganisation within the Navy to improve efficiency, the Navy said in a statement on Tuesday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/confident-of-navys-preparations-for-proactive-response-to-any-security-challenge-rajnath-128394

It is much below the expectations of farmers and government promise of doubling of farmers’ income," said Panwar.Sugarcane producing states such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana fix their own sugarcane price called state advisory prices (SAPs), which are usually higher than the FRP. The government estimates the country’s total sugar production to be 28-29 million tonnes in the current year ending next month, compared to 33.1 million tonnes during 2018-19 due to a sharp fall in acreage in Maharashtra and Karnataka.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-approves-increase-in-sugarcane-frp-by-rs-10-to-rs-285-per-quintal-for-2020-21-128385

19-08-2020||New Delhi||Contempt case against Prashant Bhushan should be heard by constitution bench: Former SC judge Kurian Joseph||Former Supreme Court judge Justice Kurian Joseph Wednesday came out in support of lawyer Prashant Bhushan and said contempt cases against him raised substantial questions of law that should be heard by a constitution bench. Justice Joseph also said that a person convicted by the top court in a suo-motu case should get an opportunity for an intra-court appeal.“Under Article 145 (3) of the Constitution of India, there shall be a quorum of minimum five Judges for deciding any case involving substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution. In both the suo motu contempt cases, in view of the substantial questions of law on the interpretation of the Constitution of India and having serious repercussions on the fundamental rights, the matters require to be heard by a Constitution Bench,” Joseph said in a statement.The former judge said a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court has decided to hear a few serious questions on the scope and extent of the contempt of Court.         “Certainly, there are graver issues, involving substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution of India.  For example, whether a person convicted by the Supreme Court of India in a suo motu case should get an opportunity for an intra-court appeal since in all other situations of conviction in criminal matters, the convicted person is entitled to have a second opportunity by way of an appeal,” he said.Joseph said under Section 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, an intra-court appeal is provided where the order is passed by the single Judge of the High Court and in case it is by the Division Bench, appeal lies to the Supreme Court.“This safeguard is provided probably to avoid even the remotest possibility of miscarriage of justice. Should there not be such a safeguard in the other Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court of India also, when there is a conviction in a suo-motu criminal contempt case?”“Fiat justitia ruat caelum (let justice be done though the heavens fall) is the fundamental basis of administration of justice by courts. But, if justice is not done or if there is miscarriage of justice, heavens will certainly fall. The Supreme Court of India should not let it happen,” he said.Referring to the contempt proceedings against Justice CS Karnan (then sitting high court judge), Justice Joseph said it was the collective wisdom of the full court of the Supreme Court that the matter should be heard at least by a Bench consisting of the seven of the court’s most senior judges.    “The present contempt cases are not cases involving just one or two individuals; but larger issues pertaining to the concept and jurisprudence of the Country regarding justice itself,” Justice Joseph, who retired on November 29, 2019, said.The former judge said important cases like these need to be heard elaborately in a physical hearing where only there is scope for a broader discussion and wider participation.“Men may come and men may go, but the Supreme Court of India should remain forever as the court of supreme justice,” he said.The apex court is seized of two contempt cases against Bhushan.The apex court in November 2009, had issued a contempt notice to Bhushan and journalist Tarun Tejpal for allegedly casting aspersions on some sitting and former top court judges in an interview to a news magazine. Tejpal was the editor of the magazine.In the second case, the apex court on August 14 had held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for his two derogatory tweets against the judiciary saying they cannot be said to be a fair criticism of the functioning of the judiciary made in the public interest.Later, the apex court said it would consider certain larger questions in the 2009 contempt case against Bhushan and Tejpal as the issue before it has wide ramifications.

"The applicant undertakes to file the review within 30 days from the date of judgment, as he is entitled under the law," he submitted.He requested the top court to defer Thursday's hearing on the sentence "in the interests of justice pending consideration of the review application that petitioner intends to file within the limitation period..."Alternatively, he said, "If this Hon’ble Court proceeds with the hearing on sentence and imposes any sentence, the same may be directed to be stayed till the remedy of review is exhausted by the applicant," Bhushan submitted.He submitted that "human judgement is not infallible. Despite all the provisions ensuring a fair trial and a just decision, mistakes are possible and errors cannot be ruled out".Bhushan said, "The fact that there is no appeal against an order of this Hon’ble Court makes it doubly necessary that it takes the utmost precaution to ensure that justice is not only done but is seen to be done."The Supreme Court had on August 14 held him guilty of contempt of court for his tweets against Chief Justice of India SA Bobde and last four CJIs, saying, “Such an attack which tends to create disaffection and disrespect for the authority of this court cannot be ignored.”A three-judge Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra had said, “The scurrilous/malicious attacks by the alleged contemnor No. 1 (Bhushan) are not only against one or two judges but the entire Supreme Court in its functioning of the last six years. Such an attack which tends to create disaffection and disrespect for the authority of this court cannot be ignored.”It said, “If an attack is made to shake the confidence that the public at large has in the institution of judiciary, such an attack has to be dealt with firmly…If such an attack is not dealt with, with requisite degree of firmness, it may affect the national honour and prestige in the comity of nations.”The Bench – which also included Justice BR Gavai and Justice Krishna Murari - had fixed August 20 to hear arguments on the sentence. The maximum sentence prescribed under Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, is six-month imprisonment with a fine of Rs 2,000.He is also facing criminal contempt proceedings in an 11-year-old case in which he had expressed regret but refused to apologise.Describing “fearless and impartial courts of justice” as the bulwark of a healthy democracy”, the top court had said, “The confidence in them cannot be permitted to be impaired by malicious attacks upon them.”Recently Bhushan had tweeted, "CJI rides a 50 Lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP leader at Raj Bhavan Nagpur, without a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC in Lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access Justice!"In another tweet on June 27, he had said, “When historians in future look back at the last 6 years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the Supreme Court in this destruction, & more particularly the role of the last 4 CJIs.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prashant-bhushan-urges-sc-to-defer-aug-20-hearing-on-sentence-in-contempt-of-court-128362

Lower formations do not have the power to reject such appeals.Under rules, an individual who is cashiered, dismissed or removed from service is not eligible for pension or gratuity in respect of all previous service. However, in exceptional cases, the competent authority, on submission of an appeal to that effect by the individual, may at its discretion sanction pension, gratuity or both at a rate not exceeding that which would be otherwise admissible to him on retirement or discharge. Such appeals are also required to be filed within two years from the date of cashiering, dismissal or removal from service.An order from the Ministry of Defence received by various establishments this month states that once such appeals are filed these are to be decided only at the level of Adjutant General at Army Headquarters, Air Officer Personnel at Air Headquarters and Chief of Personnel at Naval Headquarters or Secretary, Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare if filed after two years.The order states a review of such cases revealed that due to lack of awareness and knowledge about these provisions at the level of lower formations, these appeals are rejected at subordinate levels and reach Service HQ or DESW after many years of filing. In many cases, such appeals are filed at the instance of the Armed Forces Tribunal when the concerned individual serviceman files a petition for grant of pension and gratuity.The objective behind the provision for mercy appeal is to provide relief to the individual and his family in exceptional situations on compassionate grounds and if the process itself gets inordinately delayed, the very objective behind such provision gets defeated, the orders states.The ministry has directed that such appeals may be immediately forwarded by the lower formations through there relevant echelons for disposal at the level of Service HQs of to the DESW is filed after a lapse of two years from the date of cashiering or dismissal.The ministry also observed that though cashiered or dismissed individuals are not entitled to pension or gratuity, they tend to make an application for claiming the same. Such applications should be rejected as per the provisions of the Pension Regulations and the individuals should be advised about the provisions of the mercy appeal and the relevant documents required in support of their appeal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lower-formations-cannot-reject-mercy-appeals-for-pension-in-cases-of-cashiering-or-dismissal-mod-128359

Once the girls applied, female accomplices of Sunny Verma allegedly suggested submitting their nude pictures in order to get better ranking in the contest."After receiving the nude pictures and sometime even before, Sunny used to get in touch with the girls to push them for completely nude pictures and videos. He also asked as well as threatened them to submit to his sexual desires if they were interested in modelling as a career or wish to win the contest," the complaint said.The complaint further claimed that once Sunny used to establish physical relationship with the girls, he used to blackmail them for regular sexual favours and many girls from across the country have suffered sexual and mental assault at the hands of Sunny and his accomplices.In her complaint, Bhayana said: "I have now received several letters, texts and audio clips from several girls as proof of this modus operandi of Sunny Verma and IMG. The girls have written details of sexual harassment under the condition that their names and identity will not be revealed. They have also shared their chat screenshots and audio call record with Sunny Verma.

The local police sounded an alert asking people to stay indoors and avoid non-urgent travel.Within half an hour of rain, the entire city was waterlogged. People took to social media, posting pictures and seeking aid from the authorities. However, their pleas went unanswered for many hours.The worst affected areas were the Expressway – including all the connected underpasses, Narsinghpur, DLF Phase 3, Bheem Nagar, Model Town, Jyoti Park, Sectors 9, 10, 10A, Kadipur, Sector 15, Patel Nagar, Nathupur, Sushant Lok, Hero Honda Chowk, IFFCO Chowk, MT Chowk, Manesar and Golf Course road.The picture of a car submerged in water on Gold Course road became the face of the 2020 monsoons in Gurugram."We are facing flash floods almost every monsoon. Since morning, the entire staff and residents of the society are struggling to keep the water out. We have been shutting the main gate, using the furniture and even clothes...We have called the MCG a hundred times, but no response," said Vandana Taneja, a resident of Belvedere Park, DLF Phase 3. The residents of the Sushant Lok Phase 1 area, which was last flooded in 2010, saw heavy floods. They blamed the MCG for the situation, saying they had removed check dams erected in 2010. "Last year, the MCG took over and they removed them (check dams) calling them speed breakers. This has resulted in pushing the water back," said Gurusharan Dhanjal, a resident."The electricity supply has been snapped and our parking lot is flooded, so no repair works. We cannot move out and are without electricity for the last seven hours,” said Chanderjeet Yadav, a resident of Meghdoot Apartment, Sector10 A.The waterlogged roads affected the traffic movement with average waiting time in a jam varying between 20 minutes and one hour across the Expressway, Rajeev Chowk and Hero Honda Flyover. The Gurugram Police though emerged as a hero yet again as over 2,000 cops with rolled-up pants and shirts took to roads not just directing or diverting traffic but also repairing vehicles that broke down in the floods."We had a plan ready and it has been executed to perfection by the force. There was congestion but we managed to keep things moving," said Police Commissioner KK Rao.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/heavy-rain-throws-life-out-of-gear-in-delhi-ncr-128342

This has also led to the declining Case Fatality Rate, which stands at a new low of 1.91% today,” said the Health Ministry.The record-high recoveries have ensured, that the actual caseload of the country viz. the active cases have reduced, and currently, comprises less than one fourth (only 24.45%) of total positive cases.The higher number of recoveries and the declining fatality rate has shown that India's graded strategy has worked.India has posted 13,61,356 more recoveries than the active cases (6,76,514).This, the government said, as a result of graded, pre-emptive and proactive response and management strategy for COVID-19 in the country and the push to test track and treat plan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-60-091-cases-in-24-hours-india-crosses-2-million-covid-recoveries-128341

19-08-2020||New Delhi||Non-Gandhi should be appointed Congress president, says book quoting Priyanka Gandhi Vadra||Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has endorsed her brother Rahul Gandhi’s stand on a non-Gandhi president for the Congress, saying there are plenty of people capable of leading the party, remarks that were carried in a new book which according to the Congress were made in July last year in a different context.In the book ‘India Tomorrow: Conversations with the Next Generation of Political Leaders’, she is quoted as saying that Rahul was her leader and will always be.Though the book was released recently by Oxford University Press, the Congress said Priyanka’s interview was conducted after Rahul stepped down as party president taking responsibility for the 2019 Lok Sabha poll drubbing.Sonia Gandhi is the interim president of the party and there has been a growing demand in the Congress for return of Rahul as chief.In the book, which features interviews with young leaders in India, Priyanka told authors Pradeep Chhibber and Harsh Shah, “He (Rahul Gandhi) has said that none of us should be the president of the party and I am in full agreement with him. I think that the party should find its own path also”.       Meanwhile, the Congress said the remarks were a year old and made on July 1, 2019, by Priyanka and its context today is to take on the vicious attack on India’s polity by the current dispensation and fight it fearlessly.Party chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said millions of Congress workers and leaders have seen that Rahul has led the fight tirelessly, undaunted by setbacks.“It is this fearlessness and uncompromising courage that the Congress requires, workers respect and nation needs,” he said.In her conversation, Priyanka said the presence of Gandhis in the party would impede the functioning of a non-family president only if her family wanted things to be that way.“I think it would only undermine somebody if that was the way we wanted to be. But if we wanted to step back and give other people the freedom to take decisions and do anything, I don’t see why there should be an encumbrance,” she said to a question on Gandhi family’s presence in the party and its potential to undermine a non family chief.Noting that none in her family look at things like that, Priyanka said if there were to be another party president, “He would be my boss. If he tells me tomorrow that he doesn’t want me in Uttar Pradesh but wants me to be in Andaman and Nicobar, then I would jolly well go to Andaman and Nicobar”. “It depends on me---I could say ‘sorry I don’t care, I’m going to do what I want. But, I don’t think that any of us have that attitude. I think that we actually believe in the democratisation of our party,” she added.On her and Rahul’s role going forward, Priyanka is quoted as saying: “If we could enable that process of actually empowering other young people to participate and become leaders, then we would have achieved something. I see that as my role”.She said Rahul in his resignation letter post the 2019 Lok Sabha polls had said that he thinks he should take responsibility for the last election.Asked if she could assume leadership role in the Congress, Priyanka said her brother is her leader and will always be.“Firstly, I would like to say that, to me, my brother is my leader and he will always be. Secondly, I see hundreds of people in UP and in different parts of the country who are very well equipped to fight the BJP. There are young and good enough leaders. I cannot tell the future, I do not know what is going to happen in the future. But, I think there are plenty of people who are capable to lead the party as well,” she said.Praising Rahul, Priyanka said her brother had done a lot of work to democratise the party and had conducted elections in the Youth Congress and National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) because he wanted to facilitate new and younger talent in the party.“In fact, oddly enough, he was attacked from within his party for it,” she said.To a query on whether she would give a shot at leadership if Rahul decides to stay away, Priyanka said she has her work cut out in Uttar Pradesh where she has her hands full.“It is an immense task, if we do manage to revive the party in UP, it will actually do a lot to the party in the rest of the country as well. It’s a huge task,” she said.“I am at ground zero, and it is going to take a lot of time, a lot of focus, and frankly, I am quite happy doing it. I really do believe that if we do manage to build there it will be a huge contribution to the party. So, I feel that I would like to focus there and put my head down and work hard there,” she added.On whether the Congress has lost its independent ideological vision that once distinguished it from other regional parties and what needed to be done to present an alternative vision for India, the Congress general secretary said the party has a clear ideology but that ideology has not been communicated with the same clarity to the public in a long time.“I think part of that issue is perhaps the internal shift of some of the leaders of the Congress party towards the end of the last government where the ideological stances were diluted to some extent,” she said, adding that there was not much clarity as there might have been earlier.Priyanka noted that there are different energies in the Congress party which has leaders who lean to the right, to the Left and those who are more towards the centre.“It is not like the BJP where everything is uniform thought. There is space in the Congress party for different kinds of thinking, and it all comes together and everybody discusses and moves forward. I think where we might have failed is in the public articulation of that ideology,” she noted.Asked how she would like her to be remembered once she retires, she said “I am anti-legacy. I just do not believe in it”.         Priyanka noted that she is in politics not because she has a legacy to preserve but because she believes that she better not ignore the privileges she has and do something.“I think kids should not have a legacy. We should not leave them with a legacy of good or legacy of bad. They should be free. And therefore, I frankly need not be remembered,” she said.

19-08-2020||Satya Prakash||SC orders CBI probe into unnatural death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput||Tribune News Service  New Delhi, August 19The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a CBI probe into the unnatural death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput saying, “A fair, competent and impartial investigation is the need of the hour.”“When truth meets sunshine, justice will not prevail on the living alone but after Life’s fitful fever, now the departed will also sleep well. Satyameva Jayate,” a Bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy said, rejecting Sushant’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty’s plea for transfer of an FIR lodged in Patna against her by the deceased actor’s father to Mumbai.“For the petitioner (Rhea) too, it will be the desired justice as she herself called for a CBI investigation. The dissemination of the real facts through unbiased investigation would certainly result in justice for the innocents, who might be the target of a vilification campaign.“Equally importantly, when integrity and credibility of the investigation is discernible, the trust, faith and confidence of the common man in the judicial process will resonate,” the top court said.Rhea – who was in a live-in relationship with Sushant (34) had left his place on June 8 and shifted to her own residence in Mumbai, barely six days before he was found hanging at his Bandra house under mysterious circumstances on June 14. Mumbai Police said it was a suicide and that he was suffering from depression.When truth meets sunshine, justice will not prevail on the living alone but after Life’s fitful fever, now the departed will also sleep well. Satyameva Jayate.Supreme CourtWhile giving approval for the ongoing CBI investigation, the top court said, “If any other case is registered on the death of the actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the surrounding circumstances of his unnatural death, the CBI is directed to investigate the new case as well.”It said, “In the event a new case is registered at Mumbai on the same issue, in the fitness of things, it would be appropriate if the latter case too gets investigated by the same agency, on the strength of this Court’s order.”The top court held that registration of an FIR at Patna in Sushant’s case by his father KK Singh and its subsequent transfer to CBI at the behest of the Bihar government was right.“It must be held that the Patna police committed no illegality in registering the complaint. Looking at the nature of the allegations in the complaint which also relate to misappropriation and breach of trust, the exercise of jurisdiction by the Bihar Police appears to be in order.“At the stage of investigation, they were not required to transfer the FIR to Mumbai police. For the same reason, the Bihar government was competent to give consent for entrustment of investigation to the CBI and as such the ongoing investigation by the CBI is held to be lawful,” the court said.On Wednesday, Sushant’s father issued a statement declaring himself to be Sushant’s legal heir and took exception to some lawyers issuing statements to the media claiming to have been authorised by his late son. He said he has authorised only advocate Varun Singh and senior advocate Vikas Singh to speak on his behalf.As a single judge, Justice Roy chose to exercise extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, saying, it was required in the peculiar circumstances in the case and “to ensure public confidence in the investigation and to do complete justice in the matter”.Describing Sushant as “a talented actor in the Mumbai film world” who “died well before his full potential could be realised”, the court noted that his family, friends and admirers were keenly awaiting the outcome of the investigation so that all the speculations floating around could be put to rest. The credibility of the investigation and the investigating authority, must be protected, it added.“Therefore a fair, competent and impartial investigation is the need of the hour. The expected outcome then would be a measure of justice for the complainant, who lost his only son,” Justice Roy said.The court gave a clean chit to Mumbai Police, saying “The records of the case produced before this Court, does not prima facie suggest any wrongdoing by the Mumbai Police.” However, it said, “Their obstruction to the Bihar police team at Mumbai could have been avoided since it gave rise to suspicion on the bona fide of their inquiry.”Noting that because of “acrimonious allegations of political interference” levelled by Maharashtra and Bihar governments against each other, the legitimacy of the investigation has come under a cloud, the top court said, “Accusing fingers are being pointed and people have taken the liberty to put out their own conjectures and theories.“Such comments, responsible or otherwise, have led to speculative public discourse, which have hogged media limelight. These developments unfortunately have the propensity to delay and misdirect the investigation. In such a situation, there is reasonable apprehension of truth being a casualty and justice becoming a victim,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-orders-cbi-probe-into-unnatural-death-of-actor-sushant-singh-rajput-128327

The Karakoram pass, Depsang plains and the airfield at Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) are part of the SSN.At present, these sensitive places can be accessed through the 255-km-long Darbuk-Shyok-DBO (DSDBO) road, which at several points is close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and thus exposed to military risk. From Ladakh’s Shyok village to Murgo (in Depsang), covering 127 km, the DSDBO road runs close to the LAC. The Galwan valley is on the same stretch. A 23-km tract of the DSDBO road from Darbuk to Shyok and 105-km stretch from Murgo to the DBO is relatively away from the LAC.The new road alignment starts from Sasoma, near the base of Siachen Glacier, and goes eastwards across the 17,800-foot-high Saser La and then descends at Gapsam near Murgo in Depsang plains. Here, the road will join the existing DSDBO road. As of now a jeepable mud track has been created from Sasoma to Saser La. Eastwards from Saser La to Saser Brangsa (an ancient camping site with no population), the 27-km track allows just walking. Beyond that till Murgo, a jeepable track is being laid out. The entire alignment, so far, is useable only during summer months, sources told The Tribune. New Delhi is taking a call on blacktopping the entire stretch.An all-weather road exists between Leh and Sasoma. The route eastwards of Sasoma will allow an alternative axis to the SSN in case the DSDBO road is targeted.The route is not new, it has been a mule track for centuries. Janet Rizvi in her book “Trans Himalayan Caravans- Merchant Princes and Peasant Traders in Ladakh”, published in 1999, says trade caravans were a regular between Ladakh and Kashgar till 1937. She describes the use of the route across Saser La.The BRO, a unit under the Ministry of Defence, has carved out the new track under trying circumstances as this is one of rugged parts of the tree-less Karakoram mountains. Temperature dips to -50°C during winter and hovers around 12°C in peak summer.

19-08-2020||New Delhi||Gaming firm wins IPL title rights, China link remains||Dream11, a gaming platform, has won the title sponsorship rights for IPL 2020 with the highest bid, Rs 222 crore, among three prospective sponsors.Dream11 beat bids from educational platforms Byju’s (Rs 201 crore) and Unacademy (Rs 170 crore) to win the IPL’s title rights for roughly four-and-a-half months, from August 18 to December 31, 2020. The tournament, originally scheduled to be played in India in March-May, had to be postponed due to the pandemic and will be played in three UAE cities between September 19 and November 10.The IPL had to look for a new title sponsor after severing its ties with Vivo, a Chinese smartphone maker, due to adverse public opinion after the recent Galwan valley clash.The IPL’s deal with Dream11 is worth around half of that with Vivo — the latter’s five-year sponsorship was worth Rs 2,199 crore, around Rs 440 crore annually.Interestingly, while the deal with Vivo had to be called off after strong protests due to its Chinese origin, Dream11 too has a Chinese connection — two years ago, Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent reportedly bought a majority stake in Dream11. However, currently Tencent’s stake in Dream11 is less than 10%. An Indian cricket board (BCCI) official confirmed this. “Only a single-digit percentage minority stake is held by Tencent,” the official said.However, another controversy hovers over Dream11 — last month, BCCI’s Anti-Corruption Unit sought an inquiry against it over its alleged links with a fake T20 league played at a village near Mohali. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gaming-firm-wins-ipl-title-rights-china-link-remains-128096

The Foreign Secretary is likely to meet Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen and his counterpart Masud Bin Momen.The Ministry of External Affairs, however, without giving details, said the visit was meant to “discuss and take forward cooperation on matters of mutual interest.”Bangladesh media claims the trip follows Bangladesh’s announcement that it will soon get a $1 billion loan from China for the Teesta river project. PM Narendra Modi had promised a deal on Teesta waters during his Dhaka visit five years back but was unable to deliver on it. The UPA, too, had almost finalised the Teesta deal but it was then torpedoed by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.India has named Vikram Doraiswami to succeed Riva Ganguly Das as the India’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh who will take over at the Ministry of External Affairs as Secretary (East). Shringla is also expected to discuss programmes chalked out to celebrate 50 years of Liberation struggle this year.First overseas visit Post lockdownThis is Foreign Secretary Harsh V Shringla’s first overseas visit after the lockdown.
