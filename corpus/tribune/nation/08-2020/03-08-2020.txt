On July 28 the state government had thrice altered the dates.The state government had on July 28 withdrawn the complete lockdown on August 2 and 9 and pared down the number of lockdown days from nine to seven.The step had then been taken after receiving requests from different communities since the dates coincided with festivals, officials had said.This time too requests and appeals have been received from different quarters to relax the lockdown on certain dates as they are coinciding with some festivals and days marked for the observance of local customs.The order issued by state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said “We have taken this decision to partially modify the order keeping in view of the requests received and in due consideration of the public sentiment”.In the fresh order, the state government has withdrawn lockdowns on Sundays as proposed by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.The change of lockdown dates elicited sharp reactions from the opposition parties which criticised the ruling TMC, alleging that it is completely clueless and has failed to manage the crisis arising out of COVID-19.“The state government has not only failed but is also clueless about the way forward. The state government could change the dates, but it didn’t yield to our request to change the date of August 5 the day of bhoomi pujan at Ayodhya for the construction of the Ram Mandir,” BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said.Taking a swipe at the West Bengal government for deliberately selecting August 5 for the lockdown, the state BJP on Monday asked the state government to shift the date as it did for the Eid festival.CPI(M) legislature party leader Sujan Chakraborty said the chief minister and her government had turned the idea of the lockdown into a “farce”.“We don’t know whether the TMC government is running an administration or a circus,” he said.West Bengal has so far reported 78,232 cases of COVID-19. There are 1,234 containment zones in the state at present. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-dates-changed-in-wb-for-the-fourth-time-tmc-govt-draws-opposition-ire-121668

03-08-2020||Kolkata||IIT-Kharagpur researchers awarded for generating power from wet clothes||A group of researchers from IIT Kharagpur has been conferred the ‘Gandhian Young Technological  Innovation Awards 2020’ for developing a mechanism for generating electricity from wet clothes left under sunlight to dry, a spokesperson of the institute said on Monday.Another team from the institute was separately granted the same award for addressing the problem of energy conservation and thermal management in wearable and flexible electronic devices.Congratulating the researchers, IIT Kharagpur Director Prof Virendra Tewari said: “We still have sectors which need sourcing and efficient management of clean energy to meet our augmented power requirements, even in the remote areas”.The ‘Gandhian Young Technological Innovation (GYTI) Awards’ was instituted by the Society for Research and Initiatives for Sustainable Technologies and Institution (SRISTI), a voluntary organization.SRISTI said that GYTI Award celebrates the spirit of student innovation in all the fields of engineering, science, technology and design through extremely affordable/frugal solution or the ones pushing the technological edge.The spokesperson said that Prof Suman Chakraborty, Prof Partha Saha and Dr Aditya Bandopadhyay from the Department of Mechanical Engineering have been awarded for their work - “Electrical power generation from wet textile”.Prof Sunando Dasgupta and his team from the Department of Chemical Engineering have also been awarded for their work--- ‘Smart, flexible, and multi-functional thermal and energy management systems for next-generation electronic devices’.The novelty of the first innovation, the nano- electricity generator, is in its frugal means instead of energy harvesting from complex resources, the spokesperson said.The device has been tested in a remote village where around 50 wet clothes were left for drying by washermen. These clothes were connected to a commercial supercapacitor which discharged electricity of around 10 volt. This stored energy is enough to glow a white LED bulb for more than an hour.“The clothes we wear are made from cellulose-based textile which has a network of nano-channels. Ions in saline water can move through this interlace fibrous nano-scale network by capillary action inducing an electric potential in the process,” explained the researchers from the department of mechanical engineering.The work has been published in Nano Letters, a high-impact journal in the field, and the innovation has been patented by them.The group led by Prof Sunando Dasgupta has been working in collaboration with Purdue University, USA, to address the problem of energy conservation and thermal management in wearable and flexible electronic devices, the spokesperson said.They achieved this by leveraging the unique properties of ‘smart materials’  materials that sense and react to environmental conditions or stimuli such as mechanical, chemical, electrical, or magnetic signals infused with graphene, a form of carbon.

When my son died on June 14, I requested them to take action against named persons. But nothing came of it even after 40 days. Left with no other option, I lodged a case at a police station here in Patna,” Singh said.Patna police swung into action immediately, Singh remarked appreciatively, and thanked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and state minister Sanjay Jha who came forward to “stand for the truth.Singh had, in his complaint on which an FIR was lodged on July 25, accused actress Rhea Chakraborty and her family members of abetting his sons suicide, besides defrauding him of his money and subjecting him to blackmail.His decision to go public on the matter for the first time comes in the backdrop of alleged non-cooperation of Mumbai police with its Patna counterpart.The city police, in their note, pointed to K K Singh releasing a statement about his family submitting the written complaint.“It must be clarified that no such written complaint was addressed to the Bandra Police on that day (February 25),” said the note.However, O P Singh, an IPS officer and brother-in-law of Rajput, had sent some WhatsApp messages to the then DCP Zone 9 regarding this matter, the Mumbai police said.The then DCP Zone 9 had called OP Singh and told him a written complaint was mandatory for any inquiry or action, they said in the note.However, O P Singh wanted the matter to be resolved informally, but the DCP had clearly told him this was not possible, the Mumbai police said.

03-08-2020||---||Prashant Bhushan questions SC for being a ‘mute spectator’ during Delhi riots||New Delhi, August 3Activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan has defended his controversial statements that led to the Supreme Court initiating contempt of court proceedings against him, saying power of contempt can’t be used to “stifle bona fide criticism from citizens”.A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra had on July 22 issued notice to Bhushan and Twitter for his tweets allegedly scandalising the judiciary. Two days later, it had also decided to resume hearing in another contempt of court case against pending since 2009. The two cases are listed for hearing on August 4 and 5.In an affidavit filed in response to the top court’s contempt notice, Bhushan questioned the top court for being a “mute spectator” during the recent Delhi riots.“When the Delhi riots were unleashed, with daily videos emerging of mobs tearing down and burning mosques, the police force systematically destroying public CCTVs, taking an active part in stone-throwing, massive firing and deaths, blockades of a hospital to prevent assistance to the severely wounded Muslims, etc., the Supreme Court remained a mute spectator while Delhi burnt,” Bhushan submitted.He stood by both his tweets cited by the court and refused to tender an apology for his comments even as he expressed regret for a factual mistake.“I admit that I did not notice that the bike was on a stand and therefore wearing a helmet was not required. I therefore regret that part of my tweet. However, I stand by the remaining part of what I have stated in my tweet,” Bhushan stated in his affidavit.Bhushan had on June 29 tweeted, “CJI rides a 50 Lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP leader at Raj Bhavan Nagpur, without a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC in Lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access Justice!”In another tweet, he had on June 27, said, “When historians in future look back at the last 6 years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the Supreme Court in this destruction, & more particularly the role of the last 4 CJIs.”He cited public statements of Supreme Court judge DY Chandrachud and former SC judges Deepak Gupta and Kurian Joseph on free speech and dissent to justify his critical remarks.Contending that the Supreme Court is an institution consisting of 31 Judges and its own long-standing and enduring traditions and practices, he said it cannot be equated with a Chief Justice, or even a succession of four CJIs.“To bona fide critique the actions of a CJI, or a succession of CJIs, cannot and does not scandalise the court, nor does it lower the authority of the court. To assume or suggest that ‘the CJI is the SC, and the SC is the CJI’ is to undermine the institution of the Supreme Court of India,” Bhushan submitted.“The power of contempt under Article 129 is to be utilised to aid in administration of justice and not to shut out voices that seek accountability from the Court for its errors of omissions and commissions which have been detailed hereinafter.“To curb constructive criticism from persons of knowledge and standing is not a ‘reasonable restriction’. Preventing citizens from demanding accountability and reforms and advocating for the same by generating public opinion is not a ‘reasonable restriction’.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prashant-bhushan-questions-sc-for-being-a-mute-spectator-during-delhi-riots-121651

It also maps themes with learning outcomes. The purpose of mapping is to facilitate teachers and parents to assess the progress in the learning of children and also to go beyond textbooks. All activities in the calendar are suggestive, not prescriptive,” the Education Minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/education-min-releases-ncert-8-week-alternative-academic-calendar-for-upper-primary-classes-121649

03-08-2020||New Delhi||Two-thirds of migrants have returned to cities or wish to do so: Survey||Nearly two-thirds of migrant workers who had left for their homes due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown have either returned to cities or wish to do so in the absence of skilled employment in villages, according to a new study that surveyed over 4,500 households.The collaborative study on “How is the Hinterland Unlocking” was carried out by the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (India), Action for Social Advancement, Grameen Sahara, i-Saksham, PRADAN, SAATHI-UP, SeSTA, Seva Mandir and Transform Rural India Foundation, VikasAnvesh Foundation and Sambodhi.The study is based on a rapid assessment survey of 4,835 households across 48 districts in 11 states carried out between June 24 and July 8.It found that 29 per cent of migrants who had left for their villages are now back in cities, while 45 per cent want to return.“Absence of skilled employment in villages is reflected in the fact that nearly two-thirds of the returned migrants have either migrated again or wish to do so,” it said.The study also found that migrants who returned were engaged mainly in labour work in villages, more than 80 per cent of them.“More than one-fourth of the migrant workers are still searching for work in villages,” it said.According to the survey, one in every four households is thinking of taking their child out of school (24 per cent).“Though distress is still considerable, structural changes are not yet visible and the health risk of COVID-19 in rural India is rising,” the survey warned.The study found that 43 per cent of households still reported a reduction in meals, while 55 per cent said they have reduced the meal items.However, it said, there was a “marked improvement” in food intake in comparison to the lockdown period.“... it is likely that grain availability through PDS (public distribution system) has helped households improve the consumption as well as reduce the need to buy from the market,” it noted.The study found that about 6 per cent of participants have mortgaged household items, while 15 per cent sold their livestock to cope with financial distress.With regard to sale of productive assets, the study found that 2 per cent of households have sold dry cattle and milk cattle each.About 2 per cent have mortgaged their land, while 1 per cent surveyed households have sold their land.About 10 per cent of households have borrowed money from their extended families, while 7 per cent borrowed from money lenders, the study found.The survey found that women in households where migrant members have returned shouldered more workload compared to other members.On government schemes, the study found that 71 per cent of households have LPG and 85 per cent of them got it through the ‘Ujjwala Yojana’.“Eighty per cent of Ujjwala beneficiaries have received free refills in the last month (June 2020), while 90 per cent households are eligible for PM-KISAN and 38 per cent of those have received the transfer of Rs 2,000,” it said.The study found that 35 per cent of households have postponed a ceremony and 13 per cent reduced the number of guests instead.Released at a webinar on Monday, the study was aimed at making an assessment of the effect of the lockdown on rural households.It focussed mainly on areas of reverse migration, food security, kharif season practices, drudgery faced by the women in households, and borrowing and asset sales. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-thirds-of-migrants-have-returned-to-cities-or-wish-to-do-so-survey-121643

Earlier, a magistrate’s court had rejected an application to include him in the charge sheet.The applicants then approached the additional district judge’s court, which issued directions that their complaint should also be probed.Taking up the issue, Gehlot said people will not accept a leader who is “involved in a scam”.“The CBI and the ED raids should be conducted on his premises,” he told reporters after arriving Jaipur from Jaisalmer, where Congress MLAs are holed up amid allegations of horse-trading.The Rajasthan Chief Minister also targeted Shekhawat for his alleged role in the “conspiracy” to topple his government. Gehlot called the Jodhpur MP as an over-ambitious leader, who “should have shown patience” but acted “hurriedly”.The Congress has accused Shekhawat of involvement in the “conspiracy” to topple the Ashok Gehlot government in the state on the basis of audio clips having a purported conversation regarding the alleged plot.Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot also rejected the claim of dissident Congress MLAs that their work was not being done.He told reporters that the MLAs earlier used to appreciate the government’s work and now they are complaining about it.He said people elected them but now they have “revolted”.Gehlot said it was unfortunate that the BJP was making repeated attempts to topple his government and that too amid the coronavirus pandemic.“The public is seeing this all. They understand what is going on. They (BJP) are trying to topple an elected government. They should stop this and let the state government function,” he said.The Chief Minister also reiterated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should hold a two-day video conference with Chief Ministers of states to review the COVID-19 situation.

03-08-2020||Islamabad||Pakistan court orders government to give India ‘another chance’ to appoint lawyer for Kulbhushan Jadhav||The Islamabad High Court on Monday ordered the Pakistan government to give “another chance” to India to appoint a lawyer for death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav, Pakistani media reports said.Jadhav, the 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. India approached the International Court of Justice against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.On Monday, a two-member bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb heard a petition filed by the Pakistan government to appoint a lawyer for Jadhav.In its petition, the Pakistan government asked the IHC to appoint a legal representative for Jadhav so that it can fulfil its responsibility to see to the implementation of the ICJ’s decision.It also claimed that Jadhav refused to file a review petition or an application to reconsider the verdict against him by the military court.“Now that the matter is in the high court, why not give India another chance,” Justice Minallah was quoted as saying by Geo News.The judge said that the Indian government or Jadhav may reconsider their decision pertaining to the review petition.“India and Kulbhushan Jadhav should once again be extended an offer to appoint a legal representative” for the death row prisoner, he added.Responding to the judge’s remarks, Pakistan’s Attorney General Khalid Javed Khan said an ordinance was issued to give an opportunity to India and Jadhav to file a review petition against the sentence.“We will contact India again through the Foreign Office,” he said.The hearing was subsequently adjourned till September 3.The Pakistan government filed the review petition in the IHC on July 22.However, the main parties, including the government of India, were not consulted ahead of the filing of the application by the Ministry of Law and Justice under an ordinance which was enacted on May 20.Under the ‘International Court of Justice Review and Reconsideration Ordinance 2020’, which was enacted on May 20, a petition for the review of a military court’s decision can be made to Islamabad High Court through an application within 60 days of its promulgation.The ordinance was approved by the parliament last week.In New Delhi, External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava last month said Pakistan has once again exposed its “farcical” approach by denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence which is also in contravention of the ICJ verdict, and asserted that it will explore further options in the case.Srivastava said Pakistan has blocked all the avenues for an effective remedy available to India in the case, while noting that New Delhi has so far requested consular access to Jadhav for 12 times over the past one year.The MEA spokesperson said Pakistan is not only in violation of the judgment of ICJ, but also of its own ordinance.

03-08-2020||---||Withdraw 3 Capitals or dissolve Assembly: Chandrababu Naidu tells Andhra CM Jagan Reddy||Naveen S GarewalTribune News ServiceHyderabad, August 3Telugu Desam Party (TDP) National President and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu gave an ultimatum to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy to withdraw his “3 Capitals” decision within 48 hours or abolish the state legislative assembly to seek fresh public mandate on his decision for trifurcation.Naidu reminded Jagan Reddy that he and his party leaders had promised the people of Andhra in the 2019 election campaign that Amaravati would continue to be the only capital city and that it would be fully developed. After making that promise, the chief minister has no right to shift Amaravati Capital without the approval of the five crore people of the state, he said.Addressing a press conference Chandrababu Naidu dared the Andhra Chief Minister to seek a fresh mandate if he had courage and if he was fully confident of having total approval of the people for his “3 Capitals” plan.“If the people vote for and bring the YSRCP back to power in the re-election, then the TDP would humbly accept their mandate and it would not raise its dissenting voice again against the decision. If the CM does not come out with a proper response, the TDP along with the other Opposition parties would intensify their agitation not just through legal battles but also make the chief minister a culprit in the people’s court,” he said.The TDP chief listed out how the YSRCP leaders made the innocent voters of Andhra believe that the idea to make Amaravati the state’s capital would not be destroyed even if Jagan Reddy was made the chief minister in 2019.“But, after coming to power, the CM backstabbed and betrayed all the 5 crore people of the state by going ahead with his capital shifting without discussing or taking prior approval of the people. Jagan Reddy himself repeatedly uttered the election slogan that he would never break his promises and that he would worship his party manifesto like the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita and the Quran. Having sworn on the holy books, the Chief Minister was now relentlessly breaking his promises without any conscience,” he said.Naidu recalled how YSRCP’s 2019 Election Manifesto Committee Chairman Ummareddy Venkateswarlu repeatedly assured the people at that time that their party would continue Andhra Capital in Amaravati alone and it would be developed into a good and well-equipped city. Incidentally, Ummareddy Venkateswarlu hails from the Guntur, the district where Amaravati is located. YSRCP Mylavaram MLA Vasanta Krishna Prasad went to the extent of taking a vow that he would resign if Amaravati was discontinued as a permanent capital. Krishna Prasad hails from Krishna district, which is close to Amaravati.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/withdraw-3-capitals-or-dissolve-assembly-chandrababu-naidu-tells-andhra-cm-jagan-reddy-121638

The trend is the result of the government’s continued crackdown on them and seizing their bank accounts and attaching assets allegedly amassed through terror funds.”The officials said after the arrest of two main separatist leaders — Yasin Malik of the JKLF for his alleged involvement in a 1990 case of gunning down IAF personnel, and Shahbir Shah of the JKDFP in a 2007 money laundering case — there has been hardly any bandh call during the last one year.The sale of medical seats in Pakistan by separatist leaders also came to the fore during last year, the officials said, adding that it left the public at large disgruntled.Further giving the statistics of the declining trend of violence, the officials said there were 532 incidents of stone-pelting in 2018, 389 in 2019 and 102 in 2020. The incidents of stone-pelting were down by 27 per cent in 2019 in comparison to 2018 and 73 per cent in 2020, they added.“A total of 583 militants were arrested under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in 2018, 849 in 2019 and 444 in 2020,” the Ministry said, adding: “58 Hurriyat leaders were also detained in 2018, 70 in 2019 and six in 2020 while 29 activists of the banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) were detained in 2019 and eight in 2020.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/42-pc-decline-in-locals-joining-terror-outfits-in-jk-since-august-5-last-year-mha-121634

Later, it was extended until November 24.Scheduled domestic passenger services resumed on May 25 after nearly two months of suspension to combat the coronavirus outbreak. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23.Along with the limits on airfares, the government had asked the airlines to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights. On June 26, the cap was increased to 45 per cent.After Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced on May 21 that there would be limits on airfares till August 24, the DGCA had issued an order with more details.The regulator had said there would be seven bands of ticket pricing with lower and upper fare limits based on flight duration.The first such band consists of flights that are of less than 40 minutes duration. The lower and the upper fare limits for the first band is Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000, respectively.The subsequent bands are for flights with durations of 40 to 60 minutes, 60 to 90 minutes, 90 to 120 minutes, 120 to 150 minutes, 150 to 180 minutes and 180 to 210 minutes.The lower and upper limits for these bands are: Rs 2,500 to Rs 7,500; Rs 3,000 to Rs 9,000; Rs 3,500 to Rs 10,000; Rs 4,500 to Rs 13,000; Rs 5,500 to Rs 15,700 and Rs 6,500 to Rs 18,600, respectively, the DGCA said.The regulator had made it clear that each airline would sell at least 40 per cent of its tickets on a flight at prices less than the midpoint between the lower limit and upper limit.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic.All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and firings of employees in order to conserve cash.The occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around just 50 to 60 per cent since May 25.

Three COVID-19 patients in BC Colony, Jarjapupeta in Vizianagaram District were seen taken to the hospital in a “Garbage vehicle”. Don’t know about coronavirus, but the helpless patients might contract other dangerous diseases. Why are they not being treated like humans?” former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu tweeted.After a video of the three patients boarding a garbage van went viral, the authorities immediately ordered a probe. The incident reportedly occurred on Saturday when an ambulance did not reach to shift three members of a family to the hospital.According to locals, the family had undergone COVID-19 tests earlier in the week and their results came out to be positive. Despite calling 108 for an ambulance, there was no response. The worried villagers prevailed upon the family to use the garbage van to get to the hospital.Primary Health Centre medical officer Gayatri Devi said the ambulance was sent immediately after learning about the patients from volunteers but before the vehicle could reach there the local residents mobilised a garbage van from the local municipal body.Nellimarla Nagar Panchayat Commissioner J. R. Appala Naidu said the vehicle was being used to carry Sodium Hypochlorite and other items for burying the COVID-19 victims.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-patients-taken-to-hospital-in-garbage-van-in-andhra-pradesh-121630

03-08-2020||Mumbai/Patna||Sushant Singh Rajput had bipolar disorder, says Mumbai police chief||Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was suffering from bipolar disorder, a mental condition characterised by extreme mood swings, at the time of his death, Mumbai police chief Parambir Singh said on Monday amid clamour by Bihar politicians for a CBI probe.An IPS officer from Bihar, who had landed in Mumbai on Sunday for leading the SIT investigating in the case, was, meanwhile, quarantined under the COVID-19 regulations in force in the city, a development Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar called “inappropriate and forcible”.The issue resonated in the two Houses of Bihar legislature, with lawmakers across the political divide demanding a CBI investigation into the death of the 34-year- old Patna-born actor.Read also: Sushant Singh Rajput searched for ‘painless death’ on internet: PoliceRhea not missing, hasn’t got summons from Bihar cops: LawyerBoth Mumbai and Patna police are probing the case.Rajput, who impressed his audience with his performances during his short but promising career, was found hanging in his rented apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra on June 14.“It was found that the actor had bipolar disorder, and was undergoing treatment and taking medicines for it. What circumstances led to his death is the subject of our investigation,” Mumbai police commissioner Singh told a press conference.Singh also said no politician’s name has come up during the investigation by Mumbai police.There is no question of non-cooperation with the Bihar police team which is in the city in connection with the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, Singh said, adding Mumbai police are seeking legal opinion on the matter.Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday voiced strong disapproval of the “forcible” quarantine of the officer.“Whatever has been done to him is inappropriate,” Kumar told journalists in Patna.Patna police have registered a case of abetment to suicide against actor Rhea Chakraborty, who was in a relationship with Rajput, on the basis of a complaint lodged by his father K K Singh.Kumar also said the matter has been taken up with the authorities in Maharashtra by DGP Gupteshwar Pandey.“He (Pandey) will himself speak to the authorities concerned,” Kumar said.When asked about whether he would himself have a word with his Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray, the Bihar chief minister said, “It is not a political matter. The issue at hand is a legal obligation of the Bihar police. We will make all possible efforts to fulfil the same.”He, however, ducked queries about recommending a CBI inquiry into the matter, the demand for which has been raised by at least two of the deceased actor’s sisters.Meanwhile, political lines got blurred as the bicameral Bihar legislature demanded a CBI inquiry into Rajput’s death.The demand was first raised by Neeraj Kumar Singh Bablu, a BJP MLA and the deceased stars cousin, when members were allowed to speak on the subject by Speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary after the passage of 12 bills by the House, which assembled for a truncated, day-long monsoon session.Turning towards Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Bablu requested the state government to hand over the probe to the CBI.“It is evident that the Maharashtra government is trying to put hurdles in the way of Bihar police, preventing it from investigating the matter properly, he alleged.Bablu’s wife Nutan Singh, a BJP MLC, also raised the issue in the legislative council.The BJP MLA underscored the “forcible quarantine” of an IPS officer from Patna, hours after he landed in Mumbai on Sunday, to buttress his point.The demand for handing over the matter to the central agency was seconded by leader of the opposition Tejashwi Yadav, who asserted, RJD was the first party to have made such a demand. I had written a letter to the CBI shortly after Rajputs death and also requested that the upcoming film city in Rajgir be named after the deceased actor.Congress legislature party leader Sadanand Singh, who is also a former Speaker of the House, suggested that a resolution be passed in support of the demand for a CBI inquiry into the actors death.Raju Tiwari, an MLA of Ram Vilas Paswan’s LJP, and Awadhesh Kumar Singh of the Congress were among others who rose to speak in favor of a CBI inquiry.Mumbai police commissioner Singh said after registering an Accidental Death Report (ADR) in the case, the investigation is in progress and till now statements of 56 people have been recorded.The statements of Sushant’s sisters have also been recorded, he said.Sushant was upset after he was linked with the death of his former manager Disha Salian on June 8, he said.“No politician’s name came up during the probe so far.There is no evidence against any politician from any party,” Singh said, referring to a query on the name of a prominent young Maharashtra politician being mentioned on social media.“The FIR by Bihar police says Rs 15 crore were siphoned off from Sushant’s account. During the probe, we found he had Rs 18 crore in his account of which around Rs 4.5 crore are still there,” he said.There is no confirmation yet of a direct transfer to the account of Rhea Chakraborty, he added.Police consulted forensic experts and doctors during the investigation, he said.“We obtained CCTV footage of June 13 and 14 of his house but we did not get any evidence about any party being held there,” he said.“The statements of Sushant’s father, sister and brother-in-law were recorded on June 16. At that time, they neither raised any suspicion nor complained about any lapse in our probe,” he said.All angles are being investigated, be it professional rivalry, financial transactions or health reasons that could have led to the actor’s death, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sushant-singh-rajput-had-bipolar-disorder-says-mumbai-police-chief-121626
03-08-2020||New Delhi||Falling R-values in Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai point to COVID slowdown, but scientists warn against laxity||The R-value, or reproductive number, for COVID-19 has fallen below one in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the disease in three of India’s biggest cities, according to a recent study.As experts sound a note of caution against the temptation to lower the guard and warn that any laxity could send the numbers spiralling, a modelling study published in the journal Statistics & Applications found the current R-value for Delhi is 0.66 while it is 0.81 for Mumbai and 0.86 for Chennai, lower than the national average of 1.16.R-value is the number of people getting infected by an already infected person on an average. Andhra Pradesh has the highest R-value of 1.48 in the entire country right now.Explaining the Delhi figure of 0.66 to illustrate the concept, Sitabhra Sinha, professor of physics at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc) in Chennai who led the study, said this means every group of 100 infected persons in the city can currently pass on the infection to another 60 people on an average.“Continuation of such a low value of R in a community implies that the current wave of the pandemic is on the decline and could be brought under control in the near future with continued containment measures,” said Dibyendu Nandi, professor of physics at Kolkata’s Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER).“Typically an effective reproduction number, i.e., R-value lower than one implies that an infected person, on average, is spreading the infection to at most one person,” he explained.Stressing the need for continuing all measures such as containment until the pandemic is “completely eradicated”, Nandi asserted, “So we should not lower our guard.”The simplest way to think about the R number is that it measures, on average, the number of people susceptible to the disease who can be infected by someone with the infection, added Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University in Haryana.In his view, estimates for Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai indicate the growth of the pandemic, as inferred from the day-to-day change in case numbers, is slowing.Menon said serological surveys suggested it is likely that 40 per cent or more of the population has been infected in both Mumbai and Delhi by now.Sero-surveillance studies provide estimates of antibody levels against infectious diseases and is considered the gold standard for measuring population immunity due to past infection or vaccination.“From what we know from other countries, herd immunity from infection will probably require that at least another 20 per cent or more will need to be infected,” said Menon.“So, while the slowdown is real, the pandemic could resurface if we are not vigilant and relax our precautions too soon,” he added.Scientists note the R-value depends on the model and assumptions used for the analysis and may vary accordingly. They add that the projections need to be used cautiously for arriving at any conclusions.Asked if there are limitations in calculating the R-value, Nandi said, “From the theoretical view point no. But from observations sometimes it is difficult to estimate an actual R-value unless the data on disease spread is accurate and comprehensive.”  One intriguing question that arises from the analysis is the fact that the growth rate of the disease has continued to be low despite a large degree of relaxation in lockdown norms, researchers from the IMSc noted in their study.“As India is still very far from achieving herd immunity, and there appears to be no evidence that the pathogen has shown any change in its ability to infect, it is possible that the voluntary adherence to public hygiene has been responsible.“If true, this may suggest that, under certain conditions, citizens can be mobilised to engage in a mass effort to achieve desirable public health outcomes,” according to the study authors.On most days in July, more people were recovering from the disease in Delhi than getting infected, pointing to an improvement in the situation.On Sunday, the city reported 961 fresh cases (with 12,730 tests), taking the tally to 1,37,677 cases, of which 1,23,317 have recovered. On June 23, Delhi had seen the highest single-day spike of 3,947 new cases.Mumbai city reported 1,105 fresh cases on Sunday, pushing the count to 1,16,436. The city recorded 717 new cases of coronavirus on July 28, its lowest one-day rise in more than two months.Chennai registered 1,065 fresh cases on Sunday taking the tally to 1.01 lakh cases. The COVID-19 growth rate in the city has been low ever since cases dropped from 2,400 in the first week of July. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/falling-r-values-in-chennai-delhi-mumbai-point-to-covid-slowdown-but-scientists-warn-against-laxity-121620

03-08-2020||Vijay Mohan||Mohali institute uses Aspirin nano-particles for non-surgical, economical prevention of cataract||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 3Scientists at the Institute of Nano Science and Technology (INST), Mohali, have developed nano-rods from Aspirin, a popular medication used to reduce pain, fever or inflammation, for non-invasive treatment against cataract.The delivery of the Aspirin nano-rods to treat cataract non-invasively will be in the form of eye drops. The research can help prevent cataract in an economical and less complicated way.A cataract is a major form of blindness that occurs when the structure of crystalline proteins that make up the eye lens deteriorates, causing damaged or dis-organised proteins to aggregate and form a milky blue or brown layer that ultimately affects lens transparency.“Prevention of the formation of these aggregates as well as their destruction in the early stage of the disease progression is a major treatment strategy for cataract and materials that can carry out this task can make cataract prevention affordable and accessible,” the Ministry of Science and Technology said.This easy to use and low-cost alternative non-surgical treatment will benefit patients in developing countries, who cannot access expensive cataract treatments and surgeries.The INST team used the anti-aggregation ability of Aspirin nano-rods as an effective non-invasive small molecule-based nano-therapeutics against cataract. Aspirin nano-rods prevent the aggregation of crystalline protein and other matter which play a crucial role in cataract formation through bio-molecular interactions.With ageing and under various conditions, the lens protein crystalline aggregates to form opaque structures in the eye lens, which impairs vision and cause cataract. The targeted disaggregation of the accumulated crystalline in aged and cataractous human lenses is considered as a viable therapeutic strategy for the prevention of cataract formation.The Aspirin nano-rods are produced using the process of molecular self-assembly, which is a low cost and high–yield technique to generate the Aspirin nano-rods as compared to the high-cost and laborious physical methods generally used for the synthesis of nano-particles.Computational studies based on molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism of Aspirin’s anti-aggregation behaviour and the nature of protein interaction. The scientists observed that the interactions eventually transformed the matter responsible for cataract formation into various coils and helixes, thereby preventing their aggregation.Many natural compounds have already been reported as potential aggregation inhibitors but the utility of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Aspirin will open a new paradigm.In addition, due to their nano size, Aspirin nano-rods will enhance bio-availability, improve drug loading and lower toxicity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mohali-institute-uses-aspirin-nano-particles-for-non-surgical-economical-prevention-of-cataract-121613

I will certainly attend it. The dispute is over now after the court’s verdict,” Ansari, 69, told PTI.“Our Prime Minister is coming. I will meet him and give him a ‘Ramnami’ stole (with Ram’s name written on it) and Ramcharitmanas as a present,” Ansari said.His father, Hashim Ansari, the oldest litigant in the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi land dispute case, died at the age of 95 in 2016 after which the son started pursuing the case in the court.Talking about Wednesday’s ground-breaking ceremony to mark the beginning of the construction of a grand Ram temple here, Ansari said, “I belong to Ayodhya.

03-08-2020||New York||Chef Vikas Khanna to help India's street vendors impacted by COVID-19 pandemic||Michelin-star chef Vikas Khanna, who will soon reach the milestone of having distributed 25 million meals across India amid COVID-19, is now aiming to provide essential rations and supplies to 10 million street vendors and their families facing hardships due to the coronavirus pandemic.The 48-year-old world-renowned chef and author has coordinated a massive food distribution drive from his home in Manhattan since the coronavirus pandemic gripped India, unleashing economic hardships for millions as a nationwide lockdown was implemented in March.“We are securing ration and are planning about 10 million meals around the country for street vendors, who actually hold the true heritage of Indian food in their hands,” Khanna told PTI.He has distributed rations, meals and essential supplies to innumerable orphanages, old-age homes, leprosy centres, widow ashrams, Mumbai’s famed Dabbawalas, boatmen and craftsmen in Varanasi as well as to migrant workers and hundreds of thousands of people in need across more than 125 Indian cities with the help of The National Disaster Response Force.Nearly 50 leading brands as well as public and private organisations and individuals have partnered with and supported Khanna in his ‘Feed India’ initiative.Khanna will soon touch the landmark of having distributed 25 million meals across India amid the pandemic and says he will dedicate this milestone to India's legendary artist Lata Mangeshkar, with whom he shares a special bond.He recalls that his mother listened to Mangeshkar’s songs on the radio after working long arduous hours running and managing banquets in Amritsar.Khanna is simultaneously working on providing two million meals, food, clothes, essential supplies like mosquito repellents, candles and matches to people in flood-ravaged areas of Bihar and Assam, particularly in the remote areas.“There are a lot of challenges to support relief in flooded areas of Bihar & Assam (especially the remote ones). But I pledge 2 million+ meals in the affected areas. We will do best to our ability,” Khanna had tweeted.The world-renowned chef said he was particularly moved by the plight of the millions of street vendors across India, whose source of income and livelihood has been severely impacted due to the pandemic and lockdown.He is planning to distribute 10 million meals and other essential items for the street vendors that will last for at least three months and has shortlisted 20 cities for the distribution drive.Khanna hopes that more people and companies will join his efforts to help the street vendors, who he says are an intrinsic part of India’s food culture and feed daily wage workers, besides attracting food lovers from all walks of life.“Street vendors have been among the most important thread of society and provide food to millions of daily labourers. They have uplifted each other through the years. That is the power of street vendors. My next mission is to help these street vendors,” he said.“It is important to stay positive in these difficult times but it also good to help out right now. This is the true moment where individual strength is displayed. We are all holding hands and we can actually make this work. It is time for the country to come together,” he said.Khanna emphasised that criticising governments or foundations for their response to the crisis “is an absolutely wrong way to look at it right now because these are very unpredictable circumstances. Nobody knows how to deal with it”.“These crises are not crises which can be managed by NGOs and governments alone. The crisis is a testimony of the human grit. At this time of severe crisis, we need individuals who can share a little from what they have,” he said.“The street vendors are hopeful that once restrictions are lifted and the crisis is over, their businesses can resume. They are just hanging by a thread. The pandemic is an unprecedented crisis and it is far from over. But we cannot give up,” Khanna said.

03-08-2020||Satya Prakash||‘Top-down’ approach on triple talaq the way out||There are two ways to deal with discriminatory social practices — to leave it to the society to evolve and get rid of such practices or to use law as a tool to achieve desired social change.The first one follows a “bottom-up” approach in which the objective can be achieved without much social upheaval, but it would take decades. The second is known as “top-down” approach requiring state intervention to push the society in a direction away from practices rooted in gender discrimination and to bring them in sync with constitutional objectives of equality and dignity.This approach accelerates the process of change. However, it creates social tension as status quoist elements resist it, for they may not be comfortable with the manner and pace of the change sought to be pushed through by the state. Abolition of “sati” and untouchability, Hindu personal laws and criminalising the practice of dowry are good examples.Analysed from this perspective, the legislative experiment on instant triple talaq appears to be a step in the right direction as government figures show a sharp decline in incidents of Muslim women being subjected to instant divorce after the enactment of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act a year ago.As against 3,82,964 cases between 1985 and 2019 i.e. 11,263 cases per year, only 1,039 incidents were reported since the enactment of the law. The issue remained on the backburner for decades as the Indian state and the political class had an unwritten understanding with conservative elements of the Muslim society that viewed any change in their personal laws as an attempt to interfere with their religious practices.However, some brave Muslim women, including victims of instant triple talaq, managed to disturb this understanding by asserting their right to equality, right to non-discrimination and right to live with human dignity before the Supreme Court.Ironically, while the Muslim women asserted their fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, majority of the judges in the five-judge Constitution Bench decided the case on the basis of the Quran, though in their favour.But the Supreme Court's verdict and the subsequent law enacted by Parliament vindicate the 'top-down' approach to deal with gender discrimination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/top-down-approach-on-triple-talaq-the-way-out-121515

It argued that the use of Doordarshan to broadcast the religious function is against the accepted norms of national integrity.‘Grateful to brothers who sacrificed lives’I thank lakhs of brothers who sacrificed their lives during the 500 years of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. They had said ‘lathi-goli khaayenge, mandir wahin banayenge’ Sadhvi Ritambhara, Hindutva leader AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi has also been questioning whether the Prime Minister of a secular state should attend a religious ceremony. “Prime Minister Modi should not attend it in his official capacity, but can do so as an individual,” Owaisi said.Meanwhile, preparations for the foundation stone-laying ceremony are in full swing in Ayodhya, where Prime Minister Modi will lay the stone on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-slams-politics-over-live-telecast-of-ayodhya-event-121356

The economist, who went back to teaching in the US after his resignation from the RBI last year, said the dip in financial savings was another reason which could explain disagreements between Mint Road and North Block. “Over discussions with former Governors and Deputy Governors, I have found one explanation for why these pressures are now simmering more. I think it is because we have moved from a nationalised economy to a market economy,” Acharya said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shift-to-market-economy-causing-rbi-govt-tensions-says-acharya-121359

The tussle took a turn at a recent virtual meeting called by Congress president Sonia Gandhi with members of the Rajya Sabha, the House where it still remains the main Opposition party.The ostensible reason for the verbal duel was the attack by young Congress MP Rajiv Satav, who sought to join issue with seniors in the party and apportioning blame on the performance of UPA-2 that saw Congress plummeting to only 44 seats in the 16th Lok Sabha. The trigger The attack on UPA-2 was interpreted as a criticism of Dr Manmohan Singh by a member considered to be part of Team Rahul. The denunciation attracted immediate rebuke from senior MPs. For the past few days, party leaders, including Anand Sharma, Kapil Sibal and Manish Tewari, could be seen recounting accomplishments made under UPA 1 and 2.The candid exchange reflected the larger problem in the Congress that it could not find a president besides being unable to clear the accumulated ideological cobwebs for the past six years.Ever since Rahul walked away from top party post two years ago and Sonia Gandhi stepped in to take charge as its interim president, barring intermittent voices to bring Rahul back as the president, there appears to be no major movement. It would be simplistic to look at the tussle purely from the prism of old versus new.Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi need to work with other leaders to anoint a new president, as was done by former party chief PV Narasimha Rao when he handed over the baton to Sitaram Kesri, building consensus among members of the working committee. Otherwise, a large majority of party workers might not accept any new arrangement.The new leader could then formalise how to rejuvenate the party and decide where would the party head from here to challenge the BJP, which is now the most powerful political outfit in the country.That the party is not exactly in a moribund state can be inferred from the manner in which leaders in various states have taken the pole position. Until it gets a leader who has acceptability across the country, the Congress should benefit from regional leaders who demonstrated political grit and determination to remain relevant in states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tussle-within-cong-rekindles-old-versus-new-debate-121361

Both sides are already moving infrastructure like pre-fabricated structures to house additional troops in areas between 14,000 and 16,000 feet.Read also:The meeting of Lt General-level officers, the fifth such engagement since June 6, was held to plan and implement a joint schedule for the de-escalation. The last meeting on July 15 could not break the impasse. India sees this is as an attempt by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to change the status quo of the LAC and no further progress can be made till Chinese troops move back. The meeting commenced at 11 am and continued late into the night.The PLA has not honoured the disengagement plan so far. Troops have not moved back from Finger-4 on the north of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake. They have advanced up to the same point that they had reached during the 1962 war. After the war, they had withdrawn till Finger-8, eastwards from the present location. Since 1962, the Indian Army has been patrolling till Finger-8. The PLA move this summer has blocked Indian patrol parties. The area between Finger-4 and Finger-8 was a ‘grey zone’ till April-end, both sides refrained from making any structures.The other point of contention is the Depsang plains. Some 5,000 men, tanks and guns have been stationed at a place called “Bottleneck”, which is 25 km southeast of the strategic airfield in Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) located at 16,700 feet. The DBO is just 20 km south of the 18,176-foot-high Karakoram pass, which divides Ladakh and Xinjiang in China.Since the last meeting of the Commanders, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had visited Ladakh on July 17.
