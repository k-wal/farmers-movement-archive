16-08-2020||New Delhi||IMD issues red alert for 2 Maharashtra districts; more rains likely in Odisha, Telangana, Chhattisgarh on Monday||Four rain-related deaths were reported from Odisha and Telangana on Sunday and a red alert of extremely heavy showers was issued for two districts in Maharashtra.In north India, rains lashed Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and parts of Uttar Pradesh.However, Delhiites witnessed sultry weather as humidity levels shot up to 91 per cent and the maximum temperature settled at 36.5 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal.The weatherman has forecast only light, isolated rains over the next two days.The flood situation in Assam improved marginally while Bihar continued to be in the grip of the deluge.The number of people affected by the deluge in Bihar rose by about 12,500 in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 81,44,356 in 16 districts, the state Disaster Management Department said.No fresh district was affected by the flood on Sunday and 33 teams of the NDRF and the SDRF have evacuated 5.46 lakh people so far.As many as 11,812 people were affected by the floods in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur and Baksa districts of Assam on Sunday, against 13,300 the previous day, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said.In Odisha, heavy rains caused by a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal led to a flood-like situation in several parts of the state, snapping road connectivity, damaging mud houses and crops.On Saturday night, two members of a family were killed at a village in the Patnagarh block of Balangir district after a wall of their home collapsed due to heavy rains.“Heavy to very heavy rainfall coupled with a strong surface wind is likely to persist in many parts of the state till Monday under the impact of the low-pressure area, which has now weakened and lies over Jharkhand and its neighbouring areas,” the Meteorological Centre said.The Met Centre has forecast the likelihood of the formation of another low-pressure area over north Bay of Bengal around August 19.An octogenarian and her 50-year-old daughter were killed in Nagarkurnool district of Telangana after a wall of their home collapsed on them.  Heavy rains have been lashing some districts of the state for the past couple of days.The India Meteorological Department in its daily weather report has forecast thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and very heavy to extremely heavy rains on Monday.The Met Department issued a red alert of extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places in Pune and Satara districts of Maharashtra on Monday, an official said.The forecast also predicted heavy rainfall at isolated places in Mumbai, Raigad, and Palghar from Monday onwards, he said, adding that the intensity of rains would reduce from Tuesday.The IMD classifies minimum 204.5 mm rainfall in 24 hours as extremely heavy. A red alert requires authorities to take preventive steps to minimise damage.An India Meteorological Department official said the rest of the region was expected to receive heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places during the week.“Heavy rainfall in catchment areas of various dams in western Maharashtra has prompted authorities to release water from them,” Irrigation Department officials said.Water from the Koyna Dam in Satara district was being released at the rate of 52,146 cusecs in the downstream Koyna river, a district official said. The dam is currently filled to 86 per cent of its total capacity of 86.08 TMC (one thousand million cubic feet).The Chhattisgarh government has also issued directives to district officials to remain alert to deal with a possible flood-like situation.In South Bastar, several rivers and rivulets are in spate due to which the road connectivity has been cut off in some parts.Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Sunday directed all district collectors and superintendents of police to remain alert in view of the continuous rainfall.“In Kerala’s Idduki, a ground-penetrating radar will be used to locate bodies buried in the landslide at Pettimudi in the district, where the death toll has risen to 58 with the recovery of three more bodies,” a senior official said.The GPR would assist the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), police, fire force personnel and locals, who had been engaged in search and rescue operations for the past nine days, District Collector H Dineshan said.A massive mound of earth and slush, triggered by heavy rains, had flattened a row of 20 one-room row houses made of tin and asbestos sheets, which housed at least 82 workers, at Pettimudi in Rajamala on August 7.Intermittent rains in Uttarakhand caused landslips that blocked around 100 roads, including national highways leading to the famous Himalayan temples of Kedarnath and Badrinath.Rains and overcast conditions in Dehradun led to the cancellation of Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat’s tour of the rain-ravaged villages of Pithoragarh district.During the last 24 hours in Rajasthan, 115 mm rainfall was recorded in Merta city of Nagaur, followed by 100 mm in Sedwa of Barmer, 85 mm in Raipur of Pali and 65 mm in Ramsar of Barmer district, the Met department said.In Uttar Pradesh, Kanpur was the hottest place at 35.8 degrees Celsius while the maximum temperature in Lucknow rose to 35.7 degrees Celsius.Haryana and Punjab also recorded near-normal temperatures. Chandigarh recorded a high of 34 degrees Celsius, according to the meteorological department here.The maximum temperature in Ambala, Hisar, Karnal and Narnaul settled at 34 degrees Celsius, 36.4 degrees Celsius, 33.6 degrees Celsius and 35 degrees Celsius, respectively.

I think you will have to go to BJP to find out if it’s your enemy or friend. We received a warm welcome from party leaders today and look up to work with them like any other party worker.”    Delhi BJP leader Nighat Abbas said the people who joined the party are residents of Shaheen Bagh area. There is a “myth” that Muslims are “averse” to the BJP which stands dispelled by people from the minority community joining the party, she said.Welcoming the new entrants to the party fold, Delhi BJP president said the public welfare schemes of the BJP government at the Centre do not focus on any religion or caste but give equal benefits to all.              “The BJP has never done any work on the basis of caste and religion but there are some parties which have scared Muslim communities and deprived them of education, employment and development and used them for vote bank,” he said.                 The BJP government has worked to end social evils and has also ended the practice of triple talaq to empower the Muslim woman, he added.

16-08-2020||New Delhi||Allegations of corruption per se can’t be contempt: Prashant Bhushan||Ahead of the crucial August 17 hearing in an 11-year-old criminal contempt case against him, activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan has contended before the Supreme Court that allegations of corruption per se can’t be per se contempt of court.In a written submission filed in the top court, Bhushan—who has already been held guilty of contempt of court in another case relating to his controversial tweets against CJI SA Bobde—made it clear that he would invoke truth as his defence.“Allegations of corruption cannot be per se contempt because truth is a defence to contempt proceedings. Given that the defence/ justification of truth is a statutory right (approved by the Supreme Court) available to an alleged contemnor, the court cannot hold the alleged contemnor guilty of contempt ‘per se’ in case the contemnor invokes the said defence/truth,” Bhushan contended.The Supreme Court had on August 10 decided to go ahead with criminal contempt proceedings Bhushan as it refused to accept his ‘regret’ in connection with his 2009 statement allegedly scandalising the judiciary.“Before reaching to any finding whether the statement made as to ‘corruption’ would per se amount to contempt of court, the matter is required to be heard,” a three-judge Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra had said in a brief order.The top court had on Friday held him guilty of contempt of court, saying public confidence in courts can’t be allowed to be impaired by malicious attacks on them.A three-judge Bench led by Justice Mishra will hear arguments on sentence on August 20.In connection with the 2009 cases slated for hearing on August 17, Bhushan contended that corruption in public life has a wide and expansive definition. “Corruption is not restricted to pecuniary gratification alone but various instruments identify its particular forms such as bribery, embezzlement, theft, fraud, extortion, abuse of discretion, favouritism, nepotism, clientelism, conduct creating or exploiting conflicting  interests,” he submitted.“The factum of corruption in the judiciary has been stated in Parliamentary Committee reports on Prevention of Corruption, has been commented upon by former judges of this Hon’ble Court, has been taken note of in various judgements of this Hon’ble court and high courts in the country and courts in foreign jurisdictions and commented upon by constitutional experts,” he said.“Allegations of corruption and their investigation become essential in impeachment proceedings under the Constitution and the Judges Inquiry Act. Therefore the allegation of corruption per se cannot be contempt, he submitted.But Bhushan had refused to tender an apology and issued a statement expressing regret.“In my interview to Tehelka in 2009 I have used the word corruption in a wide sense meaning lack of propriety. I did not mean only financial corruption or deriving any pecuniary advantage. If what I have said caused hurt to any of them or to their families in any way, I regret the same,” he had said.“I unreservedly state that I support the institution of the judiciary and especially the Supreme Court of which I am a part, and had no intention to lower the prestige of the judiciary in which I have complete faith. I regret if my interview was misunderstood as doing so, that is, lower the reputation of the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, which could never have been my intention at all,” his statement further read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allegations-of-corruption-per-se-cant-be-contempt-prashant-bhushan-127064

16-08-2020||New Delhi||Report on Facebook ignoring hate speech rules triggers slugfest between BJP, Cong||A slugfest erupted between the Congress and the BJP on Sunday following a report in the Wall Street Journal claiming that Facebook ignored applying its hate speech rules to politicians of the ruling party in India.Seizing on the report, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP and RSS of spreading “fake news” using Facebook and WhatsApp to influence the electorate, triggering a sharp counter-attack from Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who reminded the opposition party of the Cambridge Analytica issue.The Congress demanded a probe by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) into the charges mentioned in the report, saying they threaten the foundation of Indian democracy and need to be investigated.BJP & RSS control Facebook & Whatsapp in India.They spread fake news and hatred through it and use it to influence the electorate.Finally, the American media has come out with the truth about Facebook. pic.twitter.com/Y29uCQjSRP  Hitting back, Prasad tweeted, “Losers who cannot influence people even in their own party keep cribbing that the entire world is controlled by BJP and RSS.”“You were caught red-handed in alliance with Cambridge Analytica and Facebook to weaponise data before the elections and now have the gall to question us,” he said.His strong reaction came after Gandhi took to Twitter to slam the BJP and RSS following the report and posted a screen grab of it.“BJP & RSS control Facebook & Whatsapp in India. They spread fake news and hatred through it and use it to influence the electorate. Finally, the American media has come out with the truth about Facebook,” Gandhi said.Losers who cannot influence people even in their own party keep cribbing that the entire world is controlled by BJP & RSS. You were caught red-handed in alliance with Cambridge Analytica & Facebook to weaponise data before the elections & now have the gall to question us? https://t.co/NloUF2WZVY  In the report published on Friday, the US newspaper cited interviews with unnamed Facebook insiders to claim that one of its senior India policy executives intervened in internal communication to stop a permanent ban on a BJP MLA from Telangana after he allegedly made communally charged posts.There was no immediate comment on the issue by Facebook, for whom India is one of the fastest growing markets globally with over 340 million users.Countering Gandhi’s remarks, Prasad also said, “The fact is that today access to information and freedom of expression has been democratized. It is no longer controlled by retainers of your family and that is why it hurts.”Prasad’s reference to Cambridge Analytica was about the allegations the Congress faced in 2018 that the UK-based firm offered the party data mining of Facebook posts to influencing voters in 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Congress had rejected the charges.Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, who heads the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, said the panel would like to hear from Facebook about the report. “The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology would certainly wish to hear from Facebook about these reports and what they propose to do about hate-speech in India,” he tweeted.BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, reacting to Tharoor’s comments, said the subjects which are permissible and are in accordance with rules of parliamentary standing committees could be raised.But at the same time, he added that these panels should not be made a political platform by members to satisfy “ego of their respective party leaders”.Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken, at a virtual press conference, demanded a JPC probe into the charges that Facebook ignored its hate speech policy in dealing with BJP lawmakers.“The Congress party demands a JPC probe to ascertain the charges on how Facebook is helping the BJP in elections and in spreading hatred and fake news in society. There should be a JPC probe on how Facebook is helping the BJP,” he told reporters.He said Facebook global should also hold a probe to ascertain the alleged links of some of its employees with the ruling party, to help protect its own credibility.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted: “Facebook-Whatsapp sinister connection to BJP Government exposed.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/report-on-facebook-ignoring-hate-speech-rules-triggers-slugfest-between-bjp-cong-127056
16-08-2020||New Delhi||Former Chief Justice of Delhi AP Shah slams govt for 'weakening institutions of democracy'||A “Janata Parliament” organised by civil society groups and social activists commenced on Sunday, with former Chief Justice of Delhi AP Shah (retired) hitting out at the present Union government for allegedly  weakening the institutions of democracy, including Parliament.Speaking at the inaugural session of the Janata Parliament, Justice Shah expressed concern at the lack of legislative scrutiny of government’s decisions and policies taken during the period of national lockdown.He lamented that Parliament has not been convened yet after the last Budget Session was truncated and adjourned sine die in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, even though other countries made changes in procedure to hold virtual sessions of their top legislative organs in keeping with social distancing norms.COVID-19 was being used by the government as an excuse to evade questioning and accountability, he said.He said affairs of Jammu and Kashmir, among others, needed to be discussed in Parliament.He said this in the context of delay in convening of Monsoon Session of Parliament.He alleged that the present regime at the Centre was stifling dissent.The democratic institutions and other organs, including the Judiciary and the Fourth Estate have failed to live up to the expectations.“Executive’s accountability is a thing of memory,” Justice Shah said.Among others, converting a Bill of general nature into  a “Money Bill” (during the tenure of preceding government) to evade scrutiny of the Rajya Saba was cited by him as a case in point of the government’s act of evading accountability.Aruna Roy, who was Member of the National Advisory Committee headed by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi during Manmohan Singh-led UPA government, said the six-day Janata Parliament will deliberate on 10 themes.A number of the organisers of the Janata Parliament are known for their opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.They said the event was being organised to fill in the void of legislative scrutiny of government’s decision taken during the lockdown period.Among the other speakers at the inaugural session, sitting Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani alleged that the BJP government in the state and at the Centre were not convening the Sessions of the Assembly and Parliament deliberately.Former Member of Planning Commission Sayeeda Hameed alleged that the present Union government was pursuing a communal agenda.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-chief-justice-of-delhi-ap-shah-slams-govt-for-weakening-institutions-of-democracy-127053

16-08-2020||New Delhi||PIL in SC seeks uniform grounds of divorce for all citizens||A PIL seeking “uniform grounds of divorce” for all citizens of the country, keeping with the spirit of the Constitution and international conventions, has been filed in the Supreme Court.The plea filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay seeks directions to the Centre to take steps to remove anomalies in divorce laws and make them uniform for all citizens, without any prejudice on the basis of religion, race, cast, sex or place of birth.“The court may declare that the discriminatory grounds of divorce are violative of Articles 14, 15, 21 and frame guidelines for ‘Uniform Grounds of Divorce’ for all citizens.“Alternatively, this court may direct the Law Commission to examine the laws of divorce and suggest ‘Uniform Grounds of Divorce’ for all citizens in the spirit of Articles 14, 15, 21, 44 within three months, while considering international laws and international conventions,” the plea says.“Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains have to seek divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Muslims, Christians and Parsis have their own personal laws. A couple belonging to different religions has to seek divorce under the Special Marriage Act, 1956,” it says.If either partner is a foreign national then that person has to seek divorce under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969. Hence, the grounds of divorce are neither gender neutral nor religion neutral, the plea says.The PIL says the “injury” caused to the public due to this is large because divorce is among the most traumatic misfortunes for both men and women, but even after 73 years of independence, divorce procedures are very complex in the country.“Hence, grounds of divorce are neither gender neutral nor religion neutral. For example, adultery is a ground of divorce for Hindus, Christians and Parsis, but not for Muslims. Incurable leprosy is a ground of divorce for Hindus and Christians, but not for Parsis and Muslims.“Impotency is a ground of divorce for Hindus-Muslims, but not for Christians-Parsis. Underage marriage is a ground of divorce for Hindus, but not for Christians, Parsis and Muslims,” the plea says.It adds that many other grounds of divorce are neither gender neutral nor religion neutral, though equity, equality and equal opportunity are the hallmarks of a socialist, secular, democratic republic like India.“The ongoing distinction is based on a patriarchal mindset and stereotypes and has no scientific backing, perpetrates de jure and de facto inequality against women and goes against the global trends,” the plea says. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-seeks-uniform-grounds-of-divorce-for-all-citizens-127044

The first unmanned mission was planned in December 2020, the second unmanned mission in June 2021.The final and the main component, the manned mission of Gaganyaan, was scheduled six months later in December 2021, much before the 2022 deadline.The ISRO had earlier indicated that there would be a delay in several missions as the space body’s work has been hit by disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic.Among the major projects that have been affected are Chandrayaan-3 and Gaganyaan. Chandrayaan-3, the third mission to Moon, was scheduled later this year.The sources said efforts were on to stick to the deadline of 2022 for launching the human space mission.“We will not be able to meet the deadline for the December 2020 launch of the unmanned mission. The coronavirus pandemic has led to several disruptions. This was also recently conveyed to the Space Commission,” a source said.The sources added that staff members from ISRO’s different centres were infected.Only essential and process-related work is on. Also, the related industry has been affected.Even the training of four astronauts in Russia was hit due to the pandemic. However, the training has now resumed.“Even if we are not able to launch the manned mission by December 2021, we have eight months to cover up for the time we have lost,” the source said.The spacecraft will be placed in a low earth orbit of 300-400 kilometres. The total programme cost is expected to be less than Rs 10,000 crores.In June, Jitendra Singh, Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office, had said even though because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the training of four Indian astronauts in Russia had to be halted, yet the opinion of Chairman ISRO and the scientific team is that there was a “cushion” period kept both in the training programme and launch deadline.“The training of astronauts has now been resumed and the launch is scheduled to take place as planned, before the 75th anniversary of India’s independence in 2022,” he had said.

While Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are the traditional opium-trafficking states, Jharkhand has recently emerged as the hub of illegal supply of opium,” the official said.According to the official, the soil quality and hilly tracts of Jharkhand make things easy for the opium poppy cultivators and the supply finds its way to all over the country, including Haryana and Punjab.According to the data, the NCB and state agencies have destroyed illegal crops of opium poppy on 1,002 acres of land, where it was being cultivated, in Jharkhand from 2019 to 20. The agencies have also destroyed the crop on land measuring a total of 10,401 acres in eight states during the period.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncb-seizes-24-kg-of-opium-of-jharkhand-base-trafficking-network-from-up-bihar-127033
16-08-2020||Bulandshahr||2 held in Sudiksha Bhati’s death case; police say no evidence of harassment||Two people have been arrested in connection with the death of a 20-year-old student here, police said on Sunday while ruling out that she was harassed by bike-borne men before being killed in an accident.Sudiksha Bhati, who hailed from Deri Scanar village in Gautam Buddh Nagar’s Dadri, died on August 10 in a road crash in Bulandshahr district while she was pillion riding a motorcycle with her younger cousin, a minor.Police said they arrested the two people—Deepak Choudhary and Raju—on the basis of CCTV camera footage.Sudiksha, an academically bright student, was pursuing a graduation course in entrepreneurship at Babson College, Massachusetts (US), on a scholarship and was scheduled to go back on August 20.While her family has alleged that the road crash took place because two unidentified motorcycle-borne men were “following” her two-wheeler and harassing her, the police on Sunday said it has found no evidence to corroborate their claims. Senior Superintendent of Police Santosh Kumar Singh and District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar during a press conference on Sunday ruled out harassment or a motorcycle stunt as cause of death. They made it clear that the woman’s death was an accident.After going through video footage from eight CCTV cameras, police have not found any evidence of harassment with the woman, they said. On the basis of the SIT’s probe, eye-witness accounts and CCTV video footages, the incident is not a case of sexual harassment and Sudiksha’s death occurred in a road accident, Kumar said.Singh said that during interrogation, accused Deepak revealed that he is employed with a contractor and on the day the incident occurred he was on his way to a designated site along with Raju.Deepak told police that while the duo was on the road on a bullet motorcycle, they had to suddenly apply the brakes when an autorickshaw and a bullock cart came in its way as a result of which the bike behind them, on which Sudiksha was riding pillion, rammed into their vehicle and she fell on the road.According to police, after the incident came in the limelight Deepak got scared and in order to evade interrogation he got his bike modified by changing its tyres, silencer and even the vehicle registration number plate that had ‘Jat’ written on it.Police have recovered the pre-modification parts of the motorcycle including the number plate, they said.They also said the bullet bike was traced after its number was identified from CCTV camera footage.Both the motorcycles—Deepak’s and Raju’s as well as the one on which Sudiksha was riding pillion—were being driven on high speed of approximately 80 kmph and were travelling at a distance from each other, they said.In order to probe Diksha’s death, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed comprising Circle Officer Diksha Singh and two inspectors from the UP Police Crime Branch, the district magistrate said.Police also interrogated the man from whose mobile phone the woman’s family was contacted after the accident and he told investigators that it was a case of road mishap and she died on the spot.Police had earlier said some people were “trying to twist the narrative of the incident” by claiming that the woman was being sexually harassed because of which the accident took place. “It appears that after the body reached her Deri Scanar village, some people tried to twist the narrative of the incident. Since the girl had got a huge scholarship package (to study in the US), there could have been a thought of demand (for compensation) in the people,” Senior Superintendent of Police Santosh Kumar Singh had said on Thursday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-held-in-sudiksha-bhatis-death-case-police-say-no-evidence-of-harassment-127032

India took 156 days to reach this national figure,” the ministry underscored as the number of fatalities due to coronavirus infection in the country reached 49,980.Implementation of testing aggressively, tracking comprehensively and treating efficiently through a plethora of measures have contributed to the existing high level of recoveries as well, it said.The total number of recoveries in the country rose to 18,62,258 on Sunday, according to official data.Improved and effective clinical treatment in hospitals, supervised home isolation, use of non-invasive oxygen support, and improved services of the ambulances for ferrying patients for prompt and timely treatment have been the focus of the Centre and state and UT governments, the ministry said.It said “tireless efforts” of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) have ensured effective surveillance and tracking progress of the patients in supervised home isolation.Clinical management skills of doctors treating COVID-19 patients have been upgraded by active technical guidance through teleconsultation sessions by domain knowledge experts from AIIMS, New Delhi. “These measures have collectively ensured seamless and efficient patient management from home to hospital for critical and severe patients. This has ensured that India’s case fatality rate (CFR) is maintained below the global average,” the ministry said.From 3.33 per cent on June 18, the CFR has declined to 1.93 per cent, while India’s recovery rate among COVID-19 patients has reached nearly 72 per cent.A total of 53,322 patients recuperated and were discharged in a span of 24 hours. “The steady rise in recoveries has ensured that the percentage caseload of the country is reducing,” the ministry said highlighting there are 6,77,444 active cases of coronavirus infection which compose the actual caseload of the country and comprise 26.16 pc of the total cases as on date.They are under active medical supervision, it said.With efficient and aggressive testing, India is rapidly moving towards completing 3 crore COVID-19 tests, according to the ministry.A total of 2,93,09,703 samples had been tested for detection of COVID-19 till August 15, with 7,46,608 samples being tested on Saturday alone, the ministry said.This has been made possible by a rapidly growing national network of diagnostic labs which comprises 969 labs in the government sector and 500 private labs, adding up to 1,469, it said.India’s COVID-19 tally increased to 25,89,682 with a single-day spike of 63,490 infections, while the death toll climbed to 49,980 with 944 people succumbing to the disease in a span of 24 hours, the official data updated at 8 am showed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-19-case-fatality-rate-declines-to-1-93-pc-recovery-rate-nears-72-pc-127031

16-08-2020||New Delhi||Private train operators given freedom to choose halt stations: Railways||Private operators who will be handed over 150 trains to ply on 109 routes by the Railways will have the freedom to choose halt stations of the trains they operate, documents released by the national transporter have shown.However, the private operators have to submit in advance to the Railways the list of such intermediate stations on the trains’ paths where they are proposing halts in advance.The private operators also have to provide the time in and time out at the intermediate railway stations, which shall form part of the train operation plan. This has to be submitted in advance and will be in place for at least a year, after which it can be revised, a draft of the Concession Agreement has said.“The Concessionaire shall have the flexibility in deciding the stops and halts in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Concession Agreement,” the Railways has said in reply to a query by one of the private players who attended pre-application meetings.The Railways has also said the number of such halts of the private trains will not be more than the number of existing halts of the fastest train of the Railways operating in that route. The train operation plan submitted by private operators will also have to include the stations at which the water tanks in the trains need to be filled and also the railway stations, washing lines or stabling lines, as the case maybe, at which the train toilets would be evacuated.As earlier reported by PTI, the fares for private trains that are scheduled to begin operations by 2023 will not be regulated by any authority and will be decided by the private operators depending on market conditions.Bombardier Transportation India, Siemens Limited, Alstom Transport India Ltd are among the 23 firms that have evinced interest in running private trains.The first-of-its-kind venture, the project to bring in private players to run trains is expected to see private sector investment of around Rs 30,000 crore.The 109 pairs of routes have been formed into 12 clusters that will cover major parts of the Indian Railways network. The aim of the project is to upgrade passenger experience on the railway network to world-class standards, with modern train rakes, most of which will be manufactured in the country under the ‘Make in India’ initiative.The Indian Railways will earn by charging the private entity fixed haulage charges and energy charges as per the actual consumption. The national transporter will also get a share in the gross revenue which will be decided through a transparent bidding process.As of now, the private train operator would need to access the Railway’s PRS (passenger reservation system) for management and distribution of its ticket inventory. For usage of such a reservation system, they may have to pay a charge to the Indian Railways, the document said.

A special consignment of Ayurvedic medicines and a medical team were part of the assistance. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-sends-assistance-to-mauritius-to-help-deal-with-oil-spill-127022

16-08-2020||Washington||If elected, will stand with India in confronting threats it faces along borders: Biden||Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden asserted that if elected, his administration will stand with New Delhi in confronting the threats it faces and called for strengthening the "bond" between India and the US.Presidential elections in the US will be held on November 3 and the 77-year-old is challenging incumbent Republican President Donald Trump in the polls."Fifteen years ago, I was leading the efforts to approve the historic civil nuclear deal with India. I said that if the US and India became closer friends and partners, then the world will be a safer place," Biden, who was vice-president in the Obama administration, said while addressing the Indian-American community on India's Independence Day.If elected president, Biden said, he will continue to believe this and also continue to stand with India against the threats it faces from its own region and along its borders.He said that he will work on expanding two-way trade between the two nations and take on big global challenges like climate change and global health security.If elected, the Democratic candidate said, he will work to strengthen the democracies where diversity is a mutual strength.On this day, let us "continue to deepen the bond that endures between our nation's and our people,” Biden said. He said that "as President, I'll also continue to rely on the Indian-American diaspora, that keeps our two nations together, as I have throughout my career". "My constituents in Delaware, my staff in the Senate, the Obama administration that had more Indian-Americans than any other administration in the history of this country, and this campaign with Indian Americans at senior levels, which of course includes the top of the heap, our dear friend (Kamala Harris) who will be the first Indian American vice president in the history of the United States of America,” Biden said.Early this week, Biden scripted history by selecting Indian origin Senator Harris, 55, as his running mate in the US presidential election. Harris, whose father is an African from Jamaica and mother an Indian, is the first-ever Black vice-presidential nominee."We all know she's smart, she's tested, she's prepared. But another thing that makes Kamala so inspiring is her mother's immigrant story to the US that started in India, with pure courage that brought her daughters to this moment. I know the pride you feel. It's your story too," Biden said."For your sacrifices, and your family's courage, you became pillars of our community and our country. You're patriots and the frontlines of this pandemic. In this reckoning of systemic racism, you're making a real real promise that America is a place where people of all races and religions can live together in peace," he said."But I know it's hard. I heart goes out to all those of you who have been the targets in a rise in hate crimes, and the crackdown of legal immigration, including a sudden and harmful actions on H-1B visas. That for decades have made America stronger and brought our nation's closer," Biden said.The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise."While it's sometimes may not feel like the US of your dreams, we will overcome and build back better than ever. Like (former President) Barack Obama had asked to me, I'm asking Kamala Harris, to be the last person in the room to ask the tough questions of me, provide counsel, most of all to always represent the belief in possibilities," the former US vice president said.-- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-elected-will-stand-with-india-in-confronting-threats-it-faces-along-borders-biden-126986
