It asked all the stakeholders to give detailed report on the issue of stubble burning.Maintaining that policies needed to be put in place to prevent stubble burning it sought to know if Panchayats had been roped in for spreading awareness about government projects aimed at stopping the agricultural practice of stubble burning.It asked all the parties to file affidavits detailing the steps taken to dealing with pollution hotspots in the region. It also asked Punjab Government to apprise it about the steps taken to deal with industries which were found non-compliant with pollution norms.The top court—which is seized of a PIL on air pollution in NCR—directed Delhi chief secretary to file an affidavit on the present status of 13 pollution hotspots in the national capital and steps taken to control air pollution.“What steps have been taken? We want affidavit on all issues...not just stubble burning... We want involvement of Centre on formulation of rules/laws to prevent and confiscate vehicles running on kerosene,” it asked.The top court observed that kerosene run vehicles cannot ply on roads. “It’s a sinister thing. These vehicles should be confiscated. If it’s allowed things will never approve,” it added asking the Centre, Delhi Government and Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority to file report on air pollution aspect.It asked the Centre to “start at the earliest” the work for installation of smog tower at Anand Vihar in east Delhi, which is aimed at helping in combating air pollution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-punjab-haryana-delhi-up-to-spell-out-steps-taken-to-stop-stubble-burning-124747

For the past six months, the family members were living on the farm which they had hired for cultivation.Police had found chemicals and injection vials at the shack, leading to suspicion that some poisonous substance may have been administered to family.Two of the victims, Laxmi and Priya, are said to be nurses, according to police. Their signatures appear on the note.The survivor told police that after dinner with the family he went up to the fence of the farm to keep watch against animals and fell asleep there.Police said all the bodies were found inside the shack while the beds where the family members intended to sleep were laid outside, the usual practice due to the hot and humid weather.Other migrants gathered at the hospital where the post mortems were being conducted. They demanded a high-level inquiry.Hindu Singh Sodha who heads a migrants’ organisation, Seemant Lok Sanghthan, said a high-level inquiry was needed even if it was case of suicide.He said the local police could not be trusted with the case as they are mentioned in the note, which alleged harassment of the family by them.The victims included Budharam Bhil (75), his wife Antara Devi, their son Ravi (31) and daughters Jiya (25) and Suman (22). Another 40-year-old woman and five children were also among the dead. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/poisonous-substance-killed-pak-migrants-post-mortem-note-accuses-police-of-harassment-124746

How would their kids get access to online education, the MPs asked the officials.Panel Chairman Vinay Sahasrabuddhe suggested that children can be taught via community radio and transistor, which is cost-effective compared to mobile phones, can be provided to poor students, according to the sources.The senior BJP leader also suggested creation of a “big question bank” of all subjects for students on the basis of which questions should be asked whenever the exams are held for this academic session.Quoting Sahasrabuddhe, the sources said it would solve the exam management-related issues and ease the anxiety and fear among students amid this coronavirus crisis.The Education Ministry officials told the panel that this academic year will not be a “zero year”, the sources said, indicating that exams will be held by the end of the academic session.School education secretary, higher education secretary, UGC chairman and other officials of the Education Ministry briefed the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource Development on the education scenario in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-not-be-zero-year-hopeful-of-conducting-exams-officials-to-parliamentary-panel-124743
10-08-2020||New Delhi||Govt to roll out more steps to attract investment in defence manufacturing: Rajnath||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said the government will unveil more steps to attract investment in defence manufacturing so that India can produce world-class military platforms and weapons systems.The defence minister’s comments came after he unveiled new infrastructure and facilities in a number of leading state-run defence majors to enhance their production lines and capabilities.Singh announced on Sunday that India will stop import of 101 military systems and weapons like transport aircraft, light combat helicopters, conventional submarines and cruise missiles by 2024 to promote India’s domestic defence industry.The defence minister announced the restrictions on import of the items in tune with the government’s initiative to make India a self-reliant nation.While kick-starting ‘Atmanirbhar Week’ in the defence sector on Monday, Singh said self-reliance in this field is a tall task which needs whole hearted involvement of all stakeholders to make it successful.“We will take more steps towards indigenisation, investment in defence infrastructure and expansion in defence manufacturing capability. These steps will create big opportunities for the Indian defence industry,” Singh said while addressing top officials of several Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs).At the online event, Singh inaugurated new facilities at a number of DPSUs aimed at enhancing their existing capabilities to produce various weapons systems.“The ban on imports of 101 items is a big step towards an ‘atmanirbhar Bharat’. This list of negative items contains not only small items but weapon systems of high and critical technology. More such items will be added to this list shortly which will save crores of rupees in imports,” he said.The decision to prune the import list of weapons systems under a year-wise schedule was first announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in May while rolling out reform measures for the defence manufacturing sector that included increasing the FDI limit from 49 per cent to 74 per cent under the automatic route.“Being self-sufficient is never meant to separate oneself from the world. I remember a statement by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He said in the context of Swadeshi that water is necessary to operate a boat. But this does not mean that the water is so much that the boat sinks,” Singh said.The defence ministry said additional infrastructure dedicated by Singh included upgraded facilities for production of Pinaka rockets and T-90 tanks and manufacturing and testing of anti-torpedo defence system by Bharat Electronics Ltd.The defence minister also inaugurated a newly established industrial design centre of Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) at Bengaluru.“The design centre is the first of its kind in India, focusing on implementing factors of industrial design and human factors as a part of developmental strategies for setting the global benchmarking in industrial design,” the defence ministry said.It said aerospace major Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd handed over the 500th AL-31FP overhauled engine to the IAF which are mounted on its most lethal frontline fighter aircraft Su-30MKI.New infrastructure created by Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Ltd at its Raja Bagan dockyard in Kolkata was also thrown open by Singh.Another DPSU, Bharat Dynamics Ltd, is also creating infrastructure to enhance manufacturing of missile systems that will reduce import dependence. The BDL is enhancing capabilities for production of Akash and Astra missiles, officials said.Mishra Dhatu Nigam, a DPSU, is setting up a state-of-the-art skill development centre with a focus on promoting applied research for the development of materials used in aerospace, defence, nuclear, space and other strategic weapons, they said.“The defence industries have been the force behind the armed forces. Today we are proud of our Defence PSUs and OFB for their continued support and sustained efforts towards this,” Singh added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-to-roll-out-more-steps-to-attract-investment-in-defence-manufacturing-rajnath-124738

In accordance with an agreement between India and Nepal, the water resources department of Bihar conducts the flood management work in the bordering areas,” said Nitish. Flood situation grimThe flood situation in the state remained grim on Monday with 20,000 more people affected by the calamity in 16 districts in the past 24 hours, a Disaster Management Department bulletin said.The total number of flood-affected people in the state has risen to 74.40 lakh, while deaths caused due to the deluge stood at 24.As many as 74.19 lakh people were hit by the calamity and 23 deaths were reported till Sunday evening.However, there is a ray of hope with a reduction in the number of flood-hit people in a day, an official said."The number of fresh people getting affected by flood has reduced to 20,000 in past 24 hours with merely 11,800 people residing in just seven relief centres," a Disaster Management Department official said.The number of community kitchens has also declined to 1,239 from 1,267 on Sunday, he said."For us, this phase of flood is over and things will improve in days to come if nothing major untoward incident happens," he said.Darbhanga reported the highest number of flood-related deaths at 10, followed by Muzaffarpur at six, West Champaran at four and two each in Saran and Siwan, the bulletin said.The 16-flood affected districts are Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Supaul, Kishanganj, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, West Champaran, East Champaran, Khagaria, Saran, Samastipur, Siwan, Madhubani, Madhepura and Saharsa.A total of 5.08 lakh people have been evacuated from the deluge-hit areas so far during joint rescue operations conducted by 20 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and 13 teams of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), it said.Rivers such as Baghmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamlabalan, Adhwara, Khiroi, Ghaghra are flowing above danger levels while the Ganga is also flowing 15 cm above the danger mark at Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur.However, the water level of the Ganga has declined by a few centimetres at several places like Munger, Bhagalpur, Digha ghat and Gandhi ghat (both in Patna), the Water Resources Departments bulletin said.The MeT Department here has forecast light to moderate rain on Tuesday in the catchment areas of all rivers flowing through Bihar.

10-08-2020||Bengaluru||Floods: Karnataka seeks Rs 4,000 cr special assistance from Centre||The Karnataka Government on Monday said it has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide an additional special assistance of Rs 4,000 crore to handle the flood situation in the state.“As per the initial assessment Rs 4,000 crore loss has occurred. It is a preliminary estimate because rains are continuing. A proper survey has to be done,” Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said.Speaking to reporters after attending the virtual meeting chaired by the PM with chief ministers of six states to review the flood situation in the country, he said Karnataka had suffered huge damage in the 2019 floods, followed by the COVID-19 pandemic.With the current flood situation, the government has requested the Centre to provide additional special assistance of Rs 4,000 crore, other than NDRF norms, he said.“We also requested the prime minister to kindly direct the immediate release of the next instalment of SDRMF of Rs 395 crore to Karnataka to take up relief and rehabilitation measures,” he said.This was a preliminary submission and a detailed memorandum would be sent to the Centre in the days to come, he said.Revenue Minister R Ashoka, along with Bommai, attended the video conference in the absence of Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa, who had been undergoing treatment for COVID-19.The chief minister has since been discharged.At the meeting, the prime minister directed officials to look into providing both immediate and long-term relief to affected states, the ministers said.Ashoka said the state government will utilise the funds available with it to manage the situation and provide relief to those affected until it received the central fund.Several parts of Malnad, coastal and interior Karnataka have been ravaged by torrential rains, causing floods and landslides and affecting lives and property.At least 12 districts have been affected, in which over 12 people have lost their lives since August 1.Bommai said 56 taluks and 885 villages have been affected.“Preliminary assessment of damage is around 3,000 houses, 80,000 hectares of crops, 3500 km of roads... also damage to electrical infrastructure, transformers, buildings, bridges, minor irrigation tanks are there,” he said.The ministers said they gave details to the prime minister about the measures taken by the state to provide relief to those affected.They informed him that four NDRF teams and 200 trained SDRF men have been positioned in vulnerable areas and thanked the Centre for reserving four IAF helicopters and deploying the Army for search and rescue operations.Bommai said the state also suggested to the PM, certain long-term measures like commissioning a special project to study and establish an Integrated Flood Forecasting and Response System for inter-state river basins like in the Krishna Basin to mitigate flood damage.“We also suggested a special project to study and establish Landslide Hazard Mapping and Development of Early Warning System for high vulnerable areas of western ghats in Karnataka and its adjoining states,” he said.The home minister said they requested an additional four NDRF teams to be deployed in Karnataka.The state also suggested a scheme to handle soil erosion along the western coast on the lines of the National Cyclone Relief Mitigation Project (NCRMP), he added.

10-08-2020||Mumbai||Some properties seized by ED belong to my trust: Nirav’s son||Fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi’s son Rohin Modi told the Bombay High Court on Monday that a few of the properties seized by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the Punjab National Bank scam belong to a trust owned by him (Rohin) and they were not purchased with alleged proceeds of crime.Rohin Modi’s lawyer made the submission before a Division Bench of Justices SS Jadhav and NJ Jamadar.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, appearing for the Enforcement Directorate (ED), however, argued that though some of the properties in question are owned by the Rohin Trust, the purchasing amount for them was paid by Nirav Modi, a key accused in the PNB scam, and his wife Ami Modi.The Division bench was hearing a petition filed by Rohin Modi challenging confiscation of properties purportedly belonging to the Rohin Trust.On June 8, a special court set up under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) ordered confiscation of movable and immovable properties belonging to Nirav Modi, a prime accused in the multi-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud.The order was passed in accordance with section 12 of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act on an application filed by the ED, which is probing money laundering charges in the fraud case.Nirav Modi was, in December 2019, declared an “economic fugitive offender” under the Act.The properties ordered to be confiscated include bank accounts in India and England, residential and commercial properties in India, the UAE and the UK, allegedly purchased by Nirav Modi from proceeds of crime.Rohin Modis advocate Abhimanyu Bhandari on Monday told the HC that a flat in the iconic ‘Samudra Mahal’ building in Worli in south Mumbai and several other immovable properties are owned by the Rohin Trust.The flat was purchased in the year 2006 and not (from) proceeds of crime. The adjudicating authority (the special court) ought to have heard Rohin Modi before ordering confiscation of those properties (both movable and immovable), that are owned by the Rohin Trust, Bhandari said.He urged the HC to direct the ED to maintain status quo vis-a-vis the properties owned by the Rohin Trust and to not auction them so that Rohin Modi could approach the special court seeking to be heard.The EDs counsel, Singh, however, opposed the plea and said all the confiscated properties were purchased using proceeds of crime as they were purchased by Nirav Modi and his wife Ami Modi.This (petition filed by Rohin Modi) is just a means used by Nirav Modi to protect some of his properties. Nirav Modi fled the country as soon as the scam came to light and has not returned.“He refused to cooperate with the investigation. A sum of Rs 6,498 crore has been laundered, Singh said.Nirav Modi is currently lodged in a UK jail after being arrested in London in March 2019.The bench, after hearing arguments, posted the petition for passing orders on August 13.In January 2018, the CBI had registered a case against Nirav Modi and several others, including two PNB officials, in connection with the scam.According to the complaint lodged by PNB, between February and May 2017, the accused persons in connivance with bank officials duped the public sector bank to the tune of Rs 6,498 crore.

Students should prepare for the exam,” Mehta had said.Refusing to relent on the September 30 deadline for conducting final year of universities and colleges, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had earlier told the court that its decision was taken “after due deliberation by taking into account and balancing all relevant factors”.In an affidavit filed in the court, UGC had said its circular was issued to “protect the academic future of students”, while keeping in mind their “health and safety”.The affidavit has been filed in response to petitions challenging the UGC’s July 6 circular for allegedly being arbitrary as it mandated conducting examinations during COVID19 pandemic.The petitioners wanted the UGC to follow the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) which has decided to hold examinations at a later date for students not satisfied with their marks given on the basis of internal assessment.However, the UGC said, “The nature of examinations conduct by CBSE, ICSE or ICAI…are very different from those that are the subject matter of the UGC Guidelines. In the present case, the UGC is concerned with final year/terminal semester examinations which will have a lasting and indelible effect on the academic credibility, career opportunities and future progress of the students.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ugc-questions-decision-of-maharashtra-delhi-to-cancel-final-year-exams-124716

He should come out with figures as to how many jobs were provided to the unemployed in the last six years. After promising to construct seven lakh houses, the state has not even built 50,000 houses.”  Coming down on the government for what he called mishandling the coronavirus crisis, Nadda said: “Instead of containing the coronavirus pandemic, KCR is in slumber like Kumbhakarna.

10-08-2020||New Delhi||Puri questions Cong MPs’ tweets on plane mishap, says Kozhikode runway safety as per ICAO guidelines||The Kozhikode airport is equipped with runway safety as per the guidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Monday while questioning various tweets by Congress MPs on the plane crash in which 18 people were killed.After the accident on Friday, Virudhunagar MP Manickam Tagore, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor alleged on Twitter that there were safety lapses on the part of the Civil Aviation Ministry.“There was some excited tweeting by few members of Congress Party without fully being aware of the facts,” Puri said on Twitter on Monday.An Air India Express flight from Dubai with 190 people on board, including a six-member crew, overshot the tabletop runway during landing at the Kozhikode airport in heavy rain on Friday night, fell into a valley 35 feet below and broke into two, killing 18 people including both pilots.Questioning Tagore’s tweets on the plane crash, Puri said the Congress MP did not study “the basic facts before turning into an aviation security and protocol expert”.A day after the crash, Tagore had tweeted that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and aviation regulator DGCA “seem to have ignored” the proposal for using Engineered Material Arrestor System (EMAS) technology to ensure the safety of Kozhikode airport’s tabletop runway.The AAI works under the Civil Aviation Ministry. The EMAS is a unique surface of special materials that is built at the end of the runway to stop the aircraft in its tracks if it has overshot the area while landing.Puri said on Monday: “Kozhikode airport is equipped with Runway End Safety Area (RESA) as per ICAO Guidelines on safety.”               He said the provision of EMAS is not mandatory in a civil airport as per the ICAO guidelines.Puri said EMAS provides safety benefits if standard RESA length is not available at the airport or if RESA cannot be provided at the airport due to some constraints.“Provision of EMAS at Mangalore and Kozhikode were examined by AAI in consultation with DGCA, subsequent to the Air India Express accident at Mangalore in 2010. Tabletop runways at both these Airports are accordingly provided with RESA of 240 meters and 90 meters in compliance to DGCA directive,” Puri said.Back in 2010, an Air India Express aircraft overshot the runway at Mangalore airport, fell into a gorge and caught fire, resulting in loss of 158 lives.After Friday’s accident, Tharoor had alleged on Twitter that warnings had been given about the dangers of landing in heavy rain at Kozhikode airport and the AAI knew an accident was waiting to happen.On Monday, Puri said he was glad that Tharoor had checked the facts and “changed his tune” on the Kozhikode tragedy.Bittu had alleged on Twitter on August 8 that “despite several red flags and 2015 ban on wide-body aircraft’s landing at Kozhikode airport, Hardeep Singh Puri removed the ban in July 2019 leading to such a fatal crash and loss of lives”.The Air India Express plane that crashed on Friday night was a B737, which is a narrow body aircraft.“MP @RavneetBittu did not know the difference between a narrow body aircraft & a wide bodied one yet he tweeted as an expert on the subject! He did well by deleting his tweet,” Puri noted.A wide body aircraft has a bigger fuel tank as compared to a narrow body aircraft. This allows the former to travel to longer distances as compared to the latter.

10-08-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Andhra’s new industrial policy to counter economic depression from COVID-19||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, August 10To counter the ill-effect of COVID-19 on the state’s economy, the Andhra Pradesh government on Monday unveiled its new Industrial Policy for 2020-23.All districts in the states have been identified to promote specific sectors for growth. The policy highlights 10 thrust areas with manufacturing kept as high priority sector as it would generate large scale employment. Andhra Pradesh is one of the first states in the country that passed legislation that mandates 75 per cent employment to state domiciles even in private jobs. The government has identified industrial zoning as a key focus area to ensure planned industrial development. Claiming the policy to be investment-friendly it aims at reducing the impact on the environment. The AP Industries and Infrastructure Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy said, “De-risking the investments is the cornerstone of the new industrial policy. We are introducing ‘YSR AP One’, a multi-faceted business enablement centre which acts as a one-stop resource and support centre for industries.”  He said the major incentive a prospective an investor gets, under the new policy, is reimbursement of State Goods and Services Tax for five years (capped to Fixed Capital Investment) for medium, large and mega industries linked to employment creation, the minister added. The current lease and buy models for land the allotment is being replaced with a composite lease plus buy model, where an industrialist gets to purchase the land after successfully running his unit for 10 years, the Industrial Policy reads. Reddy further said, “The manufacturing sector, as an employment provider, remains a high priority for the state. The government will undertake structural reforms to accelerate industrialisation in the state. We believe that providing the right facilities at the right cost and offering transparent approvals is critical to the success of the industrial sector.”  Thrust areas in the new policy are food processing, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, textiles, electronics, footwear and leather, toys and furniture, petrochemicals, aerospace and defence, automobiles, machinery, precision equipment and mineral-based industries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhras-new-industrial-policy-to-counter-economic-depression-from-covid-19-124709

He tested positive for COVID-19 in the test conducted after the crash.Because of this, his mortal remains could not be handed over to his family for cremation in Malappuram district where he had built a new house last year. Instead, the cremation was done in the public crematorium in Kozhikode district.Prashob Tharammal Keeri, one of his flatmates in Dubai, told Gulf News that Sudheer had contracted coronavirus in mid-April along with him and three other flatmates.He said Sudheer was isolated in the Al Warsan facility and recovered by May first week.Before he took the flight to leave the UAE for good, Sudheer tested negative for COVID-19 in an RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) test, which is considered the most accurate test for COVID-19, Prashob was quoted as saying in the report.“He decided to do the test again before flying because his wife had checked with health officials in Kerala about the need for it since he had the disease some months back,” his flatmate said.“He had carried all these documents with him. Unfortunately, there was nobody to explain all these details to the authorities. It was the driver who went to pick him up from the airport who ran around to find out in which hospital he was admitted,” said Prashob. Praveen Kumar, a social worker volunteering for the Indian Consulate in Dubai, said he was the one who helped Sudheer and his flatmates to be isolated when they tested positive in April.“I have informed the Non Resident Keralites Affairs (NORKA) department in Kerala about what exactly happened and requested to give a clarification that probably he might have tested positive due to the antibodies,” he said.The Air India Express flight from Dubai with 190 people, including a six-member crew, overshot the tabletop runway during landing at the Kozhikode airport in heavy rain on Friday night, fell into a valley 35 feet below and broke into two, killing 18 people, including the pilots.

10-08-2020||Satya Prakash||Sushant Rajput death: Rhea alleges ‘media trial’, urges SC to protect her right to privacy||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 10Actor Rhea Chakraborty on Monday filed an affidavit in Supreme Court accusing the media of sensationalising the death of Sushant Singh Rajput and conducting a parallel media trial.“The issue is blown out of proportion in Media. Media Channels are examining and cross-examining all the witnesses in the case,” Rhea submitted. She is being investigated by the CBI as an accused and ED too has interrogated her.Alleging that the issue was being exploited for political mileage in Bihar polls due in November, she told the top court that “she should be protected and not be made scapegoat of political agendas”.Read also: ED continues questioning Rhea, Showik, now dad Indrajit also joins“The sad incident of the death of Sushant Singh Rajput who hailed from Bihar unfortunately occurred just in wake of elections in Bihar. This has led to the issue of suicide of deceased being isolated and blown out of proportion. Actors Ashutosh Bhakre (32) and Sameer Sharma (44) were also reported to have committed suicide in last 30 days and yet no whisper about the same in power corridors. In case of death of Sushant Singh Rajput, Chief Minister of Bihar is reported to be responsible for registration of FIR in Patna,” she said.The affidavit has been filed ahead of the hearing of her petition seeking transfer of an FIR registered in Patna against her to Mumbai later this week.Rhea said, “Petitioner (she) is already convicted by media even before a foul-play in the death of Sushant Singh Rajput is established.”Her transfer petition is likely to come up for hearing before a Bench headed by Justice Hrishikesh Roy on Tuesday.Both Bihar Government and Sushant’s father KK Singh have opposed her petition, saying her plea has become infructuous after the matter was handed over to the CBI. Sushant’s father accused her of giving drug overdose to the deceased.However, Rhea opposed transfer of the Patna FIR to the CBI on the ground that it was without jurisdiction and didn’t comply with the requirements of Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act.“In the present case, the consenting state i.e. Respondent State of Bihar had no jurisdiction to retain the investigation since the entire cause of action has occurred in Mumbai. No cause of action has ensued in State of Bihar. Thus, the consent by State of Bihar under Section 6 is bad in law. Said consent is merely to render the present Petition infructuous,” she submitted.Maharashtra government, too, has opposed transfer of the probe to the CBI.Rhea also complained of violation of her right to privacy. “Extreme trauma and infringement of privacy of the rights of petitioner is caused due to constant sensationalisation of this case,” she submitted.“Media had convicted accused in 2G and Talwar case in similar fashion where each and every accused was later on found innocent by courts,” Rhea contended.“Investigation into financial scams of thousands of crores by Enforcement Directorate and CBI never see the light of the day and at drop of a hat, cases gets registered even without there being a jurisdiction in the foundational case,” she submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sushant-rajput-death-rhea-alleges-media-trial-urges-sc-to-protect-her-right-to-privacy-124687
10-08-2020||New Delhi||Rajasthan political row: SC to hear tomorrow pleas on merger of six BSP MLAs with Congress||The Supreme Court on Monday said it would tomorrow hear the petitions filed on the issue relating to merger of six BSP MLAs with the Congress in Rajasthan last year.The apex court was hearing a plea filed by a BJP MLA who has challenged the Rajasthan High Court order which had refused to stay the functioning as Congress legislators of six BSP MLAs who after election to the assembly merged with the ruling party in the state.A bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said that appeal filed by BJP MP Madan Dilawar would be heard along with a separate plea filed by the six MLAs.In their plea, these six MLAs have requested the apex court to transfer to itself Dilawar’s plea pending in the high court seeking their disqualification for allegedly violating the party whip.Dilawar has challenged in the apex court the August 6 order of a division bench of high court which had disposed of his plea against the order of a single judge, who had refused to stay the functioning of these six MLAs as Congress legislators.During the hearing conducted on Monday through video-conferencing, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Dilawar, told the apex court that in September last year the Assembly Speaker had passed an order accepting the merger.He said that BSP has said that they have not merged.While saying that the issue is pending before a single judge of the high court, he also referred to the plea filed by the six MLAs in the apex court.The bench said it would hear both the matters tomorrow.The single judge of high court had earlier not granted any interim relief and refused to put a stay on the participation of six MLAs in the proceedings of the House as Congress legislators.Sandeep Yadav, Wajib Ali, Deepchand Kheria, Lakhan Meena, Jogendra Awana and Rajendra Gudha contested and won the 2018 assembly election on a BSP ticket but they defected to Congress in September 2019.They had submitted an application for the merger on September 16 last year and the Speaker allowed their induction into the Congress two days later.The merger was a boost to the Ashok Gehlot-led government as the tally of the Congress increased to 107 in the house of 200.In their plea filed in the apex court, these six MLAs have contended that similar petitions, raising questions on disqualification under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution, are pending before the Supreme Court and, therefore, the plea filed against them in the high court should be transferred to the top court.They said the high court cannot exercise the power of judicial review in “purely political questions” but can examine questions if they emanate from a constitutional duty or obligation.They have said in their plea that it would be in the interest of justice that the matter is transferred to the top court and heard together with similar petitions filed there.Two petitions have been filed in the high court, one by Dilawar and the other by BSP National Secretary Satish Mishra.Dilawar has challenged the merger of the BSP MLAs into Congress, questioning Assembly Speaker CP Joshi’s order dismissing his complaint without allowing him to have his say.Mishra has challenged the defection of the MLAs, but these legislators have not sought transfer of his plea to the Supreme Court.On July 30, the high court had sought the response of the Assembly Speaker and its secretary on the pleas challenging the induction of the six MLAs into the Congress.Amid a political crisis triggered by a rebellion by Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs, the Speaker had moved the top court for a stay on the high court’s order which had asked him to defer disqualification proceedings against the sacked deputy chief minister and the 18 others.On July 31, the Rajasthan Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi also moved the top court challenging the high court order asking the Speaker to defer disqualification proceedings.

10-08-2020||New Delhi||'Raised issues of principles, don’t crave for any post': Sachin Pilot after meeting Cong leaders||Congress president Sonia Gandhi has decided to set up a three-member committee to address issues that rebel leader Sachin Pilot has raised---a development that comes after Pilot met Rahul Gandhi in Delhi to hold parleys at a time when turbulence threatens to tear apart Rajasthan’s Congress unit.After meeting Congress leaders, Sachin Pilot said, “We raised issues of principles before Congress leadership and welcome their assurance of time-bound redressal of our grievances."“I don't crave for any post, party has given position and can take it back,” he added.“Some personal remarks have been made against me. I feel there is no place for such mudslinging in politics,” the former Deputy CM added.The Congress said in a statement issued on Monday evening that Pilot’s meeting with Rahul Gandhi was "frank, open and conclusive".Sachin Pilot has "committed to working in the interest" of Congress party and its government in Rajasthan, the party’s statement said.Pilot also meet general secretary Priyanka Gandhi in an attempt to negotiate terms.The meeting between Pilot and the Gandhis appeared to have course to what looks like some resolution to the crisis that is threatening to rip the party apart for over a month now. Pilot and 18 rebel MLAs have been at daggers drawn with Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot ever since they challenged Rajasthan Speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notices to them for failure to attend two consecutive CLP meetings in Jaipur.The rebels challenged the notices in the High Court which stayed the process.For any redressal, however, Pilot and rebels will be asked to vote for the Gehlot Government should the Chief Minister seek trust of the house in the upcoming Assembly session from August 14.Even though the Congress recently sacked Pilot as Deputy Chief Minister and state unit chief they kept asking him to return to party fold and talk.Pilot, who ran out of options after Gehlot managed to secure his flock of 102 MLAs with six former BSP MLAs also merging in the Congress, today decided to come to the talking table and negotiate his return.It remains to be seen if the Congress leadership will restore Pilot as Deputy CM and state chief in return for his peace-making effort.That said, the Congress is now secure in the Rajasthan Assembly after Pilot’s rebel move misfired.Congress veteran Ahmed Patel is said to have struck the deal.Rahul Gandhi will soon meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to take a final call on the Pilot issue and terms of his reconciliation with the party. — With PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/raised-issues-of-principles-dont-crave-for-any-post-sachin-pilot-after-meeting-cong-leaders-124669
10-08-2020||New Delhi||India’s fodder, water augmentation programme will reduce man-animal conflict: Javadekar||Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday said the fodder and water augmentation programme in jungle areas will reduce incidents of man-animal conflicts that lead to the death of a large number of elephants as well as humans.“Hopefully, from next year, there will be ample availability of water and fodder so that elephants do not have to venture out in search of food,” Javadekar said while releasing the Document on Best Practices and Launch of Portal on Human-Elephant Conflict on the eve of World Elephant DayEach year, human-elephant conflict results in about 500 human deaths and damage to thousands of houses and millions of hectares of crops, while over 100 elephants die due to human-related activities, which include poaching for ivory or meat, poisoning, electrocution and collision with trains, according to the report.Javadekar said India is taking up the ambitious water and fodder augmentation in forests using LIDAR-based survey technology to boost its flora and fauna.=“It will give complete details of forest area where water conservation can be done so that water-base increases through recharge, ample grass and fodder are available,” he saidDespite having only 2.6 per cent of the world’s landmass, 4 per cent fresh rainwater resources, 16 per cent of the human population and 16 per cent of cattle population, India has 8 per cent of the World’s biodiversity.“This is because of our ability to coexist and care for it,” Javadekar said.While globally, wild Asian elephants are present in 13 countries, India holds the largest population with nearly 30,000 animals.However, human habitation is impinging on the boundary of many Protected Areas and shrinking space accompanied by a shortage of food often forces wild animals towards populated areas.The number of wild Asian Elephants, estimated at 29,964 according to 2017 census by Project Elephant, is about 60% of the species’ global population.Friction between humans and elephants termed Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) occurs mainly over space and is a major conservation concern across the country for governments, conservationists and people living close to the wild animals. Loss of natural habitat andfragmentation have been bringing wild elephants closer to humanhabitations, sparking these conflicts.To tackle such conflicts and avoid losses on both sides, it is important to strengthen the human-elephant coexistence through by active management interventions by the State Forest Departments, the involvement of various stakeholders and sensitization and generating awareness in local communities of forest fringe areas.A variety of management strategies and practices has been developed and customized are implemented at different scales by the State Forest Departments for preventing and mitigating human-elephant conflict, states the report that summarises the various management inventions successfully adopted by the elephant range states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-fodder-water-augmentation-programme-will-reduce-man-animal-conflict-javadekar-124668

We will consider all those suggestions and then will come out with a final draft. People jumping at the draft is not a fair practice During their regimes decisions have been taken without public consultations, this also I have mentioned in my reply to Jairam Ramesh,” he saidAccording to Ramesh, the Parliamentary Standing Committee has been “inundated with requests from various stakeholders to give them an opportunity to present their views and that the “Notification may be kept in abeyance until the Committee completes its deliberations”.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has called the draft “disgraceful and dangerous”.Javadekar said the ministry, in order to make some changes in the Environment Impact Assessment, had brought out a draft notification. In the last 150 days, people have given their views and opinions on it.“While as per rules 60 days are given, because of COVID, three more months were given. Thousands of people gave their view, which I welcome. But some people have become so impatient that they have given a call for agitation. It is still a draft….suggestions that have been received will be further discussed. It is only after that the final document will be prepared….if someone has to give a reaction that will be the appropriate time.“But because there is nothing else, let’s have an agitation this type of attitude is not good. When they were in power, they did not even ask people before implementing several decisions. I have also given a detailed reply to Jairam Ramesh. The consultation period has ended yesterday, now discussions will be held after which it will be decided what kind of changes are made and what draft is brought before the people.It is better that the reactions are given then. Today they are untimely and premature. When I saw reactions of some leaders that they want to protest against the draft, (my question is) how can you protest against the draft. A draft is a draft it is not a final notification,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eia-draft-notification-protests-immature-this-is-not-the-final-notification-says-javadekar-124662

Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria has written to legislators regarding the meeting at 4 pm, according to reports.Interestingly, the development comes after the Rajasthan BJP shifted some MLAs to Gujarat to safeguard its flock against "poaching”. Former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje too has got active and met top party leaders such and JP Nadda and Rajnath Singh in New Delhi.She apparently expressed displeasure over certain decisions taken by the state organisation. Sources say she assured the leadership that she will stand with the party, but "won't compromise on her self-respect". It seems the former CM has been told that she will be a part to any decision taken by the BJP regarding Rajasthan. While in Delhi, she also met general secretary (orgnasiation) BL Santosh.  Even though the politics was in full force in the desert state, Raje maintained a low profile, also skipping meetings called by state president Satish Poonia.Poonia on Saturday said MLAs would be taken to Gujarat, alleging that CM Gehlot “who does not have the strength to save his government” was trying to “to influence, poach and harass” them using the state police and administration.Interestingly, till then it was Gehlot who had been accusing the BJP of “horse-trading” and trying to “poach” Congress MLAs to topple his government in Rajasthan.The Congress imbroglio in Rajasthan has also brought into open factionalism and contours of different groups within the BJP.While BJP leaders say “it is just a matter of time” before the Gehlot government falls under its own weight, the fact is the long gap before the Assembly session on August 14 have given rise to multiple possibilities.There appears to be a clear “directive” from Nagpur that the person occupying the top post should be from saffron party, Sangh ‘parivaar’, its background and ideology.Therefore, if the Gehlot government fails, the next big question is “who will become the Chief Minister”.The fact is in states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan, there is no dearth of in-house talent from the Sangh background in the BJP.In those terms, Congress rebel Sachin Pilot “certainly does not fit the bill” despite what Poonia had said a few days ago. “Sachin Pilot revolted to become the Chief Minister... there is a history in the country that those who have fewer MLAs go on to become Chief Ministers,” Poonia was quoted as saying.Though Raje is said to have the support of around 40 MLAs, there are others in the running, including Union Ministers Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and state leaders like Om Mathur and Satish Poonia with their large network of party cadres and "Nagpur" connections.Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria is another hopeful, though he is above 75 years in age.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-rajasthan-assembly-session-on-august-14-bjp-effects-subtle-change-in-its-strategy-124660
10-08-2020||New Delhi||UGC in SC questions decisions by Delhi, Maharashtra to cancel exams amid COVID-19 pandemic||The UGC in the Supreme Court on Monday questioned the decisions of Delhi and Maharashtra governments to cancel final year exams of state universities amid the COVID-19 pandemic, saying they were against the rules.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan that states cannot change the rules of the University Grants Commission as only the UGC is empowered to prescribe rules for conferring degree.Mehta argued that not conducting exams will not be in the interest of students and degrees may not be recognized if the states would act unilaterally.The apex court was hearing a batch of pleas which have challenged the July 6 directive to all the universities and colleges to conduct final year examinations by September 30 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.During the hearing conducted through video-conferencing, Mehta informed the bench about the decisions of Delhi and Maharashtra to cancel final year exams of state universities.He said that the UGC would file its response on the affidavits filed by Maharashtra and Delhi in the matter.The bench granted time to the UGC to file a response and posted the matter for further hearing on August 14.Advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, appearing for some of the petitioners, claimed that the July 6 guideline for holding exams are neither legal or constitutionally valid.He also raised the issue regarding guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for educational institutions amid the pandemic.The top court had on July 31 refused to pass any interim order on the pleas.The UGC had earlier told the court that nobody should remain under the impression that since the Supreme Court is examining this issue, the final year /semester examination would be stayed.The solicitor general had informed the bench that out of over 800 universities in the country, 209 have completed the examinations while around 390 universities are in the process of conducting exams.The UGC had filed an affidavit in the apex court and justified its decision directing all universities and institutions to hold final year/semester examinations in September saying it was done to protect the academic future of students across the country.The UGC had said that in June this year, considering the evolving situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it requested the expert committee to revisit the April 29 guidelines, by which it had asked the universities and institutions to hold final year examinations in July 2020.The expert committee submitted a report recommending that terminal semester/final year examinations should be conducted by universities/ institutions by the end of September 2020 in offline (pen & paper)/ online/ blended (online + offline) mode, the UGC had said.It added that this report of the expert committee was deliberated and approved by the UGC in its emergent meeting held on July 6, since the conduct of the final year/terminal examination is a time-sensitive issue.Assailing the decisions of some states like Maharashtra and Delhi of cancelling the final year examinations, the commission had said that such decisions directly affect the standards of higher education and will be an encroachment on the legislative field of coordinating and determining the standards of higher education that is exclusively reserved for Parliament under Schedule VII of the Constitution.

10-08-2020||New Delhi||India is not for sale: Ex-hockey coach recalls Dhyanchand's response to Hitler||The date August 15 holds a great significance for every Indian around the world but 11 years before that day in 1947, the Indian flag flew highest in another part of the world -- Germany.At the 1936 Olympics, the players of the Indian hockey team were creating an unbelievable sort of frenzy around them, courtesy of their performances in front of packed arenas of Berlin.France felt the brunt of India's might in the semi-final, especially from Major Dhyanchand, who scored four of team's 10 goals to completely annihilate the European powerhouse. The stage was now set for India to take on hosts Germany on August 15. However, the mood inside the Indian camp wasn't that of excitement but of fear and anxiety. The reason being Adolf Hitler who was scheduled to watch the final along with more than 40,000 Germans.Come the fateful day, Dhyanchand ran riot in front of the fuhrer, and what followed next holds much more importance that just an Olympic gold."It was Dada Dhyanchand, called the wizard of hockey, who in 1936 Berlin Olympics had scored six goals against Germans as India had won 8-1. Hitler had saluted Dada Dhyanchand as he offered him to join the German Army," former India hockey coach Saiyed Ali Sibtain Naqvi told IANS."It was during the prize distribution ceremony and Dada was silent for a few seconds, even the packed stadium went completely silent and feared that if Dhyanchand refused the offer then the dictator might shoot him. Dada had narrated this to me that he replied to Hitler with closed eyes but in a bold voice of an Indian soldier that 'India is not for sale'."To the utter surprise of the entire stadium, Hitler saluted him, instead of shaking his hand and said, 'German nation salutes you for the love of your country India and your nationalism.'His title of 'Wizard of Hockey' was also conferred by Hitler. Such players are born rarely in centuries," he added.Naqvi also gave an insight into what differences he finds in hockey of yesteryear in comparison to contemporary times. India is still longing to recreate their age-old performance, especially in the Olympics, and while there have been some encouraging displays, the gulf in class between the two different generational teams is clearly apparent."The Indian team at present is being trained and coached by European and Australians and now are playing in the European style. They have changed the entire concept of artistic hockey and mainly concentrate on physical fitness," said Naqvi, who also coached the women's team at 1978 Women's World Cup in Madrid."The Australian coaches try to teach them a combination of European and Indian style which is why they are successful. Though the present Indian team is young but their performances are not consistent. It has been observed in some important and crucial matches they have lost the game in dying minutes. The defence crumbles against the fast European teams."During my time the Indian team players were masters of their positions and carried great confidence. They were artistic dribblers, masters in different strokes and they had great national spirit to fly the tricolours in Olympics. Each player was conferred and can achieve top form."Old team had master penalty corner and penalty strokes specialists such as Trilochan Singh, R.S Gentle, Prithipal Singh, Rajinder Singh and MP Singh. For example, in 1956 Melbourne Olympics, R.S Gentle rightfully brought back victory through penalty corner against Pakistan. Similarly in 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Mohinder Lal scored through penalty stroke and India won the Olympics," the former coach added.India are currently ranked fourth in the world following their string of consistent performances. They are now ready, according to Naqvi, to reclaim their throne at next year's Olympics in Tokyo."Yes, India is capable with young team led by Manpreet Singh as the captain. He is my favourite as well. It is expected that the team will be in the top four position. And the rest is on luck," the celebrated coach said.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-is-not-for-sale-ex-hockey-coach-recalls-dhyanchands-response-to-hitler-124646

10-08-2020||Mumbai||77 new butterfly species found in Matheran: BNHS||As many as 77 new species of butterflies have been found in the ecologically sensitive forest of Matheran hill station near Mumbai during a study conducted there over the last eight years, according to the Bombay Natural History Society.With this, the total number of butterfly species in the Matheran forest has now gone up to 140, city-based Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) scientist Mandar Sawant said.Matheran is spread over an area of 214.73 sq km and is located about 80 km from the Maharashtra capital.“The eight-year-long rigorous study undertaken by BNHS from 2011 to 2019 has resulted in the discovery of 77 new species of butterflies in Matheran,” the non-governmental research organisation said in a statement.“After a span of 125 years, for the first time such a study was undertaken to discover the flying beauties at Matheran,” it said.Scientists from BNHS and Somaiya Vidyavihar University here have published a research paper, titled ‘Finding the forgotten gems: Revisiting the butterflies of Matheran after 125 years, with the introduction to the novel colour barcode for depicting seasons and activity of the Indian butterflies’, in the community peer-reviewed Biodiversity Data Journal.A strong seasonal variation in butterfly diversity was observed. The maximum diversity of butterflies was recorded during winter, and the least during monsoon, BNHS said in its statement.“A high similarity of butterfly species composition was observed between the pairs of sites studied, tending towards perfect nestedness. This also emphasises the fact that butterfly diversity in the region is quite stable and chances of emigration to, or immigration from, surrounding regions are very low, the study said.“Further, we introduced a novel barcode system for denoting seasons and activities of Indian butterflies and hope this will help butterfly biologists to concisely and effectively present the data, the statement said.The research paper is an outcome of eight years of fieldwork with 22,833 observations and usage of colour barcoding system by Mandar Sawant, Dr Nikhil Modak and Sagar Sarang in the forests of Matheran, it added.In 1894, British researcher J A Betham surveyed the hills of Matheran for its butterfly diversity.He had reported 78 butterfly species back then and expressed hope that someone from Bombay (now Mumbai) would take up survey in future and might report some more butterflies, a BNHS official said, adding that they have now taken it a step forward.

10-08-2020||New Delhi||From Delhi to Mumbai, police officials scramble to save man showing 'suicidal activity' on Facebook||A timely alert by an Ireland-based Facebook staffer to Delhi police saved the life of a 27-year-old man, who was under financial stress because of the coronavirus lockdown and showing "suicidal activity" on the social media platform, officials said Sunday.The man had been posting videos on Facebook that apparently showed him preparing to end his life and this raised a red flag on the social media giant's network. Facebook feared any attempt to contact the man directly could drive him to expedite his suicide plans, officials said.So a company official contacted Delhi Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber) Anyesh Roy as the phone number used to create the Facebook account was registered in the national capital.The Facebook staffer shared the details of the "suicidal activity" with Roy on his email just before 8 pm Saturday, and what began then was a race against time to save the man.Police traced the phone number to a woman resident of east Delhi, the DCP said.Roy reached out to Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Jasmeet Singh and they immediately sent a police team to the address but found everything fine at the residence.The case then took a turn when the woman told the police officials the Facebook account was used by her husband who had left for Mumbai two weeks ago after a fight with her.She also said the man was working as a cook in a small hotel in Mumbai, police said.The woman had her husband's phone number but did not know his address.DCP Roy got in touch with his counterpart in Mumbai, DCP (Cyber) Rashmi Karandikar, but the man's phone number was found "unreachable".Karandikar said she received a phone call from Roy around 11 pm Saturday, more than three hours after the matter first came to light in Delhi."Our biggest challenge was to trace him and our priority was to reach him quickly because we were told he had put out at least four videos of himself preparing to end his life by hanging. Until 12.30 am, we were struck," Karandikar told PTI over the phone from Mumbai.The Mumbai police then asked the man's mother to video call him on WhatsApp, so that they would be able to trace his location, but the call got disconnected after a single ring."The man then contacted his mother through another number and that's how we traced his location. For an hour, one of my officers kept him engaged on a phone call and tried to convince him to not take any an extreme step," the senior Mumbai police officer said.By 1.30 am, a police team reached his address and counselled him.The man told Mumbai police that he was under severe financial distress for a few months because of lockdown and had fought with his wife. He said he was worried how would he be able to raise his recently born child and decided to end his life, the officer said.

This will result in massive hacking of trees, leading to destruction of habitats of thousands of endangered species,” said Rahul. He said the youth who have always been at the forefront of every battle to protect our environment must take up this cause.Begins ‘Rozgar Do’ driveNew Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday launched the Indian Youth Congress’ “Rozgar Do” campaign whereby the opposition party plans to attack the ruling BJP for failure to secure jobs and demand employment for crores of youth. Rahul said, “When PM Narendra Modi assumed office he promised to give 2 crore jobs every year. The reality is his policies have resulted in the loss of 14 crore jobs. Demonetisation, flawed goods and services tax and lockdown have crippled the economic sector of India.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centres-eia-draft-dangerous-rahul-124581

On the same day, his sister and prime accused in the case Rhea (28) was questioned by the agency for the first time for about eight hours.Rhea and her father Indrajit Chakraborty have been summoned to appear before the agency again on Monday.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday claimed “pressure tactics” were being used in the Sushant’s death case and the issue was being politicised as part of a conspiracy against Maharashtra. “It is wrong to see the unfortunate suicide of the actor from a political angle,” Raut said in his weekly column “Rokhthok” in the party mouthpiece “Saamana”.“If one wants to indulge in politicisation and pressure tactics, anything can happen in our country. It looks like the script of Sushant's case was already written. Whatever has happened behind the curtains is a conspiracy against Maharashtra,” Raut said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-questions-rheas-brother-in-pmla-case-124578

There is no doubt that Gautam Buddha was born in Lumbini, which is in Nepal,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava in a statement today.Jaishankar’s remarks came weeks after Nepal PM KP Oli had courted controversy by claiming that Lord Rama was born in Nepal and was a Nepali. On that occasion, Oli was criticised for his remarks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-walks-back-on-ministers-buddha-remark-124574

They had been living at the Lodta village farm, which they had hired for farming, for the past six months.“There was neither any injury mark on any of the bodies nor any evidences of any foul play.

The PM released the sixth installment on SundayAsserting that the government’s agri-reforms are focussed on empowering small farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday launched a financing facility of Rs 1 lakh crore under the Agri-Infra Fund that will help create post-harvest infrastructure in villages and generate jobs.He added, “The country does not face problems in farm production, but in post-harvest losses and therefore efforts are being made to strengthen post-harvest infrastructure facilities and ensure better income for farmers. Legal hurdles are being removed and major push for agri-reforms is being given to encourage investment in rural India for creating post-harvest linkages.”Modi launched the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund through a video-conference on the occasion of “Balram Jayanti”, a day when farmers worship plough. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and farmers from some states also participated in the video-conference.“The fund will help create better storage facilities and modern cold storage chains in villages. Many employment opportunities will get created in villages,” Modi said after the launch.The PM reiterated that India has a huge opportunity to invest in post-harvest management solutions like warehousing, cold chain and food processing and build a global presence in areas such as organic and fortified foods.He also mentioned that this scheme provides a good opportunity for startups in agriculture to avail the benefits and scale their operations, thereby creating an ecosystem that reaches farmers in every corner of the country.Modi also interacted with farmers from Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, who are among the initial beneficiaries of the credit facility under this new fund through Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) for creating post-harvest facilities.Under the Agri-Infra Fund, about Rs 1 lakh crore will be sanctioned under the financing facility in partnership with multiple lending institutions as loans to PACS, farmer groups, Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), agri-entrepreneurs, startups and agri-tech players.Already, 11 of the 12 public sector banks have signed initial agreements with the Ministry of Agriculture.Under the fund, about 3 per cent interest subvention and credit guarantee of up to Rs 2 crore will be provided to the beneficiaries to increase the viability of the projects. Loans will be disbursed in four years starting with a sanction of Rs 10,000 crore in the current year and Rs 30,000 crore each in the next three financial years.Citing reasons for poor investment in agri-infrastructure, the PM said there was “negligible” investment due to legal hurdles in the wake of a provision of stock limit under the Essential Commodities Act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-empower-small-farmers-pm-launches-rs1l-cr-finance-facility-124504

The DGCA issues show-cause notices, but these are seldom followed up. No action is taken for non-compliance. — Capt Mohan Ranganathan, Air Safety ExpertPeople involved in the processes need to be held accountable. In case of non-compliance of the safety norms, the authorities should shut down such airports or suspend operations till the norms are met, he says, adding only then will such airports wake up and act.Lawyer and aviation safety activist Yashwanth Shenoy blames the DGCA for the prevailing scenario. “The DGCA is the biggest violator of norms. It has been headed by an IAS officer who knows nothing about aviation. Nowhere in the world are administrators appointed civil aviation regulators.” A former DGCA official says airports need to follow the norms set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/airports-safe-only-on-paper-experts-124501

It also offers a great opportunity to the Indian industry to manufacture items on the ‘negative list’ by using its own capabilities or adopting the technologies designed by the DRDO. — Rajnath Singh, Defence MinisterAny item on the ‘negative list’ can now only be sourced from the domestic industry. Most of the items on the embargo list are already being produced by the public sector units or the private industry.The MoD will place orders worth Rs 4 lakh crore with the domestic industry over the next 5-7 years by cutting down on these imports. For now, India is a top importer of weapons and equipment.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced the policy on Sunday, saying that the embargo would be implemented in phases.Among the big orders for the domestic industry will be submarines, which would come under the import embargo by December 2021. A contract for six of these would be worth about Rs 42,000 crore. The likely embargo date for LCA MK-1A is December 2020. An order of 123 of these for the IAF with an approximate cost of Rs 85,000 crore will now go to domestic players. The embargo on imports will be progressively implemented from 2020 to 2024.The Department of Military Affairs (DMA) headed by the Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, prepared the list of 101 items. The Indian defence industry can either have its own design or adopt the technologies designed and developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation.The list was finalised by the MoD after several rounds of consultations with all stakeholders, including Army, Air Force, Navy, DRDO, Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), Ordnance Factory Board and the private industry. They assessed the current and future capabilities of the Indian industry for manufacturing.Barred imports: Warships, submarines, LCAThe banned items comprise not just simple parts but also some high technology weapon systems like artillery guns, assault rifles, warships, sonar systems, submarines, light transport aircraft, light combat helicopters, radars and light combat aircraft.Rs52k-cr budget for domestic purchaseThe MoD has bifurcated the capital procurement budget for 2020-21 into domestic and foreign routes.
