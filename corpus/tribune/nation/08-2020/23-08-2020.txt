Chaudhuri’s colleague, Gurudas Malik Thakur, another director of IIPM, has also been apprehended for the same offence and sent to 14 days in judicial custody.The probe is also on properties held by Chaudhuri and his company in Delhi and other cities and also overseas.This is not the first time Chaudhuri has been caught on the wrong side of the law as his famed institute, IIPM, had been in the news earlier as well for similar cases of financial irregularities.Chaudhuri was apprehended on March 14, 2020 for allegedly submitting a forged medical certificate after police asked him to join the probe with respect to a 2016 case. The doctor, whose signature was on the medical certificate, had died 10 years before the certificate was made. He was subsequently released on bail.Delhi Police had in 2015 registered an FIR against IIPM following the complaint of UGC that the institute was “misleading, cheating, and fooling” students as it was not recognised by any regulatory body. The UGC, in its complaint, had said despite the fact that its courses were not authorised, the institute was “fooling” students by charging hefty fees from them. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iipm-director-arindam-chaudhuri-arrested-for-rs-23-crore-tax-evasion-130359
23-08-2020||Gwalior||Scindia left Congress despite getting so much from party: Digvijaya||Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh on Sunday hit out at BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, saying that the latter left the Congress even as the party had given him “so much”.Singh said leaving Congress was not expected from Scindia and his move has dented the credibility in politics.Singh’s criticism of Scindia came on the day the ruling BJP claimed that as many as 35,843 Congress cadres joined the ruling party in the last two days of its three-day membership drive underway in Gwalior.However, Singh said that the Congress has grown much stronger in the Gwalior-Chambal region after Scindia quit the party.The BJP’s membership drive began in Gwalior on Saturday.Talking to reporters here on Sunday, state Energy Minister Pradhyuman Singh Tomar said, “As many as 35,843 Congress leaders and workers joined the BJP in two days in the presence of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and RS member Jyotiraditya Scindia.”The minister added that former Congress MP from Morena Barelal Jatav and former Congress MLA from Gwalior rural constituency Ramvaran Gurjar on Sunday joined the saffron party.The Congress, which had held a protest against the BJP’s membership drive when it was launched on Saturday, also organised a ‘dharna’ (sit-in) at the Rani Lakshmi Bai memorial here on Sunday.After taking part in the protest, Digvijaya Singh said “The Congress has given so much to Scindia, still he left the party. It was not expected from him. This has dented the credibility in politics.”“The massive protest of thousands of Congress cadres on Saturday against the BJP’s big membership drive on its opening day, speaks of the fact that the party has grown stronger after Scindia’s exit,” Singh told reporters in the afternoon.Congress media in-charge for Gwalior-Chambal region K K Mishra said that his party held the protest as the ruling BJP violated the COVID-19 protocols.“The BJP function in Gwalior is being held in violation of the lockdown rules imposed in the state to curb the spread of coronavirus,” he added.Meanwhile, Chouhan, Scindia, Union minister Narendra Tomar and state BJP president V D Sharma have been holding talks with the party’s public representatives and office-bearers in the region to chalk out a strategy for the yet-to-be announced bypolls for 27 seats in the state, 16 of them from Gwalior-Chambal region.Twenty-two Congress MLAs, mostly from the Scindia camp, resigned in March, reducing the Kamal Nath-led dispensation to a minority and paving the way for the BJP to form the government.Scindia and these former MLAs then joined the BJP.Last month, three more Congress MLAs resigned and joined the saffron party. Two other assembly seats have fallen vacant due to the death of legislators. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scindia-left-congress-despite-getting-so-much-from-party-digvijaya-130358

23-08-2020||New Delhi||Now, Garuda Prakashan to publish book on 2020 Delhi riots||Garuda Prakashan on Sunday said it will publish “Delhi Riots 2020: The Untold Story”, a day after Bloomsbury India announced withdrawing the upcoming book following outrage over a virtual pre-publication launch event featuring BJP leader Kapil Mishra.Garuda Prakashan, which claims to promote “indic narrative”, said the book is expected to hit the stands within 15 days.“Garuda Prakashan is committed to an authentic narrative of Indian history - both ancient and contemporary. It is sad to see that other publishers are being driven by extraneous events rather than the content of the book. We support eminent authors of the book to bring out the true picture of Delhi riots,” said Sankrant Sanu, CEO of Garuda Prakashan.Bloomsbury India on Saturday announced that it will not publish the book after there was outrage over a virtual pre-publication launch, which it said was being organised without its knowledge.The publishing house faced massive backlash online on Friday after an advertisement of the book launch on Saturday with BJP leader Mishra as a guest of honour did the rounds on social media.There have been allegations that several leaders including Mishra made inflammatory speeches targeting anti-citizenship law protesters before the violence broke out in northeast Delhi on February 23. Bloomsbury India issued a statement saying it strongly supports freedom of speech but also has a deep sense of responsibility towards society.The virtual event, where the book was “released” by BJP MP and national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, went ahead as scheduled with Mishra in attendance among other guests.The authors—advocate Monika Arora and Delhi University teachers Sonali Chitalkar and Prerna Malhotra—have thanked Garuda Prakashan for agreeing to publish the book and supporting freedom of expression.They have alleged that Bloomsbury UK was pressurised by some international authors and social activists for not publishing their book.“The book launch was planned on 22nd August, 4 pm. At 3:30 pm Bloomsbury India tells us that Bloomsbury UK has pressurised them to withdraw this book. They said that Bloomsbury UK was pressurised by international authors and other social activists who have tweeted and tagged Bloomsbury UK not to publish this book.“These people have not read this book and without reading they have pressurised Bloomsbury to withdraw the book. This is killing of freedom of expression. It is killing of writers’ right to write. We want to tell Bloomsbury UK that black lives matter, brown lives matter too,” the authors said in a joint statement.Publishing house Garuda Prakashan’s earlier books include “Urban Naxal” by director and author Vivek Agnihotri, “India Facts: Hindu Human Rights Report 2017” by author Mayank Patel, and “The English Medium Myth” by author Sankrant Sanu.

23-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi jeweller arrested for staging fake robbery to get loan waiver||A 40-year-old jeweller and his two associates staged a fake robbery of 2.6 kg gold at his office in central Delhi in order to get bank loans worth Rs 61 lakh waived off, police said on Sunday.Abhijeet Samanta, who has been in the jewellery business for the past four years, was not making much profit and it was further hit due to the coronavirus lockdown. Samanta and his associates—Farhan (38), a property dealer, and Munna (28), who works at a garage—staged a fake robbery, officials said.Munna executed the robbery by venturing into the office at Chandni Mahal wearing a burka and a toy gun, police said.The matter came to light after Samanta approached the police, alleging that a woman wearing a burka came inside his office on Saturday night and placed a gun on his head, according to the police.Samanta alleged that the woman slapped him, snatched Rs 50,000 from him and keys of lockers. She forced him to open the locker and later tied his hands, legs and mouth with the cloth. Thereafter, she fled with all the jewellery and cash.During investigation, the CCTV footages of different cameras were analysed and it was noticed that the entry of the woman was friendly and behaviour of the complainant was also suspicious, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Sanjay Bhatia said.After a six-hour interrogation, Samanta broke down and confessed about the entire conspiracy hatched by him along with his two associates, Bhatia said.Samanta said in order to expand his business, he had availed business loan worth Rs 61 lakh approximately from three different banks. He also got insured the gold stock, based on which he secured loans.Since 2018, his business was not going well and finally due to lockdown, he was not in a position to deposit the EMI, the DCP said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-jeweller-arrested-for-staging-fake-robbery-to-get-loan-waiver-130349

23-08-2020||New Delhi||Chorus grows for postponing entrance exams amid COVID-19 pandemic||The chorus for postponing various examinations, including the NEET and the JEE, grew louder on Sunday with over 4,000 students observing a day-long hunger strike to press for the demand in view of rising COVID-19 cases.The protest came on a day Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the government must listen to the ‘mann ki baat’ of students and arrive at “an acceptable solution” and his party demanded that the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) be deferred.According to the leftist All-India Students Association (AISA), over 4,200 students observed the day-long hunger strike at their respective home demanding that CBSE compartment exams of Classes 10 and 12 be cancelled and entrance exams such as the UGC-NET, CLAT, NEET and JEE be postponed.Using the hashtag, SATYAGRAHagainstExamInCovid, many students also took to Twitter to appeal to the government to heed to their demands.Manoj S, a JEE aspirant from Karnataka, said: “We have to report to the JEE exam centre at 7 am. My centre is almost 150 kilometres away and there are no train or bus services available currently. Many of my friends have said that their centres are 200 to 250 kilometres away. How are we supposed to travel? How will we write exams wearing masks for seven to eight hours?”He urged the government to postpone the exams till normalcy is restored.Anisha, hailing from Odisha, said with all the hotels and guest houses closed, where would they stay in case they have to travel for exams.“I am from Balasore and my NEET exam centre is in Bhubaneswar. I will have to travel for five hours to take my exam. There are no hotels or guesthouses that are open. Where will we stay?” she said.Siddh Dutt, who will be appearing for the CBSE compartment exam, said: “I am an asthma patient. I am scared of what may happen to me if I catch COVID-19.”Madhurima, who said she has to take four different entrance exams, wants authorities to listen to her appeal — “Please produce a vaccine so that we can take exams. I am a JEE, IISER, DUET aspirant and also have to take another entrance exam,” she said.Md Danish Khan from Bhagalpur in Bihar said he has been “allotted an exam centre in Patna, which is a COVID-19 hotspot”.“I do not want to risk the lives of my relatives by staying at their place when I go to take the exam. I also stay in a joint family and if I contract the virus, it will create a chain of infection,” he added.A Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) aspirant from Kolkata, who requested anonymity, said she fears for her parents' safety during this time.“My father is a diabetic and my mother just had an operation for a tumour. Even if they go to drop me to the exam centre using public transport, I will be putting them at risk. The government is not ready to listen to us. We will have to sit and write the exams wearing masks, gloves and headgear under hot weather conditions,” she said.Other students also shared similar woes and urged the government to postpone entrance exams and declare the academic year as a “zero year”.The AISA lent solidarity to the demands of the students.A day ago, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had appealed to the central government to cancel medical and engineering entrance exams JEE and NEET in view of the COVID-19 situation.He also said an alternative admission methodology should be used this year and the exams should not be conducted.On Friday, Education Ministry officials had said the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) and the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET-UG) will be conducted in September as scheduled.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16 when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. A nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into effect the next day and threw economic activities out of gear.India’s COVID-19 tally sprinted past the 30-lakh mark on Sunday, just 16 days after it crossed 20 lakh while 22,80,566 people have recuperated in the country so far pushing the recovery rate to 74.90 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data.

I, therefore, decline consent to initiate contempt proceedings against Swara Bhasker,” Venugopal said.Saxena and others have alleged that Bhasker made these statements at a panel discussion on February 1, 2020 organised by the Mumbai Collective. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ag-refuses-consent-for-initiating-contempt-action-against-swara-bhasker-130330
23-08-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Union minister feels Telangana lagging in Covid testing||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, August 23 The Union Minister of State for Home, G Kishan Reddy has charged the Telangana Government with not doing enough testing to curb COVID-19. Appreciating the recovery rate, the minister said there is a lot that needs to be done in terms of scanning the people who could be infected with the coronavirus. Reddy, who represents the Secundrabad Constituency is general critical of Chief Minister K Chandrashekahar Rao (KCR), but today he said the state had moved up considerably both in terms of development index and recovery of COVID-19 cases. “I wish the state move up in the list as it is rich and developed,” he said after the inauguration of a Blood Plasma Bank here. He disclosed that the Union Government has provided the state with 14 lakh N-95 masks, about 2,40,000 PPE kits and 1,400 ventilators, among other things to fight COVID-19 effectively. Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference with Chief Ministers of various states recently, the union minister said that the prime minister has stressed rigorous testing and the centre was willing to help the states. He defended the Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, who had in the past expressed displeasure over anti-COVID measures in the state by saying that being a medical doctor; she has made suggestions out of her experience. Neither the Centre nor the BJP has anything to do with the remarks of the Governor, he clarified. He asked the state government to ensure that local hospitals did not charges exorbitant rates for treatment from COVID-19 patients.  He, however, noted that Telangana was at seventh place from the bottom among all states in testing; Kishan Reddy wished the state to move up in the list as it was “rich and developed”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-minister-feels-telangana-lagging-in-covid-testing-130329

23-08-2020||Guwahati||Ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi may be BJP’s CM candidate in Assam: Tarun Gogoi||Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi, who headed benches that pronounced several key judgements, including the Ayodhya land dispute case, might be the BJP’s chief ministerial candidate in Assam in the Assembly election next year, veteran Congress leader Tarun Gogoi has claimed.The BJP, however, denied the former three-time state chief minister’s assertion on Ranjan Gogoi, who was nominated as a Rajya Sabha member by the government in March.If the former CJI could go to the Rajya Sabha, he might also agree to be the next chief ministerial candidate of the BJP in Assam, said Tarun Gogoi.“I have heard from several sources that Ranjan Gogoi’s name is there in the list of BJP candidates for the chief minister’s post. I suspect that he might be projected as the next possible chief ministerial candidate,” he said.Ranjan Gogoi, who is the son of former Assam CM Kesab Chandra Gogoi, could have easily become the chairman of the Human Rights Commission or other rights bodies, but he accepted the Rajya Sabha membership as “he has political ambition”, the Congress leader claimed.“The BJP was happy with Ranjan Gogoi for the Ayodhya land dispute case judgment. It won’t be surprising if he agrees to be the next CM candidate for the BJP,” Tarun Gogoi said on Saturday.Gogoi headed a bench which delivered the verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case that gave Hindus the 2.77-acre disputed land for construction of Ram temple and directed that Muslims be given a 5-acre land at a “prominent location” to build a mosque in the city.The BJP, however, said what the 85-year-old Congress leader said was not true.“People say many meaningless things when they become very old. There is no truth in what Tarun Gogoi said about the former CJI becoming the BJPs chief ministerial candidate,” the saffron party’s state unit president Ranjeet Kumar Dass said.Tarun Gogoi also said he was not going to be the chief ministerial candidate of the Congress.“I will contest the elections but I will not be the chief ministerial candidate. There are several qualified candidates in the party for that. I can only be a guiding force or act as an advisor,” he said.A common candidate can also be projected from the proposed ‘grand alliance’ comprising the Congress, the AIUDF, the Left and other like-minded political parties, he said.

23-08-2020||---||Congress government in Rajasthan betrayed people: BJP chief Nadda||Jaipur, August 23BJP national president J P Nadda on Sunday accused the Congress government in Rajasthan of inaction, betraying people and failing to provide relief to them during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown.Addressing the party’s Rajasthan unit leader and workers through a video conference, he said the rising crime graph was a symbol of crumbling administration.“The Ashok Gehlot government has proved inactive during the lockdown. Instead of providing relief, the government has betrayed people,” Nadda said.He also said, “Rising crime graph in the state is a symbol that the administration is crumbling and the government did nothing except for nepotism”. The BJP chief claimed that there has been an increase in the crime rate in the state as atrocities against women have increased by 122 per cent compared to last year and crimes against dalits and tribals grew by 92 per cent and 101 per cent respectively.“I am putting these figures in front of you because this is a reflection of the inhumanity of the Gehlot government, the nepotism, the collapse of the government structure,” he alleged.In an apparent reference to the recent political crisis in the state in which Congress MLAs were holed up in hotels, Nadda said while the people of the state were struggling with coronavirus, Congress leaders were watching movies in hotel rooms and making Italian dishes.“The chief minister and his deputy did not meet for the last 18 months. Now, there has been an agreement (between Gehlot and Sachin Pilot)... don’t know on what grounds it has been done and how long it will last. Gehlot tried levelling allegations on the BJP. They failed to manage their house and were fighting among themselves, but blamed the BJP,” he added.He asked the state unit of the BJP to apprise the public about the work done by the Centre.“The state unit should be concerned with motivating workers. The commitment level should be high and this will happen only when we give them political content,” he said.He asked the state BJP chief to form WhatsApp groups of party representatives at all 52,000 electoral booths.In these WhatsApp groups, schemes launched by the central government and local issues should be discussed, he said.BJP state president Satish Poonia claimed that farmer organisations’ are agitated as the Rs 833 subsidy, which was given to them during the tenure of the previous government, has been stopped.

23-08-2020||Kolkata||BJP to fight Bengal elections without projecting Chief Minister face: Vijayvargiya||The BJP will not project any chief ministerial candidate for West Bengal Assembly polls and bank on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development plank to fight against the TMC, the party’s Bengal minder, Kailash Vijayvargiya, said.The saffron camp will pick its chief minister, once voted to power, he said on Sunday.“As of now, it has been decided that we won’t project anyone as our chief ministerial face. We will fight under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and win the election. Once voted to power, the legislative party in consultation with central leadership will decide on its chief ministerial choice,” Vijayvargiya told PTI.Asked if the party has anyone in mind for the post, he said that “time has the answer”.“Right now, our target is to win 220-230 seats in the 294-member Assembly. We will achieve our target as we did in the Lok Sabha polls. The issue of projecting a CM face won’t be a factor,” he said.Incidentally, in 2016, too, the BJP had fought the Assembly polls without any CM face. But a lot of water has flown under the Howrah Bridge over the last four years, with the saffron party having emerged as the prime challenger of the ruling TMC in Bengal, by pushing the traditional opposition parties—the CPI (M) and the Congress—to distant third and fourth positions.The saffron camp reached its all-time high in Bengal politics last year when it stunned political pundits by bagging 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state, four less than the ruling TMC, and with a staggering vote share of 41 per cent.According to BJP sources, the decision of anointing a chief ministerial face before elections could be a double-edged sword for the party, so it would “be wiser to rely on the negatives of the opposition camp” to win the elections.“We will fight elections on the development plank of Narendra Modi and by highlighting the failures of the TMC government. Elections are won and lost depending on the performance of the incumbent government. That is what had happened in 1977 and 2011 when the Left Front was voted to power and also when it lost the polls,” a senior BJP leader said.In several states where the BJP has seized power, such as Haryana, Maharashtra, Manipur, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, the party didn’t have any CM candidate during the polls, he said.Noted political analyst Biswanath Chakraborty also echoed the same sentiments.“If you take a look at elections, both at the state-level and the Centre, a face is not always that important, it’s the negative votes and anti-incumbency against the present-day government that makes the difference,” Chakraborty told PTI.According to state BJP sources, a few names have been doing rounds in the party, but the leadership is yet to take a final call on the matter and will wait for the poll results.“Dilip Ghosh tops the chart, as it is during his tenure as the state BJP chief that the party witnessed such a meteoric rise. He has a strong RSS background, too. The names of Swapan Dasgupta, MP and a noted member of the BJP intellectual cell, and Tathagatha Roy, former governor and ex-state president, have also been doing the rounds. But nothing has been finalised.“Now, whether the party top brass has any hidden trump card up its sleeves, only time will tell,” a senior state BJP leader said.When contacted, Ghosh said, “The BJP in Bengal is not driven by an individual, unlike the TMC.” Tathagatha Roy, who is hoping to make a comeback in active politics, and Dasgupta declined to comment.According to BJP sources, the anointment of a chief ministerial candidate would open up a pandora’s box in the party’s state unit.“The issue of zeroing in on a CM can cut both ways; if you anoint someone, he will have to carry the onus of both victory and defeat. Secondly, the other factions might not take it positively, and it might adversely affect our poll prospects,” another senior state BJP leader said.The Trinamool Congress, however, feels it would be tough for the opposition to dislodge the Mamata Banerjee government without projecting a credible face as her contender.“Bengal has always voted for a credible leader, be it in the opposition camp or the ruling party. This has been the trend since the days of B C Roy, Siddhartha Sankar Roy, Jyoti Basu, Buddhadeb Bhattacharya and now Mamata Banerjee. The BJP not having a credible face against Banerjee will be an added advantage for us,” senior TMC MP and spokesperson Sougata Roy told PTI.Senior state Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharya said a party needs to depend on its organizational strength and the “anti-government wave” to win elections, in the absence of a CM candidate.The CPI (M), however, feels that more than the face, it is the “policies and the ideologies” of a party that make all the difference.

They were denied ration from a local shop and barred from attending social events,” he said.Steps were taken to resolve the issue after representatives of the Dalit families approached the police and the district administration a few days ago, the sub-collector of Kamakhyanagar sub-division, BP Acharya, said.They also submitted memoranda to the administration and the police, the sub-collector added.The village comprises over 700 families, of which 40 belong to the Scheduled Caste Naik community, the official said.“The girl’s father claimed that the Dalit representatives had also tendered an apology following the incident but still they were subjected to the social boycott,” he said.Sarpanch Pranabandhu Das admitted that the villagers were asked not to communicate with the Dalit families but claimed that the restrictions were limited to only that.He said the matter between the two groups was bound to be resolved in due course of time, adding that members of the majority community did not intend to “invite trouble” keeping in mind the provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.Acharya said a peace meeting was held between the two groups in the village in the presence of senior district administration and police officials on Friday and the issue was resolved.Both groups arrived at a compromise forgetting the bitterness of the past and normalcy had been restored in the village, he said.Dundung said the police did not file an FIR over the issue as both sides wanted to arrive at a compromise and sort out the matter.

23-08-2020|| Thiruvananthapuram||Daughter of migrant worker from Bihar aces varsity exam in Kerala||Getting a university first rank was never in the mind of Payal Kumari, daughter of a migrant worker from Bihar who topped the BA Archaeology course in the Kerala-based Mahatma Gandhi University, surmounting all odds, including financial woes.Paying the annual college fee of Rs 3,000 itself was a big problem for her family, which migrated to Kerala nearly two decades ago, but thanks to good samaritans including, her teachers, she overcame the hurdle and has now set her eyes on post-graduation in the prestigious JNU and on civil services.Congratulatory messages have been pouring in for Kumari with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan calling her up on Saturday and praising her for her achievement.“College fees was a problem and arranging around Rs 3,000 for each year in the institution was a big task. But there were good samaritans who lent a helping hand,” said Kumari, who passed out of the Marthoma Women’s College in Perumbavoor near Kochi in flying colours with 85 per cent marks this year.Kumari’s father Pramod Kumar, hailing from Gosaiymati village in Sheikhupura District in Bihar, had reached Kerala 19 years ago seeking a better life for his family.Driven by the desire to ensure good education for his three children, Kumar slogged all these years, making Kerala his second home.All praise for her History lecturer Priya Kurian, Payal said the teacher had paid her first year fees learning about the plight of her family, living in a two-bedroom rented house at Edappally in Kochi.In the following two years also teachers helped her and they were more confident she would do well in the final year, Kumari said, speaking in fluent Malayalam and English.“I knew I had done well, but did not expect to get a rank,” she told PTI, adding her parents always encouraged her.Kumari is keen to do her postgraduate studies in the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi and also has plans to prepare for the Civil Services.Her father and mother Bindu Devi have always encouraged her to study as much as she wanted and there had never been pressure for marriage, she said.“My parents were very happy with the result. They told me to continue studying and do much better in life,” she said.She was four when her family shifted to Kalamassery near Kochi. The tongue twisting Malayalam language was at first difficult, but she soon learnt it along with her elder brother Akash Kumar, who is now employed, and sister Pallavi Kumari, presently doing Bsc Physics.But at home, the family speaks in Hindi, as parents do not know much Malayalam, she said.“I am confident in Hindi, English and Malayalam,” Kumari said.Vijayan spoke to Kumari over the phone and congratulated her saying her achievement was a matter of pride and joy for the state.“Her achievement is a matter of pride and great joy for us.  This shows that the steps taken by the state for the welfare of the guest workers never went in vain. I wish her all the success for her future endeavours,” he said.Mizoram Governor P S Sreedharan Pillai and state Agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar have also sent messages, she said.Finance Minister Dr T M Thomas Isaac took to Twitter, saying he was proud of her.“Payal Kumari, daughter of Pramod, a migrant worker from Bihar, graduates from MG university Kerala with first rank BA Archaeology and History (85 % marks). She hails from Gosaimaty village in Shaikpura district. She wants to join JNU. Feel so proud of you Payal. Congratulations,” he tweeted.Senior Congress leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor said Payal’s success was another story of inclusive India from Kerala.“Another story of #InclusiveIndia from Kerala! Payal Kumari, daughter of a migrant labourer from Bihar, wins first rank in the BA (History and Archaeology) exams of Mahatma Gandhi University in Kerala. Congratulations Payal!” Tharoor tweeted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/daughter-of-migrant-worker-from-bihar-aces-varsity-exam-in-kerala-130307

In a tweet in Hindi, Priyanka Gandhi said: “The COVID-19 situation in the country is yet to normalise. In such a situation, if students who are taking NEET and JEE, and their parents have raised concerns, then these should be taken into consideration by the government and those conducting these exams.”कोरोना को लेकर देश में परिस्थितियां अभी सामान्य नहीं हुईं हैं। ऐसे में अगर NEET और JEE परीक्षा देने वाले छात्र-छात्राओं व उनके अभिभावकों ने कुछ चिंताएं जाहिर की हैं तो भारत सरकार व टेस्ट कराने वाली संस्थाओं को उस पर सही से सोच विचार करना चाहिए#SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid  Chowdhury requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and postpone the exams.“The aspirants of the national examination are under tremendous mental pressure as to how they could remain immune to the infection while attending the examination physically. Right at this pandemic situation, their concerns should be given due consideration. The spectre of corona will be haunting the students during the examination period stretching from September 1 to 6,” he said in his letter.Chowdhury said when the country was witnessing a spike of COVID-19 infection with a single-day rise of 70,000 cases, “I think it is absolutely necessary to review the date of the exam because approximately 25 lakh students are supposed to participate in the exam, hence I thought it prudent to knock the door of the wisdom of Prime Minister of India”.“Your sagacious intervention may bring about the relief of those anxious aspirants. My suggestion to you Prime Minister is that the examination could be deferred for a certain period till the situation is stable,” he added.Former HRD Minister Kapil Sibal also tweeted: “Stop this injustice. NEET-JEE Entrance Exams. Elitist approach. The poor discriminated. Digital divide. Jeopardising lives. Reaching exam sites hazardous. Poor connectivity and more. Only just, fair and sensible solution is to postpone: NEET, JEE.”STOP THIS INJUSTICENEET - JEE Entrance Exams Elitist approachThe poor discriminated Digital divideJeopardising lives Reaching exam sites hazardous Poor connectivity & more Only just , fair and sensible solution is to postpone:NEETJEE  The Supreme Court on Monday had dismissed a plea seeking postponement of JEE (Main) April 2020 and NEET-Undergraduate examinations, which are scheduled to be conducted in September, amid a spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases, saying the precious year of students “cannot be wasted” and life has to go on.The JEE (Main) is scheduled to be held between September 1 and 6, while the JEE (Advanced) on September 27.

He, however, added that no suicide note had been recovered.The bodies were sent for post-mortem and a probe was underway in the case from all angles, he said.Khargapur area police inspector Sunil Sharma said according to the initial investigation, Soni, who retired from the state’s veterinary services, recently sold two acres of land and his son Manohar wanted money from him to buy a shop to earn his livelihood.Soni was averse to his son’s idea following which their relationship turned sour, he said.A detailed investigation was on in the case, he added.On getting information about the incident, Collector Subhash Dwivedi and Khare reached the spot.

It is likely to start the trials next week.In a tweet in Hindi, Vardhan said on Saturday: “I hope that if everything goes well, India will get a coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year.”Meanwhile, the apex health research body, ICMR, is in the process of developing an online vaccine portal which will provide information related to COVID-19 vaccine development in India and abroad, with the majority of the updates in several regional languages in addition to English.“The aim of creating the website is to provide all information and updates relating to the COVID-19 vaccine development on one platform as all the information in this regard is scattered as of now,” Samiran Panda, head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the ICMR, told PTI on Saturday.“The idea behind making the updates available in regional languages is to make sure that every citizen is able to access the information. The portal is likely to be functional by next week,” Panda said.With a single-day spike of 69,239 infections, India’s COVID-19 caseload mounted to 30,44,940 on Sunday while the death toll climbed to 56,706 with 912 fatalities being reported in 24 hours, the data updated at 8 am showed.

23-08-2020||Thane||Maharashtra: Hospital’s licence suspended for overcharging patients||The licence of a hospital treating COVID-19 patients at Kalyan here in Maharashtra has been suspended for allegedly overcharging patients and violation of other government orders, an official said on Sunday.The Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) had received several complaints from patients about Sridevi Hospital charging them exorbitant amounts, the civic body’s spokesperson Madhuri Phophale said.Hence, on the directives of KDMC Commissioner Dr Vijay Suryavanshi, its licence was suspended on Saturday by Additional Municipal Commissioner Sunil Pawar till August 31 or till the hospital complies with the official orders, she said.The order stated that hemodialysis facility at the hospital will continue, but admission of new patients has been prohibited.Also, KDMC’s medical officer Sameer Sarvankar has been appointed the hospital’s administrator with immediate effect for keeping a tab on its activities and compliance with the government norms, the order said.A show-cause notice was earlier issued to the private hospital and it was also warned, Phophale said, adding that KDMC’s flying squad had come across several alleged irregularities at the medical facility.She said the hospital did not report to the civic body about the treatment of COVID-19 patients at the 24-bed facility in July this year.The reply given by the hospital to the notice did not cover the objections raised by KDMC and the facility also supported its excess billings, the official said.KDMC’s Chief Accounts and Finance Officer S K Ubale, who oversees the activities of hospitals within the civic limits, said this medical facility did not maintain a record of beds as per the 80:20 norm, and did not inform the patients about the same.Notably, private hospitals have been asked to charge regular government rates for first 80 per cent beds and thereafter permitted to fix their charges for the remaining 20 per cent beds.Ubale said the hospital did not co-operate with the civic team constituted to inspect the bills raised by the hospital, and had not given a single bill for verification so far despite several reminders.The staff at the hospital also behaved arrogantly with the inspection team, he said.

23-08-2020||New Delhi||India’s COVID-19 recovery rate nears 75 pc, case fatality rate one of the lowest globally at 1.86 pc||Recoveries among the COVID-19 patients in the country surged to 22,80,566 on Sunday, pushing India’s recovery rate to nearly 75 per cent while the case fatality rate reduced to 1.86 per cent — one of the lowest globally, the Union Health Ministry said.“The constantly rising number of recoveries has ensured that the active cases of coronavirus infection, which is the ‘actual caseload’ of the country, currently comprises only 23.24 per cent of the total cases,” it said.“This has also resulted in a gradually falling mortality rate. Currently, at 1.86 per cent, India’s case fatality rate (CFR) is one of the lowest globally,” the Ministry said.Also read: 69,239 fresh cases push India Covid tally past 30-lakh markWith 57,989 patients recuperating from COVID-19 in a day, recoveries have surged to 22,80,566 and exceed the total number of active cases of coronavirus infection by nearly 16 lakh (1,572,898). The national recovery rate has increased to 74.90 per cent.Meanwhile, testing over eight lakh samples for six days in a row, India’s total COVID-19 tests have touched 3.52 crore while the average daily positivity rate has come down from 9.67 per cent during August 3 to 9 to 7.67 pc over the last week, the Centre said on Sunday.So far, 3,52,92,220 samples have been tested for detection of COVID-19 with 8,01,147 being tested on Saturday.The steep rise in testing was a result of effective implementation of the aggressive testing strategy of the Centre through a focussed and graded approach, the Ministry said.“The rising average daily tests during the past three weeks present a strong depiction of the progress made in the enhancement of COVID-19 tests across the country. The rise in daily testing has been followed by a decrease in the average daily positivity rate,” the Health Ministry highlighted.Keeping a sharp focus on the ‘test, track and treat’ policy, tests per million population have seen a boost, touching 25,574 as on date.“It is only by aggressive testing that positive cases can be identified, their contacts tracked in a timely manner and promptly isolated, as well as the severe and critical patients provided the needed clinical treatment,” the Ministry said.“The testing strategy also ensured a steady expansion of the laboratory network. Today, with 983 labs in the government sector and 532 private labs, a total of 1515 labs are providing comprehensive testing facilities to the people,” the Ministry added.The increasing recovery rate and declining case fatality rate have been made possible because of “comprehensive and sustained effectiveness of the Centre’s policy of testing aggressively, tracking comprehensively and treating efficiently”.“Higher number of recoveries and declining mortality rate among COVID patients have shown that India’s graded and pro-active strategies are delivering results on the field,” the ministry underlined.With a single-day spike of 69,239 infections, India’s COVID-19 caseload mounted to 30,44,940 while the death toll climbed to 56,706 with 912 fatalities being reported in a span of 24 hours, the data updated at 8 am showed.

23-08-2020||Chandigarh||Amarinder opposes challenge to Gandhi family leadership, says India needs a strong, united opposition||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has opposed the bid by some Congress leaders to challenge the Gandhi family leadership of the party saying that the country needed a strong opposition against the BJP-led NDA that was out to destroy the country’s Constitutional ethos and democratic principles and that this was not the time for such issues.In a statement issued here on Sunday, the veteran Congress leader said the NDA’s success was attributable to the absence of a strong and united Opposition, and the move by these Congress leaders to demand an overhaul of the party at this critical juncture would be detrimental to its interests, and the interests of the nation. India is currently facing not just external dangers from across the border but also internal threats to its federal structure, he said, adding that a unified Congress alone could protect the country and its people.Terming the demand for leadership change as untenable, Captain Amarinder noted the immense contribution of the Gandhi family to the country’s progress since it achieved freedom from the British rule. “What Congress needs is a leadership that is acceptable not to just a few but to the entire party, through its rank and file, and the nation at large,” he said, adding that the Gandhis were the right fit for this role.“Sonia Gandhi should continue to helm the Congress as long as she wanted,” he said, and added that Rahul should thereafter take over as he was fully competent to lead the party.“The Gandhis were the only universally recognisable face of the Congress, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari,” Smarinder Singh said. “Electoral defeats cannot be the yardstick for leadership change,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amarinder-opposes-challenge-to-gandhi-family-leadership-says-india-needs-a-strong-united-opposition-130297
23-08-2020||New Delhi||Leadership debate: Congress must give consensus a chance, says Salman Khurshid||Amid calls from within the Congress to hold polls for presidency, senior leader Salman Khurshid on Sunday said the party should give consensus a chance instead of elections which create divisiveness.Khurshid also said Rahul Gandhi enjoys the “full support” and “endorsement” of party leaders and workers, and it does not matter whether he wears the label of a president or not.“I have said very clearly that the Gandhis are leaders of the Congress. Nobody can deny this, even the opposition cannot deny this. I am quite happy having a leader, I don’t worry about whether or not we have a president, we have a leader (in Rahul Gandhi) and that is comforting for me,” the former Union minister told PTI in an interview.His remarks assume significance as they come just ahead of the meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision making body, which is likely to deliberate on the leadership issue that is in the spotlight with Sonia Gandhi completing a year as interim chief.Also, 23 Congress leaders, including some ex-ministers have written to party president Sonia Gandhi for the overhaul of the organisational structure.Asked about the section of party leaders calling for elections to the CWC and presidency, Khurshid hit out at those asking for internal polls, saying why are people so anxious to make these demands in the Congress when they are not made in any other party.“I am very surprised. I have not heard a single demand being made in the Communist party or in the regional parties or in the BJP. I have not heard about demand for elections in any of those parties,” Khurshid said.“Elections are important, but the historical context in which elections have to be held, circumstances, have to be taken into account. Consensus has been an important part of the political process in the Congress,” he said.Giving up consensus and opting for elections, without reflecting upon the implications and consequences might be running into “unknown, unchartered territory”, he said.Khurshid also said that such issues should be discussed within the party and not outside it.His comments come days after Shashi Tharoor had said that he has been advocating elections to the CWC and for the post of the president as it would certainly have a number of beneficial outcomes for the party.Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit had also said recently that it is “high time” that the Congress appoints a full-time president by “selection or election”.Asked if consensus was the way forward instead of internal polls, Khurshid said, “My instinct says this. My understanding of the Congress says that consensus is extremely important.” “People react to that by saying that you are being anti-democratic. I don’t know if consensus is in some way an undemocratic thing to happen. It should be a genuine consensus. Of course it should not be a forced consensus. I think we should give consensus a chance,” he said.On whether polls can lead to divisiveness in the party, Khurshid said elections do divide.Elections, in the right spirit, should not divide, but the ground reality is that elections do divide, he said.“So, let us just hope we gradually mature to a stage where elections will not divide,” he said.Asked if Rahul Gandhi should come back as party chief, Khurshid said it was up to him to make his decision and leaders should allow him to take a call.“When you give someone your allegiance as a leader then you have to listen to the leader and whatever the leader wants to do. There is a view in a large number of people that he should not stay away from presidentship of the party,” he said.Noting that Gandhi has his own reasons to keep himself away from the presidentship, Khurshid said party leaders should respect his decision and not in any way create a situation that becomes difficult for him.“Let us wait for him to take a call, I think he understands what people’s expectations and hopes are and I think he will respond to those hopes,” he said.Asked about Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s remarks carried in a book endorsing Rahul Gandhi’s views that the party should have a non-Gandhi president and whether that person would be under pressure of the Gandhis, Khurshid said where is the question of pressure as there “may be a president who is a non-Gandhi, but there will also be a leader who is a Gandhi”.“Even the president will have to accept ‘the leader’ Gandhi. You cannot choose a leader who is already chosen. People have given full support and have given their endorsement to Mr Rahul Gandhi and that will remain a fact,” he said.“Whether he (Rahul) wears the label of a president or he doesn’t wear the label of a president, he remains a leader,” Khurshid said.If Rahul Gandhi is a leader, surely, he should also be respected for his views on what the presidential structure or what the organisational structure should be in the future, he said.Khurshid said if Rahul Gandhi is the leader and he gives respect to a president, everybody will give respect to the president, he said.The party should not be breast-beating about the leadership issue and it will get resolved, Khurshid said.

23-08-2020||New Delhi||Bihar assembly polls on time: EC sources||The assembly elections in Bihar, due later this year, would be held on time, highly placed sources in the Election Commission said on Sunday amid demands by some political parties for postponing the polls in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.The term of the 243-member Bihar legislative assembly comes to an end on November 29.Indications are that the polls could be held sometime in October-November."Bihar elections are definitely happening on time," a senior official of the poll panel said on Sunday.The state's principal opposition party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, has questioned the need for holding the elections amid the pandemic. The Lok Janshakti Party, a constituent of the ruling NDA, has urged the poll panel to postpone the polls in view of the pandemic.Some other parties like the NCP and the National People's Party to have demanded postponing the elections.Political parties had recently responded to a letter from the EC seeking suggestions on how to conduct campaigning during the pandemic for the upcoming Bihar elections and certain other by-elections.Last week, the Commission had come out with a set of broad guidelines to hold elections and by-elections amid the pandemic.Voters will be provided with gloves to press electronic voting machine (EVM) buttons and COVID-19 patients in quarantine will be allowed to vote at the last hour of the polling day, according to the guidelines issued by the EC.A separate set of guidelines would be issued for voters who are residing in areas notified as COVID-19 "containment zone".The commission has recommended mandatory sanitisation of polling stations, preferably a day before polling.Thermal scanners would be placed at the entry point of every polling station. Polling or paramedical staff will conduct thermal screening of voters at the entry point of a polling station, it said.In case an election cannot be held before the term of the assembly ends, the EC seeks a certificate from the Law Ministry to postpone the elections, detailing the reasons.The state then comes under the central rule in the absence of an elected legislature.

23-08-2020||Chennai||DMK alleges AYUSH secretary asked non-Hindi participants to leave meeting||Another row over Hindi has erupted in Tamil Nadu with the DMK alleging yoga and naturopathy practitioners from the state were asked to leave a virtual meet held by the AYUSH department if they did not understand the language and seeking action against officials concerned.The episode “exposed” the BJP-led government’s agenda of imposing Hindi through its officials, the Dravidian party chief M K Stalin alleged while party MP Kanimozhi wrote to AYUSH Minister Shripad Yesso Naik seeking an inquiry.It comes close on the heels of Kanimozhi’s recent claim that a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Personnel had asked her if she was an Indian as she could not speak Hindi, which brought back the debate on “Hindi imposition”.Stalin, in a statement, alleged Ayush secretary Rajesh Kotecha with “arrogance and chauvinism for Hindi intimidated 37 yoga and naturopathy physicians to leave an online training session if they did not know Hindi” and condemned it.“It is shameful that a senior government official in the rank of secretary has behaved in such an uncivilised fashion prompted by linguistic chauvinism,” Stalin said on Saturday.He urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that such an incident did not recur and asked Chief Minister K Palaniswami to exert pressure on Modi to conduct the Central government’s training programmes and meetings only in English.“The BJP government at the Centre is continuously working by thrusting Hindi as its first agenda,” and slighting other languages, particularly the classical Tamil, he alleged.The AYUSH official would not have behaved in such a manner if prompt action had been taken against the CISF official for ‘questioning’ his sister and MP Kanimozhi for not knowing Hindi at the airport, he said.Kanimozhi had alleged a woman CISF official who interacted with her on August 9 at the  airport here asked her if she was an Indian as she did not speak in Hindu.The CISF officials later maintained the woman officer “had not uttered” the words as alleged by the DMK MP but just said “Hindi is also an Indian or official language”.They also had said the force would take “enhanced efforts” to deploy more personnel who know the local language.Stalin said when the remarks of officials, one after the other was examined, it “exposed the BJP-government’s agenda of imposing Hindi” through them.Also, the Centre’s declaration that no language would not be imposed vis-a-vis the National Education Policy is an “eyewash” and this has become clear, he said.Kanimozhi, in a letter to Naik, said the AYUSH secretary addressed the meet in Hindi and demanded an inquiry and action against “all officials who have acted in a manner discriminating (against) our fellow citizens on the basis of language.”She wanted the Minister to direct officials in his ministry to communicate in English in all official events and wherever Hindi was used, English translation should be provided.“Further, I would like to remind you about the promise made by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 7th August 1959 on the floor of Lok Sabha that as long as the non-Hindi speaking states require English as an associate language, it will continue for an indefinite period,”  she said.

23-08-2020||New Delhi||412 infrastructure projects show cost overruns of Rs 4.11 lakh-crore||As many as 412 infrastructure projects, each worth at least Rs 150 crore, have reported total cost overruns of over Rs 4.11 lakh crore, according to data from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.The data showed that as of July 1, out of 1,683 central sector infrastructure projects costing Rs 150 crore and above, 412 projects reported cost overruns while 471 have been delayed.Only nine of the total projects are ahead of their schedule and 224 are on schedule. The report noted that 182 projects reported both time and cost overruns with respect to their original project implementation schedules."Total original cost of implementation of the 1,683 projects was Rs 20,65,336.20 crore and their anticipated completion cost likely to be Rs 24,77,167.67 crore, which reflects overall cost overruns of Rs 4,11,831.47 crore (19.94 per cent of original cost). The expenditure incurred on these projects till June 2020 is Rs 11,21,435.29 crore, which is 45.27 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects," it said.The 'Flash Report On Central Sector Projects' noted that the number of delayed projects decreases to 418, if the delay is calculated on the basis of the latest schedule of completion. Further, for 979 projects, neither the year of commissioning nor the tentative gestation period has been reported, it said.The average time overrun in these delayed projects is 43.34 months, as per the report.Various project implementing agencies attributed time overruns in project implementation to delays in land acquisition and environment clearances, lack of infrastructure support and linkages, delay in tie-ups for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, changes in scope and delays in tendering among other factors.The report said that it has been observed that project agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time or cost overrun figures are "underreported". — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/412-infrastructure-projects-show-cost-overruns-of-rs-4-11-lakh-crore-130291
23-08-2020||Ahmedabad||Homeopathic drug given to half of Gujarat population since March||The Gujarat health department has said it distributed homeopathic drug Arsenicum Album-30 to more than half of the state's population as prophylaxis since March after the outbreak of COVID-19.In its presentation made before the World Health Organisation on August 20 on Gujarat's COVID-19 prevention strategy, the health department said it distributed Arsenicum Album-30 to 3.48 crore people, which is more than half of the state's population of 6.6 crore.There is no scientific evidence that the drug works against COVID-19, a fact stressed not only by medical scientists but by some homeopathic practitioners themselves.The state government also claimed that 99.6 percent of people who availed AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) remedies as prophylaxis during their quarantine period tested negative for coronavirus.In its presentation, which was shared with the media, the health department said "AYUSH interventions have proven to be immunity boosters, and the AYUSH treatment protocol was developed and research carried out for assessing the efficacy of treatment.""As many as 33,268 people benefited from AYUSH medicines in the quarantine period, half of whom availed homeopathic medicines," it said.The state government claimed that 99.69 percent of people who availed AYUSH remedies as prophylaxis during their quarantine period tested negative for coronavirus.However, a clinical trial related to the prophylaxis nature of Arsenicum Album-30 for coronavirus in the state has not yet yielded any conclusive result, an official said.Gujarat Principal Secretary, Health, Jayanti Ravi on Sunday said the government has some reason to believe about the efficacy of Arsenicum Album-30 medicine, as out of thousands of quarantined people who were given the dosage of Arsenicum Album-30, "99.69 percent eventually tested negative for coronavirus"."Even 0.3 percent who tested positive had only mild symptoms. We have prima facie reason to believe in some effectiveness of Arsenicum Album-30 against coronavirus. But to actually establish this, we need more rigorous analysis," Ravi said.The government has so far distributed 3.48 crore dosages of Arsenicum Album-30 starting March, including repeat dosages as the medicine remains effective for 1.5 to two months, she said.As per Bhavna Patel, director of state AYUSH department, the result of a clinical trial on Aresnicum Album-30 going on at a private clinic in Bhavnagar as prophylaxishas not yet shown any clear result.Patel said the homeopathic medicine has been distributed since March on the recommendation of an expert committee, including homeopathic doctors, and a repeat order has also been given by the state health department for people who used it over a month ago."The AYUSH department used its channel of 272 dispensaries, and roped in officials of the local administration like TDOs (taluka development officers) and talatis (local revenue officers) to distribute the medicine.Health camps were organised with the help of NGOs to distribute this," Patel said."Arsenicum Album-30 boosts immunity, but our research is not yet complete on this. We have given approval for its private clinical trial as prophylaxisin Bhavnagar, but the result is not clear because it is not complete," she said.Ahmedabad-based homeopathic doctor and member of national executive committee of the Homeopathic Medical Association of India, Shivang Swaminarayan, said the AYUSH Ministry recommended the use of the medicine as an immunity booster after finding that it benefited people.However, it is better to consult qualified homeopathic doctors before taking the medicine, he said."It is always better to consult a qualified homeopathic doctor. Immunity is not everything in any disease.One should also look at one's general health, age, profession, how much risk he/she is exposed to...this is after all a medicine, and how to take it, and when and in how much dose, one needs to know this from qualified government or private doctors," he said.

23-08-2020||Balrampur/Lucknow||'Could have never imagined he would take to terrorism': Father of ISIS operative held in Delhi||Father of alleged ISIS operative Mohammad Mustakim Khan, alias Abu Yusuf Khan, who was arrested in Delhi, on Sunday said people know his son as a "very good person" and he could have never imagined that he would take to terrorism.Kafeel Ahmed told a news channel that his son has always been very polite and never fought with anyone.Khan's wife, Ayesha, however, said she had told him not to indulge in "wrong activities" but he did not listen to her.Khan, 36, from Badhiyaa Bhaisaahi village in Uttar Pradesh's Balrampur district was arrested from central Delhi's Ridge Road area late on Friday night following a brief exchange of fire with police, according to officials.Two "fully ready" IEDs were recovered from him, and he planned to carry out a "lone wolf" strike at a heavy footfall area in the national capital, the officials said.Ahmed said Khan left home on Friday for Rath in UP's Hamirpur district and after that his whereabouts were not known."On Saturday, we learnt that he has been arrested in Delhi," he said.Asked about Khan collecting explosive material and testing bombs in a graveyard, Ahmed said, "I have not heard anything about explosive material. If I had any idea that he was collecting explosive material, I would not have allowed Abu Yusuf to stay in my house." "Only after the police came in the evening and found the material I realised what it is," he said.He claimed he had never been inside his son's room.Ahmed said he is "deeply saddened" by what has happened."Everyone knows that Abu Yusuf is a very good person. He used to speak very politely, and did not get into fights with anyone," he said.Khan had been on the police radar for over a year now, according to the officials.Ayesha said, "I had told him (Khan) that you are indulging in wrong activities and you should refrain from such activities, but he did not listen to me."On items recovered from her room, she said, "Two jackets, one belt, one bottle, some explosive material, and some pellets (chharra) were recovered. These were kept in a box." Khan and his wife have four children—two sons and two daughters.Khan has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. He was remanded to eight days in police custody and taken to different places in Uttar Pradesh, including Balrampur, for further investigation, the officials said.

23-08-2020||Aditi Tandon||Will Sonia quit, repeating 1999 history: All eyes on Monday’s CWC meeting||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 23All eyes are on the crucial Congress Working Committee meeting on Monday to see whether 1999 history will repeat itself, and whether Sonia Gandhi, facing questions about her leadership, will once again resign.The camp close to Sonia threw ample hints today that the Congress chief may offer to quit tomorrow after a section of senior leaders, all long trusted but Sonia, wrote a letter demanding a full time visible chief and a collective leadership with Gandhis integral to the arrangement.“Sonia Gandhi is not visible and obviously not a full time chief. She’s ill and the fact that the letter by some 20 leaders demanding change in party organisation and leadership was written when she was in the hospital, speaks volumes about those writing it. They’ve obviously questioned her style of working. She may offer to resign tomorrow and may say the party can look for a new president as only accepted the post in the interim. She has never hankered after posts,” a senior Congress man today said although AICC officially through media chief Randeep Surjewala denied having seen any dissenting letter or reports that Sonia had quit.The letter seeking leadership change has come from former ministers like Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, M Veerappa Moily Mukul Wasnik, Manish Tewari, and former CM BS Hooda among others like former Punjab CM Rajinder Bhattal and ex-Himachal Congress chief Kaul Singh Thakur among others.Meanwhile, efforts were on today to scuttle any move by Sonia Gandhi to resign tomorrow with sitting CMs Amarinder Singh and Bhupesh Baghel rubbishing calls challenging the Gandhis.Both CMs said Gandhis alone could keep the party together and fight the BJP with Amarinder Singh demanding that Sonia should continue till Rahul Gandhi takes over and Baghel batting for Rahul’s return as party president.Amarinder opposed the challenge to Gandhis and spoke against attempts to “divide the party.”Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja also firmly backed Sonia Gandhi saying this was the time for Congress to close ranks against BJP and not to show cracks in the house.Former Minister Ashwani Kumar, too, rejected calls for elections saying consensus was needed at this time.“This is not the time for an electoral exercise which is potentially divisive. Issues required to be addressed can be addressed under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi who has held the party together through difficult times. Only a year ago, party persons literally begged Sonia Gandhi to lead and she agreed as a call of duty. It is wrong to question her unifying leadership at this stage. Under the present extraordinary circumstances political adventurism cannot be the way forward,” said Kumar.Young leaders like MP Manickam Tagore and AICC secretary Challa Reddy also batted openly for Rahul saying any delay in promoting Rahul would be at the cost of the Congress.With daggers drawn on the issue of Gandhi versus non-Gandhi leadership Sonia may well repeat the 1999 history.On May 17, 1999 Sonia Gandhi had famously walked into a CWC meeting and tendered her resignation after three CWC members — Sharad Pawar, PA Sangma (nominated for CWC by Sonia) and Tariq Anwar made a statement that the President, Prime Minister, or Vice President of India shouldn’t be a person of foreign origin.The statement was seen as a question on Sonia’s foreign origins and attempts to prevent her from becoming the Congress PM candidate in the 1999 Lok Sabha election.“You are all well aware of the background of this meeting. I also received the same letter. The letter deals with matters directly concerning myself. I feel I should recuse myself and perhaps Pranab Mukherjee could continue the meeting,” Sonia Gandhi said on May 17, 1999 tendering her resignation which she withdrew few days later following CWC’s unanimous rejection of the same.Sonia Gandhi stayed in the Congress and Pawar, Sangma and Anwar quit forming the NCP.The question is what the current Congress dissenters will do should Sonia again resign tomorrow and the CWC again rejects her resignation.Will the dissenters follow in Sharad Pawar’s footsteps to break away from the Congress? All eyes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-sonia-quit-repeating-1999-history-all-eyes-on-mondays-cwc-meeting-130272
23-08-2020||New Delhi/Lucknow||30 kg explosives recovered after ISIS operative's arrest: Police||The Delhi police have so far recovered around 30 kilograms of explosives from the alleged ISIS operative arrested in the national capital, officials said on Sunday.About half of this quantity was found at Mohammad Mustakim Khan’s home in Uttar Pradesh’s Balrampur during a search, an official said. An ISIS flag was also recovered there.Khan, armed with two pressure cooker IEDs, was arrested in central Delhi’s Ridge Road area on Friday night following a brief exchange of fire.A Delhi Police Special Cell team took him to his house in Badhiyaa Bhaisaahi village in Balrampur district.A brown jacket containing three explosive packets and a blue-check jacket containing four explosive packets were recovered there, a Delhi police officer said.Also read: 'Could have never imagined he would take to terrorism': Father of ISIS operative held in Delhi“Each explosive packet, removed from the jackets, was wrapped with transparent tape which contained explosives and cardboard sheet pasted with ball bearings, and electric wires were coming out from it,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) PS Kushwah said in Delhi.Another police officer said 15 kilograms of explosives were seized from Khan at the time of his arrest. Altogether, about 30 kilos of explosives have been recovered so far.“Khan said that he was operating alone, but it is a matter of investigation,” the officer added.Police on Sunday conducted raids at several places. Two bicycle shop owners were among those questioned in Uttar Pradesh, possibly over the origin of the ball bearings found by police.Khan’s father Kafeel Ahmed and wife Ayesha were also questioned, an official said.Ayesha told a television channel that she had told Khan not to indulge in “wrong activities” but he did not listen to her. She appeared to be referring to activities that indicated he was being radicalised.Ahmed said people knew his son as a good, polite person and never imagined that he would take the path of terrorism. He claimed he had never gone into his room, where the explosives were found.Mustakim Khan had planned to carry out a “lone wolf” strike at a heavy footfall area in the national capital, police had earlier said.“One ISIS flag, one leather belt containing around three-kilogram explosives, eight to nine kilogram explosives in four different polythenes, three cylindrical metal boxes containing explosives and electric wires wrapped with transparent tape and two cylindrical metal boxes in which ball bearings were pasted were recovered from his house,” DCP Kushwah said.Was currently operating on the instructions of present Chief of India ops of IS-KP who is suspected to be an ISI proxy..NSG team carried out controlled detonation of seized IEDs...Deeper network of associates being investigated.. pic.twitter.com/nWZouIpH3V  Security agencies have recovered a suicide vest & explosives used for making bombs from the house of #ISIS terrorist Abdul Yusuf Khan in #UttarPradesh's #Balarampur district.Explosives & ball bearings used to make bombs were also recovered.Photo: IANS (File) pic.twitter.com/t7WMx3kZXi“Other material recovered from his house included one wooden broken box (for target practice), 30 ball bearings of different diameters, one packet containing 12 small boxes of ball bearings, three lithium batteries — two of 4V and one of 9V, two cylindrical metal boxes, one ampere meter, yellow colour. Two iron blades, attached parallel to each other, connected to electric wires from sides, one wire cutter, two mobile chargers, a table alarm watch attached with electric wires and one black colour tape were also recovered from his house,” Kushwah said.Security was stepped up in the national capital and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh following the arrest.Khan, 36, planned to strike in the national capital on August 15, but could not do so due to heavy security arrangements, police said.He had been under the watch of security agencies for the last year.“Khan was first handled by Yusuf-al Hindi, ISIS chief of India operations, who was killed in Syria in 2017. After that he was handled by Abu Huzaifa Al Bakistani, a resident of Pakistan, who was killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan in July 2019. Later, another handler instructed him to carry out strikes,” police said.He had tested a small IED near the burial ground in his village. Later, he used the same method to make two pressure cooker IEDs.Television footage showed Khan, in handcuffs, being taken to the room at his Balrampur home where items that could be used for improvised bombs were stored.His father told a TV channel that he did know anything about the material in his son’s room.“If I had any idea that he was collecting explosive material, I would not have allowed Abu Yusuf to stay in my house,” he said, referring to his son by the other name he was known by.The father said he realised what was there in the room only when the police arrived.He said Khan left home on Friday for Rath in UP’s Hamirpur district and after that his whereabouts were not known.“On Saturday, we learnt that he has been arrested in Delhi,” he said. Ahmed said he is “deeply saddened” by what has happened.“Everyone knows that Abu Yusuf is a very good person. He used to speak very politely and did not get into fights with anyone,” he said.Khan had been on the police radar for over a year now, according to officials.“His wife confirmed that investigators found incrimination material in the room. Two jackets, one belt, one bottle, some explosive material, and some pellets were recovered. These were kept in a box,” she told a TV channel.Khan and his wife have four children — two sons and two daughters.He was sent to eight-day police custody by a Delhi court on Saturday.Police have taken him to different places in Uttar Pradesh, including Balrampur, for further investigation, officials said.

23-08-2020||---||BJP, JD(U), LJP to fight Bihar polls together, Oppn a ‘spent force’: Nadda||New Delhi, August 23Putting an end to all speculations and drawing a line for NDA’s warring Bihar partners LJP and JD-U to follow, BJP chief JP Nadda on Sunday said the party-led coalition would contest the forthcoming Assembly elections as one force with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as the face of the alliance.Nadda’s remarks, at a virtual meet of Bihar BJP, come amid a bitter war of words between Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) and Chirag Paswan-headed Lok Janshakti Party resulting from issues related to sharing of seats and power in the polls to the 243-member Bihar Assembly.Chirag Paswan has been targeting Nitish Kumar over his handling of the migrants’ crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and floods. However, Nadda not only praised the Bihar government’s handling of the pandemic and floods in the state but also said whenever the three parties — the BJP, the JD(U) and the LJP — fought together, the National Democratic Alliance emerged victorious.Noting that the Assembly elections were coming at a time when the state faces the twin challenges, Nadda said the three NDA constituents would contest under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and also emerge victorious.The coming Assembly polls are the first time the three parties are contesting together, however, their performance as allies was tested in the 2019 Lok Sabha election when they won all but one of 40 seats.However, Chirag Paswan systematic targeting of the Nitish Kumar-led state government has resulted in speculations about the future of the NDA. In those terms, Nadda's balancing statement and act is significant.He was joined by several Union Ministers elected from Bihar in the meeting.He also called the Opposition in the state as well as elsewhere had become a “spent force”, asserting that the BJP was the only party which was being looked at by people with hope.“The Opposition has neither the ideology nor the vision and spirit to serve people and it can’t rise above petty politics,” Nadda said.While highlighting the pro-poor and pro-farmers steps taken by the Narendra Modi government to help them in the challenging times, Nadda also asked the party leaders to organise small meetings and door-to-door campaign in line with the COVID-19 guidelines while preparing for the polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-jdu-ljp-to-fight-bihar-polls-together-oppn-a-spent-force-nadda-130258
23-08-2020||Islamabad||Pakistan confirms putting Dawood Ibrahim's name in new terror sanctions list||Days after including India's most wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim on its new sanctions list, Pakistan on Sunday tried to wriggle out of its admission on his presence in the country by claiming that its notifications about the 88 banned terror groups and their leaders were based on the details provided by the UN.Seeking to escape from getting blacklisted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, Pakistan on Friday imposed tough financial sanctions on 88 banned terror groups and their leaders, including Ibrahim, 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar.The Pakistan government ordered the seizure of all movable and immovable properties of these outfits and individuals, and freezing of their bank accounts.Underworld don Ibrahim, who heads a vast and multifaceted illegal business, has emerged as India's most wanted terrorist after the 1993 Mumbai bombings.In 2003, the US declared Ibrahim as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. India has repeatedly asked the Government of Pakistan to hand over Ibrahim to India so that he can be prosecuted for the crimes committed by him. It is reported that Ibrahim is based in the southern port city of Karachi.Pakistan's Foreign Office issued a midnight statement in response to the media reports that Islamabad had admitted in the two new notifications issued on August 18 that Ibrahim was residing in the country.It said that the SROs (Statutory Regulatory Orders) issued reflect the information contained in the list entry of UN designated individuals/entities. It said the reports in certain sections of the media about Pakistan imposing new sanctions measures, through these SROs, were not factual.The assertions made by some sections of the media, as to Pakistan admitting to the "presence of certain listed individuals on its territory, based on the information contained in the SRO, are baseless and misleading", it claimed."It is once again reiterated that the information contained in the SRO is reproduced as per the details in the list entry of the individuals/entities designated under the two sanctions regime, which is publicly available, and contains names of individuals who despite their confirmed deceased status still continue to be on the sanctions list," it said.The Foreign Office said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued two consolidated SROs on August 18, reflecting the current status of the UN Taliban and ISIL (Da'esh) and AQ Sanctions list.These lists contain names of individuals and entities designated under the two sanction regimes established pursuant to the UN Security Council resolutions, it said, adding that the consolidated SROs are issued periodically as a routine matter.Similar SROs have been issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the past, as per statutory requirements to meet our international obligations. The last such SROs were issued in 2019, the Foreign Office said.The Paris-based FATF put Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action by the end of 2019, but the deadline was extended later due to COVID-19 pandemic.Though various sanctions were in place against almost all of those listed by the UNSC, the Pakistan government through the new notifications on Friday consolidated and documented the previously announced measures, Pakistani media reports said on Saturday.The UNSC Sanctions Committee deals with sanctions on entities and individuals declared as terrorists. All states, including Pakistan, are bound to implement the sanctions which include assets freeze, an arms embargo, and travel ban.It is believed that the latest move by the Pakistan government is part of its efforts to wriggle out of the grey list of the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog FATF.On August 12, Pakistan Parliament's lower house passed four bills related to the tough conditions set by the FATF  after the government and the Opposition reached a consensus.The legislation was part of the efforts by Pakistan to move from the FATF's grey list to the white list.In its third and final plenary held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic in June, the FATF decided to keep Pakistan in the "grey list" as Islamabad failed to check the flow of money to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). The plenary was held under the Chinese Presidency of Xiangmin Liu.With Pakistan's continuation in the 'grey list', it will be difficult for the country to get financial aid from the IMF, World Bank, ADB, and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the nation which is in a precarious financial situation.If Pakistan fails to comply with the FATF directive by October, there is every possibility that the global body may put the country in the 'Black List' along with North Korea and Iran.The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.The FATF currently has 39 members including two regional organisations—the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council.

23-08-2020||New Delhi||Pak says terror list was 'routine exercise', no move to impose fresh sanctions||Pakistan on Sunday cleared the air about two orders that sought to sanction an entire spectrum of terrorist organisations and their leaderships by stating that it was a routine exercise which was carried out last year as well.In a statement, the Pakistan Foreign Office said such consolidated orders (called SROs or Statutory Regulatory Orders) are issued periodically as a routine matter. It had similar orders earlier "as per statutory requirements to meet our international obligations’’. It denied that the naming of certain people in the SROs, such as Dawood Ibrahim, amounted to admitting their presence in Pakistan."The SROs issued to reflect the information contained in the list entry of UN designated individuals and entities. These lists contain names of individuals and entities designated under the two sanction regimes established pursuant to the UNSC resolutions," said a Pakistan Foreign Ministry statement.  The statement did not mention whether it intended imposing sanctions against the 88 terrorist organisations and their leaders if they, as it admits, have been named by two sanction regimes set up by the UNSC. In fact, the Pakistan Foreign Office said reports about Pakistan imposing new sanctions measures are not factual.The Pakistan Foreign Office once again underlined that the information in the two orders has been "reproduced as per the details in the list entry under the two sanctions regime, which is publically available, and contains names of individuals who despite their confirmed deceased status still continue to be on the sanctions list". Also read: Pakistan confirms putting Dawood Ibrahim's name in new terror sanctions listSources here on Saturday had said they would not comment till Pakistan had taken action against terrorist leaders like Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed, considered Pakistan Army proxies or the Taliban’s leadership, engaged in delicate peace talks with the US.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-says-terror-list-was-routine-exercise-no-move-to-impose-fresh-sanctions-130252

Thelast such Lt General meeting was hosted byChina on August 2, which was to discuss the entire 826-km stretch of the LAC in Ladakh.After that on August 8, Major General-level officers of India and China met to ease the tension at the Depsang plains to reduce troop mobilisation and war-waging equipment on both sides of the 900 sq km area. The talks revolved around two issues — restoring patrol rights in the ‘grey zone’ areas, where the perception of the LAC varies, and arriving at some semblance of understanding as to what are each other’s perceptions of the LAC and how these are to be ‘respected’ by troops on the ground.The dis-engagement process has been stalled. Five meetings at the Lt General-level have been conducted between June 6 and August 2. It was decided to go ahead with de-escalation. China, however, backed out of the agreement.Barring success in creating a 3-km buffer zone at Patrolling Point 14 (Galwan) and PP 15 (Hot Springs), there has been no breakthrough. China is adamant on not moving further away from the LAC from its position at Finger 4.The PLA has a similar stance as regards PP 17 and PP 17A, near Gogra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/another-military-level-meet-on-cards-to-end-lac-impasse-130020

23-08-2020||New Delhi||Undue favour to two developers cost UP Rs 572 crore: CAG report||The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) suffered a loss of Rs 772 crore, including Rs 572 crore owing to the “undue” benefit given by the UP Government to two real estate developers, who were spared the mandatory change of land use (CLU) charges.Ghaziabad scam: Other losses tooRs18.91 crore loss as GDA didn’t revise & recover city development chargesRs151.98 cr loss owing to non-compliance of orders on sale of propertiesRs22.14 cr loss after incentive scheme was extended to a medical collegeObjections by the Legal Department in this regard were overruled, as per the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) which was tabled during the four-day session of the state Assembly at Lucknow. Given that the CAG report is based on a ‘sample check’, the scale of the scam could be much bigger.The report says that an undue benefit of Rs 401.30 crore was given to Uppal Chaddha Hi-tech Developers Private Ltd and of Rs 171.18 crore to Suncity Hi-tech Infra Private Ltd. “The Government of UP allowed undue benefit of Rs 572.48 crore to the two developers at the cost of the Ghaziabad Development Authority,” the CAG report reads.“On April 23, 2010, the Housing and Urban Planning Department of Government of UP, at the request of the developers, altered the indicated land use in the Master Plan to residential and consequently no charges for conversion of land use were payable by the two developers,” the report said. The Legal Department of the Government objected, pointing out that the “non-levy of land use conversion charges would amount to ‘post-bid benefit’. This was overruled by the Principal Secretary, Legal Department”, the report says.In May 2005, the UP Government selected two developers for High-Tech township in Ghaziabad. At that time, Master Plan-2001 was in force, according to which the land use of the area designated for the township was agricultural. In July 2005, Master Plan-2021 was approved which said the selected developers would have to pay the applicable CLU charges.The UP Government orders issued in August 2001 too state that CLU charges are to be levied as per the circle rate fixed by the district magistrate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/undue-favour-to-two-developers-cost-up-rs-572-crore-cag-report-129991
