30-08-2020||Noida (UP)||UP: Wildlife photographer’s looted camera, lens worth 5 lakh recovered, 3 held||Gautam Buddh Nagar police on Sunday recovered the camera and lens worth Rs 5 lakh that were robbed from a wildlife photographer in the Dhanauri Wetlands on August 22 and arrested three students involved in the act, officials said.The accused are Class 12 students and two of them are aged 18 while one in 19 and they live in adjoining Bulandshahr district, they said.Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, Greater Noida, Vishal Pandey said the accused had overpowered wildlife photographer Narinder Kohli and looted his camera, lens and other accessories at gunpoint on August 22.Although, a picture of the trio was captured in a car-mounted camera of the victim, the police officer said the case was challenging as the accused had their faces covered and the only substantial lead they had was their motorcycle that had “Jat” inscribed on its front in red and blue colours.“The word ‘Jat’ was written on their TVS Apache motorcycle and we checked around 150 such bikes in the region, got registration details checked, among others,” Pandey told reporters.Multiple police teams engaged in the case carried out searches in nearby villages and towns, including in neighbouring district, but the breakthrough in the high profile case came from Facebook.“We were also monitoring social media, including Twitter and Facebook, among other platforms for a lead. We came across a picture on Facebook in which an Apache bike was seen with ‘Jat’ inscribed on its front side in red and blue colours,” Pandey said.“That is how the culprits were identified and traced. The bike and the firearm used in the crime have been recovered while 100 per cent recovery has been ensured in the form of the looted items—the camera, its lens and accessories,” he said.The accused have been identified as Deepak, Pramod and Deependra. The motorcycle belongs to Deepak, the officer said.The additional DCP said Kohli, who had gone to the Dhanauri Wetlands to work on a documentary along with another photographer, is a renowned artist and Police Commissioner Alok Singh was also monitoring the case.A reward of Rs 25,000 was also announced leading to the arrest of the culprits in the wake of the incident, he added.Pandey said the three students from Bulandshahr were visiting a friend of theirs in Dhanauri village for a birthday party and had already planned to rob someone while going back.“They knew that photographers with expensive cameras come to the Dhanauri Wetlands and had planned to rob someone, hoping to make some easy and quick money,” he said.“Three of them were at the crime scene while their fourth partner was part of the planning but not present at the site,” he added.An FIR under Indian Penal Code section 394 (robbery) has been lodged against them at the Dankaur police station and further proceedings were underway, the police said.

30-08-2020||New Delhi||Not appropriate for leaders to make comments in public: Congress||In a snub to dissenters, the Congress said on Sunday it was not appropriate for any leader to go public on internal matters of the party after president Sonia Gandhi had called for moving on collectively at the recent CWC meeting, which had discussed the leadership issue.The Congress’s remarks come as some of its leaders continue to make statements in public over internal party issues, after 23 leaders wrote to Gandhi calling for far-reaching reforms within the party such as having a “full time, active and visible” leadership.They had also called for devolution of powers to state units and revamping the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the highest decision making body of the party, in line with the party constitution.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the party has to move forward collectively in the direction and manner suggested by the Congress president during the CWC meeting, in which internal party issues were discussed at length for seven hours.He said he was not speaking about individuals, individual press conferences or about reports.“It is a free country. Nobody is censored to speak or not to speak,” Singhvi said.“But, let me make one thing clear, we had a marathon discussion on diverse issues for seven hours and at the end of which, the Congress president clearly said that we discussed it openly like a family and we now should look to the future, and the momentum and the directions should be to the future. We have to move together forgetting the bygones,” he told reporters while speaking on the comments made by some leaders in public.Once the Congress president has said so, “I think that letter and spirit must be observed in every way”, Singhvi said.“I don’t think it is appropriate after that for me or anyone else to comment, be it to be in the centre of press, be it to be in the headlines or not,” he said.Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, while justifying the letter to the Congress chief, said it was in the interest of the party to hold elections to the CWC (the party’s highest-decision making body) and bring changes as suggested, “otherwise the Congress will keep sitting in the opposition for the next 50 years”.Another signatory to the letter, Kapil Sibal, has said in interviews that the Congress needs a “de jure and a de facto president” and concerns raised in their letter to the party chief should be addressed as soon as possible.Sibal has also alleged that politics in the country is now based primarily on loyalty, but what is needed is merit, inclusiveness and commitment to the cause.He has said after their letter, the issue that was debated was loyalty and not its contents.Sibal has said this happens when distances within the party increase and moves are views with suspicion.

30-08-2020||New Delhi||‘Sophie’ and ‘Vida’, the award-winning Army dogs, find mention in PM’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’||In his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio broadcast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday paid glowing tributes to India’s canine brigade and specifically mentioned about ‘Sophie’ and ‘Vida’, the two brave dogs who were awarded the Chief of Army Staff’s Commendation Cards on August 15.Modi also exhorted those planning to raise a pet dog to adopt one from the Indian breeds, saying they are “very good and capable”.“Sophie and Vida are the dogs of the Indian Army who have been awarded the Chief of Army Staff ‘Commendation Cards’. Sophie and Vida received this honour because they performed their duties diligently while protecting their country,” the prime minister said.Military sources said Vida, belonging to an Army dog unit under Udhampur-headquartered Northern Command, was instrumental in the timely detection of five mines and one grenade buried underground, preventing possible casualties and injuries of troops.Sophie, an explosive detection dog, saved lives by sniffing out the presence of initiator/accelerant which could have been hastily used to fabricate an IED (improvised explosive device), they said.“Sophie and Vida received this honour because they performed their duties diligently while protecting their country. Our armed forces and security forces have many such brave dogs who not only live for the country but also sacrifice themselves for the country,” the prime minister said.He said such canines have played a very important role in thwarting numerous bomb blasts and terrorist conspiracies.In his radio broadcast, Modi also mentioned about ‘Balaram’, a canine who sniffed out ammunition on the route of the Amarnath Yatra, and ‘Bhavana’ who searched out an IED in 2002 but died later in an explosion triggered by terrorists.“You might have seen a very moving scene on TV a few days ago, in which the Beed Police were giving their canine colleague Rocky a final farewell with all due respect. Rocky had helped the police in solving over 300 cases,” Modi said.Mentioning about Indian dog breeds, the prime minister said they cost less to raise and are better adapted to the Indian environment and surroundings, adding that the security agencies are also inducting these dogs.“Among the Indian breeds, Mudhol Hound and Himachali Hound are of excellent pedigree. Rajapalayam, Kanni, Chippiparai and Kombai are fabulous Indian breeds. They cost less to raise and are better adapted to the Indian environment and surroundings,” Modi said.He further said: “Search for these breeds on the internet and know more about them - The beauty and qualities of these breeds will leave you astounded!”The military sources said the superiority of the “canine soldiers” employed by the Indian Army has led to an increasing demand from friendly foreign countries, including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Cambodia for acquiring dogs trained by the Remount and Veterinary Corps (RVC).Countries like South Africa, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Seychelles are keen on getting their personnel trained in dog handling courses conducted by the Indian Army. Japan has also shown interest in the training standards of Indian Army canines, they said.The sources said since July last year, Army dogs have contributed to a number of operational successes including 30 cases of recovery of IEDs and explosives, 14 cases of recovery of arms, ammunition and other war-like stores and five cases of tracking of terrorists leading to their elimination.“In addition, they have also been saviors of many lives during avalanches, earthquakes and other natural disasters,” said a source.The Indian Army has trained dogs under eight different roles which are: tracker, guard, mine detection, explosive detection, infantry patrol, search and rescue, assault and narcotic detection and avalanche rescue operations.“Army dogs trained in the Indian Army are rendering yeoman service to the nation by performing stellar ‘Op successes’ as ‘force multipliers’ in various counter insurgency/counter-terrorist operations,” said the source. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sophie-and-vida-the-award-winning-army-dogs-find-mention-in-pms-mann-ki-baat-133817

The proposal will be implemented based on the guidelines,” J L Meena, Joint Director at National Health Authority said.Hospitals will get ratings up to five stars based on scores on the set of elements under each domain like availability of advanced and super specialised care, patient fall rate per 1,000 patients, discharge time, patient satisfaction score compliance to quality indicators among others. And on each element, weightage, data source and scoring criteria are defined.The weight factor will be multiplied with individual score and then overall percentage will be derived from it.As of now, AB-PMJAY has over 23,000 hospitals on board across the country.For 5-star rating, a hospital has to score above or equal to 90 per cent; for 4 star rating, it has to get 75 to 90 per cent; for 3 star rating, it has to get 50 to 75 per cent score; for 2 star rating, it has to score 25 to 50 per cent; while for a hospital to get 1 star rating it should have a score of less than 25 per cent.Also, these star ratings will be reviewed on monthly basis, the guidelines stated.“Star rating of hospitals will be published on the official website of AB-PMJAY and mobile application of PM-JAY against the name of each empanelled hospital,” said Meena.Since the launch of AB-PMJAY in September 2018, at least 1,08,99,888 beneficiaries have availed treatment under the scheme in the country. The health insurance scheme aims to provide a cover of Rs 5 lakh to more than 10.74 crore poor in a year as a step forward towards achievement of Universal Health Coverage in India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-hospitals-empanelled-under-ayushman-bharat-scheme-to-get-star-ratings-133814

It is an act of mischief by some people who want to malign the higher education system and the transparent online admission process by including such names in the merit list,” he said on Sunday.The college students’ union run by the Trinamool Chhatra Parishad said that there seems to be a design behind such incidents as Bollywood actress Sunny Leone’s name had figured similarly in merit list of three other colleges on successive days.Leone’s name featured in the third place in the list for English honours in Barasat Government College in North 24 Parganas district on Saturday, preceded by that of US pornstar Dani Daniels and webcam model from Lebanon, Mia Khalifa.On Friday, the name of Leone, a Canada-born actor, had appeared in the 151st position in the list of 157 candidates selected for BA (Honours) in English at Budge Budge College in South 24 Parganas district.Her name also appeared at the top of the merit list again for English Honours at Asutosh College in Kolkata on Thursday, the first such incident.The West Bengal Government had earlier announced that admission to undergraduate courses will be completely online this year and no processing fee will be charged due to the hardship caused to people due to the pandemic situation.

30-08-2020||Bengaralu||NIA arrests doctor in Lashkar terror group recruitment case of 2012||The NIA has arrested an Indian doctor, brother of 2007 Glasgow bomber, after he was deported from Saudi Arabia where he was in custody for his alleged involvement in recruiting people in India for Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Toiba.The accused, Dr Sabeel Ahmed, who worked at a hospital in Saudi kingdom, is the younger brother of aeronautical engineer Kafeel Ahmed who was involved in the 2007 suicide attack at Glasgow airport in Scotland in the UK. His mission had failed and he died on August 2 after their bombs went off.Ahmed, 38, who was in London at that time, was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) upon his arrival in New Delhi from Saudi Arabia where he had moved in 2010 and worked at King Fahad hospital.He was deported from the kingdom after being detained for his alleged involvement in recruiting people for the LeT. A case was registered in connection with the case in Bengaluru in 2012 against 25 people. He is also an accused in the case.A non-bailable warrant and a look-out notice were issued against him.The case was initially lodged by the Bengaluru police which had claimed that it was a plot to attack columnist Prathap Simha, who is now a BJP Lok Sabha member from Karnataka’s Mysuru.So far, 17 people have been arrested in the case out of whom 14 have been released after serving their sentence.The NIA established Ahmed’s identity in the case after the deportation and arrest of a Hyderabad resident from Saudi Arabia in 2015. Earlier, he was identified as “Motu doctor” in an initial charge-sheet filed by the NIA in 2015 in this case.The NIA alleged that Ahmed was introduced to LeT recruitment plot by his brother-in-law Imran Ahmed, arrested in 2013 for travelling with a fake passport, and an engineer from Bengaluru Mohammed Shahid Faisal, who is still absconding. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-arrests-doctor-in-lashkar-terror-group-recruitment-case-of-2012-133797
30-08-2020||New Delhi||Centre to weed out inefficient, corrupt employees, asks depts to review service records of staff||The Centre has asked all its departments to review service records of employees who have completed 30 years in job to identify inefficient or corrupt staff and retire them prematurely in public interest, according to a Personnel Ministry order.The employees’ performance review is conducted under the Fundamental Rule (FR) 56 (J) and 56 (I), and also under Rule 48 (1) (b) of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972, that gives “absolute right” to the appropriate authority to retire a government servant, “if it is necessary to do so in public interest”.“It is clarified that premature retirement of government servants under these rules is not a penalty. It is distinct from ‘compulsory retirement’, which is one of prescribed penalties under Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965,” said the order issued on Friday.The government may, at any time after a government servant has attained the age of 50/55 years or completed 30 years of service, as the case may be, retire him/her prematurely in public interest, it said.Instructions have been issued from time to time for undertaking periodic review of performance of government servants with a view to ascertain whether they should be retained in service or retired prematurely, the ministry said.The latest order has been issued in order to bring in better clarity to the existing instructions and enable uniform implementation, it said.“An effort has been made to review, consolidate and reiterate the guidelines so far issued on the subject at one place,” the ministry said in the order issued to the secretaries of all Central government departments.Giving details on applicability of FR 56 (J), the order said the service record of a group A and B category officer can be reviewed if he/she has attained the age of 50 years (in case of joining service before 35 years of age) or after attaining 55 years (in case of joining service after 35 years of age).Under FR 56 (I), the appropriate authority has the absolute right to retire a government servant in Group C service or post who is not governed by any pension rules, after he has completed 30 years’ service by giving him/her notice of not less than three months in writing or three months’ pay and allowances in lieu of such notice, it said.For employees covered under Rule 48 (1) (b) of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, it said the review can be done at any time after a government servant has completed 30 years’ qualifying service.“…and in the case of such retirement, the government servant shall be entitled to a retiring pension, provided that the appointing authority may also give a notice in writing to a government servant at least three months before the date on which he is required to retire in public interest or three months’ pay and allowances in lieu of such notice,” said the order.The Personnel Ministry has also asked all the departments to maintain a register for conducting such review.“A register of the government servants who are due to attain the age of 50/55 years or to complete 30 years of service, has to be maintained. The register should be scrutinised at the beginning of every quarter by a senior officer in the ministry/ department/ cadre…,” it said.The Personnel Ministry has also mentioned composition of a review committee and broad criteria to be followed by it while conducting assessment of the employees’ performance.“Government servants whose integrity is doubtful, shall be retired. Government servants found to be ineffective shall also be retired. The basic consideration in identifying such government servants should be their fitness/competence to continue in the post held,” it said.No government servant should ordinarily be retired on ground of ineffectiveness, if, in any event, he would be retiring on superannuation within a period of one year from the date of consideration of his case, reads the criteria mentioned in the order.However, in case where there is a sudden and steep fall in the competence, efficiency or effectiveness of a government servant, it would be open to review such a case also for premature retirement, it said.The entire service record, in addition to the Annual Performance Appraisal Report (APAR), of a government servant should be considered at the time of review, the order said.“The personal file of the government servant may contain valuable material.

It improved to 26.59 per cent on May 3 and 47.76 per cent on May 31. It was recorded at 60.77 per cent on July 5.The number of patients recovering is on a steady rise over the past several months and as on date exceeds the active cases by 3.55 times, the ministry said.India has posted nearly 19.5 lakh (19,48,631) recoveries more than 7,65,302 active cases.The record high recoveries have ensured that 7,65,302 active cases of coronavirus, which is the “actual caseload of the country and the same comprises only 21.60 per cent of the total positive cases,” the ministry underscored.This has aided the fast widening gap between the number of patients recovered and the active cases, it said.“Timely and effective clinical management of the patients in critical care through a slew of holistic measures has been instrumental in keeping the case fatality rate low and on a steady downward trajectory. It has further dipped to 1.79 per cent today,” the ministry said on Sunday.India’s COVID-19 tally rose to 35,42,733 with a record single-day spike of 78,761 infections, while the death toll climbed to 63,498 with 948 people succumbing to the disease in a span of 24 hours, the ministry data updated at 8 am on Sunday showed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-recoveries-cross-27-lakh-case-fatality-rate-drops-to-1-79-health-ministry-133781
30-08-2020||New Delhi||Suspended J-K cop Davinder Singh was tasked by Pakistan to establish ‘contact’ in MEA, says NIA||Suspended Deputy Superintendent of Jammu and Kashmir Police Davinder Singh, who has been chargesheeted by the NIA for providing support to banned terror group Hizbul Mujahideen, was tasked by his Pakistani handler with establishing a “contact” in the Ministry of External Affairs for espionage activities.According to the chargesheet of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) filed before a special court in Jammu, Singh, who was posted in the sensitive anti-hijacking unit of Jammu and Kashmir police, had been in constant touch with his handlers in the Pakistan High Commission who have since been repatriated to Islamabad.The 3,064-page chargesheet, filed under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code against Singh and five others, gave a detailed description of the police officer’s involvement in providing shelter to the terrorists of the banned group.The chargesheet said he had saved the number of his contact at the Pakistan High Commission as ‘Pak Bhai’ (Pakistani brother). The contact had been giving him various tasks which included deployment of forces and arrival of “VIPs” in the Kashmir valley.After having committed himself to Hizbul Mujahideen, Singh was asked to establish a contact in the Ministry of External Affairs by his Pakistani handler for spying on them.However, Singh was unable to make any headway, the NIA officials said.The chargesheet, filed in the first week of July, has accused Singh and others of allegedly waging “war against India” with the help of Pakistan-based terrorists and members of the country’s high commission in Delhi.Besides Singh, others named in the chargesheet are self-styled commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen terror group Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Naveed Babu, his brother Syed Irfan Ahmad as well as the group’s alleged overground worker Irfan Shafi Mir, alleged accomplice Rafi Ahmad Rather and businessman Tanveer Ahmad Wani, former president of the Line of Control Traders Association.Detailing the conspiracy, the NIA alleged that Deputy Superintendent of Police Singh, who is in a jail here, was “in touch with certain officials of Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi through secure social media platforms. Investigation revealed that he was being groomed by Pakistani officials for obtaining sensitive information”.The central agency said in the chargesheet that the probe in the case has brought “on record that the Pakistani establishment has been devising all possible ways and means to fund, arm and sustain the terrorist activities of the banned terrorist organization Hizbul Mujahideen”.Singh was arrested on January 11 this year along with Naveed Babu, Rather and Mir, an advocate, when their car was intercepted by Jammu and Kashmir police near Qazigund on the national highway connecting the Valley with the rest of the country.A search of the vehicle led to the recovery of an AK-47 rifle, three pistols and a cache of ammunition and explosives. The NIA took over the case on January 17.The investigation found that Singh, in an apparent bid to shield Naveed Babu, had shifted him along with the advocate to Jammu and arranged safe shelter for them in the city in February last year.Singh used his own vehicle for the movement of the Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists and also assured them help in procuring weapons, the NIA alleged.Investigations show that the accused were obtaining weapons and ammunition from across the border with the help of arms smugglers and Singh. These weapons were later used for terrorist activities, it said.

30-08-2020||Lucknow||SP hits out at UP govt over crime in Gorakhpur||The Samajwadi Party on Sunday hit out at the Uttar Pradesh government over incidents of crime in Gorakhpur, a seat earlier represented by Chief Minister Adityanath in the Lok Sabha. In a Hindi tweet on Sunday, the Opposition party said in the home district of the CM, murders are taking place every second day, terming it as “August apradh kraanti” (August crime revolution).The SP said in the “VVIP Gorakhpur”, 14 murders have taken place in a span of 28 days. When will the ‘rogi raj’ (sick rule), which is turning the state into a “jungle raj”, be sensitive to law and order, the SP asked.On the other hand, UP BJP spokesperson rebutted the content of the tweets, claiming that the state government has zero tolerance towards crime and corruption.“The crime in the state has declined as compared to the era of the SP and BSP governments,” he said, adding that Chief Minister Adityanath had spoken about it in the recently-concluded Vidhan Sabha session.“The Samajwadi Party is baffled as strong action has been initiated against dreaded gangsters Mukhtar Ansari and Atiq Ahmed, who were nurtured by it,” the BJP spokesperson alleged. “The Samajwadi Party is feeling that its empire, which it had built through Mukhtar Ansari and Atiq Ahmed, is being hit. Hence, they are trying to give a cover fire through such baseless statements,” Shukla added.On Saturday, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had lashed out at the Yogi Adityanath government, saying crime is now being reported even from “safe and secure” areas of the state like Gautampalli, where a double murder took place.“Now, crime has entered the so-called most secured and important area of Gautampalli with a double murder. Now, the people of the state are telling stories to their children that some time ago, there was law and order in the state,” the former UP Chief Minister said in a tweet.

The CM has also announced that the Necklace Road in Hyderabad, on the periphery of the Husain Sagar Lake will be named as PV Gnana Marg.To give proper respect to the late prime minister, the state will be establishing a PV Memorial in the capital city.Upset over the way PVR was treated during his end, the CM is personally reviewing the arrangements for the year-long PV Centenary Celebrations.“PV Narasimha Rao is a symbol of Telangana existence. He was a reformer who initiated several reforms in the country. He was recognised as a great intellectual all over the world. He was the Telanganite who rose to the level of the country’s Prime Minister. We will discuss the greatness of PV and his achievements in the Assembly. We have decided to have a comprehensive debate on PV. We will pass a resolution urging conferring of Bharat Ratna on PV,” KCR has announced.The CM said his government had decided to install a portrait of PV in the Assembly Hall of the state Vidhan Sabha. “We will request the Centre to install a portrait of PV in the Parliament too and will ask the centre to rename the Central University of Hyderabad, which was established by PV in Hyderabad, as PV Narasimha Rao Central University.“When the land was the only resource for people to have their employment and earnings, PV as Chief Minister had implemented land reforms daringly. This resulted in having 93 per cent small and medium level farmers in the Telangana state now. The land came into the hands of the poor. It was due to economic reforms that PV implemented as the PM, the country’s economy was stabilised now. We have to honour such a great personality in a befitting manner,” the CM said.He suggested to the committee members to prepare the programme lists on how should they be conducted the programmes amidst the present-day Corona guidelines and how it should be celebrated on a grand scale after the relaxations in the guidelines with large public participation. “The Committee should decide this as Corona and post-Corona periods,” the CM said.The state will also develop Laknepally, the village where PV was born and Vangara where he grew up as tourist spots.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-assembly-to-pass-resolution-seeking-bharat-ratna-for-narasimha-rao-133773
30-08-2020||New Delhi||Increased testing, opening economy, complacency among people behind COVID-19 case surge: Experts||The surge in coronavirus infections in India can be attributed to increased testing on one hand and opening of the economy on the other accompanied by complacency among people towards following COVID-appropriate behaviour, experts have said, as the country witnessed over five lakh cases in a week.A record single-day spike of 78,761 cases took India’s COVID-19 tally to 35,42,733, on Sunday, according to Union Health Ministry data updated at 8 am.The country has been registering over 70,000 cases for the last four days.Dr Samiran Panda, Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said this increase in cases was expected but pointed out that it is not a homogenous phenomenon across the states.“It is happening in some pockets and among groups where there is an intermixing of the susceptible population and asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases which is leading to a transmission of the disease. So, efforts have to be made to interrupt this transmission in these pockets,” Dr Panda said.Also, testing has been ramped up exponentially which is leading to more number of cases getting detected, he said.“Further, with the opening up of the economy and people’s movement increasing, some complacency is being seen among people towards following COVID-appropriate behaviour which is also contributing to the rise in cases,” Panda said as he stressed on the need for a sustained COVID-19 appropriate behaviour.Leading virologist Shahid Jameel said that people are not following advisories on wearing masks, hand hygiene and social distancing.“This is driven by a complacency that results from the official narrative which only talks of increasing recovery and low death rate. The fact is that we are producing the largest daily numbers. We are now third in total infections and going to be on the third spot on total deaths as well,” he said.Experts underlined that the way forward is for the people to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour which includes wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing, hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette in a sustained manner while the government should focus on preventing deaths.  Dr KK Aggarwal, the president of the Confederation of Medical Association of Asia and Oceania (CMAAO) and former IMA chief said, “There is no way the number of cases can be checked by government efforts at this stage.”He stressed that prevention will have to be at an individual level now.“If this current trend continues, nobody can stop India from crossing Brazil and America (in the number of cases). That would happen in probably six weeks. There is no way we can check the number of cases by government efforts. Now, prevention will have to be an individual effort.“Opening up (of the economy) will lead to a surge in cases. The locking period was to prepare and sensitise people about how to prevent themselves from getting infected. What is more important now is to put a check on mortality. So government efforts should focus on mortality reduction,” Aggarwal said.India has till Sunday recorded 63,498 fatalities linked to COVID-19 with 948 people succumbing to the disease in the last 24 hours, according to the Union Health Ministry data.According to sources in the government, a record 10.5 lakh tests were conducted for detection of COVID-19 on Saturday, which took India’s cumulative tests to 4,14,61,636. India’s COVID-19 positivity rate as on date is 7.50 per cent.The number of recoveries has surged to 27,13,933 pushing the recovery rate to 76.61 per cent while the fatality rate has declined to 1.79 per cent.The Health Ministry had on Saturday said, “The global comparison depicted that India has one of the lowest cases per million (2,424) and deaths per million (44) compared to the global average of 3,161 and 107.2 respectively.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/increased-testing-opening-economy-complacency-among-people-behind-covid-19-case-surge-experts-133772
30-08-2020||New Delhi||Sushant death case: Cong questions Centre over CBI probe, wants Sandeep Ssingh's ‘BJP-link' investigated||The Congress Sunday questioned the "alacrity" exhibited by the Centre in ordering a CBI probe in the Sushant Singh Rajput case and sought investigation into alleged BJP links of Sandeep Ssingh, the producer of a biopic on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is under the scanner in a related drugs case.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi asked who in the BJP is trying to "save" Ssingh, who produced “PM Narendra Modi”, the posters of which were unveiled by the then Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.Singhvi alleged the film producer who claimed to be Rajput's close friend made 53 calls to the Maharashtra BJP office in the last few months."Who he was seeking security from," Singhvi asked.He said political parties do not get into Bollywood matters."But if a suspect is linked to the ruling party, the country wants to know who is he connected to and who in the BJP is trying to save Sandeep Ssingh.” "Was Sandeep Ssingh the reasons for showing alacrity in ordering a CBI probe? Why are such people linked to the BJP?" he asked.Singhvi said Fadnavis and senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari should answer as to why Ssingh made these many calls to the Maharashtra BJP office and who was his boss.The Congress leader said Ssingh's closeness to the ruling party is evident from the fact that he made the biopic on PM Modi. "He is not a common person as none other than the then CM Devendra Fadnavis released the posters of this film." On the drugs angle coming up during the investigation into the Rajput death case, Singhvi asked what was the Fadnavis government doing at the time as it was in power in 2017 and 2018.He also alleged that a case of assault on a minor Swiss national was lodged against Ssingh on March 29 in Mauritius, as per documents available from the Indian embassy.Singhvi also alleged that even though his company had shown losses, Ssingh was the lone film producer the Vibrant Gujarat in 2019 signed a Rs 177-crore agreement with.The Supreme Court had last week upheld the transfer to the CBI an FIR lodged by Rajput's father in Patna against actress Rhea Chakraborty and others for allegedly abetting his son's suicide and misappropriating his money.

This will ensure minimisation of service delivery outage and water loss as well as monitor the quantity and quality on a long-term basis.The additional advantage of this data would be to analyse the demand pattern of the user groups over time and use this information for demand management at the aggregate level, minimise non-revenue water, ensure proper management and effective operation and maintenance of water supply systems in the villages, according to a statement issued by the ministry today.Recent technological advancements such as IoT, big data analytics, artificial intelligence as well as declining costs of mobile data, hardware and software provide an opportunity to digitise water supply infrastructure in rural India. Digitally enabled supply infrastructure will help in near real-time monitoring and evidence-based policy making.The union government’s Jal Jeevan Mission will be creating a smart rural water supply eco-system to measure and monitor the service delivery of water supply in rural areas. The mission, being implemented in partnership with state governments, aims at providing Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) to every rural household by 2024 and delivering the prescribed quality and quantity of water on a regular and long-term basis.A technical expert committee, with members from academia, administration, technology and specialists from the water supply sector has been constituted to prepare a road map for measurement and monitoring of water service delivery system in rural areas.The Mission, in collaboration with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is also planning to conduct an open ICT Grand Challenge to bring an innovative, modular, and cost-effective solution to develop a ‘Smart Water Supply Measurement and Monitoring System’ that can be deployed at the village level.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sensor-based-systems-to-monitor-and-forecast-water-supply-in-villages-133769

But the situation is getting tougher for the family with her husband’s salary reduced by half due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The parents are struggling to provide treatment to Ujjawal who cannot walk properly.From doctors in Delhi to panchakarma therapy in Kerala to treatment at the Udaipur Narayan Seva Sansthan, the couple has explored all options and has spent Rs 30 lakhs on their 11-year-old son’s treatment till now.“Ujjawal was fine at birth. His physical growth slowed down when he was seven months old. Initially, doctors said he exhibited development delays,” Lakshmi said.Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders caused by damage to the immature brain as it develops, most often before birth. It affects movement and muscle tone or posture.“These 11 years have been excessively difficult, full of struggles. We have spent all we had on Ujjawal’s treatment. I sold all the 10 tolas (100 grams) jewellery my mother-in-law gifted me on my wedding to afford treatment for my son,” she said, choking on her tears.But it was only in January that they could witness a tangible improvement in the boy’s condition.“Finally, we have got a doctor who brought a positive change in the boy’s condition, but we do not have money for treatment now,” she said.Ujjawal’s doctor, Dr Ranbir Singh, said the boy needs physiotherapy at home twice a day.Using a wheelchair to take the boy to hospital will be demotivating and is not advisable, the doctor said, adding that physiotherapy at home is the way ahead.Lakshmi said, “Around Rs 15 lakh is needed—Rs 30,000 a month—for four years of treatment. Due to the pandemic, my husband’s salary has been reduced by half. He earns Rs 15,000, of which Rs 5,000 is spent on rent.”          She said her maternal family did not support her and rejected the child because of his disability.“The kid knows we are struggling financially and says when he will be fit, he will set everything right,” Lakshmi said.Ujjawal, who is a student of Class 4, loves playing the keyboard and tries reproducing the music he listens to on YouTube.For the last three months, Ujjawal’s parents have been providing therapy to him.“But we are not experts, there is a difference between what we do and what a doctor does,” she said.“The doctor has been helping us online but we cannot ask him for more. We need some help so that our kid is back on his feet again,” the mother added.

30-08-2020||New Delhi||Flying to India for NEET amid COVID-19 risk stressful, impractical: Aspirants in Gulf nations||Travelling to India to write medical entrance exam NEET is not only stressful but also impractical, several candidates in Gulf countries have said, citing the risk of contracting COVID-19 and the need to undergo a mandatory quarantine, among other issues.Some of them have decided the skip the National Eligibility-Cum-Entrance Test (NEET) altogether this year.“What choice do I have? It is impractical,” said Royston Mendonca, who is based in Dubai.Several Indian students like him said the Supreme Court’s refusal to allow exam centres for the NEET in Gulf countries has left them the lurch. Many of these students have their JEE Main exam in the Gulf and the NEET in India.While exam centres have been set up abroad for JEE Main, there is no such plan for NEET.Reaching India in time to be able to complete the mandatory quarantine period before the exam, arranging a stay before taking a flight back home, additional expenses, the risk of contracting COVID-19 and being quarantined again back home, are among several concerns on the mind of the aspirants.The National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts medical and engineering entrance exams, has decided to hold NEET on September 13 and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains from September 1 to 6.      Mendonca told PTI over phone from Dubai, “Even if I take the next possible Vande Bharat flight, I will not be able to finish my quarantine period by then. And how can one appear for such a crucial exam amid this much stress.”Shailaja Vishwanathan, a Doha-based candidate, said, “I had contacted the Indian embassy here and I have been told that though I had not applied earlier, I would be accommodated in the next Vande Bharat flight. But it is too much of a hassle right before an exam for which I have been preparing for two years. I wish I was able to take the exam in Doha, but I don’t have much choice. I will go anyhow.”          Jonathan Vergis, who resides in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has to write both these exams, the JEE-Main in Dubai on September 3 and the NEET in India 10 days later.“If I leave after this exam (JEE Main), I will not be able to finish the quarantine period before September 13, when the NEET exam is scheduled,” he said.However, NTA officials said the JEE exam centre in such cases can be shifted to India and the students should reach out to the agency.NEET candidate Jasim, a resident of Saudi Arabia, said, “This is very impractical. I have not travelled alone before this. If my parents fly with me, we will have to bear extra cost which is an added burden at the moment. The time taken to complete the quarantine, appearing for exam and then completing quarantine here once back, will require a lot of leaves from work for them too. We are still working out what to do.”Another candidate based in Oman, who did not wish to be identified, told PTI she has decided not to appear for the exam this year.“I think I will take the exam next year now. I know a year is precious but it is just not feasible to travel to India for the exam now. I was really hoping that they either postpone the exam or set up centres in Gulf countries too,” she said.On Monday, the Supreme Court of India declined to pass direction to the Central government to hold NEET in Gulf countries. The court directed the government to allow students to come through Vande Bharat Mission flights to write the exams.The SC was hearing a plea filed by parents of nearly 4,000 NEET candidates, who alternatively had sought to postpone the examination until the coronavirus pandemic subsides.The parents of these candidates, who reside in Doha, Qatar, Oman and the UAE, had approached the apex court challenging the High Court of Kerala order which had dismissed their plea in June.The NTA informed the Supreme Court that it had duly consulted the MCI (Medical Council of India) on the students’ demand for overseas test centers.However, the MCI had clarified since the exam is conducted in pen and paper mode, it will not be feasible to have a different pattern for Gulf countries or establish a centre there amid the pandemic situation.Among Indian states too, there has been a growing chorus for postponing the two exams in view of a spike in COVID-19 cases. However, the Ministry of Education has clarified the exams will be conducted on schedule in September as any further delay now can lead to a zero academic year.These exams have already been deferred twice in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.The JEE-Main was originally scheduled to be held from April 7-11, but was postponed to July 18-23, the NEET-UG was originally scheduled for May 3, but pushed to July 26.

In our considered view, in the facts and specificities of the instant case, compensation of Rs 25 lakh with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum from the date of the death of the patient appears just and equitable,” the bench said.The compensation shall be paid within six weeks of the pronouncement of this order, without fail, it said.“There was an urgent need for brain CT scan of the patient but it was delayed more than 3 hours for the want of a fresh receipt of Rs 1,850 towards CT scan charges even though complainants had already deposited 1,50,000 in advance. Hospital has every right to insist on the payment but it was also a prime duty to care (for) the emergency patient,” the bench said.According to the complaint, the 58-year man, who later died, had a history of pain in his left arm after engaging in strenuous activity. In 2009, the patient visited the hospital’s outpatient department complaining of pain in his left arm on exertion.The patient got admitted in CMC as a private patient. On next day, after examination it was diagnosed as a case of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).The hospital began administering doses of Heparin to the patient, the complaint alleged, adding that it was started without any laboratory investigations or monitoring protocol.The patient complained to the hospital authorities of bleeding and disorientation, but despite repeated requests the doctors ignored it.  It stated that they continued administering the drug (Heparin), which was the cause of the bleeding, only to be informed later that he had suffered a stroke and there was an immediate need for a CT scan.Citing unpaid dues, the CT scan sought was denied for over three hours despite the fact that Rs 1,50,000 was already deposited.“The delay in treatment and the improper administration of Heparin led to anticoagulation, resulting in brain haemorrhage, and the patient suffered stroke in the morning at 08:30 AM, since then the doctors at CMC virtually did nothing till 10.30 PM and after long struggle the patient died on 20.06.2009 at 6.30am,” it said.The hospital raised preliminary objections that the complainants filed a false complaint and suppressed the correct facts. It was further contended that the blood thinners the patient had been taking prior to his treatment at the hospital may have caused internal bleeding.Being aggrieved, the patient’s wife and son filed the consumer complaint against the CMC for the alleged medical negligence and callousness of the doctors seeking compensation of Rs 2.01 crore.

30-08-2020||New Delhi||India to start bidding process by October to procure 6 submarines costing Rs 55,000 crore||India is all set to launch the bidding process by next month for a Rs 55,000-crore mega project to build six conventional submarines for the Indian Navy to narrow the gap with China's growing naval prowess, government sources said on Sunday.The submarines will be built in India under the much-talked-about strategic partnership model that allows domestic companies to join hands with leading foreign defence majors to produce high-end military platforms in the country and reduce import dependence.The sources said the groundwork like specifications of the submarines and other critical requirements for issuance of the RFP (request for proposal) for the mega project, named as P-75 I, has been completed by separate teams of the defence ministry and the Indian Navy.The RFP will be issued by October, they added.The defence ministry has already shortlisted two Indian shipyards and five foreign defence majors for the project, being billed as one of biggest "Make in India" ventures.The shortlisted Indian entities were L&T group and state-owned Mazagaon Docks Ltd (MDL) while the select foreign entities included ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (Germany), Navantia (Spain) and Naval Group (France).Initially, the defence ministry will issue RFPs to MDL and L&T and the two firms will have to submit their detailed bid after receiving the document. Subsequently, the L&T and MDL will have to select a foreign partner out of the five shortlisted entities, the sources said.The Indian Navy plans to acquire 24 new submarines, including six nuclear attack submarines, to bolster its underwater fighting capability. It currently has 15 conventional submarines and two nuclear submarines.The Navy has been focusing on significantly bolstering its overall capabilities in view of China's growing efforts to increase its military presence in the Indian Ocean Region.The Indian Ocean, considered the backyard of the Indian Navy, is critical to the country's strategic interests.According to global naval analysts, Chinese navy currently has over 50 submarines and about 350 ships. The total number of ships and submarines is projected to go past 500 in next 8-10 years.The Indian Navy is also in the process of procuring 57 carrier-borne fighter jets, 111 Naval Utility Helicopters (NUH) and 123 multi-role helicopters under the strategic partnership model.The policy envisages the establishment of long-term strategic partnerships with Indian defence majors through a transparent and competitive process wherein they would tie up with global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to seek technology transfers.Initially, the strategic partners will be selected in four segments - fighter aircraft, helicopters, submarines and armoured fighting vehicles/main battle tanks. It is expected to be expanded to other segments.In the last few months, the government has unveiled a series of reform measures and initiatives to make India a hub of defence manufacturing.On August 9, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced that India will stop the import of 101 weapons and military platforms like transport aircraft, light combat helicopters, conventional submarines, cruise missiles and sonar systems by 2024.In May, the government announced increasing the FDI limit from 49 per cent to 74 per cent under the automatic route in the defence sector.India is one the largest importers of arms globally.According to estimates, the Indian armed forces are projected to spend around USD 130 billion in capital procurement in the next five years.The government now wants to reduce dependence on imported military platforms and has decided to support the domestic defence manufacturing.The defence ministry has set a goal of a turnover of USD 25 billion (Rs 1.75 lakh crore) in defence manufacturing in the next five years that included an export target of USD 5 billion (Rs 35,000 crore) worth of military hardware.

30-08-2020||New Delhi||Census, National Population Register unlikely in 2020||The first phase of the Census and the exercise to update the National Population Register (NPR), scheduled for this year but deferred due to the coronavirus outbreak, may be delayed by a year as there is no sign of slowdown of the pandemic.The Indian census is one of the largest administrative and statistical exercises in the world, with the involvement of more than 30 lakh officials who would visit each household across the length and breadth of the country.“Census is not an essential exercise for now. Even if it is delayed by a year, there would be no harm,” a senior official told PTI.The official said no final decision has been taken on when the first phase of the Census 2021 and NPR update would take place, but it is almost certain that it would not be held in 2020 due to the rising cases of the coronavirus.The house-listing phase of the Census and the exercise to update NPR were scheduled to be carried out across the country from April 1 to September 30, 2020, but were postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak.“As the entire exercise needs the involvement of lakhs of officials and visit to each family, we can’t undermine the health risk involved in it,” the official said.With a record single-day spike of 78,761 cases, the total coronavirus cases in India rose to 35,42,733, while the death toll climbed to 63,498 as on Sunday.According to the earlier schedule, the census would have its reference date as March 1, 2021, and in the snow-bound areas of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, it would be October 1, 2020.“The COVID-19 threat is still looming large. The Census and NPR are not in the priority list of the government as of now,” another official said.In March, when the coronavirus-induced lockdown was announced, the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India was all set for the first phase of the census and updation of the NPR that was scheduled to begin from April 1.Even though some state governments opposed the NPR update, all offered full support to the census exercise.The census is the largest single source of a variety of statistical information on people of India which helps the State to chalk out various policies.With a history of more than 130 years, this reliable, time-tested exercise has been bringing out a veritable wealth of statistics every 10 years, including on the rich diversity of the people, and has become one of the tools to understand and study India.The objective of the NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars.The NPR is a register of the usual residents of the country. It is prepared at the local (village and sub-town), subdistrict, district, state and national levels under provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003.The data for NPR was last collected in 2010 along with the house listing phase of the Census 2011. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting a door-to-door survey.While updating the register in 2015, the government had asked details like Aadhaar and the mobile number of people.This time, the information related to their driving licence and voter ID card may also be gathered, the officials said.Though information regarding the place of birth of parents will be sought, it is up to the residents whether to respond to the question as it is voluntary.For the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months.The law compulsorily seeks to register every citizen of India and issue a national identity card.The demographic details required for every usual resident are name, relationship to head of household, father’s name, mother’s name, spouse’s name (if married), sex, date of birth, marital status, place of birth, nationality (as declared), present address of usual residence, duration of stay at present address, permanent residential address, occupation and educational qualification.

We also have a Bug Bounty programme, under which we reward responsible disclosure of any security risks. We extensively work with the security research community and safely resolve security anomalies,” the Paytm Mall spokesperson said.

30-08-2020||New Delhi||'Can't see heavens falling' for need of elected Congress president: Khurshid||Asserting that there was no urgency to have an elected Congress president, senior leader Salman Khurshid on Sunday said he "can't see the heavens falling" for the need of a party chief as Sonia Gandhi was still at the helm and should be the one to decide on the leadership issue.Khurshid, a former Union minister and among the leaders considered close to the Gandhi family, told PTI in an interview that he would not have signed the letter even if he was approached by the group that wrote to Gandhi seeking urgent organisational overhaul, including an active and full-time leadership.On Ghulam Nabi Azad, the most vocal among the 23 letter writers, seeking organisational elections to ensure that the Congress does not remain out of power for decades, Khurshid said the senior leader from Jammu and Kashmir had been part of the top echelons of the party for years when there have been no such elections and still the party prospered.He said probably Azad wanted a change now in what the party has been doing over the years and expressed confidence that the leadership will give a thought to what he is saying as he is a senior leader  Khurshid said the leaders who have written to Sonia Gandhi always had access to her and could have approached her rather than writing to her."It is very clear that the important persons in this letter do belong to the top echelons of our party and therefore Mrs Gandhi has indicated that it was best that they could have discussed it within the confines of the party," he said.Khurshid's remarks assume significance as they come days after the 'group of 23' wrote to Gandhi calling for far-reaching reforms within the party such as having a "full time, active and visible" leadership, devolution of powers to state units and revamping the Congress Working Committee (CWC) in line with the party constitution.Asked about the suggestions made in the letter, Khurshid said the discussion seems to be about electing a leader and the Congress president has indicated that it can be done at an appropriate time when physically it is possible."For people like me, we already have leaders, we have a leader in Mrs Sonia Gandhi, we have a leader in Rahul Gandhi. So for me, there is no sense of urgency about electing leaders. Electing a president, yes that will happen when it happens, I can't see the heavens falling down. What is the sense of urgency that is being expressed, is not clear to me," he said."We don't have a part-time president, we have a full-time president but the full-time president is an interim president and no ordinary person as an interim president as she is the longest-serving president. We must just trust and leave it to the longest-serving president to take steps when she thinks it is appropriate," the Congress leader said.On whether it would have been better to go to the president for articulating concerns than writing a letter, Khurshid said the leaders had done that for the last 20 years and he did not know what was different now or had changed that they felt the need to write a letter.Asked about the future of the party with knives out within the organisation at a time it needs to be revitalised, he said, "The pens are out, so what is the problem. Of course, the words written with pens can hurt and they did, but they don't draw blood...it's only ink, it's something we can live with and I am sure that the ink will fade in due course." Khurshid said no one had approached him for signing the letter and even if anyone had done so, he would not have signed because he does not agree with the letter."There is nothing about that letter that gives an opportunity for me to express and say that I may want to say...We have always spoken directly with the leadership, so I don't know what changed because of which people are not speaking directly. Nothing has changed for me and therefore, I don't see the urge for writing the letter," he said.Khurshid said he still feels that instead of leaders continuously urging Rahul Gandhi to come back as party chief, they must leave the decision to him."Surely he understands the implications of that letter more than I do, he will do what he thinks is the best to do," he said when asked if it was now imperative for Rahul Gandhi to return as party chief to set the house in order.After the seven-hour meeting of the party's top decision-making body last week, the CWC urged Sonia Gandhi to continue as its interim chief till an AICC session could be convened and authorised her to effect necessary organisational changes to deal with the challenges facing the party.It made it clear no one would be permitted to undermine or weaken the party and its leadership.The CWC also resolved that inner-party issues cannot be deliberated through the media or in public fora and all such issues must be raised within the party "in the interest of propriety and discipline". --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-see-heavens-falling-for-need-of-elected-congress-president-khurshid-133758

Several states have demonstrated a better performance by registering a positivity rate that is lower than the national average,” the Ministry said.India’s COVID-19 tally rose to 35,42,733 with a record single-day spike of 78,761 cases, while the death toll due to the disease climbed to 63,498 with 948 people succumbing to it in a span of 24 hours, the Ministry’s data, updated at 8 am, showed.The testing strategy also ensured a steady expansion of the laboratory network across the country. As many as 1,583 laboratories — 1,003 in the government sector and 580 private ones — are providing comprehensive COVID-19 testing facilities to people. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-tests-go-past-4-14-crore-in-india-133756

If these masks are thrown away, it can emerge as a prominent political party.”               He said Congress veteran late V N Gadgil described the Congress as an old woman who will never die. “Rahul Gandhi has to decide what to do with the old lady,” Raut added.

30-08-2020||Kolkata||3 senior Visva-Bharati officials dismissed from service for ‘tampering with’ minutes of meeting||Three senior officials of Visva-Bharati, including former officiating vice-chancellor Sabujkali Sen, have been dismissed from service for alleged tampering of a resolution recorded during the institute’s executive council (EC) meeting in 2018.The decision was taken by the council on Friday evening, based on the recommendations made by a one-man committee of Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, set up for the purpose, an EC member said.Before making his recommendations, Justice Bhattacharya, a former judge of the Calcutta High Court, had gone through the findings of another inquiry committee in the case, which had concluded that Sen and two others “tampered with the recording of an EC meeting held in February 2018”.Former officiating registrar Sougata Chattopadhyay and ex-finance officer Samit Roy are the other two institute officials who were removed by the council, the EC member said.Sen was appointed as the officiating vice-chancellor (VC) on February 2, 2018, days after Prof Swapan Dutta retired from the post. Her tenure, however, was set to last only for a few days, as the EC, during its meeting on February 17 that year, decided to anoint another senior official, Asha Mukherjee, as the next acting VC.The former officiating VC, with the help of Chattopadhyay and Roy, allegedly “tampered with the minutes of the meeting” to be able to extend her term.The council, during an emergency meeting two days ago, dismissed the officials from service with immediate effect, just three days before Sen’s retirement.Terming the EC’s decision as “vindictive, premeditated, unfair,” Sen claimed that she was not given time to produce documents and defend herself.All three officials were intimated about the central varsity’s decision over e-mail, the EC member added.

30-08-2020||Bengaluru||Karnataka mining baron Janardhan Reddy tests positive for Covid-19||Karnataka’s mining baron and former BJP minister Gali Janardhan Reddy has tested positive for the novel coronavirus and admitted to a private hospital for treatment in the city, an official said on Sunday.“Reddy is in a private hospital for treatment after he tested positive for corona virus on Saturday as he was not feeling well. As he is asymptomatic, he is responding to the treatment,” a party official told IANS here.Confirming that Reddy tested positive for the infection, state Health Minister B. Sriramulu said he would pray to god for his best friend’s speedy recovery.Incidentally, Reddy, 53, was to visit Bellary on Sunday to attend the last rites of Sriramulu’s mother after the Supreme Court on August 27 allowed him to travel to his hometown from Bengaluru for two days.As Reddy is on conditional bail since January 2015 in multi-crore illegal mining scam cases, he is banned from visiting or staying in Bellary pending investigation.In a Facebook post, Reddy said he would not be able to attend the funeral as he is in the hospital here for treatment.Sriramulu recently recovered from the infection after he tested positive on August 9 and was treated at a state-run hospital in the city centre.In a related development, former Congress legislator Munirathna has also been admitted in a private hospital in the city after he tested positive on Saturday.Munirathna, 57, joined the ruling BJP in November 2019 after he defected from the Congress following his disqualification for revolting against the party. He resigned from the RR Nagar Assembly segment in the city’s northwest suburb.Former Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S) minister H.D. Revanna and Congress state unit president D.K. Shivakumar are in separate private hospitals after they both tested positive for the virus last week.Scores of politicians, including Chief Minister B.S Yediyurappa, opposition Congress leader Siddaramaiah, state cabinet ministers S.T. Somashekar, Anand Singh and C.T. Ravi, Lok Sabha members, MLAs and MLCs tested positive and recovered from the infection. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-mining-baron-janardhan-reddy-tests-positive-for-covid-19-133741
30-08-2020||New Delhi||Bihar polls: Some leaders feel Congress far from hitting top gear||Amid a turmoil within the Congress, some leaders feel the party is far from hitting top gear in preparing for the Bihar assembly polls, but senior party functionaries involved in strategising for the elections are confident of sealing an alliance with “like-minded parties” soon and putting up a good show.The assembly elections in Bihar are likely to be held on time in October-November despite demands by some political parties for postponing the polls in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. These elections are being seen as the next big political fight between the BJP-led NDA and a combined opposition force.While the Congress as such is not in a position to lead the opposition alliance in Bihar with its ally Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) having a relatively much larger base, some within the party feel its electoral and even seat-bargaining prospects may take a hit due to the ongoing turmoil over the central leadership and other organisational issues raised by a group of leaders.The appointed party office bearers, however, asserted that the controversy surrounding the letter written by 23 leaders to party chief Sonia Gandhi seeking organisational changes will, in no way, impact the party’s preparations for the Bihar polls.Also, all parties need to evolve novel campaign strategies for an election to be held under the coronavirus pandemic protocols.Various political equations are also changing fast with all eyes glued to whether Nitish Kumar, who has been at the helm for about 15 years barring a brief period when Jitan Ram Manjhi replaced him, will hold his ground or get challenged by the opposition ‘grand alliance’.But cracks have begun appearing in the opposition grand alliance with Hindustani Awam Morcha’s Manjhi already exiting the group.Asked about the alliance and seat-sharing talks in the opposition camp, AICC in-charge for Bihar, Shaktisinh Gohil, said they were moving in the right direction and “appropriate things happen at an appropriate time”.“We want all like-minded parties to fight together and work is moving in that direction. I am confident that in every good atmosphere we will have an alliance,” he told PTI.Asked if Rahul Gandhi will lead the campaign in the Bihar polls, Gohil said his leadership is for the whole country and “we would want him to give maximum time in Bihar”.On the controversy surrounding the letter by the ‘group of 23’ and whether it has taken the party’s focus away from polls, he said this will not affect the Bihar elections.“The Congress has internal democracy under which this happened, it (letter) should not have been leaked to the media and should not have panned out the way it did. But after the CWC meeting, it is not an issue and will not impact (preparations for) Bihar polls,” Gohil said.Congress’ Bihar unit chief Madan Mohan Jha echoed Gohil’s views on the letter written to the Congress chief, saying it will not impact polls preparations.He said talks for seat-sharing were on and an alliance will be soon finalised.Asked if it was certain the Congress would contest more than the 41 seats it had fought in the last assembly polls, he answered in the affirmative.“(RLSP’s Upendra) Kushwaha ji will be there, (Vikassheel Insaan Party’s Mukesh) Sahni ji will be there and new partners could join us,” he told PTI, without elaborating.Sources said Congress will also hold a slew of virtual rallies in the coming weeks.However, not all Congress leaders from Bihar feel the party is battle-ready for the polls.Kirti Azad, a senior party leader from Bihar, said the campaign should have been in the top gear already, but that is “unfortunately not there” for the Congress.“There are a lot of disadvantages at the moment. One is that you cannot go and hold public meetings, you have to do virtual meetings. The BJP is far ahead because they have been doing this, they have got the money, they have got the system and had started in June,” he told PTI.Azad, who switched over from the BJP to the Congress ahead of Lok Sabha polls last year, also indicated that he was not being kept in the loop regarding the strategising for polls.Bihar Congress’ working president Kaukab Quadri also said the party’s preparations were not up to the mark and it was lagging behind opponents.“There was a need to bring about changes after assessment of the result of Lok Sabha polls in Bihar. But that did not happen. Despite such a grand alliance, we neither got seats nor the vote percentage we expected,” he told PTI.He said the party now needs to focus on finalising seat-sharing soon and select appropriate candidates keeping in mind dynamics of seats to turn the fortunes around for the party.He also cast aspersions on the Kushwaha-led Rashtriya Lok Samta Party’s loyalty to the grand alliance, saying there is no guarantee it will not go over to the BJP after the polls.“Leave alone top gear, we are in the ‘neutral’ and when we are applying gears, we are applying reverse,” Quadri said in a lighter vein about the party's preparations.In the 2015 polls, the Congress had won 27 out of the 41 seats it contested while the JD(U)-RJD-Congress alliance secured 178 seats in the 243-member assembly. The RJD had emerged the leader of the pack with 80 seats while JD(U) bagged 71, both of whom had contested 101 seats each.While Nitish Kumar became chief minister of the grand alliance government after the 2015 polls, he and his party later switched sides to join the NDA in 2017.The term of the Bihar assembly comes to an end on November 29.

30-08-2020||New Delhi||Many transgender community members battling mental, physical abuse during pandemic||Reshma, a transwoman from Ajmer, was the sole breadwinner of her family of five, whom she started supporting at an early age of 16 by begging in trains.She says she has heard all kinds of taunts and sarcastic comments about her gender from outsiders all her life, but was shattered when her own family's attitude changed towards her since the lockdown."As the lockdown progressed, and I was not able to bring anything back home, slowly the taunts started, which soon turned into verbal abuse. My family members, especially my brothers, for whom I had to drop out of school so that they could study, started calling me a disgrace," Reshma (36) said."They did not realise that I was a disgrace when I was supporting them financially. Slowly, the verbal abuse gave way to physical violence and one day, it became so unbearable that I decided to move out," she added.For 33-year-old Sunehri (name changed), a transwoman from Bihar, the issue of domestic violence pushed her out of her home years ago.She was sending money back home every month but ever since the lockdown was imposed, she lost all means of livelihood and had no option but to move back with them."I had to go back to my home as I had no money left to live alone. I thought the situation might have changed as my family was dependent on my earnings, but I was wrong. They were not there for me when I needed them. Their abuse started soon after I returned in May. I cannot wait to get back on my feet and end this torture," she said.Krishna (name changed), a 33-year-old transwoman from Bengaluru, says she was shocked when her long-time partner hit her for the first time in April.Treating it as a one-off incident, she forgave him but as the months passed, the abuse became more frequent."The violence increased up to a point that I started fearing for my life. My partner lost his job of a security guard soon after the lockdown and his frustration and anger turned violent as even I was unable to bring any money home," 40-year-old Krishna, who danced at celebrations to earn her living, said."I finally left him and moved back with my family members, who also do not want me to stay with them for long, but till I get back on my feet, there is no other option," she said.The transgender community has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.Relegated to the sidelines of the society, many of the country's estimated 4.88 lakh transgender people are forced to make a living through begging, dancing at celebrations like weddings and sex work, according to rights groups.But ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many trans community members have lost their means of livelihood and have been struggling to earn a living.They say they have been subjected to taunts, verbal abuse and domestic violence by their partners and family members in the last few months."They were of no value to their family members anymore once they stopped earning, so the family members started treating them as they wanted," said Jaipur-based transgender activist Pushpa Mai.Bittu, an LGBTQ activist, said several transgender community members had to be rescued from their houses due to violence since the lockdown."We had to rescue a number of transmen during the lockdown because they were facing so much violence at their homes," he said.Akhila Sivadas, the managing trustee and executive director of the Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR), a non-profit organisation, said the only way domestic violence, social stigma and discrimination will stop is by empowering transgender persons and groups."Constitute state and national-level commissions and councils for transgenders and let the National Legal Services Authority mandate the district legal services authorities to appoint transgender people as paralegal volunteers and not only sensitise everyone on law but also on the legal rights and entitlements of transgender people," she said.Meera Parida, co-founder of Sakha, said, "The COVID-19 outbreak has pushed us back to those times when we were struggling to come to terms with our identity, get heard and save ourselves from life-threatening challenges."In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, she urged the government to consider the concerns of transgenders while framing policies and strategies."The trans community needs the help and support of the society and the government more than ever now," she noted.

We go by what CBI, ED, Police or NCB officially says in writing."In screenshots of WhatsApp chats made public by Sushant's sister Shweta Singh Kirti on her unverified Twitter page on Friday night, Rhea, her brother Showik, Samuel Miranda, and Siddharth Pithani talk of "doobie" (which Google defines as cannabis cigarette) and 'blueberry kush'.Shweta had tweeted to share the screenshots from a WhatsApp group named "NIFW". The group members include names like Aayush SSR, Anandi SSR, Siddharth Pithani SSR, Rhea and others.Earlier chats leaked in sections of the media allegedly had Rhea talking of using MDMA and also discussing marijuana."In case we speak about hard drugs, I haven't been doing too much. Tried MDMA once," she allegedly messaged a man named Gaurav Arya, asking him: "You have MD?" A message sent to her by one Jaya Saha on November 25 last year read: "Use 4 drops in coffee, tea or water and let him sip it. Give it 30-40 minutes for it to kick in."

What do these people want? They want that everyone — our youth, our tribals, our poor, our women — should remain quiet.

Divisive forces that instigate citizens and rule in the name fear and polarisation are ruling the roost. Freedom of expression is in danger. Democratic institutions are being destroyed.
