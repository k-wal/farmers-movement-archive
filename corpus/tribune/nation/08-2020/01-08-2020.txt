01-08-2020||Jaipur||CM Gehlot lacks numbers, does not trust his MLAs: BJP||Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia on Saturday attacked Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, saying he does not trust his MLAs and lacked the numbers to prove majority in the assembly.“The government is in a five-star hotel in Jaisalmer. He has no trust in his ministers and MLAs. Therefore, they are holed up in the hotel amid tight security,” Poonia said.This situation would not have arisen if Gehlot had the numbers, Poonia told reporters at the party office here.Also read: If high command forgives rebels, I will welcome them back: GehlotThe BJP chief said it was the infighting within the Congress which was to blame for the situation, rather than his party.Taking a dig at the state government, Poonia said though the law and order situation is deteriorating, its legislators were enjoying the stay at a five-star hotel.The MLAs loyal to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had remained confined to Fairmont hotel in Jaipur since July 13 before being flown to Jaisalmer amid a power tussle between the Chief Minister and his former deputy Sachin Pilot.They are expected to stay in Jaisalmer till the beginning of the assembly session from August 14.The Congress has accused the BJP of playing a major role in the rebellion by Sachin Pilot and 18 other party MLAs.It has accused the saffron party of indulging in horse-trading to topple the state government.

01-08-2020||New Delhi||Indian Army prepares to maintain current strength in eastern Ladakh during winter months||The Indian Army is preparing to maintain its current strength of troops, tanks and other weaponry in all key areas in eastern Ladakh in the harsh winter months as a resolution to the border row with China in the mountainous region shows no signs of early resolution, people familiar with the developments said on Saturday.They said the Indian Air Force (IAF) would also remain on high alert in the forward air bases along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) while the Navy would maintain its aggressive deployment in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) to keep up pressure on China.“The Indian Army is making elaborate preparations for the long haul in eastern Ladakh even as it awaits confirmation from the Chinese military for the fifth round of military talks which was earlier expected to take place this week,” they said.They said the top military and strategic brass reviewed the overall situation along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere on Saturday, adding Army chief Gen MM Naravane has been regularly updating Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on matters relating to operational preparedness.Government sources said maintaining the current level of troops and weaponry in the high-altitude region would require extensive preparations as the temperature drops beyond minus 20 degrees Celsius in the region in peak winter months.“We are preparing to maintain its current strength. That is the plan as of now based on the assessment of the current scenario,” said a source.Sources said the government had set the ball rolling in the procurement of high-altitude clothing and other required equipment for its soldiers posted in the region.They said the armies of the two countries were now expected to hold the next round of Corps commander-level talks next week to thrash out modalities to take forward the disengagement process from the Finger points at Pangong Tso.India despatched thousands of additional troops and weaponry, including tanks and artillery guns, to their rear bases in eastern Ladakh following the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. Subsequently, China has also strengthened its military deployment.The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.The Chinese military has pulled back from Galwan Valley and certain other friction points “but the withdrawal of troops has not moved forward from the Finger areas in Pangong Tso as demanded by India,” sources said.India has been insisting that China must withdraw its forces from areas between Finger Four and Eight. The mountain spurs in the area are referred to as Fingers.On July 24, the two sides held another round of diplomatic talks on the border issue.After the talks, the Ministry of External Affairs said both sides agreed that an early and complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC in accordance with bilateral agreement and protocols was essential for the overall development of bilateral relations.The sources said India conveyed a firm message to the Chinese side that it had to implement the disengagement process as agreed to during the four rounds of Corps commander-level talks between the two armies.Three weeks after the Galwan Valley clashes, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a nearly two-hour-long telephonic conversation on July 5 to bring down tension in the region. Both sides commenced the disengagement process from July 6 following the Doval-Wang talks who are Special Representatives for the boundary question.After the fourth round of Corps commander-level talks, the Army said both sides are committed to “complete disengagement” of troops, adding the process is “intricate” and that it requires “constant verification”.

Our experts are analysing the same,” K. Sivan, Chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), told IANS.“It seems the commands were sent to the lander blindly for days & there is a distinct possibility that the lander could have received commands and relayed it to the rover... but the lander was not able to communicate it back to the earth,” Subramanian said.There is also the possibility of the rover rolling out of the lander when it impacted the moon surface.Tweeting a picture taken by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbital (LRO), Shanmugam said the white dot might be the skeleton lander devoid of other payloads and the black dot might be the rover.According to him, the rover may be still intact on the moon’s surface. Latest pictures from LRO (Jan 4, 2020) showed rover tracks on the moon from the lander.He said the debris he had found earlier might be from one of the payloads. The debris found by NASA might be of other payloads, transmitting antenna and thrusters.Vikram lost contact with ISRO following its launch from Chandrayaan-2 moon orbiter on September 6 last year when it tried to make softlanding near the moon’s south pole.July 21, 2020 marked a year of the launch of India’s second moon mission by a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV)-MkIII-M1.It was on July 22, 2019, when the GSLV rocket, nicknamed ‘Bahubali’, blasted off from the second launch pad at India’s rocket port in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh carrying Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter Vikram (lander) and Pragyan (rover). — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isro-checking-space-enthusiasts-claim-of-chandrayaan-2-rover-rolling-on-lunar-surface-120827

Earlier, Darbhanga and West Champaran had reported seven and four deaths respectively.The number of people affected by the floods, across 14 districts, stood at 49.05 lakhs, up from 45.39 lakhs on Friday.The number of affected panchayats too has risen to 1,043 from 1,012 on the previous day.According to the department, the state has received a total average rainfall of 768.5 mm since the onset of monsoon, which was 46 per cent above normal.This has led to a rise in water levels of most rivers flowing through the state, especially those originating in Nepal and crisscrossing the northern districts, known for bringing along huge deposits of silt.More than a quarter of the affected populace resides in the three adjoining districts of East Champaran, Gopalganj and Saran, all of which fall in the Gandak basin, named after the river that enters Bihar from Nepal through the remote West Champaran district.Other rivers which have been flowing above danger levels at various places include Koshi, Budhi Gandak, Kamla, Bagmati and Adhwara.Besides these districts, those ravaged by the deluge so far are Khagaria, Kishanganj, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Sheohar, Siwan and Samastipur.Sixteen cattle have also been killed in the floods till date, according to the bulletin.Relief and rescue work is, meanwhile, in full swing with 29 teams of NDRF and SDRF pressed into service. The number of people evacuated till date was 3.92 lakh, an addition of about 16,000 since the previous day.Only 26,732 people have, however, taken shelter at 19 relief camps. Care was being taken to ensure that social distancing measures and other precautions against the COVID 19 pandemic were in place at the camps and community kitchens set up for flood victims.Close to 9 lakh people were being fed at 1,340 community kitchens, which are functioning in 11 of the affected districts.

He has a flying experience of more than 3,800 hours, including operational flying on MiG-21, MiG-23 MF, MiG 29 and Su-30 MKI fighter jets.Air Marshal Chaudhari held numerous important positions.

01-08-2020||New Delhi||Amar Singh: The ‘Thakur’ who made 27, Lodi Estate, the hottest address||Who was Amar Singh? The answer will differ on who you ask. One set of people will call him the man who was at the heart of UPA’s infamous trust vote and a very powerful power broker. Another set will call him “humorous”, as Rajnath Singh did.The man had access and acceptability across all political ideologies.Singh died young at 64 on Saturday, battling a critical infection after his second kidney transplant, in Singapore. In a country where 50 years old politicians are considered ‘young’, Singh surely died way too early. However, his tryst with the kidney ailment wasn’t new. Intermittently, he had gone through long spells of treatment in Singapore, with even his long-time friend Amitabh Bacchhan spending time with him there, to boost his morale.Singh was expelled from the Samajwadi Party in 2010. However, he was re-inducted, only to be expelled again in 2017, when Akhilesh Yadav took charge of the party in his own hands. However, even in the most intense moments of animosity between Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav on the one side and Amar Singh on the other, the patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav had a special fondness for Singh, something the businessman turned pelican knew well and as many within SP suspect, he used to his advantage.During the UPA era, he was one of the most powerful men in the national capital. A power broker who can get things done, was his image. While UPA Chairperson and NAC chief Sonia Gandhi’s residence  -- 10, Janpath was the most significant address, Amar Singh ensured his official residence, 27, Lodi Estate was no less.On most days of the month, the street leading to his house would be swarmed with OB vans, top political journalists and a slew of cameramen, for one or the other comment he would make that would become the day’s most controversial talking point. Singh knew he created controversy and he used it to his advantage.His two neighbours for the most part of UPA—BJP’s Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Congress’ Anand Sharma had to come to terms with regular overwhelming media attention on the man who many in his close circuit call as ‘Thakur Sahab’.This Rajya Sabha member’s rise has been meteoric and fast. He spoke many languages, including Bengali, with finesse that made him bond with unlikely leaders like Mamata Banerjee. He had deep penetration into Bollywood’s who’s who. Amar Singh had so much clout that he could regularly take pot shots at Digvijaya Singh, then a very powerful leader in Delhi of the ruling Congress party, and yet get away with it.While Singh was at the thick of the strategy of the treasury benches, he could casually walk down to the opposition side and start an animated conversation with BJP leaders. This ability to mingle with any political leader, made him both regarded and envied.Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke of it when he tweeted, “He was known for his friendship across many spheres of life.”If Amitabh Bachhan, with whose family he had a late fallout, was his best friend in Bollywood, his closest acquaintance in the corporate world was Anil Ambani.But it was only the ‘cash for vote scam’ that unravelled his clout during the UPA. Delhi Police had told a city court that it was Singh who introduced Sanjeev Saxena as his secretary to allegedly bribe three BJP members of Parliament a day before the infamous trust vote on July 22, 2008.BJP’s Faggan Singh Kulaste, Ashok Argal and Mahabir Singh Bhagora had caused an absolute chaos in July 2008, when the trio waved bundles of cash in the Lok Sabha. They had alleged back then that they were part of a bribe to save the Congress-led government after Left parties withdrew support questioning the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal. Though Singh and the three BJP leaders were let off in 2013, one thing was clear—Amar Singh was more than an MP during UPA and his address was a Lutyens’ powercentre.As the entire political spectrum mourns the loss of Amar Singh, 27, Lodi Estate, his residence during the UPA era, stands in silence today. Once, the epicentre of Lutyens’ political activities, the bungalow has stood witness to the rise of Amar Singh, an unlikely politician who loves to wear a smile and flaunt his Mont Blanc pens. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amar-singh-the-thakur-who-made-27-lodi-estate-the-hottest-address-120818
01-08-2020||---||Rules relaxed to ease sanction of pension in cases where govt servant dies in service||Vijay MohanTribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 1The Central government has relaxed certain provisions in the pension rules to ease the sanction and payment of provisional family pension in cases where a government employee dies while in service.Besides civilians, the new provisions have significance for the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), where instances of death in service are relatively higher on account of the nature of their duties.According to orders issued by the Department of Pension and Pensioners’ Welfare (DoPPW) earlier this week, Rule 80-A of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, which required the head of the office concerned to sanction and draw provisional family pension and death gratuity in favour of claimant after forwarding the case file and accompanying documents to the Pay and Accounts Office (PAO), has been relaxed.The new orders state that if a claim for family pension along with death certificate and bank account details has been received and the head of office is satisfied that the claim is bonafide, he shall sanction provisional family pension immediately.The head of office shall not wait for forwarding of the family pension case and other relevant documents to the PAO before sanctioning the provisional family pension.In CAPF related cases, where death of an employee occurs during service, initially provisional family pension may be sanctioned without waiting for the final Operation Casualty Report, the DoPPW has directed.The department observed that the process of forwarding the family pension case to PAO along with requisite documents itself takes a long time and in a large number of cases, provisional family pension and gratuity were not being sanctioned on death of a government servant. The delay in finalisation of family pension and gratuity resulted in hardship to the family of the deceased employee.In accordance with rules, family pension is payable to the family of a government servant who dies in harness irrespective of the length of service rendered before his death, but the  amount of death gratuity, however, depends on the length of qualifying service of the individual. The new rules do not apply to sanction of provisional gratuity.DoPPW has also directed that PAO shall release the provisional family pension on the basis of sanction order issued by the head of office without insisting for any other documents, including the service book. The provisional family pension shall be paid in the same manner as pay and allowances of the establishment are paid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rules-relaxed-to-ease-sanction-of-pension-in-cases-where-govt-servant-dies-in-service-120812
01-08-2020||Patna||Mumbai Police cooperating in Sushant probe, Bihar cops capable to unearth truth: DGP||The Mumbai Police is assisting the sleuths from Patna visiting the metropolis to probe the death of Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput, Bihar's Director General of Police (DGP) Gupteshwar Pandey said on Saturday, dubbing the allegations of misbehaviour as "rumours".Speaking to reporters, he said the Bihar Police is capable enough to investigate the matter and has recorded statements of a number of persons.Our team is camping in Mumbai. It has already examined and recorded the statement Rajputs close friend Mahesh Shetty. It also recorded the statement of his ex- girlfriend Ankita Lokhande, his sister Mitu Singh, cook Ashok, Niraj, and Dr Chavda (Dr Kersi Chavda), who treated Sushant for depression, Pandey said.Some more persons will be examined in connection with the alleged suicide, he added.Pandey said the Bihar Police wants all medico-legal evidence related to the case handed over to it, asserting that it will bring out the truth at the earliest.A four-member team of the state police is in Mumbai to probe the suicide after it registered an FIR at the Rajiv Nagar police station here on July 25 based on a complaint lodged by Rajput's father KK Singh.Our team had a meeting with Mumbai's Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) on Friday evening. The DCP assured of cooperation... Initially, there was some confusion and non-cooperation, Pandey told reporters here.Stating that the allegations of Mumbai Police's misbehaviour with the Bihar Police personnel were "rumours", Pandey said the local police there helped the sleuths from the eastern state reach its destinations.He said that the Mumbai Police did so as probably it did not want the Bihar Police to encounter the media.Pandey said the Bihar Police wants the forensic science laboratory reports, inquest report, post-mortem report and relevant CCTV footage in order to facilitate the probe.The Bihar Police also wants details of those who were examined by the Mumbai Police and what they have said in their statements, the top police chief said.Replying to a question, he said, Why would we ask for a CBI probe. Bihar Police is capable enough for probing the case. If needed, an IPS-rank officer may be sent to Mumbai to lead the investigation.The chorus for a CBI inquiry into the death, which happened on June 14, is growing with parties cutting across the political lines in Bihar, demanding that the central investigating agency take up the case for a fair probe.The Bihar Police team reached Mumbai on July 27 and began its probe.The FIR was lodged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including those pertaining to abetment of suicide and fraud.In his FIR, the father accused actor Rhea Chakraborty, who is said to have been in a relationship with Rajput, of having used his sons standing in Bollywood to promote her own career, trying to drive a wedge between him and his family, getting him fed with medicines for mental illness with the help of conniving doctors and blackmailing him with threats of making his medical history public to tarnish his public reputation.The bereaved father has also alleged that at least Rs 15 crore was withdrawn from his sons bank account to which Chakraborty and her family members had gained access and that barely a week before Rajput hung himself to death at his Bandra residence, the actress had visited his house and stolen his laptop, ATM card and other important documents.

01-08-2020||New Delhi||Prashant Bhushan moves SC, seeks recall of order issuing contempt notice against him||Activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan has moved the Supreme Court seeking recall of its July 22 order by which notice was issued against him in a contempt proceeding initiated for his alleged contemptuous tweets against the judiciary.In his plea, Bhushan has sought a direction to declare that the Apex Court’s secretary-general has allegedly “acted unconstitutionally and illegally” in accepting a “defective contempt petition” filed against him, which was initially placed on the administrative side and later on the judicial side.Besides this, Bhushan has sought a stay on the July 22 order and also on another order for listing on August 4 the pending separate contempt case filed against him in 2009.He has said in his plea that the top court should “desist” from hearing both these matters by video-conferencing and list them when the physical hearing resumes.On July 22, the Apex Court had issued notice to Bhushan in the contempt proceeding initiated against him for his alleged tweets, saying his statements prima facie “brought the administration of justice in disrepute”.Later, on July 24, the court had said it would hear on August 4 the 2009 contempt case against Bhushan and journalist Tarun Tejpal for allegedly casting aspersions on some sitting and former top court judges in an interview to a news magazine. Tejpal was the then editor of the magazine.In his plea, Bhushan has alleged that the contempt petition filed against him by one Mahek Maheshwari regarding a tweet posted by him “was defective” as the consent of either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General was not obtained.“It is most respectfully submitted that this court erred in taking suo motu cognisance of a petition that was defective, to begin with, and therefore, what could not have been done directly was done indirectly,” the plea said.It alleged that by taking cognisance on Maheshwari’s petition, the court has “dispensed with the requirement of taking consent of the Attorney General or the Solicitor General which is the express and non-derogable mandate of law.”While referring to the Supreme Court Rules 2013, the plea said that the “defective contempt petition” ought to have been returned to Maheshwari.“However, it appears from the order dated July 22, 2020…..the respondent (secretary-general), in complete disregard for the mandate of law, proceeded to entertain the said petition on the administrative side and thereafter placed the matter on the judicial side before the bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari on July 22,” the plea said.Bhushan has claimed in his plea that secretary general’s action in “unilaterally” placing the contempt petition before a bench presided over by Justice Mishra was “contrary to the settled law” as laid down by the top court which had categorically held that “Chief Justice of India is the master of the roster and enjoys the exclusive prerogative to constitute benches and assign matters to benches.”“It is submitted that the actions of the respondent (secretary-general) amount to a usurpation of the powers of the Chief Justice and are therefore clearly unlawful being contrary to settled law as well as the Supreme Court Rules 2013,” the plea claimed.It alleged that actions of secretary-general leading to initiation of contempt proceedings against Bhushan as well as the notice as per which he has been directed to appear in person before the court on August 5 “constitute an infringement of the petitioner’s right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution”.

The processed stuff is then sent to Karachi or Gwadar for transporting them into India through sea route, they said, adding that the proceeds of smuggled stuff are used for sponsoring terror activities of groups including the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and a few other outfits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-based-narco-terror-modules-turning-out-to-be-major-concern-security-officials-120804

The NEP 2020 changes this approach,” PM said.He also noted that among the most exciting things of the Policy is the emphasis on interdisciplinary study.“This concept has been gaining popularity and rightly so because one size does not fit all and one subject does not define who you are,” said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, adding that students could now learn math with music and coding with chemistry.Inter-disciplinary studies gave you control and made you flexible, he said, terming flexibility as another hallmark of the policy and citing multiple entry and exit options to college students as an example of this.PM also said the NEP was also big on access to education starting from primary education up to higher education where the aim was to increase Gross Enrolment Ratio to 50 per cent by 2035.“The 21st century is an era of knowledge. This is the time for an increased focus on learning, research and innovation. And this is exactly what India’s National Education Policy 2020 does. This policy wants to make your school, college and university experience fruitful, broad-based and one that guides you to your natural passions,” PM said.Hailing the NEP’s focus on the use of mother tongue for instruction up to Class 5 and preferably Class 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: “Language has remained a sensitive issue in India and regional languages have languished for years. The policy ensures Indian languages prosper and serve the purpose of national integration,” he said noting that the world’s top 20 nations on GDP use mother tongue for instruction.Describing the nuances of the NEP, the PM said it invited world’s top institutes to set up campuses in India and help make India a global education hub.The PM urged the youth to keep learning, questioning and solving problems and said the aim of government’s initiatives was to foster innovation, research and development.The NEP 2020 would produce job creators rather than job seekers, PM noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/burden-of-school-bag-to-boon-of-learning-nep-reflects-aspirations-of-21st-century-youth-pm-modi-120799
01-08-2020||New Delhi||SC stays bail granted to ex-Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Singh in money laundering case||The Supreme Court has stayed the bail granted to former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh in a money laundering case related to alleged misappropriation of funds at Religare Finvest Ltd (RFL).A Bench comprising justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavani and Krishna Murari on Friday passed the direction on a plea moved by the Enforcement Directorate against a Delhi High Court judgement granting bail to Singh.The apex court order came after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the ED, submitted that the high court did not consider the grounds raised by the agency.“Until further orders, status quo with respect to release from jail be maintained and impugned judgment (of HC) not to be treated as a precedent for any other case. Reply, if any, be filed in the meantime,” the apex court said.The high court on July 23 granted bail to Singh, saying it does not perceive any grave threat to the interests of the society or the public at large with his release.One of the main grounds raised by the ED’s special public prosecutor Nitesh Rana before the HC was that Singh smuggled and used a mobile phone while in custody.The high court had granted the bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs one crore and two sureties by family members of Rs 25 lakh each, while imposing various other bail conditions on him, including that he shall not tamper with the evidence or influence witnesses, directly or indirectly.The trial court had earlier denied bail to Singh in the matter, after which he approached the HC.He was arrested in the money laundering case by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and in the fraud case by Economic Offence Wing of Delhi police on December 12 and October 10 last year respectively. He has not been granted bail in the EOW’s case yet.The ED in January had filed a charge sheet against former Fortis Healthcare promoters Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Singh and others in the money laundering case related to alleged misappropriation of funds at RFL.RFL is a group firm of REL - Religare Enterprises Ltd - which was earlier promoted by Malvinder Singh and his brother Shivinder Singh.The EOW registered an FIR in March last year after it received a complaint from RFL’s Manpreet Suri against Shivinder, Malvinder, Godhwani, former CEO of REL Kavi Arora and former CFO of RFL Anil Saxena and others, alleging that loans were taken by them while managing the firm but the money was invested in other companies.       The ED lodged a money laundering case based on this.

If anyone, who had made India’s Independence struggle Indian, it was Tilak.”The event was organised by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) headed by senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Vinay Sahasrabudhe.Elaborating further the concept, Shah said: “Tilak Maharaj gave the clarion call that Swaraj is my birthright and I will take it. This was no ordinary sentence. This brought a paradigm shift to India’s freedom struggle. It turned the movement launched by the Congress into a people’s movement.”Highlighting Tilak’s contribution in bringing about social reforms, the Home Minister said the great leader agitated against cow slaughter, as he also fought for women’s rights, published the Kesari newspaper and even turned Shiv Jayanti and Ganpati festivals into a public movement.“If anyone, who took the values of Shivaji Maharaj to the people, it was Tilak,” he added.Further showering praise, Shah said: “If you read the thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi, Veer Savarkar and Madan Mohan Malviya, you can easily make out that all of them had a bit of Tilak in them.” He also urged the youth to read about Tilak and his work.Drawing a parallel between Tilak’s thoughts and those of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shah said: “It was Tilak’s advocacy for local languages in the Congress that made everyone speak in their mother tongue during its meetings. Today, PM Modi has brought in Sanskrit and local languages into government’s education policy.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tilak-made-indias-freedom-struggle-indian-amit-shah-120795

All types of ventilators were prohibited for export vide DGFT notification with effect from March 24.

01-08-2020||K V Prasad||Amar Singh, a politician with relations across the spectrum, dies at 64||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 1Amar Singh, who passed away at Singapore on Saturday following prolonged illness, was one of his kind among hoards of politicians in the Capital.For over a decade he strutted around the corridors of powers with a reach across a wide spectrum of people and personalities.Having found little success in the Congress party, Amar Singh’s political graph rose during the 1996-98 days of the United Front Government as he struck a unique relation with ‘Netaji’ Mulayam Singh Yadav, the powerful chief of the regional Samajwadi Party (SP).Read also: Amar Singh was skilful politician, had friends in all parties, say leaders across political spectrumObituary: The ‘Thakur’ who made 27, Lodi Estate, the hottest address“Saddened to know about the death of senior leader and parliamentarian Amar Singh,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh tweeted.Earlier in the day, the former Samajwadi leader had posted messages on Twitter, paying tributes to Bal Gangadhar Tilak on his 100th death anniversary and also wishing people on Eid.For a person who was equally at ease with the glamour world of Mumbai to corporate honchos, Amar Singh became the ‘go to’ person in Delhi for his ability to get things done by working on the phones. The early days of post first-phase of liberalisation saw Amar Singh play a role in giving a push to reforms in telecom and petroleum sectors, a contribution recalled by former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh today.That Amar Singh was highly driven is a trait acknowledged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who in his tweet recalled him as an energetic public figure who witnessed some of the major political developments from close quarters and known for friendship across many spheres of life.Amar Singh’s closeness to Netaji became part of the political folklore, making many wonder how a person who did not hide his connections with the rich and glamorous, could be part of a charmed circle of Yadav, the wrestler-turned-politician in a socialist mould. The association of an unabashed consumerist in a socialist set up caused deep dismay among ‘Lohia ke Log’ (Followers of Ram Manohar Lohia) in the party.The magic was not limited to Netaji. Amar Singh’s appeal extended to veteran Marxist Harkishan Singh Surjeet to some extent. So much so, when Amar Singh who portrayed himself as one who could get political leaders of diverse views break bread together, was not invited to the celebratory dinner hosted by UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi in May 2004, it was Surjeet who took him along.Yet, in 2008 it was Amar Singh’s intervention that made Yadav change his stand and support the nuclear deal that nearly wrecked UPA-1.Amar Singh, the once powerful general secretary of the Samajwadi Party, found his utility diminishing and over the next few years his ties with the party strained to the extent that he was out of it in 2010. While he remained a Rajya Sabha MP at the time of his death, his overtures to the new BJP-led dispensation found little political traction.वरिष्ठ नेता एवं सांसद श्री अमर सिंह के निधन के समाचार से दुःख की अनुभूति हुई है। सार्वजनिक जीवन के दौरान उनकी सभी दलों में मित्रता थी।स्वभाव से विनोदी और हमेशा ऊर्जावान रहने वाले अमर सिंहजी को ईश्वर अपने श्रीचरणों में स्थान दें। उनके शोकाकुल परिवार के प्रति मेरी संवेदनाएँ।  Tribute to the great revolutionary freedom fighter Lokmanya #BalGangadharTilak ji on his death anniversary.His contribution will be remembered forever🙏🙏 pic.twitter.com/tEdchlp1hz||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amar-singh-a-politician-with-relations-across-the-spectrum-dies-at-64-120788

There are 5,65,103 active cases in the country at present, according to the Health Ministry data updated at 8 am on Saturday.Also read: Record 57,118 cases in a day push national coronavirus tally to almost 17 lakhCentre decides to allow export of indigenous ventilators as COVID-19 fatality rate falls to 2.15 pc“The recovery rate stands at 64.53 per cent,” the Ministry said, adding: “Emphasis on early detection through aggressive testing and effective clinical management of the hospitalised cases have resulted in the continuously falling case fatality rate (CFR), indicating that India has been able to successfully contain the fatality rate of COVID-19.”While the CFR has been kept low, successful implementation of effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardised clinical management protocols based on a comprehensive standard of care approach had resulted in a consistent addition of more than 30,000 recoveries daily, the Health Ministry said.It also said three-tier hospital infrastructure with seamless patient management had ensured prompt triaging and treatment.As on Saturday, there are 1,488 dedicated COVID hospitals with 2,49,358 isolation beds, 31,639 ICU beds, 1,09,119 with oxygen support and 16,678 ventilators.“Also, 3,231 dedicated COVID Health Centres with 2,07,239 isolation beds, 18,613 ICU beds and 74,130 oxygen-supported beds and 6,668 ventilators have been made operational.

01-08-2020||Jaisalmer/Jaipur||If high command forgives rebels, I will welcome them back: Gehlot||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to get the alleged attempt to topple his government stopped and said he was open to welcoming back the Congress rebels led by Sachin Pilot.Asked if the dissidents will be forgiven, he said: “It depends on the party high command. If the party high command forgives, I shall embrace them.”Since the power tussle between him and Sachin Pilot resurfaced last month, the Congress veteran has used harsh words against his former deputy, once even referring to him as ‘nikamma’ or useless. But Gehlot said he would do whatever the Congress leadership wanted.He said the party trusted him and he had been a Union Minister, AICC general secretary, state unit president and Chief Minister for a third time.“What else do I want? I am doing this to serve the public,” he told reporters in Jaisalmer.The Chief Minister was on his way back to Jaipur after an overnight stay at Jaisalmer’s Suryagarh resort, where loyalist MLAs have been shifted ahead of the assembly session from August 14.The Congress has accused the BJP of playing a major role in the rebellion by the now sacked deputy chief minister and 18 other Congress MLAs who are threatening his government.“We have no personal quarrel with anyone. In a democracy, fights happen over ideology, policies and programmes and not for toppling a government. Modi should get the drama which is going on in Rajasthan ended,” the Chief Minister said outside the hotel where the MLAs were shifted Friday.Gehlot said Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat should resign on moral grounds, claiming that his involvement in a “conspiracy” to topple the Rajasthan government was now known.He said Shekhawat’s name also cropped up in a cooperative society scam in which money from poor people was looted.The Chief Minister also alleged that some other Union ministers, including Dharmendra Pradhan, are involved in the “conspiracy” against his government.Gehlot and other Rajasthan ministers are likely to spend most of their time in the state capital as the Congress tries to keep its numbers intact in Jaisalmer.Including the 19 rebels, the Congress has 107 MLAs in the 200-member assembly. The BJP has 72 MLAs.The Chief Minister claimed that democracy was under threat in the country and the Union Home Ministry was after his government in the state.He repeated the charge that the ‘rate’ for trying to lure MLAs away has gone up after the announcement of the assembly session.Back in Jaipur, he said Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati is giving statements “under pressure” and asserted that all six BSP MLAs lawfully merged with the Congress in Rajasthan last year.The BSP recently challenged the merger in the high court, prompting the Congress to charge that the party made the move at the behest of the BJP.Reacting to BJP state president Satish Poonia’s statement over the shifting of Congress MLAs to Jaisalmer, Gehlot called him a “new leader” who wanted to take on former chief minister Vasundhara Raje.He commented that Raje has ‘disappeared’ from the scene.Poonia had mocked the Congress, asking if the Gehlot loyalists will move further westward across the border into Pakistan.MLAs from the Congress and its allies had remained confined to Fairmont hotel in Jaipur since July 13 before being flown Friday to Jaisalmer on chartered flights.They are likely to visit Tanot Mata temple near the Pakistan border and some other places during their Jaisalmer stay, expected to continue till the assembly session begins.Gehlot recalled that he had informed Narendra Modi about the political situation in the state through a letter and a telephone conversation.He said he would write another letter to Modi asking him to call a video conference of all Chief Ministers again to review the COVID-19 situation.He said adequate testing for coronavirus was not taking place in some states while Rajasthan had increased its testing capacity to 40,000 per day.“We have done excellent COVID management in the state. The recovery rate is good, the death rate is less than 1 per cent,” he said.Meeting reporters in Jaipur, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said the states were suffering as revenues had come down after the coronavirus lockdown. Gehlot added that he had asked the Centre to declare Rajasthan’s eastern canal project, which was prepared by the earlier government led by Vasundhara Raje, as a national project.The project is aimed at providing water for drinking and irrigation to 13 districts.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-high-command-forgives-rebels-i-will-welcome-them-back-gehlot-120776
01-08-2020||Hyderabad||11 dead after massive crane collapses at Visakhapatnam shipyard||Eleven people were killed when a massive crane on a rail track collapsed during a trial run at the Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL) in Sindia area of Visakhapatnam on Saturday afternoon.Four employees of HSL were among those who died on the sport.  Other casualties included labourers, according to DCP Suresh Babu. The incident took place between 11.30 am and 12 noon when the workers were trying to ascertain the capacity of the crane and make it operational.  The crane was being deployed as part of the upgrading process of the shipyard involving the electrical wing employees and the local Green Field Company that was assisting in the project. Many of the contract labourers killed were employed by this company. RK Meena, Visakhapatnam’s police commissioner has rushed to the spot and is supervising rescue operations.  Local sources said that many injured have been rushed to hospitals, but so far only six bodies have been recovered. According to local police, about 20 workers were said to be working on the location when the crane crashed. Some workers managed to run for safety, some others received injuries and at least 11 workers were crushed under the weight of the crane. Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL) is a central government undertaking. It bought the crane some years ago but never used it. Its commissioning was recently outsourced to a private agency that was trying to make the machinery operational after some repairs and overhauling. District Collector V Vinay Chand said: “The 70-tonne capacity jetty crane was procured and commissioned two years ago and its full-fledged trials were initiated this morning. During the trials, officials were testing the dead-weight capacity of the crane when its cabin portion on the top and its base portion separated and the crane collapsed”. This is the third major mishap in the port city since May this year, when a gas leak in LG Polymers had led to 12 deaths. #Visakhapatnam.10 persons were crushed to death when a giant crane collapsed at Hindustan Shipyard limited at pic.twitter.com/Os4llKqejp  Four persons are said to be regular employees, while the remaining six are contract staff.District authorities rushed to the spot and took stock of the situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/11-dead-after-massive-crane-collapses-at-visakhapatnam-shipyard-120772

Puram police station limits but could not find out who the man and woman were yet," told a police official to IANS.Likewise, the official is also clueless as to when the incident occurred.Already viral for a few days on social media, the video shows how a man who appeared to be an autorickshaw driver was standing beside a three-wheeler was flung a few metres by a thin wire.With a little portion of the wire perched on the ground between his legs and a major portion also hanging before and after him, the wire was forcibly pulled by something leading to the man being propelled up into the air and falling right on a woman walking behind.He was pulled up into the air from between his legs and there was no escape for him.It is not clear in the video if a vehicle or anything else pulled the wire but the pull had sufficient power to fling the man of some 60 - 70 kg weight far enough.The unsuspecting woman wearing a pink dress had no idea what happened but took a heavy hit from the flying man and fell flat on the tiled floor. The entire incident unfolded at a place that appeared to be the front portion of a series of shops leading to their entrance.Following the incident which occurred beside a service road, a tractor and other vehicles paused to figure out what exactly happened as the video ends."We did not receive any police complaint, and I am also not sure when it actually happened," he said.The official said they will try to go to the source of the video or the owner of the CCTV from where the footage emerged.

Similar cases are taking place in private hospitals also," he alleged."These deaths remain unaccounted for because the patients are either brought dead to the hospitals or they die immediately after being brought there."As per the guidelines, no test is conducted on a deceased. But when the doctors take the X-ray of these people, they show symptoms of COVID-19," Mohol claimed.He said that while raising the issue with the CM, he sought steps to stop such deaths."Early tracing of patients should be done so that they can be given timely treatment and such deaths can be stopped," he added.Following the allegations, Collector Naval Kishore Ram said an inquiry will be conducted into it and a report has been sought from Sassoon hospital."The staff of the district administration keeps visiting Sassoon hospital and goes through the records. It is unlikely that there is any misreporting or under-reporting in Pune," he said."There might be some issues related to data entry. But the figure mentioned by the honourable mayor looks impossible.But we will conduct a fair inquiry as I have sought a report from Sassoon," the collector added.

This uncertainty in the manner in which the law applies renders it manifestly arbitrary and violates the right to equal treatment," they submitted.Terming it as unconstitutional, the trio argued, "It is incompatible with preamble values and basic features of the Constitution, it violates Article 19(1)(a), is unconstitutionally and incurably vague, and is manifestly arbitrary.” The petition has been filed days before the Supreme Court is scheduled to take up two contempt petitions against Bhushan for allegedly bringing the institution of judiciary under disrepute.The Supreme Court had on July 22 issued notices to Bhushan and Twitter Inc for his tweets allegedly scandalising the judiciary. Two days later, a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra also decided to resume hearing in another contempt of court case against him pending since 2009. The two cases are listed for hearing on August 4 and 5.Earlier, a group of 131 former judges, ex-bureaucrats and activists came out in his support, terming it as an attempt at stifling criticism. The group -- which included former Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur, former Delhi High Court Chief Justice AP Shah and several retired bureaucrats and academics -- appealed to the top court to drop the criminal contempt proceedings against Bhushan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/n-ram-arun-shourie-prashant-bhushan-challenge-validity-of%C2%A0criminal-contempt-120754

01-08-2020||Washington||Bipartisan support in US grows for India against Chinese aggression||India has received a strong bipartisan support from members of the US Congress against the recent Chinese military aggression in Ladakh.Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated after the June 15 Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers died.In the last few weeks, dozens of lawmakers, across the aisle, both on the floor of the House of Representatives and the Senate and outside the Capitol, have praised India of standing strong against the Chinese efforts to grab Indian territories."I call on China to end its military aggression. This conflict should only be settled through peaceful means," Congressman Frank Pallone, one of the senior-most Democratic lawmakers, said on the floor of the US House of Representatives, joining other lawmakers in condemning the recent Chinese aggression along the LAC in India's Ladakh region.A strong supporter of the India-US relationship, Pallone, founder and Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans, has been a member of the US Congress since 1988.At a time when there is a bitter political divide in Washington DC, influential lawmakers from both the GOP and Democratic Party have been supporting Indian stand against China."In the months leading to this clash, the People's Republic of China (PRC) military reportedly amassed 5,000 soldiers along this boundary and that clearly meant to redraw longstanding resettled borders by force and aggression," Pallone claimed.Support to India against China has come in the form of tweets, public speeches, House and Senate floor, letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, and Congressional resolutions. Several lawmakers have also made a call to Sandhu to express their outrage against China.A day earlier, Sandhu received a call from Republican Senator Cory Gardner from Colorado to express his condolences on the loss of lives of Indian soldiers at the LAC."The US-India relationship is broad, deep, and growing – and we discussed how vital the cooperation between our nations is to countering common challenges and aggression in the region and upholding a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific," said Gardner, who is also the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia.Sandhu, who has been meeting top American lawmakers, virtually on a daily basis, has received multiple Congressmen and Senators expressing their strong support to India against China."India has made it clear, it will not be bullied by Beijing," Senator Marco Rubio said after his call with Sandhu.Senator Rick Scott, weeks ago, wrote to Prime Minister Modi to commend his fight against the Chinese aggression."As you continue to stand strong against Communist China and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi, I want to offer help in any way I can to the Republic of India, the world's largest democracy and our ally. The US will always defend our allies and those fighting for freedom. Please do not hesitate to reach out if there is anything you need in this fight," Scott said.Congressmen George Holding and Brad Sherman, co-chairmen of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans, along with several other lawmakers, including Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna, wrote a letter to Sandhu to express extreme disappointment over the events that took place in the Galwan Valley.They said over the last few months, the Chinese authorities have been acting with impunity and have attempted to transgress on the LAC."We are disappointed that China has been acting in contradiction to their agreements with India, in their attempt to change the status quo and challenge Indian troops at the border," the Congressmen wrote.Led by Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and co-sponsored by several others, including Ro Khanna, Frank Pallone, Tom Suozzi, Ted Yoho, George Holding, Sheila Jackson-Lee, Haley Stevens and Steve Chabot, the House of Representatives has passed an amendment to the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA), which says China should work towards de-escalating the situation along the LAC with India through existing diplomatic mechanisms and not through force.Another NDAA amendment, moved by Congressman Chabot along with Indian-American lawmaker Ami Bera, said India and China should work towards de-escalating the situation along the LAC. The amendment expresses its concern over the growing territorial assertiveness of China.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor alleged that for the sake of grabbing territory, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) appears to have instigated the most violent clash between China and India since those nations went to war in 1962."I am extremely concerned by the ongoing Chinese aggression along the LAC," said Congressman Eliot Engel, Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs."China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbours rather than resolve conflicts according to international law," he said."China has resumed its submarine intrusions in the Japanese contiguous zones and picked deadly fights with India at high altitude," alleged Senator Tom Cotton.

If action is not taken soon, over the next few years we may lose 10 crore or more students from the learning system to illiteracy,” the policy states, fixing an ambitious goal for the Central and state governments to ensure that by 2025, all students up to grade 3 would have attained foundational literacy and numeracy skills, which would be tested by a special agency to be created for the purpose. India’s elementary schoolgoing population is 20 crore.The policy shows ways to achieve the foundational literacy and numeracy goal, including the promise that the government would encourage community participation for the purpose.“If every literate member of the community can commit to teaching one student how to read, it would change the country’s landscape very quickly,” says the document.“Immediate measures are needed on multiple fronts to achieve the goal of every student attaining foundational literacy and numeracy by grade 3. The highest priority of the education system will be to achieve universal foundational literacy and numeracy in primary school and beyond by 2025. The rest of this policy will be largely irrelevant for a large number of our students if this most basic learning requirement is not achieved first,” said the policy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/5-cr-elementary-students-cant-read-write-basic-text-120588

He also wanted China to generally refrain from actions that unilaterally altered the status quo.The South China Sea, however, may not have been the only issue that had troubled the Chinese envoy. On Thursday, when Weidong was explaining his country’s position on the Galwan valley clashes at a conference, O’Farrell met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and released a statement in which he also dwelt on the LAC tension.The Chinese envoy avoided commenting on O’Farrell’s part of the statement that said Australia opposed any attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), as that would increase tension and the risk of instability.Weidong trained his fire on the South China Sea part of the statement by the Australian High Commissioner since Canberra has recently spoken on the issue twice.On July 23, Australia lodged a note with the UN Secretary General, refuting China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea.More recently, the joint statement released after the Australia-US two plus two (defence and foreign ministers of both countries) used identical words for the 2016 decision of the Arbitral Tribunal — “it is final and binding on both parties”.The joint statement had also said the Indo-Pacific was the focus of the US-Australia Alliance and that the US and Australia were working side by side, including with ASEAN, India, Japan, Korea and Five Eyes partners to strengthen alliances and partnerships.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oz-china-ambassadors-spar-over-south-china-sea-120587
