Hence... the complaint deserves to be dismissed being not tenable in the eyes of law. Accordingly, same stands dismissed,” it said.Karat had told the court in her complaint that “Thakur and Verma had sought to incite people as a result of which three incidents of firing took place at two different protest sites in Delhi”.       The complaint had sought lodging of FIRs under various sections, including 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.), 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) and 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC.It had also sought action under other sections of the IPC, including 298 (uttering, words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation).The maximum punishment for the offences is jail term for seven years.Karat approached the court after her written complaints to the Commissioner of Police and the SHO, Parliament Street, failed to elicit any response.She had told the court that she had written to the commissioner on January 29 and subsequently on 31, while the letter to the SHO Parliament Street was sent on February 2.The CPI(M) leader had mentioned that at the Rithala rally here, Thakur, the minister of state for finance and corporate affairs, had on January 27 egged on the crowd to raise an incendiary slogan – “shoot the traitors” – after lashing out at anti-CAA protesters.In the application, she had mentioned that Verma had on January 28 allegedly made incendiary comments against the anti-CAA protesters in Shaheen Bagh.

26-08-2020||New Delhi||Amid calls for JEE, NEET postponement, over 14 lakh aspirants download admit cards||Over 14 lakh students have already downloaded admit cards for engineering and medical entrance exams, JEE-Mains and NEET, scheduled in September, according to National Testing Agency (NTA) officials.The NTA released admit cards for NEET on Wednesday amid growing clamour for postponement of the two exams in view of rising COVID-19 cases.“The admit cards for NEET were released at 12 pm today and within three hours over four lakh students had already downloaded it. The number rose to 6.84 lakh by evening. We have ensured that 99 per cent candidates get their first choice of centre cities,” a senior NTA official said.A total of 15.97 lakh candidates have registered for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) which is scheduled for September 13.“A total of 7.41 lakh candidates out of 8.58 lakh have downloaded their admit cards for JEE-Mains till Tuesday evening. Only 332 candidates have requested for change of their centre which is being considered positively,” the official added.The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Mains, for admission to engineering colleges is scheduled from September 1-6.As calls for postponement of the crucial exams grew louder, the Ministry of Education (MoE) officials reiterated that the exams will be conducted as per schedule in September.Increasing the number of examination centres, alternate seating plan, fewer candidates per room and staggered entry and exit are among the steps the NTA will take for safely conducting NEET and JEE-Mains next month.“The number of examination centres have also been increased from 570 to 660 (for JEE Mains) and 2,546 to 3,843 (for NEET). While JEE-Mains is a computer-based test, NEET is a pen-paper test,” the NTA said in a statement on Tuesday.“Additionally, in case of JEE-Mains, the number of shifts have been increased from 8 earlier to 12, and the number of candidates per shift has been reduced from earlier 1.32 lakh to 85,000 now,” it said.“In order to ensure proper social distancing inside examination halls, the candidates will be seated in alternate seats in case of JEE-Mains. In case of NEET, the number of candidates per room has been reduced from 24 to 12,” it added.For ensuring social distancing outside the examination hall, the entry and exit of candidates has been staggered.“Adequate arrangements have also been made outside examination centres to enable candidates to stand with adequate social distancing, while waiting. Candidates have also been issued an advisory guiding them about the ‘Dos and Don’ts’ for proper social distancing,” the NTA said.There have been demands from several quarters to further postpone the entrance exams in view of increasing coronavirus cases.On Tuesday, Swedish teen climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg also threw her weight behind postponing the exams in view of the pandemic.“It’s deeply unfair that students of India are asked to sit for national exams during the COVID-19 pandemic and while millions have also been impacted by the extreme floods. I stand with their call to #PostponeJEE_NEETinCOVID,” she said in a tweet.Several opposition leaders in India, including Congress’ Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, her Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik, DMK president MK Stalin and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia have demanded that the exams be postponed.The Supreme Court had last week dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the two exams amid a spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases, saying precious year of students “cannot be wasted” and life has to go on.“We find that there is absolutely no justification in the prayer made for postponement of the examination in question relating to NEET as well as JEE-Mains,” the Supreme Court had said.In a meeting convened by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on a range of issues ahead of Monsoon Session of Parliament, chief ministers of seven states unanimously agreed to the need for filing a review petition urging the Supreme Court to reconsider its recent order rejecting postponement of the competitive exams.The NTA has also written to state governments to extend support in local movement of the candidates so that they are able to reach their examination centres on time.JEE-Mains was originally supposed to be held from April 7-11, then postponed to July 18-23, and finally rescheduled to September 1-6. NEET-UG was originally scheduled for May 3, then pushed to July 26, and is now scheduled to be held on September 13. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-calls-for-jee-neet-postponement-over-14-lakh-aspirants-download-admit-cards-131800
26-08-2020||New Delhi||North India to witness intense rainfall over next 4 days: Met||The weather department on Wednesday forecast intense rainfall activity over several parts of north India for the next four days and issued an orange alert for Uttarakhand for August 27 and 28 and a yellow alert for the subsequent two days.The India Meteorological Department has four colour-coded alerts—green, yellow, orange and red --- based on weather pattern.Orange alert has also been issued for east Uttar Pradesh for August 28 and east Rajasthan (August 29-30).The IMD has also issued a yellow alert for Jammu Kashmir (August 27), Himachal Pradesh (August 27-28), east Uttar Pradesh (August 27, 29-30), east Rajasthan (August 27-28), Punjab (August 27-28), Haryana, Delhi (August 27-29), west Rajasthan (August 29-30).Rains have been wreaking havoc across north India with many rivers flowing close to the danger mark.In the national capital, the Yamuna was flowing near the warning mark on Wednesday and is likely to swell further with more water being released into it from the Hathnikund barrage in Haryana, officials said.In Uttar Pradesh, the number of districts hit by floods went up to 19 with Shahjahanpur being added to the list.“There are 19 flood-affected districts, where 922 villages are affected, of which 571 are marooned,” state Relief Commissioner Sanjay Goel said.Till Tuesday, 1,090 villages across 18 districts were affected. Of these, 620 villages had got marooned.The districts affected are Ambedkarnagar, Ayodhya, Azamgarh, Bahraich, Ballia, Barabanki, Basti, Deoria, Farrukhabad, Gonda, Gorakhpur, Kasganj, Pilibhit, Kushinagar, Lakhimpur Kheri, Mau, Santkabirnagar, Shahjananpur and Sitapur.A 35-year-old man was killed and a bridge washed away as heavy rains lashed wide parts of Jammu region for the second consecutive day on Wednesday, officials said. Police also rescued 15 nomadic people, belonging to different families, after they were caught in flashfloods in the Ujh river near Rajbagh area of Kathua district, the officials said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/north-india-to-witness-intense-rainfall-over-next-4-days-met-131798
26-08-2020||Mumbai||Govt debt to set hit historic high of 91 pc of GDP in FY21: Report||General government debt—which is the combined liabilities of the Centre and states—is likely to hit a record 91 per cent of GDP this fiscal, a brokerage report said on Wednesday.This will be the highest in record since data began to be maintained in 1980. General government debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 75 per cent in FY20, as per the report by economists of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.The debt ratio is likely to be at a high of 80 per cent by FY30 and is unlikely to fall to the targeted 60 per cent even by FY40 without further hurting growth, it added.The government’s capital outlays have been playing a bigger role in the overall economic growth for the past many years. At the same time, since FY16, government debt has also been rising continuously. Government debt stood at 66.4 per cent of GDP in FY 2000 and 66.6 per cent in FY15. Since then, it has been heading north at a faster pace, reaching 75 per cent in FY20. The report says unless private spending picks up strongly, real GDP growth over the next decade will be slower, averaging at 5-6 per cent as against 7 per cent in the 2010s.“The combined general government debt rose to 75 per cent of GDP in FY20 from 70 per cent in FY18. It is likely to reach 91 per cent of GDP in FY21, which is the highest since 1980 when data was made available and will stay at above 90 per cent of GDP up to FY23, before moderating slowly to 80 per cent by FY30,” the report said. A surge in public debt will restrict the government’s ability to spend significantly in the current decade, as it has done in the past few years, it said. While real GDP growth averaged at 6.8 per cent between FY14 and FY20, real fiscal spending grew at an average of 9 per cent during the period. “Since a large part of non-interest revenue spending like defence, salaries and pensions is fixed, there is a high possibility fiscal investment will grow at an even slower rate in the current decade,” it added.

26-08-2020||---||UAE central to India’s extended neighbourhood: Jaishankar||Dubai, August 26External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said India and the UAE share a fast-growing relationship and that the Gulf country is central to India’s extended neighbourhood.The minister also welcomed the normalisation of diplomatic relations between the UAE and Israel and said it has opened up “lots of opportunities” for the country as it has very good ties with the two countries.“India and the UAE share a fast-growing relationship. The UAE is central to India’s extended neighbourhood. We see the UAE on the crossroads of international trade. As Singapore is in the East, the UAE is in the West,” Jaishankar told the Gulf News.Jaishankar, who has taken a special interest in the India-UAE bilateral relationship, said: “It is a relationship where the highest leadership of both countries have invested goodwill and energy. As a result, you can see the transformation during the last five years.”In 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the first Indian premier to visit UAE in 34 years. This was a turning point, as the last five years have proven so emphatically, the report said.On August 17, Jaishankar held extensive talks with his counterpart from the UAE Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, covering a range of areas including ways to further boost strategic ties and the situation in the neighbourhood of both countries.The Ministry of External Affairs said the Indian side invited further investments from the UAE in key sectors of the Indian economy such as infrastructure including logistics, food parks, highways, ports, airports, renewable energy and defence.In a statement, it said wide-ranging discussions were held in a friendly, frank and constructive atmosphere, reflecting the strong bilateral ties between the two partners.Commenting on the recent treaty between the UAE and Israel, Jaishankar said: “When two strategic friends come closer it opens up lots of opportunities.”India on August 14 welcomed the “full normalisation” of ties between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel under a historic peace deal, and said it has consistently supported peace, stability and development in West Asia.A day after his country finalised the peace deal with Israel, Foreign Minister of the UAE Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan made a phone call to his Indian counterpart Jaishankar and discussed the peace initiative. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uae-central-to-indias-extended-neighbourhood-jaishankar-131794
26-08-2020||United Nations||India formally writes to UN on Pak’s false claim of making statement in Security Council||India has formally written to the United Nations about Pakistan’s false claim of making a statement in a Security Council meeting on terrorism, which was not open to non-Council members.India on Monday exposed Pakistan’s litany of lies it peddled in the UN after Islamabad’s UN envoy claimed to have given a statement in the Security Council meeting that was not open to non-members of the 15-nation UN body.India has now formally written to the UN and put on record about Pakistan’s claim that it had made a statement in the Council, which is false.India on Monday had put out a strong point-by-point rebuttal of the remarks that Pakistan said it made to the Security Council meeting.The Pakistan Mission falsely claimed that its UN envoy Munir Akram had given a statement at the Security Council debate on Report of the Secretary General on Threats to International Peace and Security posed by Terrorism Actions.However, the Security Council meeting on threats to international peace and security was not open to non-members of the Council.A photograph of the meeting tweeted by the German Mission to the UN showed only envoys of the 15 Security Council members participating in the meeting. Pakistan is not a member of the Council.“We have seen a statement put out by the Pakistan Mission to the UN, claiming that these remarks were made by the Permanent Representative of Pakistan at the UN Security Council.“We fail to comprehend where exactly did the Permanent Representative of Pakistan make his statement since the Security Council session today was not open to non-members. Be that as it may, the five big lies of Pakistan lies exposed,” India’s Permanent Mission to the UN had said.Calling out Pakistan’s lie that it has been a target of cross-border terrorism for decades, India had said “a lie repeated a hundred times will not become truth. The biggest sponsor of cross-border terrorism against India now tries to masquerade itself as a victim of terrorism by India,” India’s Mission to the UN had said on Monday.On Akram’s claim that Pakistan has decimated al-Qaeda from the region, India said perhaps the Permanent Representative of Pakistan is “not aware that Osama bin Laden was hiding in their own country in plain sight, and it is the US forces which got him inside Pakistan. Nor have they heard their Prime Minister refer to Osama bin Laden as a martyr.”Giving a strong rebuttal to Pakistan’s lies, New Delhi termed Pakistan’s claim that India has hired terrorists as mercenaries to hit them as “laughable”.“Coming from a country which is a known sponsor of cross-border terrorism which has made the world suffer due to its actions, this claim is nothing short of being preposterous!”, India said, adding that Pakistan is home to the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN and many of the sanctioned terrorists and entities continue to operate with impunity inside Pakistan.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan himself had admitted at the General Assembly last year about the presence of 40,000-50,000 terrorists inside Pakistan.Laying bare another lie by Pakistan about Indian nationals in the 1267 al-Qaeda Sanctions List of the UN Security Council, India said the Sanctions List is “public and the world can see none of these individuals are in it.The 1267 Committee works on the basis of evidence and not random accusations thrown in to divert their time and attention,” India said in response to a lie made by Pakistan that it has submitted names of some Indians to be proscribed under the Sanctions List.In a strong response to Islamabad raking up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in the remarks it falsely said Akram gave to the Council, India said Pakistan makes “ridiculous assertions” about internal affairs of India.“This is a country whose minority population has dropped drastically from 1947 to what it is today, which is just about 3 per cent, which is nothing short of systemic cleansing. This is in addition to false allegations about India’s sovereign actions in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which are for the welfare of the people,” India said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-formally-writes-to-un-on-paks-false-claim-of-making-statement-in-security-council-131790
26-08-2020||New Delhi||Defence Ministry working on second list of weapons that will be banned from import||The Defence Ministry has started work on bringing out by December a second list of military platforms and weapons which will be banned from import under a staggered timeline to encourage their domestic production, officials said on Wednesday.The ministry has already started preliminary discussions with major stakeholders like the defence public sector undertakings, private industries, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the three services on the second negative arms import list, they said.On August 9, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had announced that India will stop the import of 101 weapons and military platforms like transport aircraft, light combat helicopters, conventional submarines, cruise missiles and sonar systems by 2024.Subsequently, the Defence Ministry released the first list of items, with a detailed timeline.“We are working on bringing out the second negative arms import list by end of December,” said a senior official.The defence minister has already outlined the broad contours of the government’s roadmap for making India a hub for defence manufacturing.India is one of the largest importers of arms globally. According to estimates, the Indian armed forces are projected to spend around USD 130 billion in capital procurement in the next five years.The Defence Ministry has set a goal of a turnover of USD 25 billion (Rs 1.75 lakh crore) in defence manufacturing in the next five years that included an export target of USD 5 billion (Rs 35,000 crore) worth of military hardware.As part of efforts to promote the domestic defence industry, the ministry has bifurcated the capital procurement budget for 2020-21 between domestic and foreign capital procurement routes.A separate budget head has been created with an outlay of nearly Rs 52,000 crore for domestic capital procurement in the current financial year.In sync with the government’s initiative, the DRDO on Monday identified 108 military systems and subsystems like navigation radars, tank transporters and missile canisters for the domestic industry to design, develop and manufacture.The DRDO said it will also provide support to industries for design, development and testing of these systems on a requirement basis.The premier institute has set a target of next year in developing the 108 systems and subsystems.The first list of 101 items banned from import included towed artillery guns, short-range surface to air missiles, cruise missiles, offshore patrol vessels, electronic warfare systems, next-generation missile vessels, floating dock, anti-submarine rocket launchers and short-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft.

My best wishes to him for all future endeavours,” the Vice President Secretariat tweeted quoting Naidu.The tweet was posted with the hashtag ‘Human Calculator’.Compliments to Neelakantha Bhanu Prakash for winning the "world’s fastest human calculator" title & clinching the first-ever gold for India in the Mental Calculation World Championship at Mind Sports Olympiad held in London recently. #HumanCalculator pic.twitter.com/pGPgpZlHS6  Prakash, a math prodigy, who holds the fastest human calculator in the world record, had done the nation proud, winning the gold medal at the Mind Sports Olympiad (MSO) in London.As the country celebrated its 74th Independence Day, Prakash, pursuing Mathematics (Hons) at St Stephens College in New Delhi, beat 29 competitors, up to 57 years of age, from 13 countries, to emerge the winner in the Mental Calculation World Championship at London on August 15.The MSO is the most prestigious international competition for games of mental skill and mind sports held annually and equivalent to any other Olympic event in the realm of physical sports and he was the first Indian to bag the gold medal in the event, Prakash told PTI.According to the MSO website, it is an international event with over 60 different board game competitions ranging from classics like Chess, Scrabble and unique events, including over a dozen world championships such as Memory, Mental Calculations and Creative Thinking.Known as Bhanu, the maths prodigy said he holds four records for being the “fastest human calculator in the world”, having eclipsed records which were once held by highly acclaimed mathematicians.According to him, the judges, who were fascinated by his speed, asked him to perform more calculations to confirm his accuracy, which he proved with élan.On his future plans, the youth, whose parents own a small scale food manufacturing enterprise, said he wanted to eradicate maths phobia prevalent among students, mainly in the rural and underprivileged communities.Bhanu rued there were no significant programmes to increase mathematical abilities and numeracy in the country and said he would like to create math labs, reach out to millions of children, under what he called VISION Math, to make them love math and arithmetic calculations.Exploring Infinities, a start-up run by him, is a math education partner of T-SAT the education channel of the Telangana government.The startup aims at developing cognitive abilities in children through arithmetic learning using an edutech app, which Bhanu says, will banish maths phobia of classes I-XII students by making brain workouts a popular culture.“We’re looking for investments from VCs (venture capitalists) to make it big, in the Indian context,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vp-lauds-hyderabad-man-who-won-worlds-fastest-human-calculator-title-131782
26-08-2020||New Delhi||Solicitor General declines nod to contempt case against Swara Bhasker||Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Wednesday refused consent to a plea seeking initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against Bollywood actor Swara Bhasker for her alleged “derogatory and scandalous” statements against the Supreme Court on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid verdict.The SG’s denial came within days of Attorney General K K Venugopal declining the go-ahead saying that Bhasker’s comment appeared to be her “perception” about the issue.“The Attorney General for India, on August 21, has declined to provide his consent for the reasons stated in the reply of the AG...“Considering the fact that the Attorney General for India has already declined to grant his consent in the present matter for the reasons detailed in the said letter...the present request made to me is misconceived,” Mehta said in his letter addressed to lawyer Anuj Saxena.Saxena, on behalf of petitioner Usha Shetty, had sought consent of the law officer for initiating the contempt against Bhasker after Venugopal’s decision against it.The consent of either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General is necessary, under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, for initiating contempt proceedings against a person.Venugopal, in a two-page letter to Saxena on August 21, had said the actor’s “statement in the first part appears to be a factual one, and is a perception of the speaker”.Venugopal had said, “The comment refers to the judgement of the Supreme Court, and is not an attack on the institution. This does not offer any comment on the Supreme Court itself or say anything that would scandalise or tend to scandalise, or lower or tend to lower the authority of the Supreme Court.”He had said the second part of the statement is a vague statement not related to any particular court, and “something is so general that no one would take any serious note of this statement”.Venugopal said, “I do not think that this is a case where the offence of scandalising the court or lowering the authority of the court would arise. I therefore decline consent to initiate contempt proceedings.”On August 18, the plea filed before the Attorney General by advocate Mahek Maheshwari, who along with lawyers Anuj Saxena and Prakash Sharma, has alleged that Bhasker made these statements at a panel discussion on February 1, 2020 organised by the Mumbai Collective.It claimed that Bhasker had made “derogatory and scandalous” statements against the courts in the country and mentioned the Ayodhya case judgement.The petition intends to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Bhasker for “passing a derogatory and scandalous statement in context of the Supreme Court of India on February 1, 2020 at a panel discussion organised by Mumbai Collective,” it said.A five-judge constitution bench of the apex court had on November 9 last year delivered a unanimous verdict paving the way for construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and had directed the Centre to allot a five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a mosque. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/solicitor-general-declines-nod-to-contempt-case-against-swara-bhasker-131779

The police said the woman—who worked as a farm labourer— is a mother of three.

26-08-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Stage set for Centre-states clash on GST shortfall||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 26Battlelines have been drawn for Thursday’s special GST council meeting after seven opposition chief ministers decided to press the Centre to borrow from the markets to pay four months of revenue collection dues.Representatives of Kerala and Delhi are likely to join forces with them at the meeting.The seven opposition CMs, including Capt Amarinder Singh, attended a webinar with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and discussed plans to approach the Supreme Court as well as call on the President or PM to implement the Centre’s obligation to pay states the promised GST compensation.Story HighlightsCentre should borrow on their behalfMore products under compensation cessExtend GST compensation cess for 5 more yearsOn-time payment of compensation at the promised 14%The resolve to take on the Centre was also expressed by other participating CMs, including Mamata Banerjee, Hemant Soren, Ashok Gehlot, Uddhav Thackeray, Bhupesh Baghel and V Narayanasamy. Other states whose CMs did not participate but are expected to join forces are Delhi and Kerala.As Capt Singh said, “All of us must collectively see the PM and tell him about the situation. We have given all powers of taxation to them (Centre). Now they say they won’t be able to pay. How do our states run,” he asked.On the other hand, sources have indicated that the Centre will ask the states to borrow from the market according to their requirements while it would be willing to backstop the loan with sovereign guarantees.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to point out that the entire revenue collection exercise is a collective responsibility and while the Centre would be willing to do its best, states should also partly share the burden. This cooperative approach is a far cry from the early days of the pandemic when the Centre had sought to impose stiff conditionalities if the states wanted to borrow more.The Centre is also likely to point out that the pandemic was an unexpected force majeure event whose impact was never anticipated when promising a 14 per cent increase in states’ compensation. This approach, if it convinces the GST Council, may give some relief to the financially beleaguered Central Government.The Centre is also likely to suggest some tweaking of GST to bring in additional revenue but the centre-stage will be taken by a discussion on who will shoulder the burden of borrowings to make up for the GST shortfall.The Centre has already scrounged to raise Rs 70,000 crore as cess collection was Rs 95,444 crore for 2019-20 and the transfer to states was Rs 1,65,302 crore. In this fiscal, the shortfall could be nearly Rs 2 lakh crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stage-set-for-centre-states-clash-on-gst-shortfall-131767

It has issued a gazette notification in this regard."The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has made the use of FASTag mandatory for availing return journey discount or any other exemptions on Toll Fee Plazas. Users who wish to claim a discount for making return journey within 24 hours or any other local exemptions, shall be required to have a valid functional FASTag on the vehicle," MoRTH said in a statement.It said this is another step towards promoting the use of digital payments on fee plazas of National Highways. The fee payable towards such discounts shall be paid through pre-paid instruments, smart card or through FASTag or on board unit (transponder) or any other such device only, it said.The government said the amendments to the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008 in this regard would enable discount on return journey within 24 hours and it would be through FASTag or such other device and would be automatic with no requirement for a pass.It will also ensure that discounts in all other cases having a valid FASTag, is made necessary."The amendment would also enable that in cases where there is a discount available for a return journey within 24 hours, there is no need for a prior receipt or intimation and the citizen would get the discount automatically if return journey is made within 24 hours with a valid and a functional FASTag on the vehicle," the statement said. A FASTag is a device that employs Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for making toll payments directly from the prepaid or savings account linked to it and is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle and enables the commuter to drive through toll plazas, without stopping for cash transactions.

26-08-2020||New Delhi||Money put in Pak bank accounts of Jaish commander before Pulwama blast: NIA||Mohammed Umar Farooq, the nephew of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar, had received Rs 10 lakh in his bank accounts in Pakistan to execute the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed in February last year, the NIA has said in its chargesheet.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe has shown that Rs 10 lakh in Pakistani currency was credited into three accounts of Farooq, the main accused in the suicide attack case who was later killed in an encounter with security forces, in Allied Bank and Mezaan Bank in that country days before the incident, officials said.They said the money was deposited by top leadership of the terror group JeM between January and February 2019.The terrorists had spent around Rs 6 lakh on procurement of explosives and the Maruti Eeco car used in the attack, the NIA said in its chargesheet filed on Tuesday before a special court in Jammu.A major chunk of the fund, about Rs 2.80 lakh, was used to procure around 200 kg of explosives, including ammonium nitrate, to trigger a massive car-laden IED attack on the CRPF convoy moving from Jammu to Srinagar on February 14, 2019, they said.The 200 kg of explosives comprised a lethal concoction of RDX brought from Pakistan, gelatin sticks procured by Mudasir Ahmad, 4 kg of Aluminium powder bought on Amazon by accused Wazi Ul Islam and Calcium Ammonium Nitrate. The IED was fitted into the Eeco car in two containers weighing 160 kg and 40 kg to trigger the blast, the NIA said.Charge sheet accused Shakir Bashir allegedly collected the explosives—RDX, Gelatin sticks, Aluminium power and Calcium-Ammonium Nitrate—and stocked them at his house for making the IED, the agency said.The terrorists had spent another Rs 2.5 lakh on purchasing and modifying the car to be used in the attack which was also parked in the front-yard of Shakir Bashir’s house, it said.Some money was spent on miscellaneous expenses too, which included purchase of containers for fabricating the Improvised Explosive Devices, officials said.The NIA probe has shown three bank accounts of Farooq, the main perpetrator, who received the money from January 2019 till February of the same year.The agency had filed a 13,800-page chargesheet against 19 accused persons in an NIA Special Court at Jammu in connection with last year’s terrorist attack on the CRPF convoy at Lethpura, Pulwama, they said.Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist Adil Ahmad Dar, who was driving the car laden with explosives, had rammed it into the convoy killing 40 CRPF personnel and grievously injuring eight others. “The investigation has revealed that Pulwama attack was a result of well-planned criminal conspiracy hatched by Pakistan-based leadership of terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammad. The JeM leaders have been sending their cadres to the terrorist training camps of Al-Qaida-Taliban-JeM and Haqqani-JeM in Afghanistan for receiving training in explosives and other terrorist tactics,” the NIA said in the chargesheet.The agency said the main accused Umar Farooq was trained in Afghanistan for explosives. He visited Afghanistan in 2016-17 and had infiltrated into India through the International Border at Jammu-Samba Sector in April, 2018, it said.Farooq took over as the Jaish-e-Mohammad Commander of Pulwama. “Accused Shakir Bashir, Insha Jan, Peer Tariq Ahmad Shah and Bilal Ahmad Kuchey provided all logistics and harboured the JeM terrorists in their houses,” the NIA has said.Bashir allegedly did reconnaissance of the movement and deployment of security forces on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway. A propaganda video clip of Mohammad Umar Farooq, Sameer Dar and Adil Dar was allegedly prepared at Insha Jan’s house which was released immediately after the suicide attack, it said.The terrorists had prepared the car for the attack by fitting it with the IED on February 6, 2019 but suspended their nefarious plans because of heavy snowfall which led to closing of the National Highway for vehicular movement, the agency said.They attacked the convoy on February 14, 2019, when the National Highway reopened, they said.Bashir drove Adil Ahmad Dar till the National Highway, after which Dar drove the car and carried out the blast, it alleged.Damage to the tune of Rs 32.90 lakh was caused to public property, the probe agency said.The NIA found that JeM leadership consisting of Masood Azhar, Rouf Asgar and Ammar Alvi alias Chacha alias Chota Masood handled the operation by continuously giving directions and guidance to the Pakistani JeM infiltrators before and after the attack. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/money-put-in-pak-bank-accounts-of-jaish-commander-before-pulwama-blast-nia-131759

26-08-2020||New Delhi||Sushant death case: Know all about the drugs mentioned in alleged Rhea Chakraborty chats||Hallucination, paranoia, depression and loss of mind control are some effects of the drugs mentioned in the alleged drug chat of actress Rhea Chakraborty, which adds a new twist to the death case of her late boyfriend, actor Sushant Singh Rajput.Importantly, these effects fit right into the narrative around his mental health, be it his reported hallucinatory episode in Europe or his alleged struggle with depression.In the WhatsApp chats made public, Rhea allegedly talks of using MDMA and also discusses marijuana."In case we speak about hard drugs, I haven't been doing too much. Tried MDMA once," she allegedly messaged a man named Gaurav Arya, asking him: "You have MD?" A message sent to her by one Jaya Saha on November 25 last year read: "Use 4 drops in coffee, tea or water and let him sip it. Give it 30-40 minutes for it to kick in." It is being presumed that the "him" refers to Sushant.According to doctors, MDMA is a psychotropic drug."MDMA is classified as a stimulant. Without making a reference to Sushant Singh Rajput as we can't ascertain right now, whether he was taking it or not, I can tell you that the drug works by increasing metabolism and neurochemicals. It is a psychoactive substance, one can feel more energetic, excited, and also have hallucinatory experiences," doctor and director (Asia Pacific) at World Federation for Mental Health (WFMH) Sunil Mittal told IANS."People report a crash when they come off the high, and sometimes a moment of dullness. The effect starts with euphoria, happiness, rapid talking, perception changes, and hallucinations. People feel more connected. Some of the psychological withdrawals include paranoia, depression and restlessness," added Mittal, who is also director at Cosmos Institute of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences (CIMBS).Madhulika Sharma, former doctor from Central Forensic Science Laboratory, New Delhi, also mentioned that the drugs directly affect the nervous system."One can remain confused, you don't have your own thinking, have shaky hands. When the effect wears out, your nervous system becomes dull. You don't have control over it," she said.Leading psychiatrist Samir Parikh added: "MDA is a stimulant that when used cause addiction, dependence, and impairment of thinking and judgement."Sushant was found dead in his Bandra flat on June 14. His girlfriend Rhea and her family has been accused by the late actor's father of abetting his son's suicide, among other charges.Madhulika feels one should go for re-examination to ascertain if there was any drug in Sushant's body."The viscera report states no drug was found in the body. It is better if one goes for re-examination from somewhere else other than Maharashtra. If that shows nothing, then there is no point in digging this up," she said.Meanwhile, Rhea's lawyer on Tuesday night said that the actress has never consumed drugs and is ready for any test to prove the fact.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sushant-death-case-know-all-about-the-drugs-mentioned-in-alleged-rhea-chakraborty-chats-131757
26-08-2020||New Delhi||Parliamentary panel recommends regulated FDI in tobacco sector||For providing benefits to farmers, a parliamentary panel has recommended permitting regulated foreign direct investment in the tobacco sector and establishing export-only tobacco farms to boost outward shipments.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce and Industry, chaired by YSR Congress leader Vijaysai Reddy, made these recommendations in its report submitted to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday. The report is likely to be tabled in the upcoming session of Parliament.According to the report, the committee is of the opinion that the FDI in tobacco sector albeit in a regulated manner would stimulate the production and processing of Indian tobacco, thereby boosting its export.“The committee, therefore, recommends the Department to undertake a study to analyse the prospects of opening FDI investments in the tobacco sector at the earliest,” it said.Currently, FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) is prohibited in manufacturing of cigars, cigarettes and tobacco substitutes.The panel has also suggested making available sufficient funds for research and development activities, imposition of levy on sale of cigarettes to utilise it as a Market Stabilisation Fund to ensure price security to tobacco growers in times of market crisis and extension of export incentive schemes to tobacco exporters.Further, the committee has recommended that the Department of Commerce in coordination with Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare undertake measures to prevent further shrinkage of land under tobacco cultivation as well as “explore the feasibility of establishing export-only tobacco farms specifically for export purpose”.Pushing for similar export incentives to tobacco and its products as provided to other agricultural and plantation commodities, the panel said the proposed scheme of RoDTEP should extend the export benefits to tobacco and tobacco products in order to provide a level playing field to Indian tobacco exporters.Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP) is a scheme for exporters to reimburse taxes and duties paid by them.India produces about 800 million kg of various types of tobacco every year. The states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are the main producing states.The country is the third largest producer and exporter of tobacco in the world and contributed Rs 6,001.02 crore in 2018-19 in terms of foreign exchange to the exchequer.Besides exporting tobacco, the country also exports a variety of tobacco products such as cigarettes, cut tobacco, bidis, hookah, different varieties of chewing tobacco, snuff and cigars.While voicing concern over low share of export of agricultural commodities as compared to their total production, the panel called for renewed focus on post harvest infrastructure, supply chain, value addition and exploring new overseas markets for promoting export of agricultural, marine and plantation commodities sector.The panel underscored the significant role of Agriculture Export Policy in doubling farmers’ income and integrating agriculture sector with global value chain. It also suggested restructuring of Spices Board and to explore the feasibility of fixing a minimum support price for turmeric crop.Welcoming the renewal of the Indian-Chinese Phytosanitary (related to plant) protocol on reviving the export of tobacco leaves to China, the committee said all efforts, including consultations with the Chinese government, should be made to restart the export at the earliest.Quality tobacco at par with international standards is available in India at competitive prices and there is good potential for export of Indian tobacco to China. The revival of the phytosanitary protocol with China will pave the way for revival of Indian tobacco exports to China and prove economically beneficial to Indian farmers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliamentary-panel-recommends-regulated-fdi-in-tobacco-sector-131756

We have kept a team of doctors ready for best possible medical care and assistance to our revered senior leader," he tweeted.Gogoi has been at the forefront of the Congress's initiative to form a 'Grand Alliance', comprising of parties opposed to the BJP, for the 2021 assembly polls in the state.He was holding meetings regularly with members of his own party and other oufits.He attended the working committee meeting of the Congress state unit at a hotel here and also hosted several meetings at his residence in the last few days.Gogoi, who represents the Titabor assembly constituency in Jorhat district, is the 13th Assam legislator to be diagnosed with COVID-19.His former cabinet colleague Ajanta Neog, the MLA from Golaghat, tested COVID-positive on Tuesday and was admitted to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital.Another former Congress minister and legislator from Samaguri constituency in Nagaon, Rakibul Hussain, and his wife had earlier tested COVID-positive.Of the 13 legislators who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, seven are from the BJP, three from the Congress, two from the AGP and one from the AIUDF.BJP's Rajya Sabha MP Kamakhya Prasad Tasa tested positive on Saturday and has been admitted to the Jorhat Medical College and Hospital.The BJP MLAs to be found COVID-positive are Mihir Kanti Shome from Udharbond, Deputy Speaker Aminul Haq Laskar from Sonai, Krishnendu Paul from Patharkandi, Narayan Deka of Borkhetry, Bolin Chetia from Sadiya, Nabanita Handique from Sonari and Atul Bora of Dispur.AGP's West Gauhati legislator Ramendra Narayan Kalita and Dergaon MLA Bhabendra Nath Bharali have also tested positive for COVID-19.AIUDF's Algapur MLA Nizamuddin Choudhury and eight members of his family were also diagnosed with COVID-19.Another prominent politician from the state to test positive for COVID-19 was All India Mahila Congress president and former Silchar Lok Sabha MP Sushmita Dev.

26-08-2020||New Delhi||Nitish Katara murder: HC dismisses Vikas Yadav’s parole plea on ground of mother’s illness||The Delhi High Court has dismissed the parole plea of Vikas Yadav, who is serving life term for killing business executive Nitish Katara in 2002, by refusing his submission that he has to attend his ailing mother as there is no one to look after her.The high court said Yadav’s mother is not immobile, as was suggested, and there are sufficient number of relatives to look after her.Justice Vibhu Bakhru also considered that Ajay Katara, a key prosecution witness, and Nilam Katara, mother of the victim, have serious objections to Yadav being released as they fear for their safety.“This court is not persuaded to accede to the prayers made in the present petition,” the judge said and dismissed the plea.The high court said the Delhi Government’s June 26 order rejecting Yadav’s parole plea cannot be faulted with.Yadav sought parole on the ground that he has to take care of his mother, who was stated to be suffering from spinal medical condition along with thyroid and inner stress causing her depression.He also claimed that he was suffering from mental trauma due to incarceration for more than eighteen years and he requires parole to connect with his family members and maintain family and social ties.The high court noted that the call detail record indicates that his mother has been travelling extensively and there were a number of visits from Delhi to various parts of Uttar Pradesh, including Ghaziabad.While the documents supplied by him indicated that his mother had visited the Lok Nayak Hospital on three occasions in 2019, her call records indicated that she was not anywhere near the hospital on those dates, it said.Considering the past conduct of Yadav, the high court said the apprehension of both the objectors—Ajay Katara and Nilam Katara—that he would misuse his liberty cannot be stated to be unfounded.“In any view, the contention that he has been in custody for a period of eighteen years without any liberty, is plainly unpersuasive. Even though the petitioner has been in custody he had found ways to avoid rigors of custody,” the judge said in its six-page order which was passed on Tuesday.Regarding Yadav’s counsel’s submission that he has been unable to meet his mother for many years as he has not been released from custody, the high court said this argument also has little appeal considering that nothing precludes his mother to visit him in jail.The high court said during the earlier hearings, it was stated that there was no one to look after Yadav’s mother as his sister was residing in Gurugram and his brother was staying in Punjab.However, later his counsel submitted that it was not Yadav’s case that his younger brother was residing in Punjab but merely that he was residing separately.“This contention is advanced as the status report now filed clearly establishes that the petitioner’s younger brother is predominantly residing in Delhi. He has minor children that go to school in Delhi.“The analysis of the call details record indicates that most of the time he is in Delhi. It has been ascertained that the petitioner’s younger brother lives in the same property (Vasant Kunj) as their mother,” the high court said.However, Yadav’s counsel claimed that although his brother’s house is in the same compound but it is separate from the farmhouse in which their mother resides.On October 3, 2016, the Supreme Court had awarded a 25-year jail term without any benefit of remission to Vikas Yadav and his cousin Vishal for their role in the sensational kidnapping and killing of Katara.Another co-convict Sukhdev Pehalwan was also handed down a 20-year jail term in the case.Prior to this, the Delhi High Court, while upholding the life imprisonment awarded to Vikas and Vishal Yadav by the trial court, had specified a 30-year sentence, without any remission, to both of them. It had awarded a 25-year jail term to third convict Pehalwan.All three were convicted and sentenced for kidnapping Nitish Katara from a marriage party on the intervening night of February 16-17, 2002 and then killing him for his alleged affair with Bharti Yadav, the sister of Vikas.Bharti is the daughter of Uttar Pradesh politician D P Yadav who is in jail in connection with another murder case.Katara was murdered as Vishal and Vikas Yadav did not approve of his affair with Bharti because they belonged to different castes, the lower court had said in its verdict.

26-08-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee resumes flight, metro, and local train services||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday announced a partial resumption of flight operations to the state from six major cities, which included Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai.Addressing a press conference, Banerjee said, that from September 1, commercial flights from six cities could land at the airports in the state. However, operations of flights would be allowed only three days of the week initially.Flight services to Kolkata from Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chennai and Ahmedabad were suspended from July 6 following a request by the state government.West Bengal government had written to civil aviation ministry to stop the operation of flights to Kolkata and Bagdogra airports from the six “high prevalence” cities as part of the containment measures against the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the state.Besides the six above-mention cities, West Bengal also sought cancellation of flights coming from Indore and Surat.Since there was no direct flight to the state from either Surat or Indore, the question of suspension of the service did not arise.For the local commuters also there was good news from the Chief Minister as she announced that the metro service, as well as local train service, could resume from September 1.While the metro rail service caters to the requirement of commuters in Kolkata, the local train service works as a lifeline for people including officegoers who come to Kolkata from various neighbouring towns and villages daily for earning their livelihood.The Chief Minister said that the guideline regarding maintenance of “physical distance” of passengers must be adhered to while resuming the metro service and the local train services.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-resumes-flight-metro-and-local-train-services-131751

26-08-2020||New Delhi||Lowest possibility of Covid-19 infection via air travel: Official||The possibility of getting an in-flight Covid-19 infection is negligible, as borne out by empirical data, a senior Civil Aviation Ministry official said.Joint Secretary, Civil Aviation, Usha Padhee, told IANS that only about 2,000 passengers have been reported to be Covid positive after reaching their destination out of the over 6 million people, who travelled on domestic flights post resumption till August 24.“This figure even includes individuals who have been identified via contact tracing,” she said.“If you see the empirical data, we can certainly say that air travel is the safest and fastest mode of travel.” A total of 6.5 million passengers have travelled from May 25 onwards till August 24.Currently, the Centre has permitted only 45 per cent capacity utilisation in the domestic sector with effect from June 27, post the initial re-start of operations of scheduled domestic flights, with effect from May 25.In addition, special and chartered flights are operated with the government’s permission for repatriating Indians and foreign citizens.“As and when the situation improves, more capacity will be allowed. Till now, a sequential growth can be seen in passenger traffic,” Padhee said.“At present, on an average, over 90,000 passengers travel on a daily basis. This number will definitely rise. We have also instituted a fare band which is a win-win for the passengers as well as the industry.” Last month, the Centre had extended the time period for limited domestic passenger flight operations and the air fare cap till November 24.In terms of the fare structure, air routes have been divided into seven sections based on travel time. Each such section has its minimum and maximum fare.Padhee also said: “The regulator is also carrying out strict financial audits so that safety protocols are not scarified due to financial constraints.” Besides, she pointed out that the Centre has brought in bio-security or public health components in air travel via a multi-level approach.Padhee also said domestic airlines will be encouraged to expand international operations and that they should use this period to gain experience in operating long-haul flights.“There has been massive international expansion by some of the domestic airlines in this period. It is encouraging as post-Covid-19, in the new normal, more passengers will be flown out by Indian carriers,” she said.On whether or not these flights will be maintained post the commencement of normal international operations, she said: “These airlines have been designated to fly abroad.” — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lowest-possibility-of-covid-19-infection-via-air-travel-official-131749
26-08-2020||Aditi Tandon||On Parliament session eve, 7 Oppn party CMs led by Sonia pledge to jointly fight Centre 'fearlessly' over GST dues||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 26Seven Chief Ministers representing Opposition parties on Wednesday called for unity and fearlessness to take on the Centre and said they would mull moving the Supreme Court for postponement of JEE Mains, NEET UG and university exams.At a virtual meeting of seven CMs called by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, there was unanimity on the need to consider a review petition in the apex court, which earlier rejected a petition to postpone NEET UG and JEE Mains exams that are due soon.West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and her counterparts Maharashtra’s Uddhav Thackeray and Jharkhand’s Hemant Soren said Opposition unity was needed to fight the BJP.“They keep sending agencies after us to surround us and divert our attention, but we must fight for the people and our rights. We are not begging. We are asking for our rights,” Banerjee said, attacking the Centre for failing to pay GST compensation to states, a matter Sonia flagged in her opening remarks saying the government had betrayed its constitutional obligation of paying GST compensation to states.“In the meeting of Standing Committee on Finance dated August 11, the Finance Secretary has reportedly stated that the Central Government is not in a position to pay the mandatory GST compensation of 14% for the current year. This refusal to compensate the states is nothing short of a betrayal by the Modi government of the people's trust. "On the other hand, the Central Government continues to profiteer from unilateral cesses which are non-shareable with states and corner this revenue,” Sonia said.Speaking at the meeting, all CMs, including Punjab’s Capt Amarinder Singh, Rajasthan’s Ashok Gehlot and Chhattisgarh’s Bhupesh Baghel, also slammed non-payment of GST dues demanding unified action on the GST issue.Thackeray also told the gathering that the Opposition must decide whether to fight or fear.“If we have to fight we have to fight and not be afraid of pressures,” said Maharashtra CM, noting that CMs should meet even when there is no crisis.Soren earlier said he felt the Opposition voice was weak and needed to be stronger.With all CMs agreeing that holding competitive exams at the time of rising COVID transmission could be dangerous, Banerjee and Amarinder Singh pressed to move SC for a review of its earlier order rejecting postponement of the exams.All CMs agreed this needed to be done quickly as JEE Mains was scheduled from September 1 to 6.Amarinder and Baghel also attacked the National Education Policy 2020 after Sonia’s remarks criticising the same.While Punjab has formed a committee to study the impact of NEP on the state, Baghel called for opposition of many elements of the policy.The meeting called by Sonia three weeks ahead of Parliament session sought coordinated approach of the opposition in the session.Sonia earlier flagged the need for GST compensation to be paid to states on time according to the laws passed by Parliament.“This is  not happening. Dues have accumulated. The finances of all states have been affected badly. GST was enacted as an example of “cooperative federalism”. It was enacted after the states agreed to forego their constitutional powers of taxation in the larger national interest and on the solemn promise of compulsory GST compensation for a period of five years,” Sonia said.  Also questioning the Draft EIA Notification 2020 as anti-democratic, Sonia said, “Laws meant to protect the environment, livelihoods and public health are being weakened.”She also expressed concerns over privatisation or public sector assets, especially the Railways.Gandhi said NEP 2020 should worry everyone. “NEP 2020 is a setback for progressive, secular and scientific values and reveals insensitivity to what the states have been saying. Problems of students and examinations are being dealt with very uncaringly,” she said, two days after crushing an inner party rebellion questioning her presidency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-parliament-session-eve-7-oppn-party-cms-led-by-sonia-pledge-to-jointly-fight-centre-fearlessly-over-gst-dues-131748

This is consistent with our actions each year," the company informed.According to the AFR report on Tuesday, Sweet said in the global staff meeting: "In a normal year, we transition out about 5 per cent and we hire to replace them, because we are in a demand scenario"."Right now, we're not in a demand scenario, so if we manage out the same percentage of people and don't replace them, it allows us to continue to invest and preserve some people who have lower chargeability for when the market comes back."This year, in addition to the normal 5 per cent, we've identified more people who need improvement ... So we're making sure ... if we have to make other actions, we know where our performance is," she was quoted as saying in an internal global staff meeting streamed online.Accenture said that In India, "We continue to hire, and as part of our ongoing compensation programs, we also recently recognized a number of our people with bonuses and promotions."Sweet "faced questions from staff about changed internal performance assessments" in the global meeting."She that despite cutting subcontractors and halting fresh recruitment, the company still needed to reduce numbers," the report said."We finished our second quarter at the end of February and we were growing 8 per cent. We were having an incredible year."The growth had collapsed to 1.3 per cent owing to the pandemic.Accenture currently has 509,000 people serving clients in more than 120 countries. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/accenture-to-lay-off-25k-employees-indians-set-to-lose-jobs-report-131745

So every day I trekked up the hill, carrying my laptop, to attend online lectures," she said."I wrote about this in my essay. I didn't know that it would get published in a newspaper," Swapnali added.The essay got published in the Marathi daily 'Prahar' and then news channels picked up the story."A day before Ganesh Chaturthi, officials of Bharatnet came to the village and said they had received orders from the Centre to ensure internet connectivity to me," she said.BharatNet under the telecom ministry has been tasked with setting up an optical fibre network to provide internet connectivity to gram panchayats."They installed optical fibre cable in the gram panchayat and provided me a Wi-Fi connection," she said.The gram panchayat had internet facility, but it hadn't been activated, she said.Swapnali said she moved to Mumbai after standard 12 to study at the Mumbai Veterinary College, but returned home when lockdown was imposed following the coronavirus outbreak.

26-08-2020||Chandigarh||DGCA drafts fresh rules for onboard WiFi services in aircraft; operators to identify safety hazards||It has been five months since the central government permitted the access of internet services to passengers through onboard Wi-Fi. On Wednesday, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation drafted new rules for the use of portable electronic devices that can be carried by passengers.The draft revisions of the Air Safety Section of Civil Aviation Requirements was released after six years. They were last revised in 2014 when the use of mobile telephones inside an aircraft was not permitted—provided they were switched to "flight" mode.The fresh rules state, that the use of onboard WI-FI on portable electronic devices will be permitted provided the aircraft has prior approval from DGCA.The aircraft operator has to ensure that the In-Flight and Maritime Connectivity (IFMC) services being provided enruote are approved by the Department of Telecommunication.The internet services would be available only after the aircraft has attained a height of 3,000 meters or 10,000 feet above the elevation of the departure or arrival airfield.The services would be available when the electronic device is used in "non-transmitting" or "flight" mode. These devices can be deactivated by the pilot-in-command for any reason, and during any phase of the flight.Restrictions on the use of such services would be recommended in the aircraft certification documents or flight manuals.DGCA has also mandated aircraft operators to identify safety hazards, and manage associated risks for use of onboard Wi-Fi.These include use of electronic devices during various stages of light, used during turbulence, non-compliance of regulations by passengers, disruptive passengers, improperly stowed devices and battery fire. Cabin crew would be required to keep a watch on passengers to ensure compliance of prohibitory requirements.According to DGCA, portable electronic devices are not included in the approved aircraft configuration, and they may not meet the stringent electromagnetic emission standards imposed on certified airborne equipment.Many of these devices have shown significant radio frequency emissions in excess of permissible levels within the frequency band of aircraft communication and navigation systems. Aircraft manufacturers had earlier recommended that devices which intentionally transmit radio signals should be prohibited for use by passengers at all times while onboard the aircraft.With the advancement in technologies and research on the usage of mobile phones in the air, many aviation regulators across the world have determined that airlines can safely allow the use of electronic devices during all phases of flight provided they remained in ‘flight’ mode.Since 2014, passengers in India could use mobiles and laptops to play games, listen to songs watch videos or do offline work.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-drafts-fresh-rules-for-onboard-wifi-services-in-aircraft-operators-to-identify-safety-hazards-131739

But UGC is not listening to us,” said Singh.He informed the chief ministers that Punjab had set up a committee to assess the general and financial impact of the new National Education Policy 2020 on the state.“The new Education Policy has been thrust on us but we were not consulted,” he said.The Punjab chief minister said the Centre was not releasing GST dues making the COVID management challenging.“COVID situation is getting worse. We are likely to reach the peak by mid-September. Today we have 44,000 cases which will rise to 1.10 lakh by September 18. As of today there are 1,178 deaths in Punjab and the prediction is 3,000 deaths by mid-September,” Amarinder Singh said.The Punjab chief minister said the state’s finances were down and the Attorney General is learnt to have opined that the Centre need not pay GST compensation to the GST Council.“We learnt the Centre has taken AG’s opinion who says there is no obligation on Centre to pay shortfall of GST and the GST council has to find ways. Punjab's revenue is down by 38 per cent. All tax collections are in the minus and the financial year will end with Rs 25,000-crore deficit,” said Singh after Mamata Banerjee, Thackeray and Soren and other chief ministers decided to collectively petition the president and the prime minister on the depleting finances.Punjab, Singh said, has spent Rs 500 crore on COVID so far.The state had received Rs 102 crore in two instalments from Health Ministry for Covid and Rs 31 crore third instalment was due, he said.Amarinder Singh said the opposition chief ministers should collectively see the prime minister and ask him to ensure states are financially compensated.“We have given powers of taxation to the PM through GST.

26-08-2020||New Delhi||Further delay in conducting JEE, NEET can have serious repercussions: IIT Delhi director||Any further delay in conducting entrance exams JEE and NEET will have "serious repercussions" on not only the academic calendar but also career of bright students, IIT Delhi Director V Ramgopal Rao said.Rao's comments come in the wake of growing clamour for postponing the two crucial exams in the wake of rising in COVID-19 cases."The consequences of postponing these exams any further can have serious repercussions on IIT academic calendars and for candidates. I fail to see how we can run two batches together. It will become a zero academic year for lakhs of students. Our academic calendars are too packed already and linked to too many other things. The delays can impact the careers of so many bright students."We have already lost six months. If we conduct the exams in September, we can at least start the sessions in Indian Institutes of Technology (could be online) in December. Tinkering with the examination pattern or admission processes in these times will also be detrimental and unfair for everyone," Rao said in a social media post.He said coronavirus is not going to go away for at least a year and we cannot be perpetually in lockdown mode, and appealed to the students to "trust the institutions" and take the entrance tests while strictly following the COVID-19 safety guidelines."COVID is not going to go away for another six months to one year. We all need to get used to this new normal. The earlier we realise that, the better it is for all of us. The last postponement of exams definitely helped us prepare well now. "I feel sad for those serious students preparing for these examinations. I did receive a large number of emails from them. As if COVID-19 is not enough, this uncertainty about exam dates is further adding to the stress levels of students. Personally, I am for conducting these examinations by taking all precautions and following social distancing norms. Lockdown is not a solution to COVID. Lockdown was needed to prepare ourselves better," he said.The IIT director also noted that the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) is now conducted multiple times a year."Incase some students cannot write the JEE Main this time, they can take the exam after six months again. I don't see any reason for concern. As the JEE Advanced organising institute, I assure everyone that IITs will do their best and put their best foot forward in organising the JEE Advanced examination," he said.Rao said they will also be closely monitoring the situation and take necessary steps as required. "Health of candidates is of utmost concern to all of us. We all have children and we can connect with the parents of candidates," he said.The JEE Main and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) will be conducted in September as scheduled, the Ministry of Education officials had on Tuesday said, amid a growing chorus for postponing the crucial tests in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.While the JEE Main is scheduled from September 1-6, NEET is planned on September 13.Several opposition leaders in India, including Congress' Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, her Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik and DMK president M K Stalin have demanded the exams be postponed. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/further-delay-in-conducting-jee-neet-can-have-serious-repercussions-iit-delhi-director-131721
26-08-2020||New Delhi||Holding NEET, JEE will risk exposing 28 lakh students to COVID: Sisodia||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday reiterated his demand that medical and engineering entrance exams NEET and JEE be postponed and the Central government work on alternative methods for selecting students."They (Centre) are saying protocols will be followed. Following the same protocols that the Centre wants 28 lakh students to follow, lakhs of Indians have tested positive," Sisodia told reporters.He said the Union Home Minister tested positive for coronavirus despite staying in a very safe environment, and that many other leaders including Delhi Health Minister have also contracted the contagious disease."So many top leaders have got infected with COVID-19 despite taking all precautions. So, how can we take the risk of sending 28 lakh students to exam centre and be assured that they will not be infected," Sisodia asked. He said the Central government should immediately postpone the exams and work on "alternative methods" of admission. "I appeal to the government to not be adamant on admission only through these exams. We are not at all saying that the year is declared as a zero academic year. We are not in favour of admitting students just like that as we will need quality doctors and engineers but banking upon only a three-hour exam and expecting it to work like a magic wand in identifying talent, is a very conservative thought," he added.The Joint Entrance Examination (Main) and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) will be conducted in September as scheduled, the Ministry of Education officials had said on Tuesday, amid a growing chorus for postponing the crucial tests given the COVID-19 pandemic.On Tuesday, Swedish teen climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg also threw her weight behind postponing the exams given the pandemic."It's deeply unfair that students of India are asked to sit national exams during the Covid-19 pandemic and while millions have also been impacted by the extreme floods. I stand with their call to #PostponeJEE_NEETinCOVID," she said in a tweet.Several opposition leaders in India including Congress' Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, her Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik and DMK President MK Stalin have demanded the exams be postponed.Sisodia had on Saturday also appealed the Centre to postpone or cancel the exams.The Supreme Court had last week dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the two exams amid a spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases, saying a "precious" academic year of students "cannot be wasted" and life has to go on.While a total of 9.53 lakh candidates have registered for JEE-Mains, 15.97 lakh students have registered for NEET. Increasing the number of examination centres, alternate seating plan, fewer candidates per room and staggered entry and exit are among the steps the National Testing Agency will take for safely conducting NEET and JEE in September.

26-08-2020||New Delhi||Neither ‘firebrand' nor ‘rightwing', I am ‘centre-left thinking person', says Varun Gandhi in new book||Describing himself as a “centre-left thinking person”, BJP MP Varun Gandhi says in a new book that he is not a rightwing person by nature and his writings are evidence of his “consistently progressive liberal record”.In the recently launched "India Tomorrow: Conversations with the Next Generation of Political Leaders", Varun Gandhi also terms Britain's Jeremy Corbyn and US' Bernie Sanders, both known for advocating left economic and social policies, his political inspirations.The book gives readers a snapshot of contemporary Indian politics through interviews of 20 of the country's most prominent next-generation politicians. "My sense is, if one were to look at it in terms of ideology or policy, then I am a centre-left thinking person. I am not a right-wing person by nature. If you have read all my writings, for the last 10 years I have had a consistently progressive liberal record. As a person, I have grown into this voice which is what's inside me," Varun Gandhi says in an interview to the authors, Pradeep Chhibber and Harsh Shah.The Gandhi-Nehru scion – he's the son of the late Sanjay Gandhi and BJP leader Maneka Gandhi—joined the BJP in 2004. He fought and won his first election in 2009 from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh, the same seat he represents right now, with a margin of nearly three lakh votes.  The Pilibhit MP also brings up issues such as economic inequality, environment justice, disadvantaged communities in the interview to buttress his point of being a staunch progressive liberal."... I have always taken stands that are symptomatic of some desire for progressive change. The kind of support and love that I get from a variety of audiences, I get about 10 times more support from the liberals than I get from the right-wingers. In fact, I get knocked by the right- wingers many times but I never get knocked by the liberals ever," he says.Varun Gandhi adds that communists always joke with him and say he is a "communist in the BJP".  The 40-year-old politician dissociates himself from terms such as "firebrand" or “strident”, a perception that many people had of him after the alleged hate speech controversy in 2009 for which he was later acquitted by the courts.While campaigning as a BJP candidate from Pilibhit in 2009, he attracted controversy and ire over his alleged hate speeches. He was booked under various sections of the IPC and the People's Representation Act for promoting enmity and acts prejudicial against communal harmony. He was acquitted in 2013 because of lack of any substantial evidence against him.Varun Gandhi, who writes a syndicated column and has authored several books, including two volumes of poetry, says it has been a very long time since the infamous incident and there have been a hundred things he has done since then. He also points out in the interview that he was the "only MP in Parliament" to sit at Anna Hazare's dharna and support the Lokpal Bill."I don't think, to be honest, that anybody thinks any more that I am a firebrand person or a strident person. If you look at any of the public platforms, I don't think anybody would mention that. The thing is it was a very bizarre thing, the so-called speech, because when I fought my case and won, they apologized to me," he adds.Asked what draws “someone with progressive liberal views, being centre-left” to the BJP, why he is sticking with it and why he is not moving to a party “more in line” with his values and outlook on so many issues, Varun Gandhi says he has been in the BJP for 15 years."… I have built relationships within it, I have got friends here. I feel that in the medium-to-long-term, the workers of the BJP, I feel, are very committed, hard working, middle class, humble, salt of earth people who mean well for this country. I am not a huge votary of party politics, to be honest, so that's not what I think about at all," he explains.Varun Gandhi also speaks about what he really likes in BJP -- "decentralization of power" and "tolerance of different intellectual disciplines within the larger political framework".He admits to strident rightwing voices within the party, but gives the example of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who for the large part of his life talked about "Gandhian socialism"."When I joined the BJP, after a few years I realized one very good thing about it was that there was a decentralization of power. I think centralized power in any form is never a great thing.   "So I felt here was a party where even if you fell out with one leader you could survive and succeed because there would be four other people to see goodness and talent and worth in you. That is one thing that encouraged me as a young person." Varun Gandhi's syndicated column reaches a subscriber base of over 200 million through 17 newspapers, covering many different languages. In late 2018, he authored a book on rural distress, "Rural Manifesto: Realizing India's Future Through Her Villages". He is a poet too and has written two volumes—"The Otherness of Self" (2000) and “Stillness: Poems” (2015). Discussing his column, he says, "And I write solely on policy. I don't write on politics in an adversarial manner. A lot of them are solution-oriented and the syntax is not meant to be polemical, it is not meant to be an us versus them, me versus you, because in policy terms there is no me and you, there is only us."

26-08-2020||New Delhi||SC pulls up Centre for 'hiding behind RBI' on interest waiver during moratorium||The Supreme Court on Wednesday took note of the Centre's alleged inaction and asked it to clarify its stand within a week on the waiver of interest on interest for deferred payments of instalments for loans during the moratorium period announced due to the coronavirus lockdown.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said the Centre had not made its stand clear on the issue despite the fact that ample powers were available with it under the Disaster Management Act and was "hiding behind the RBI".The apex court granted time to the government after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought a week's time to file a response."My Lordships may not say that. We are working in coordination with RBI," Mehta said.The bench, also comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and Justice MR Shah, asked the solicitor general to clarify stand on the Disaster Management Act and whether additional interest on existing interest could be accrued.Mehta argued that there cannot be a common solution for all the problems.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the petitioner, informed the bench that the loan moratorium's deadline would end on August 31 and sought its extension."I am only saying that till these pleas are decided, the extension should not end," Sibal said.The apex court has now posted the matter for hearing on September 1.The top court had earlier said there was "no merit in charging interest on interest" for deferred loan payment instalments during the moratorium period announced in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.The bench was hearing a plea filed by Agra resident Gajendra Sharma, who has sought a direction to declare the portion of the RBI's March 27 notification "as ultra vires to the extent it charges interest on the loan amount during the moratorium period, which creates hardship to the petitioner being borrower and creates hindrance and obstruction in 'right to life' guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India".Sharma has also sought a direction to the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to provide relief in repayment of loan by not charging interest during the moratorium period.On June 4, the top court had sought the Finance Ministry's reply on the waiver of interest on loans during the moratorium period after the RBI said it would not be prudent to go for a forced waiver of interest risking financial viability of the banks.The top court had said there were two aspects under consideration in this matter - no interest payment on loans during the moratorium period and no interest to be charged on interest.It said these were challenging times and it was a serious issue as on the one hand, moratorium was granted and on the other, interest was charged on loans.

26-08-2020||New Delhi||Rajya Sabha expands ambit of receiving complaints||The Rajya Sabha has expanded its ambit of receiving complaints in regard to breach of normative conduct on the part of its Members.The reformative measure has been rung in after the issue remained in abeyance for 16 long years.Rajya Sabha’s Secretariat has informed its members that the House’s Ethics Committee has authorised two of its officials  “to receive complaints of alleged ethical misconduct and violation of Code of Conduct against the Members.The measure is in furtherance of a decision of the Committee on Ethics of the House under Rules formulated in 2004 empowering the Committee to do so.The Committee, in its meeting last week, decided to authorise a Director and an Additional Director attached with it to receive complaints against the Members of the House.The existing arrangement was restrictive because only complaints addressed to the Committee were valid for examination.Rule 295 (4) of the Rules of Procedure of the House provides that a complaint should be addressed in writing to the Committee, or to an officer authorised by it, but this authorisation kept hanging fire.   The authorisation was now done, for the first time after sixteen years, in the first meeting chaired by BJP Member Shiv Pratap Shukla, who was nominated as Chairman of the Committee by Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu.  During the meeting, Shukla stated that Naidu was keen on Committee being more proactive.Shukla urged the members of the Committee to address ambiguities  in the present rules relating to taking up complaints based on media reports and received through mail for its effective functioning.The Committee of Rajya Sabha was constituted in March 1997 as an internal self-regulatory mechanism of the Council to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of the members and to examine the cases referred to it.Prior to July 2004, the rules applicable to the Committee of Privileges were applied to it.In 2004, rules were incorporated in the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Council of States specifying its functions, procedure for making complaints etc. The Committee, in its first Report in 1999 formulated a 14-point Code of Conduct for Members of the Rajya Sabha enjoining upon them not to do anything that brought disrepute to the Parliament and affected their credibility.Other prescriptions were to ensure that their private financial interests did not come in conflict with the public interest, not to be disrespectful to any religion and work for the promotion of secular values, maintaining high standards of morality, dignity, decency and values.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-expands-ambit-of-receiving-complaints-131664

Govt needs to: spend more, not lend more," Gandhi said."Give money to the poor, not tax cuts to industrialists.

26-08-2020||New Delhi||Yamuna continues to flow near warning level in Delhi; water level likely to increase further||The Yamuna was flowing close to the warning mark in Delhi on Wednesday morning and is likely to swell further with more water being released into it from the Hathnikund barrage in Haryana, officials said.    The water level was recorded at 203.78 metres at the Old Railway Bridge at 8 am. Water was being released into the Yamuna at the rate of 13,433 cusecs at 8 am from the Hathnikund barrage, an official of the irrigation and flood control department said.    One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litres per second.The water level was recorded at 203.98 metres at 6 pm on Tuesday, precariously close to the warning level of 204.50 metres, according to the official.  The river had swelled to 204.38 metres on Monday, which was just a metre below the danger mark of 205.33 metres.“The flow rate was 36,557 cusec at 5 pm on Tuesday, the maximum in the last 24 hours… The water level is likely to increase in the next 48 hours,” he said. The water discharged from the barrage — which provides drinking water to Delhi — usually takes 72 hours to reach the capital.Normally, the flow rate at the Hathnikund barrage is 352 cusec, but the discharge is increased after heavy rainfall in catchment areas.Last year, the flow rate had peaked to 8.28 lakh cusec on August 18-19, and the water level of the Yamuna had hit the 206.60 meter-mark, breaching the danger mark of 205.33 meters.The Delhi government had to launch evacuation and relief operations after the overflowing river submerged many low-lying areas.Delhi's Water Minister Satyendar Jain had Monday said the government was ready to deal with any flood-like situation.The India Meteorological Department has also warned of "heavy to very heavy" rainfall in northwest India, which is likely to increase water levels of the river.“Heavy to very rainfall is likely in northwest India over the next three to four days due to the northward shifting of the monsoon through,” Kudeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the India Meteorological Department, said. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yamuna-continues-to-flow-near-warning-level-in-delhi-water-level-likely-to-increase-further-131657

It's about my country which matters most."Several members of the 'group of 23' said on Tuesday they were "not dissenters" but "proponents of revival". Many of them also backed Sonia remaining at the helm.After the seven-hour meeting of the party's top decision-making body, the CWC urged Sonia to continue as its interim chief till an AICC session could be convened and authorised her to effect necessary organisational changes to deal with the challenges facing the party.It made it clear that no one would be permitted to undermine or weaken the party and its leadership.The CWC also resolved that inner-party issues could not be deliberated through the media or in public fora and all such issues must be raised within the party "in the interest of propriety and discipline".

26-08-2020||KV Prasad||The way forward for Cong||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 25The latest developments in the Congress led to an intense scrutiny of all that is not right in the Grand Old Party. The commotion began when contents of a letter, by a group of leaders, came out in the open.The issues flagged centred around concerns that many in the party were conversing among themselves. What caused consternation in the central leadership is the presence of senior leaders who appended their signatures to the communication on the way the affairs are being run, seeking introspection and a way forward.Even though many questioned the timing of the issues or the manner in which these were made public, the party leadership would have to apply itself to arrest asense of drift and deepeningperception around it.After facing two back-to-back setbacks in the General Elections, the fact is the Congress is yet to delineate a roadmap as to where it wants to go from here.The unilateral decision of Rahul Gandhi last year to walk away from the presidentship added to the setback. His mother Sonia Gandhi reshouldered the responsibility. On Monday, the interim arrangement was extended by another six months.That she will have a four-member panel to assist her is sort of a throwback to a similar path the party took in August 2011. At that time, Sonia went to the US for a treatment, entrusting the party affairs to the collective leadership of Rahul, AK Antony, Janardan Dwivedi and Ahmed Patel.The party does need a chief; it would also have to attend to the issues that keep cropping up and work on a plan to reposition itself as the principal challenger to the strong and formidable BJP.By all accounts the dissenters have stepped back while managing to stir the political cauldron within the party. For the time being, the only achievement for this group is continuation of Sonia whose consensual style of leadership gave her the unique distinction of being the president of the GOP for two decades.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/the-way-forward-for-cong-131595

The biggest sponsor of cross-border terrorism against India now tries to masquerade itself as a victim of terrorism by India,” India’s Permanent Mission to the UN said.The Pakistan Mission falsely claimed that its UN envoy Munir Akram gave a statement at a Security Council debate on report of the Secretary General on threats to international peace and security posed by terrorism actions.However, the Security Council meeting on threats to international peace and security was not open to non-members of the Council.

It’s about my country which matters the most... we now hope the party will be united and will put up a strong fight against the BJP,” Sibal said.While most leaders who signed the letter chose to stay silent after yesterday when the seniormost signatory Ghulam Nabi Azad was at the receiving end, Mukul Wasnik, a CWC member and a signatory to the controversial letter, today said the letter was written in the party’s and the nation’s interest and raised vital issues concerning Congress reinvigoration.Another signatory Vivek Tankha also took the line that the country needed brave people. “We are not dissenters but proponents of revival. The letter was not a challenge to leadership but a parchment of action to strengthen the party,” said Tankha, a Rajya Sabha MP.The letter writers are now waiting for the Congress to make some amends before deciding on the next course of action. While the dissenters wait for things to take a favourable turn, Congress leaders didn’t mince words in attacking them, with veterans alleging that the signatories strengthened the BJP’s hands, an insinuation Rahul made yesterday at the CWC, although the Congress insisted Rahul hadn’t said so.‘Letter written in interest of party, nation’ It’s not about a post.

26-08-2020||New Delhi||World-class gear for 30K additional troops at LAC||Rs1 lakh per soldierClothing and gear to tackle extreme cold will cost over Rs1 lakh per soldierExtra troops were deployed in May to ward off any China misadventureNormally, patrolling is curtailed in winter as temp dips up to minus 30°CWith additional troops to be positioned along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh during winter, the Army is procuring world-class snow boots, gloves, layered jackets, trousers and sleeping bags.New sleeping habitat like arctic tents and special high-nutrient diet are to be provided.It is the first time that so many troops will be stationed during winter in eastern Ladakh along the 826-km LAC. Under normal circumstances, troop levels are no more than two brigades (around 10,000). Heated habitat with bunker-type beds already exists to house these many troops.This year, the challenge will be the additional 30,000 troops who along with equipment have been stationed since May this year to ward off any misadventure by China.Clothing and boots will be in multiple pairs as they tend to get wet in the snow. Just the clothing and gear to tackle the cold — night time temperatures are expected to be minus 30°C in peak winter —would cost more than Rs 1 lakh for each soldier, sources said.Normally, patrolling is curtailed in winter. But this time, it is expected to be different as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is stationed just across the LAC.The winter will set in in the first week of September when night temperatures dip below the freezing point. The entire area is above 14,000 feet and some of the mountain passes to be guarded are in excess of 17,000 feet.The other task is to feed the troops as low oxygen availability in tree-less eastern Ladakh, coupled with extreme cold, low humidity and intense solar radiation, throws up a challenge. The calorie intake has been calculated as the per Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences study. The energy requirements in high altitude (over 12,000 feet) vary between 4,270 and 4,550 calories per day per person. Then there is a requirement of nutrients as the low availability of oxygen in tree-less eastern Ladakh coupled with extreme cold, low humidity and intense solar radiation throw up a challenge.

Seven of the 19 have been held, while six eliminated. Rest are on the runOver 18 months after the deadliest attack in Kashmir that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has named 19 persons, including Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar, in the chargesheet in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack case.On February 14, 2019, a local suicide bomber, Adil Dar, had rammed an explosive-laden car into a CRPF bus at Lethpora, killing 40 personnel.In its 13,800-page chargesheet filed in a special NIA court in Jammu today, the probe agency named Azhar, one of the three militants released as part of the 1999 Kandahar hijack prisoner swap, his brothers Abdul Rauf Asghar and Ammar Alvi and 16 others as accused.Among the 19, seven militants have been arrested, while six, including three from Pakistan, have been eliminated. One of the accused in the case is a woman from south Kashmir.The NIA said the Pakistan-based Jaish leadership hatched the conspiracy and the attack was executed by Pakistan militant Mohammad Umar Farooq, who infiltrated into Kashmir in April 2018, and his local associates Sameer Dar and Adil Ahmad Dar.“The RDX was brought by the Pakistan terrorists who infiltrated into India. Shakir (another accused) collected the explosive material and stocked it in his house. In the first week of February, Umar, Sameer, Adil and Shakir made the IED using the RDX, calcium-ammonium nitrate, gelatin sticks and aluminum powder and assembled it in two containers — one weighing 160 kg and the second 40 kg.“The two IED containers were fitted into a Maruti Eeco car and the accused were ready (to strike) by the morning of February 6. However, it got delayed due to closure of highway due to snowfall. On February 14, Shakir drove Adil till the national highway, after which Adil took charge of the vehicle and carried out the suicide attack,” the NIA said. The investigation revealed that the JeM leadership continuously gave directions to the militants who had infiltrated into India both before and after the attack.“Investigation also revealed a well-crafted mechanism by the Pakistan establishment to push terrorists into India from launch pads located in Shakargarh (Pakistan), opposite the Samba-Kathua sector in Jammu,” it said.2019 Blast brought India, Pak to brink of war||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-chargesheets-azhar-2-brothers-131510
