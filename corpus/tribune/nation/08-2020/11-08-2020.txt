The meeting was chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.In a statement, the defence ministry said the DAC also accorded approvals that are likely to speed up the procurement of AK-203 rifles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) “upgrades”.Under the UAV upgrade project, the government is likely to arm some of them with laser-guided bombs and precision-guided munitions.On procurement of basic trainer jets, it said the certification process for the HTT-40 aircraft of the HAL is underway.“Post certification 70 basic trainer aircraft will be initially procured from HAL and balance 36 after operationalisation of HTT-40 fleet in IAF,” it said in a statement.It said the DAC also approved procurement of an upgraded version of Super Rapid Gun Mount (SRGM) which is fitted as the main gun onboard the warships of the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard (ICG).“The upgraded version of SRGM has enhanced capability to perform against fast manoeuvring targets like missiles and fast attack crafts and increase the maximum engagement range,” the ministry said.It said the DAC also approved procurement of 125 mm APFSDS (Armour Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot) ammunition for Indian Army as a ‘design and development case’.“The ammunition being procured will have a 70 per cent indigenous content,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-approves-military-procurement-worth-rs-8-722-crore-including-106-basic-trainer-aircraft-125171
11-08-2020||New Delhi||PM sees innovation as key to develop world-class tech products, says Niti||Niti Aayog on Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi considers innovation as the key to develop world-class technology products.“If Nalanda and Takshila university were built today, they would be completely virtual. SamShiksha is conceptualized as a first of its kind online university of the future,” Niti Aayog quoted Modi as saying at a virtual interaction with technology leaders on August 7.The Aayog said Modi also emphasised on continuing the ‘Guru-Shishya’ tradition in virtual classes.“Innovation is the key to develop world-class tech products. BHIM is a powerful product with proven technology and a proven platform. It is credible, fast and seamless,” Modi was quoted as saying by Niti Aayog in a series of tweets.According to Niti Aayog tweets, the prime minister termed Unnati as a state-of-the-art tech platform that is aimed at providing livelihood access for 20 crore blue and grey collar workers.“The platform can unlock aspirations & help educate job seekers about available opportunities, while also upskilling them,” the Aayog quoted Modi as saying.The government has identified seven key areas for developing technology-based solutions in public-private partnership mode to deal with challenges in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak.The seven areas are financial inclusion, digital health, livelihood, nutrition, MSMEs, agriculture and education.In late May, Modi had directed government think-tank Niti Aayog to identify key themes that would emerge in the post-COVID-19 world and work with top technology leaders to identify specific use cases for technology intervention.

11-08-2020||New Delhi||Every worker wants Rahul to head party: Congress||The Congress, on Tuesday, said every party worker wants Rahul Gandhi to be its president and hoped that good things would happen in future.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said Rahul had shown the courage and mettle to take on the government by “pointing out and criticising every anti-people policy”.He said: “Not 99 per cent, but 100 per cent of Congressmen and women across India, those who belong to Congress ideology, those who have faith in the Congress philosophy and those who have sacrificed their self to tread the path of the Congress party want Rahul Gandhi to be the Congress president.”“This is not because he is Rahul Gandhi, but, because he is the person who has always shown the courage and the mettle to take on the government by pointing out and criticising every anti-people policy,” Sujrewala said at a virtual press conference.Asked whether Rahul was reluctant to assume the role, Surjewala denied so saying he resigned on a moral ground taking moral accountability of the party’s rout in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.“What will happen in the future is not for me to comment upon. I am certain, good things will happen in future,” he told reporters.Many Congressmen, especially the young brigade, have been demanding that Rahul takes over as the party chief.His mother Sonia Gandhi is currently holding the charge of interim president of the Congress party for a year. Rahul refused to take back his resignation despite repeated requests from party leaders.The CWC entrusted the charge to Sonia saying she will continue as party chief till a regular president is appointed and ratified at the AICC plenary session.The chorus for his taking over as Congress chief has once again gained momentum after he played a pivotal role in stopping rebel leader Sachin Pilot from quitting the party and bringing him back into the fold while assuring that his grievances, as well as that of other rebel MLAs, would be amicably resolved in a time-bound manner.

11-08-2020||New Delhi||Gust of wind, wrong decision by pilots, condition of airstrip among possible reasons for AI Express crash: Experts||A gust of wind, a wrong decision by the pilots, the condition of the airstrip and even faulty indication by the instrument landing system could be possible reasons for the crash of the Air India Express plane on Friday in the south Indian city of Kozhikode, according to aviation experts.The dominant reason cited by the experts was the decision by the pilots to not divert the Boeing 737 plane to another airport after the first attempt to land at the designated strip in Kozhikode failed amid rain.The experts were, however, of the opinion that the real reasons would be known only after a thorough investigation into the crash was carried out and it was premature to conclude about why and how it happened.The aircraft, bringing back 190 stranded Indians from Dubai, broke into pieces after it overshot the table-top runway 10 and fell into a valley 35 feet below, leaving 18 people including both pilots, dead.Also read: Kozhikode plane crash: Air India Express says 74 injured passengers discharged from hospitalsKozhikode plane crash: DGCA to audit airports that witness heavy rainsAI pilot unions demand removal of DGCA chief Arun Kumar over Kozhikode plane crash comments“It is foolish to land with a tailwind on a wet runway...This is what I have been pointing out for years. I said in 2011 that landing with a tailwind in rain on runway 10 will result in an accident one day,” leading expert Captain Mohan Ranganathan told PTI.Ranganathan was a member of the operations group of the Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Committee (CASAC) in 2011. He has been a part of various other safety committees of aviation regulator DGCA.As the investigators begin probe into the accident, another aviation expert referred to the “widely recognised Swiss Cheese” model while talking about possible reasons for the crash that included breaking apart of the plane’s fuselage.“Any aeroplane accident that happens is never dependent on a single factor. Top air accident investigation teams across the world believe in the Swiss Cheese model. It says that only when the holes of all slices of Swiss cheese get aligned, then only an accident happens,” the expert said on condition of anonymity.“It is just a metaphor. Swiss cheese has a lot of holes. If you put slices of Swiss cheese in a string and spin them, there will be one in a million times that all holes would be aligned. That will be a precursor to an accident,” he explained.The expert said the reasons for the crash could include environmental factor, human factor, technical factor, the health of the plane, administrative factor and external factor like what the air traffic controller is telling the pilots.He said a sudden gust of wind leading to a wrong decision by the pilots, condition of the aircraft, wrong signalling by the instrument landing system or pure human error could be some of the reasons for the crash.“It can be multiple reasons. We cannot speculate. Wind speed could be a reason. When you are at low speed, you are susceptible to the impact of the wind. One gust of wind can play havoc,” he explained.The runway 10 at Kozhikode airport is approximately 2,700 metres long. The aircraft touched down approximately 1,000 metres from the beginning of runway 10 while landing, according to the AAI.Captain SS Panesar, former director of flight safety and training at the Indian Airlines, said the pilot should have diverted immediately to one of the nearby airports — Trivandrum or Bengaluru — after he did not succeed in its first attempt to land on runway 10 in bad weather condition, using the instrument landing system (ILS).The ILS uses radio beams to give pilots vertical and horizontal guidance while landing the plane.“The authorities have found the DFDR (digital flight data recorder) and CVR (cockpit voice recorder) but one thing will remain unanswered, that why didn’t he divert?” Panesar asked.The experts said the flight data recorder would give the investigators condition of the health of the aircraft, while the cockpit voice recorder would provide details of what the pilots were thinking and what they were going through before the crash.Captain Deepak Sathe was the pilot-in-command and Captain Akhilesh Kumar was the first officer of the flight AIX1344.According to the AAI, the visibility at Kozhikode airport when the flight landed was 2,000 metres.The Kozhikode airport is a CAT-1 airport where flights can land with visibility of 8,01,110 metres or more. At a CAT-IIIB airport, the runway visual range can be as low as 50 metres.The B737 is one of the most popular aircraft models of Boeing. According to the aircraft manufacturers’ operations manual, a B737 plane can satisfactorily land or take off when the tailwinds are not more than 15 knots.A former DGCA official told PTI that the accident could have been averted had the runway been extended some more during the last few years.In 2017, the AAI had attempted to procure land to extend the runway but it was not able to do so as the land acquisition was proving to be expensive and there was stiff resistance from locals, said the official.Addressing the questions on runway 10, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Monday that the airport was equipped with Runway End Safety Area (RESA) as per International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).Ten years back, an Air India Express aircraft overshot the tabletop runway at Mangalore airport, fell into a gorge and caught fire, resulting in loss of 158 lives.Pointing to the similarities between the two accidents, Ranganathan said: “If the same error is done by the same airline (Air India Express), so what happened to safety audits and other checks that the DGCA has been doing for the last 10 years?”Panesar said there should be a judicial enquiry into the accident as it would allow aviation experts to file affidavits and ask pointed questions about the accident.

11-08-2020||Mumbai||Lyricists, musicians remember ‘prolific, powerful’ poet Rahat Indori||Remembering the power of his words and saluting his courage to never hold back, several poets, songwriters and musicians like Javed Akhtar, Gulzar, Shankar Mahadevan, and Varun Grover paid tributes to Urdu poet Rahat Indori, who passed away following a heart attack on Tuesday.The 70-year-old poet-lyricist was admitted to a hospital on Tuesday morning in Indore after he tested positive for COVID-19.Gulzar said Indori’s demise is “more than a big loss” which cannot be quantified.“He was one of a kind. It’s as if somebody has left a void in our Urdu mushairas which can never be filled,” he told PTI.He remembered Indori as someone who would steal the thunder at mushairas (poetry symposium).“Wo toh lutera tha mushairon ka,” Gulzar said.Gulzar said Indori was in total rapport with the new generation and times.“People of all ages used to wait for his turn at mushairas. One mostly comes across romantic shers in mushairas, but all his work that he read was about the sociopolitical and contemporary climate,” he added.Akhtar took to Twitter and remembered Indori as a fearless poet whose passing away was an “irreparable loss.”“Rahat Saheb’s demise is an irreparable loss for contemporary Urdu poetry and our society at large. Like Habib Jalib, he was from the fast disappearing tribe of poets who are never short of courage to call a spade a spade,” Akhtar tweeted.With a 50-year career in poetry, Indori was known for penning lyrics for hits songs like “Dekh Le” from “Munna Bhai MBBS” (2003), “Tumsa Koi Pyaara” from Govinda-starrer 1994 “Khuddar”, “Chori Chori Jab Nazrein Mili” from Kareeb (1998) and “Neend Churai Meri” from “Ishq”.Lyricist-CBFC chief Prasoon Joshi said Indori was a poet with a unique voice and signature style.“He will be missed. In his words: ‘Ek hi nadi ke ye do kinare doston, dostana zindagi se maut se yaari rakho”,” Joshi told PTI.Music composer Shankar Mahadevan of the trio Shankar Ehsaan Loy, said Indori was among the top lyricists of the country.Recalling his experience of working with Indori on Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s “Mission Kashmir” (2000), Mahadevan said he was “prolific poet” who captivated the audience with his style.“In ‘Mission Kashmir’, he wrote beautiful songs like ‘Bumbro’, ‘Dhuan Dhuan’ and a couple more. ‘Dhuan Dhuan’ was about the whole war situation, the lyrics were simply beautiful.“What a prolific poet. I would regularly watch him during mushaira that he used to conduct, he was amazing on stage, the way he would render a simple poetry. I have seen young college students would go gaga over him,” Mahadevan told PTI.The composer said Indori didn’t depend on Hindi films for an identity.“He was a true poet, not just Bollywood lyrics writer. He was not dependent on writing for Hindi films, he had his own identity as a poet, a person who would narrate his own poems.“He was a great poet, his knowledge about poetry, literature, lyrics was amazing,” Mahadevan added.Grover said Indori was a true legend: “a rockstar of the Indian literary world and a prince of the mushaira tradition”.“His range, sharp political commentary, and love of language combined with his impeccable craft inspired generations of Hindustani poets in India. And will continue to do so. Mushaira generally used to end with his act as a showstopper - and today, the show has taken a long, painful pause,” he told PTI.Singer Anuradha Paudwal, who lent her voice to some of the songs penned by him, including “Zindagi Naam Ko Hamari Hai” and “Mere Khayal”, recalled Indori as a humble artiste.“It is a sad thing, he was a very soft-spoken person and a nice human being. He would write such beautiful lines, there was so much depth in what he wrote,” Paudwal told PTI.In a video message, singer Anup Jalota said whenever Indori recited poetry on stage, no one would muster the courage to go after him. “His poetry and his style would enthrall the audience. His passing away is a huge loss to Urdu poetry. It’s also a personal loss as he was a friend. Poets like him aren’t born every day,” Jalota, 67, said.Lyricist Kausar Munir, known for penning for films like “Gunjan Saxena” and “Meri Pyaari Bindu”, told PTI, “All I can say is writers like me stand on the shoulders of giants like him.” Several actors from the industry, including Farhan Akhtar, Jaaved Jaaferi, Pankaj Tripathi, Manoj Bajpayee, also mourned the loss of the poet.Jaaferi said Indori was one the most “powerful, prolific and inspiring poets of India”.“Inna lillaahe wa inna elaihi raaje’oon (from God we have come and to Him is our return) Salaam and RIP #RahatIndori sahab. You will be missed. Heartfelt condolences to the family,” the actor tweeted.Bajpayee said he was extremely saddened by Indori’s passing away and quoted one his famous poems, “Aandhi Se Keh Do Aukaat Mein Rahe”.“May he rest in peace! What a poet,” the “Family Man” star tweeted.Tripathi said Indori would continue to live in people’s hearts and memories.Indori did his schooling from Nutan School in Indore and his graduation from Islamia Karimia College Indore.Indori passed his MA exam in Urdu literature from Barkatullah University, Bhopal in 1975 and was awarded a PhD in Urdu literature from the Bhoj University in 1985 for his thesis titled ‘Urdu Main Mushaira’.While teaching Urdu literature at IK College, he also became busy with ‘mushairas’ and started receiving invitations from all over India and abroad. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lyricists-musicians-remember-prolific-powerful-poet-rahat-indori-125165

11-08-2020||New Delhi||CDS briefs Parliament’s PAC on situation at LAC in Ladakh; says armed forces ready for long haul: Sources||Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat has told a parliamentary committee that the country’s armed forces were prepared to deal with any eventualities along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, and were ready for a long haul even during the harsh winter months, sources in the panel said on Tuesday.Gen Rawat made the remarks when he, along with top commanders of the Army, appeared before the Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Monday on the issue of procurement of high-altitude clothing for the armed forces, they said.During the interaction, several PAC members sought to know from Gen Rawat about the standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in the eastern Ladakh region to which the CDS responded that the armed forces are prepared for any eventualities, the sources said.Gen Rawat appeared confident and clearly conveyed to the panel that the armed forces were prepared for a long haul in the region, they said.The PAC is headed by Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.India and China have been holding diplomatic and military talks on disengagement of troops from all friction points in eastern Ladakh.At the latest round of military talks, the Indian side insisted forcefully on complete disengagement of Chinese troops at the earliest and immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to May 5 when the standoff began following a clash between the two armies in Pangong Tso.The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has pulled back from Galwan Valley and certain other friction points but the withdrawal of its troops have not moved forward from the Finger areas in Pangong Tso, Gogra and Depsang as demanded by India, according to sources.India has been insisting that China must withdraw its forces from areas between Finger Four and Eight. The mountain spurs in the area are referred to as Fingers.The formal process of disengagement of troops began on July 6, a day after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tensions in the area.Considering the situation on the ground, the Indian Army and the IAF have decided to maintain a very high level of operational readiness in all areas along the LAC in Ladakh, North Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh till a “satisfactory” resolution to the border row with China is arrived at, military sources had said last week.Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane has already conveyed to all senior commanders of the Army, overseeing the operation of the frontline formations along the LAC, to maintain a significantly high state of alertness to deal with any Chinese "misadventure", they said.The Indian Army has already made elaborate plans to maintain the current strength of troops and weapons along the LAC during the harsh winter months in eastern Ladakh and all other sensitive areas along the LAC.It is also in the process of procuring a number of weapons, ammunition and winter gears for the frontline troops. The temperature in some of the high-altitude areas along the LAC drops to minus 25-degree Celsius in the winter months.

11-08-2020||New Delhi||India-Nepal to hold ice breaking meet next week||India and Nepal will hold a structured meeting in Kathmandu after a nine-month interregnum during which bilateral ties have travelled downhill.After Nepal media prominently published the news with the date of the meeting, sources here confirmed the move.But they dressed the meeting as a routine monitoring of Indian projects being carried out in Nepal.“The scheduled oversight mechanism meeting between the Indian Ambassador in Kathmandu and Nepal’s Foreign Secretary on August 17 is part of a regular interaction between India and Nepal. This oversight mechanism was set up in 2016 to review ongoing bilateral economic and development projects, and meets on a periodic basis,” said the sources.This will be the eighth meeting of the Nepal-India Oversight Mechanism that could break the logjam since November when India released a new map that included areas claimed by Nepal.The embers were stoked by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurating a metal topped road in May this year which cut through those disputed areas.While Nepal kept pushing for a meeting at the Foreign Secretary level, India has fielded its Kathmandu envoy Vinay Mohan Kwatra who will meet Nepal Foreign Office Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi.Nepal media quoted Nepal Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali as saying, “We don’t have alternatives to talks. We can’t hold our entire ties hostage to the differences over the boundary issue.”The meeting will review the status of ongoing bilateral projects in areas of cross-border rail, roads, integrated check posts, bridges, irrigation, inundation and post-earthquake reconstruction, according to a statement from the Nepal Foreign Office.“For the time being, the boundary issues can be isolated. But sooner or later, we have to resolve them. Differences over one issue should not overshadow our entire bilateral relations. We have to move on. We believe in constructive engagement, and the upcoming meeting is just one positive step towards that end. We are confident that our partnership with India will move towards a positive direction,” added Gyawali while speaking with Nepali media.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-nepal-to-hold-ice-breaking-meet-next-week-125160

Defence personnel from the Army, Navy and the Air Force will march across the Mughal-era structure.Earlier the police had said a multi-layer security ring, including NSG snipers, elite SWAT commandos and kite catchers, will be placed around the Red Fort, from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on the 74th Independence Day.Over 350 Delhi Police personnel, who will be part of the guard of honour at Red Fort on Independence Day, have been quarantined as a precautionary measure, they had said.These personnel of the force of all ranks—from a constable to Deputy Commissioner of Police—have been quarantined at a newly built police colony in Delhi Cantonment.Flying of sub-conventional aerial platforms like para-gliders, para-motors, hang gliders, UAVs, micro light aircraft, remotely piloted aircraft, hot air balloons, small size powered aircraft, quadcopters or para-jumping from aircraft etc. are prohibited over the jurisdiction of National Capital Territory of Delhi up to August 15, police had said.The guest list is likely to be pruned and children wearing clothes resembling the Tricolour will be missing this year.However, there will be no change in the security arrangements and they will be as stringent as they are every year. The police personnel involved in frisking would also don personal protection equipment (PPE) kits, the police had said.The Independence Day event witnesses attendance of ministers, senior political leaders, top officials of different ministries and diplomats. Even the general public is allowed to attend.This time, however, there was also a proposal to not allow the general public at the event and instead have 1,500 corona warriors, including 500 police personnel who have recovered from the infection, attend it.The event at the Red Fort shall consist of a guard of honour by the armed forces and the Delhi Police to the prime minister, unfurling of the national flag and firing of the 21-gun salute, address by the PM, singing of the national anthem immediately after the speech and release of tricoloured balloons at the end.

This expert group will continue its engagement with all state governments and vaccine manufacturers in India,” said Health Ministry Secretary Rajesh Bhushan at a press briefing on Tuesday.He was responding to a question on whether India plans to tie up with Russia for procuring the vaccine which Moscow claims to have developed.Asked if the government was looking at at-risk funding for vaccine manufacturers and has estimated the number of doses required at least in the first six months, Bhushan said these issues have been engaging the attention of the Health Ministry for “quite some time now”.“We have consulted a large number of stakeholders and have also made certain projections, but it will be premature to share them with you as of now,” he added.“The Expert Committee on Vaccine Administration under the chairmanship of Dr V K Paul, NITI Aayog will meet on August 12 to consider logistics & ethical aspects of procurement & administration of COVID-19 vaccine,” the Health Ministry tweeted.Three vaccine candidates are in different stages of human clinical trials in India.The phase-1 and 2 human clinical trials of two of them, developed indigenously by Bharat Biotech, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research, and Zydus Cadila Ltd, are going on, Bhushan said.The Serum Institute of India has been permitted for conducting Phase 2 and 3 human clinical trials of the third vaccine candidate developed by the Oxford University. The Pune-based institute has partnered with AstraZeneca for manufacturing it.The phase 1 trial of the Oxford vaccine candidate in the UK is complete and phase 2 trials are going on in the UK and South Africa, while the phase-3 trial is underway in Brazil.The Serum Institute has said it has entered into a new partnership with international vaccine alliance Gavi and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to accelerate manufacturing and delivery of up to 100 million doses of vaccines for India and other low and middle-income countries. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-vaccine-panel-to-discuss-procurement-logistics-priority-groups-on-wednesday-125154

11-08-2020||New Delhi||AICC committee to look into all grievances, leadership issue in Rajasthan: Sachin Pilot||After nearly a month-long tussle with Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Tuesday said he has been assured that the AICC committee announced by the party to address his concerns, and that of the other aggrieved MLAs, will look into leadership issue in the state among other pending grievances.He also said that during his meeting with former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday, he had made no personal demands for any post and asserted that he has left it to the party to decide on his “future role”.After his meeting with Rahul and Priyanka, the Congress issued a statement, saying Pilot will work in the “interest of the Congress”, and a three-member committee will be set up to address his grievances and that of other aggrieved MLAs, signalling an “amicable resolution” of nearly a month-long Rajasthan crisis ahead of the crucial assembly session from August 14.In an interview to PTI, Pilot said the issues raised by him and the MLAs supporting him were not personal in nature.“It was about governance structures, delivery of promises, it was about collective and participative leadership in the state which we thought was not in line with what was expected of the Congress government,” the former Rajasthan deputy chief minister said.“Those issues we wanted to raise with the party leadership which we have, and I am happy and thankful to the Congress president (Sonia Gandhi) who has taken cognizance of these issues and will address all our grievances in a time bound manner through the committee which the AICC has announced,” he said.Asked what assurance was given to him by the party on key demands raised by the MLAs supporting him like problems in working under Gehlot’s leadership, Pilot said, “All pending issues, including leadership issue in Rajasthan, will be looked into by the committee”.              “I have raised those issues individually and collectively and the committee will take a call after reviewing all aspects. The roadmap for redressal is already in place. I just hope it is achieved as soon as possible,” Pilot said.Asked if he would be given a role in AICC by the party, the 42-year-old leader said he would be happy to do what is asked of him by the party, but asserted that he has worked hard in Rajasthan, and it was his “karmabhoomi”.“I leave it to the party to decide what is it that I need to do. I am committed to the people of Rajasthan, my constituents and the promises that I made to them,” he added.On the harsh words used by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot against him like “nikamma”, Pilot said, “I am also a human being, so I felt deeply sad and hurt when I heard the choice of words, but I chose not to respond in the same fashion because two wrongs don’t make a right”.  “I think in public life and in politics we have to maintain the dignity of discourse. One may oppose, one may not agree, one may have a difference of opinion but I think one should refrain from using un-parliamentary, derogatory and personal attacks sort of a language,” he said.For five long years he toiled in Rajasthan to form the government but all these negative qualities about him “were not seen, but now they are being talked about”,  he added.However, he said Gehlot is a very senior person and despite all that is being talked about, “I have nothing but regard and warmth to offer him”.Asked about allegations that he and MLAs supporting him enjoyed BJP’s “hospitality”, Pilot said that during the last few weeks a lot of “kite flying” was done, a lot of stories were planted and a lot of rumour mongering was done to give a “different colour” to our concerns.“From day one, I had said we are all Congress MLAs, we are firmly in the Congress party and I stand vindicated today,” he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aicc-committee-to-look-into-all-grievances-leadership-issue-in-rajasthan-sachin-pilot-125143
11-08-2020||New Delhi||AI pilot unions demand removal of DGCA chief Arun Kumar over Kozhikode plane crash comments||Two leading pilot unions of Air India on Tuesday said DGCA chief Arun Kumar must be immediately replaced with a suitable candidate with substantial knowledge of the aviation sector and operational experience as his comments on news channels reveal a total lack of technical know-how and an “amateurish view” of the Kozhikode plane crash.According to the Indian Commercial Pilots’ Union (ICPA) and Indian Pilots’ Guild (IPG), Kumar said during one of the televised interviews that the plane’s “landing was not smooth”.On another news channel, Kumar stated that the “two fellows are dead...and the landing it seems was not appropriate”, according to a letter jointly written by the two unions to Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday. Pilot-in-command Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe, 58, and co-pilot Captain Akhilesh Kumar, 32, were the ones operating the Air India Express flight with 190 that overshot the runway and crashed at the Kozhikode airport in Kerala on Friday night.Both pilots, along with 16 other people on board, died in the accident.Air India Express is a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India. The two deceased pilots were not part of either of the two aforementioned unions.The unions noted, “Whether a landing technique is appropriate or a contributory factor to a mishap can only be ascertained after a thorough, evidence backed investigation and not by speculative, casual remarks.”        The above remarks of Kumar on news channels only go to reveal his “total lack of technical knowledge and amateurish view of the unfortunate accident”, the letter noted.It is an established scientific fact that so-called “smooth” touchdowns may be counterproductive in certain adverse weather conditions and may pose a significant risk to safety, it stated.Puri, when he visited Kozhikode a day after the accident, told reporters that both the pilots were very experienced and “there is absolutely no doubt over their competence”.Puri said that Sathe, a former wing commander of the Air Force, was one of the most-experienced commanders with more than 10,000 flying hours and had landed aircraft 27 times at the Kozhikode airport.Kumar had a total flying experience of 1,723 hours.The unions requested Puri that “Arun Kumar IAS is immediately replaced with a suitable candidate with substantial aviation knowledge and operational experience, to serve the country as the Director General of Civil Aviation”.Air India Express on Tuesday said 74 passengers injured in the plane crash in Kozhikode have been discharged from hospital after “obtaining complete fitness”.

The Centre and states should jointly work to create better medical facilities in the country,” KCR added.Meanwhile, Telangana reported 1,896 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the state’s tally to 82,647 while eight more fatalities pushed the state’s death toll to 645.The number of active cases in Telangana is 22,628, of which 15,554 are under home or institutional isolation.Health authorities said about 84 per cent of people were put under home isolation as they were asymptomatic. Many other patients preferred treatment at home due to high charges by private hospitals and pathetic conditions in the government hospitals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-mulling-to-take-over-50-pc-beds-in-private-covid-19-hospitals-125139

She reiterated that the Central government owed “an overall outstanding due of Rs 53,000 crore” to the state.On the issue of vaccine, Mamata told the PM that Central government should formulate a guideline on which vaccine is to be procured and used.The chief minister also urged the prime minister to provide the state with more ventilators and more high flow nasal canulas.Besides West Bengal, the CMs of Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Punjab, Bihar, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh took part in the virtual meeting with the PM.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/89-per-cent-covid-deaths-in-west-bengal-is-due-to-co-morbidity-mamata-125111
11-08-2020||New Delhi||Kozhikode plane crash: DGCA to audit airports that witness heavy rains||The country’s aviation regulator DGCA will conduct a special audit of airports that receive heavy rains, senior officials have said on Tuesday, four days after a plane crashed at the Kozhikode airport amid the downpour.“The special audit will be done at airports like Mumbai and Chennai that are affected by heavy rains annually,” said a senior official of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).The Airports Authority of India (AAI) manages more than 100 airports in the country, including the one in Kozhikode. However, major airports such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad are managed by private companies.The Air India Express flight from Dubai with 190 people, including a six-member crew, overshot the tabletop runway during landing at the Kozhikode airport in heavy rains on Friday night. It fell into a valley 35 feet below and broke into pieces, killing 18 people, including both the pilots.The airline said on Tuesday that 74 passengers injured in the plane crash in Kozhikode had been discharged from hospitals after “obtaining complete fitness”.Also read: Kozhikode plane crash: Air India Express says 74 injured passengers discharged from hospitalsA day after the crash, Congress MP Manickam Tagore had tweeted that the AAI and the DGCA “seem to have ignored” the proposal for using Engineered Material Arrestor System (EMAS) technology to ensure the safety of Kozhikode airport’s tabletop runway.The AAI works under the Civil Aviation Ministry. The EMAS is a unique surface of special materials that is built at the end of the runway to stop the aircraft in its tracks if it has overshot the area while landing.Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Monday that the Kozhikode airport was equipped with the Runway End Safety Area (RESA) as per the safety guidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).He said the provision of EMAS was not mandatory in a civil airport as per the ICAO guidelines.Puri added that EMAS provided safety benefits if standard RESA length was not available at the airport or if RESA could not be provided at the airport due to some constraints.“Provision of EMAS at Mangalore and Kozhikode were examined by the AAI in consultation with the DGCA, subsequent to the Air India Express accident at Mangalore in 2010. Tabletop runways at both these airports are accordingly provided with RESA of 240 metres and 90 metres in compliance to the DGCA directive,” Puri said.

11-08-2020||New Delhi||Daughters have equal rights in joint Hindu family property: SC||Holding that daughters cannot be deprived of their right of equality, the Supreme Court Tuesday ruled that they will have equal coparcenary rights in joint Hindu family property even if the father died before the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act 2005.A three-judge bench of Justices Arun Mishra, S Nazeer and M R Shah said  the provisions contained in substituted Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, confer the status of coparcener on the daughter born before or after amendment in the same manner as a son with the same rights and liabilities.Coparcener is a term used for a person who assumes a legal right in parental property by birth only.The Bench said, “the rights can be claimed by the daughter born earlier with effect from September 9, 2005, with savings as provided in Section 6(1) as to the disposition or alienation, partition or testamentary disposition which had taken place before December 20, 2004. Since the right in coparcenary is by birth, it is not necessary that father coparcener should be living as on September 9, 2005.”              The verdict makes it clear the amendment to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, granting equal rights to daughters to inherit ancestral property would have retrospective effect.The apex court said the appeals on the issue were pending before different High Courts and subordinate courts and the matters have already been delayed due to legal imbroglio caused by conflicting decisions.“The daughters cannot be deprived of their right of equality conferred upon them by Section 6. Hence, we request that the pending matters be decided, as far as possible, within six months,” the bench said.The apex court’s verdict came on the issue whether the amendment to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 granting equal rights to daughters to inherit ancestral property would have retrospective effect.

It presently stands at 1.99 per cent. It is continuously declining,” Bhushan said.From 7.35 per cent on April 7, the recovery rate increased to 27.41 per cent on May 5. It further rose to 48.47 per cent on June 9 and stands at 69.80 per cent as on date, the official said.Also read: Single-day COVID cases dip below 55,000; recovery rate reaches almost 70 per centIndia’s single-day count of COVID-19 cases more than that of US, Brazil in past 7 days: WHO data“The case fatality rate, which was 3.33 per cent on June 18 and 2.72 per cent on July 10, has declined to 1.99 per cent as on date,” Bhusan said.Bhushan added that over 2.5 crore COVID-19 tests had been conducted in the country so far and India is currently conducting 18,320 tests per million population.“There are 24 states and Union territories which have better tests per million than the national average. Goa is conducting 94,773 tests per million population, while Delhi is performing 65,397 tests, Tamil Nadu 41,178, Andhra Pradesh 39,224, Karnataka 26,201, Maharashtra 21,968 and Rajasthan is conducting 19,327 tests per million population,” he said.The country also touched a new peak in testing by conducting 7,19, 364 tests on August 9, he said.The health secretary said according to the WHO guidelines, 140 COVID-19 tests per million population must be carried out in a day.“We are doing more than four times the ideal set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). India’s tests per day per million population stands at 506 and there are also states which are carrying more than the country's average. First three among them are Goa, Delhi and Tamil Nadu,” Bhushan said.“One important thing here is when you are conducting 140 tests per day per million, you also have to target that the positivity rate comes down to 10 per cent and then further to 5 per cent or less than that. In states where despite high testing, the positivity level remains high, we advise them that they should increase the number of tests and for a longer period continue to do so,” he said.The level of testing has to be seen in conjunction with the rate of positivity prevailing in a particular area, he said.With more patients recuperating and being discharged from hospitals and home isolation (in case of mild and moderate cases), the total recoveries have jumped to 15,83,489 with 47,746 patients getting discharged in a span of 24 hours, the Ministry said.“With a consistent and sustained increase in recoveries, the gap between recovered patients and active COVID-19 cases has reached nearly 9.5 lakh. India’s ‘test, track and treat’ strategy is showing the desired result — the gap between the percentage of recoveries and percentage of active cases of COVID-19 is growing every day,” the ministry said.Focus on improved and effective clinical treatment in hospitals, use of non-invasive, improved and coordinated services of ambulances for ferrying patients for prompt and timely treatment, had resulted in the seamless efficient management of COVID-19 patients, it said.“As a result, the case fatality rate (CFR) has been low when compared to the global average,” the ministry said.India’s COVID-19 caseload rose to 22,68,675 with 53,601 fresh cases being reported in a day while the death toll climbed to 45,257 with 871 people succumbing to the disease in a span of 24 hours, the Health Ministry data updated at 8 am on Tuesday showed.

It asked the parties to file their written submissions, if any, by Thursday.During the hearing, the Maharashtra and Bihar governments traded charges over the probe into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, with each accusing the other of political interference.Rhea Chakraborty, who is under probe in the case, too, expressed apprehension of bias, saying there was a considerable amount of state interference.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing Sushant’s father KK Singh, defended the Bihar government’s decision to hand over the probe to the CBI.“The larger picture is that I lost my son. Mumbai police don’t listen to me and took the probe to a completely different direction. My daughter could enter into the room where my son was found after the body was reportedly brought down. Nobody in my family has seen his body hanging,” KK Singh told a Bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy.He urged the court to put its seal of approval on the CBI probe, which was also demanded by Rhea sometime back.On behalf of the CBI, Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta said: “The only pending investigation is in Bihar. Whether it is valid or not...cannot be decided in a transfer petition.”He said the affidavit filed by Mumbai police used the word “investigation” without registering an FIR under the CrPC.“If it was just an inquest, there can’t be an investigation,” Mehta said, adding, an inquest proceeding could not be a substitute for an investigation.Mehta wondered how the Mumbai police could summon 56 persons and record their statements. “They can’t do it under an inquest proceeding and they never lodged an FIR,” he said, adding the statements were recorded unauthorised.He said since the Enforcement Directorate was already probing the case, another central agency — the CBI — should also be allowed to investigate.“The affidavit by Mumbai police shows a foregone conclusion that it was a suicide...Truth has to be elicited. An investigation must take place and it has to be fair, extensive and truth-eliciting. We don’t know if the petitioner (Rhea) is a witness, an accused, a complainant or a nobody in this case... but we can say that no case was pending in Mumbai when she filed her petition for transfer of the case in Patna,” Mehta said.But before Vikas Singh and Mehta made their submissions, senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing the Bihar government, and senior advocate AM Singhvi, appearing for the Maharashtra government, indulged in a legal slugfest over the investigation into the case.Senior advocate Shyam Divan told the court on behalf of Rhea that there was not only 00a considerable delay in filing the FIR but there was also state interference in the case.He said the Bihar FIR was registered at the behest of the Chief Minister and no fair probe could happen at the instance of the Bihar police.In her affidavit filed on Monday, Rhea had opposed the transfer of the Patna FIR against her by Sushant’s father to the CBI, saying she was being made “scapegoat of political agendas”.Bihar Government and Sushant’s father opposed her plea, saying her petition has become infructuous after the CBI took over the probe.Sushant’s father has also accused Rhea Chakraborty of giving drug overdose to Sushant.The Maharashtra government has opposed the registration of an FIR by Bihar police and its subsequent transfer to the CBI.Rhea, who had earlier demanded a CBI probe into Sushant’s unnatural death, changed her stand on the issue.Divan said instead of transferring the Patna FIR to the CBI, it should have been sent to Mumbai. It was for the Maharashtra government to take a call on sending the matter to the central agency, he added.Maninder Singh contradicted Divan, saying: “Political pressure is in Maharashtra and not in Bihar. Mumbai police are not cooperating. What are they hiding in this case?”Singhvi said Bihar didn’t have jurisdiction in the case at all.“You may have screaming headlines, screaming anchors, comments from everywhere but that does not change the law. The court should look at the law. It’s not about Mumbai police and Bihar police. It’s about federalism and jurisdiction,” Singhvi submitted.The victim’s family could not decide who should investigate the case, he added.“I have never seen this amount of sensationalism in a transfer petition. Every anchor and reporter has become an expert. Casualty is in the investigation and truth. I don’t know whether it was suicide but there is definite murder of the CrPC.” Singhvi said.Maninder Singh asked: “How many people were examined after June 25? The entire facade of undertaking an inquiry is entirely without jurisdiction. If you have to call anyone for an inquiry after you have filed post-mortem report, you must register an FIR.”Regarding Maharashtra’s allegation that Bihar filed an FIR after a delay, he said: “I (Bihar) registered the only FIR in this case as soon as I received a complaint. There is no delay by Bihar but there is a complete refusal by Maharashtra to register an FIR. Maybe there is political pressure in Maharashtra.”He said there was complete non-cooperation by the Mumbai police.“No documents have been shared. A senior officer of Bihar police sent to request Mumbai police to cooperate was virtually put under detention in the name of quarantine,” Maninder Singh told the top court.“Can I transfer something that I don’t own? Bihar is extremely generous in transferring something that it has no jurisdiction over,” Singhvi wondered.Referring to Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, he pointed out there was no consent of Maharashtra where the incident happened.“The only exception to state consent is if and when the Supreme Court of India comes to a conclusion that there are ‘extraordinary circumstances’, then the Supreme Court can transfer an investigation,” Singhvi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sushant-singh-rajputs-death-sc-reserves-order-on-rheas-plea-for-transfer-of-patna-fir-to-mumbai-125093

11-08-2020||United Nations||India sending more relief, humanitarian materials to explosion-hit Lebanon||India is sending more relief and humanitarian materials, including medicines and foodstuff, to Lebanon after a massive explosion last week devastated parts of Beirut, killing more than 160 people and injuring 6,000 others.India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti offered deep condolences on behalf of the Government and people of India to Lebanon on “this terrible human tragedy"."We are shocked by the loss of human lives and the widespread destruction this has caused in Beirut. We pray for strength to families to overcome their great loss,” Tirumurti said on Monday at a briefing on the humanitarian situation in Lebanon.Tirumurti said India just recently sent Lebanon essential medical items to combat COVID-19.“We are immediately sending more relief and humanitarian material of medicines, foodstuff and other essential items to do whatever we can to alleviate the difficulties on the ground. We are discussing with the Government of Lebanon on how we can contribute further,” he said.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also paid condolences to the families and loved ones of at least 160 people who were killed, and wished a full recovery to about 6,000 others injured in the explosion on August 4, which sent shockwaves across the bustling city of Beirut, bursting? out windows and shaking buildings.Tirumurti recalled that he had paid an official visit to the “beautiful city of Beirut” last year, and said it is difficult for him to imagine that this vibrant and bustling city has been affected by the blast. “I admire the resilience of the people and the dedication of the rescue workers to cope with this tragedy,” he said.India has had traditionally close and historical relations with Lebanon, including through Indian peacekeepers in the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Tirumurti said, adding that “I would like to express our solidarity with Lebanon at this juncture.” Guterres said almost a week after the blast, many people remain missing. Buildings were damaged for miles around the city of Beirut after 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in fertilisers, stored at the port for six years, reportedly caused the explosion.A plane carrying 20 tonnes of World Health Organisation health supplies landed in Beirut on Wednesday to cover 1,000 trauma interventions and 1,000 surgical interventions for people suffering from injuries and burns as a result of the blast.  Further, within hours of the blast, the Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon released USD 9 million from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund to address immediate needs. Last Friday, the Emergency Relief Coordinator released a further USD 6 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund.UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said the devastating impact of last week's tragedy makes it imperative for the international community to stand beside the people of Lebanon who have generously hosted thousands of refugees for years."We must respond by providing the necessary humanitarian assistance to alleviate the immediate suffering and to support the Lebanese people as they embark on the road to recovery. The needs are enormous and great.” --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-sending-more-relief-humanitarian-materials-to-explosion-hit-lebanon-125085
11-08-2020||New Delhi||Rhea tells SC there's considerable state interference in Sushant Rajput case, alleges bias||Actress Rhea Chakraborty told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that the FIR lodged in Bihar by late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's father against her in relation to his son's suicide has absolutely no connection with any offence in Patna. A bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy was told by senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the actress, that there appears to be considerable amount of state interference, influence and therefore an apprehension of bias.He referred to the timeline in the case and said that there was considerable delay of over 38 days in lodging of the FIR at Patna.Divan referred to the complaint by Rajput's father to police in Patna and said that all averments mentioned in the complaint are relatable to Mumbai. He said that Mumbai Police had recorded statements of 56 persons in the case and the probe has proceeded quite substantially. The hearing in the matter is going on.  On August 5, the top court had said that the truth behind the “unfortunate” death of the "gifted and talented artist" should come out.The Centre had apprised it of having accepted the Bihar government's recommendation for a CBI probe in the matter.The top court had directed Rajput's father Krishna Kishore Singh as also Bihar and Maharashtra to respond within three days to Chakraborty's plea seeking transfer of an FIR, accusing her of abetting the actor's suicide, from Patna to Mumbai.The 34-year-old Bollywood actor was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14.

11-08-2020||Vibha Sharma||Vasundhara Raje emerges 'winner' in BJP's Rajasthan loss as Gehlot survives Pilot crisis||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 11Congress rebel Sachin Pilot has finally returned home, just in time before the August 14 Assembly Session called by Governor Kalraj Mishra in Rajasthan.Apparently, it was Pilot's meeting with the Gandhis on Monday that clinched the deal for the reconciliation with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and survival of the Congress government in the state.Interestingly though, the development also followed the visit by former BJP CM Vasundhara Raje to Delhi and her meeting with the saffron party's who's who.This has given a reason for observers to believe that more than the Congress leadership, it is the "understanding and political acumen" of Raje and Gehlot, who between them have ruled Rajasthan for more than two decades now, that saved the day for the Congress in Rajasthan for now.Rajasthan has an interesting political quality. Before Raje and Gehlot, it were leaders like Bhairaon Singh Shekhawat of the BJP and Hardev Joshi and Shiv Charan Mathur of the Congress who dominated the political scene in the state.Observers say Pilot's rebellion could have ended the "partnership" between Raje and Gehlot provided he and BJP's Gajendra Singh Shekhawat played well. But it seems they underestimated Raje as well as Gehlot.The Congress imbroglio also brought into open factionalism and contours of different groups within the BJP.Raje refused to join the state leadership's plan to join forces with rebels. Maintaining  a low profile, she skipped meetings called by state president Satish Poonia. While poltics played in full force, Raje posted just one tweet saying the people of Rajasthan were paying the price for the Congress crisis.Ultimately, it all worked according to her. The BJP has 72 MLAs in the state and it seems more that 40 of them are allied to her.In her meetings with the top party leadership, including JP Nadda and Rajnath Singh, Raje is believed to have expressed displeasure over certain decisions taken by the state leaders. Sources said Raje was assured that she will be a part of any decision taken by the BJP regarding Rajasthan."Raje said she stands with the party but will not compromise on her self-respect," they said.Following this, Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria was told to bring back MLAs shifted to Gujarat to safeguard them “against poaching”.Even though BJP leaders insist that “it is just a matter of time” before the Gehlot government falls under its own weight, the imbroglio has shown who is the boss in Rajasthan.While Raje is known to hold her own against someone as powerful as Amit Shah, there also appears to be a clear “directive” from Nagpur that the person occupying the top post should be from the Sangh ‘parivar’, its background and ideology.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vasundhara-raje-emerges-winner-in-bjps-rajasthan-loss-as-gehlot-survives-pilot-crisis-125079
11-08-2020||New Delhi||DGCA suspends two senior executives of AirAsia India over safety violations||Aviation regulator DGCA has suspended two senior executives of AirAsia India for a period of three months over "safety violations", said a senior official on Tuesday.When asked about it, the airline's spokesperson said, "AirAsia India acknowledges the receipt of the notice from DGCA last month and has complied with the directions of the regulator and appointed interim post holders in accordance with the regulator's directions."  AirAsia India prioritises safety above all and it continues to engage with the authorities and exercise the option to appeal for redressal, the spokesperson added.In June this year, one of AirAsia India's former pilots -- who runs a YouTube channel called Flying Beast -- alleged violations of safety norms by the low-cost airline."We had issued a show-cause notice to two AirAsia India executives -- Head of Operations Manish Uppal and Head of Flight Safety Mukesh Nema -- in June only. It has been decided now to suspend them for a period of three months," the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official said.Captain Gaurav Taneja, a popular Youtuber, tweeted on June 14 that he has been suspended by AirAsia India "for standing up for safe operations of an aircraft and its passengers". On June 15, he posted a detailed video on YouTube titled "Reasons behind suspension from my pilot job".Taneja alleged in the video that the airline has asked its pilots to do 98 per cent of landings in "Flap 3" mode, which allows it to save fuel. He said if a pilot does not do 98 per cent of landings in "Flap 3" mode, the airline considers it a violation of its standard operating procedure (SOP).Flaps are part of wings of an aircraft and they are engaged to create drag during a landing or a take-off.Taneja gave the example of the Imphal airport, where the plane descends more steeply as compared to other airports when approaching for landing. He said when an aircraft is coming down steeply, it needs to have a drag so that it remains slow, and in these circumstances, a pilot has to do a "Flap full" landing."In order to achieve targets, what would people do? They will do Flap 3 landings without giving consideration whether it is safe or unsafe. This directly impacts the passenger safety," he had claimed in his YouTube video."If something happens during a Flap 3 landing, then the question would be asked to the pilot if he or she cares more about saving fuel or 180 passengers'' lives, Taneja had said.On June 15, the DGCA said on Twitter that it had taken note of the concerns raised by some stakeholders "against a particular airline and its approach to safety"."DGCA has already started an investigation into the issues flagged and shall take appropriate action based on the outcome of the said investigation," it added.Senior DGCA officials had confirmed on June 15 itself that AirAsia India was under investigation after Taneja's allegations.

But his cheap (phoohad) comments have left me disgusted. I would like to warn him that he should refrain him from talking such nonsense. Else I may consider slapping him with a case of defamation", said the MLA."He should be ashamed of using such language against an elderly person, that too who has been devastated by a tragedy", said Bablu referring to his 74 years old bereaved uncle, who has accused actress Rhea Chakraborty and her family members of abetting his sons suicide, subjecting him to mental torture and cheating him financially.The father made a request for handing over the matter to the CBI when Maharashtra governments insistence that Bihar had "no jurisdiction" in the matter led to a stalemate and things came to a flashpoint with a young IPS officer from Patna, who went to Mumbai for heading the investigation, was forcibly quarantined by municipal authorities there.The Centre promptly gave its assent to the recommendation for a CBI probe sent by the Nitish Kumar government, leaving the Shiv Sena, which heads the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, deeply annoyed.Meanwhile, the controversial remarks by Raut, whose partys president Uddhav Thackeray is the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, drew condemnation from political circles in Bihar cutting across party lines.While JD(U) leader Sanjay Singh, predictably, rubbished Raut's remarks and called him "mentally sick" (maansik roop se bimar), the opposition RJD, notwithstanding its alliance with the Congress which shares power in Maharashtra, accused the western state of trying to derail the investigation."It has been the Maharashtra governments attitude, since the very beginning, to divert the attention and thereby derail the investigation. The Shiv Sena leaders latest gimmicks are just another attempt in the same direction", said senior RJD leader Jayaprakash Narayan Yadav.

11-08-2020||Imphal||6 Congress MLAs in Manipur resign||Six Congress MLAs in Manipur have  submitted their resignation to the speaker, party legislator O Henry Singh said on Tuesday.They are among the eight Congress MLAs who defied a party whip on Monday and skipped the one-day session of the assembly, in which the BJP-led N Biren Singh government won a facile vote of confidence.Besides Henry Singh who is an MLA from the Wangkhei assembly segment, the legislators who have resigned are Oinam Lukhoi of Wangoi, Md Abdul Nasir of Lilong, Paonam Brojen of Wangjing Tentha, Ngamthang Haokip of Saitu, and Ginsuanhau of Singhat, he said.They cited the lack of trust in the leadership of O Ibobi Singh and said that due to him, the Congress failed to form the government even when it was the single largest party in the state.They were summoned by Speaker Yumnam Khemchand Singh after the assembly session on Monday night and their resignation letters were verified, Henry Singh said.The resignations were yet to be accepted by the speaker, he added.Henry Singh said they will resign from the membership of the party later in the day.Though the government's victory in the vote of confidence was a foregone conclusion, the absence of the eight Congress MLAs from the crucial session showed some astute political manoeuvering by the chief minister.The 60-member House has an effective strength of 53, including the speaker, who had the casting vote he could have used in the event of a tie.Four members had been disqualified earlier and three of the BJP resigned sometime back.The ruling coalition had 29 MLAs, including the speaker, while the Congress had 24, of whom eight abstained.With this victory, Biren Singh, buffetted by a string of desertions in the party, appeared to have consolidated his grip on the ruling coalition which has 18 BJP MLAs, four each of NPP and NPF, one each of the TMC, Lok Janshakti Party and an Independent.

She has been questioned for around 18-19 hours till now.Her father Indrajit Chakraborty and brother Showik have also been questioned for varied lengths of time earlier.The ED is also expected to question one of Rajput's three sisters in this case on Tuesday or Wednesday.Rhea, her family and a friend of Rajput are expected to be called in for questioning again.The ED had also questioned the chartered accountants (CAs) of Rhea and Rajput and the deceased actor's house manager Samuel Miranda in the past.The agency is understood to have questioned Rhea, who stated in her petition to the Supreme Court that she was in a live-in relationship with Rajput, about her friendship with the late actor, business dealings and the developments that took place over the last few years between them.The ED's line of questioning, officials said, is revolving around Rhea's income, investments, business and professional deals, and links.Also, under the ED's scanner is a property located in the city's Khar area and another in Raigad district of the state, both linked to Rhea, for the source of purchase and ownership.Agency sources have said they "want more answers" from Rhea over the alleged mismatch between her income, expenditure and investments.They said while Rhea has filed Income Tax Returns stating an income of about Rs 18 lakh in the recent past, the value of her investments is reportedly higher.Her father, they said, is a retired defence personnel who gets a pension of around Rs one lakh per month.The sources said Rhea told the agency that she had made the property investments from her income, savings and has also taken bank loans.Rhea has been accused by Rajput's father of abetting his son's suicide and she had initially refused to appear before the agency citing her appeal pending before the Supreme Court that is slated to be heard on Tuesday.Her lawyer Satish Maneshinde had said Rhea is a law-abiding citizen and would cooperate with the probe.She has filed a petition in the apex court requesting that the case lodged by the Bihar Police against her be transferred to the Mumbai police.Rhea, through her lawyer, also shared a picture of a note on Saturday which she claimed was written by Rajput to express his gratitude towards her and her family.She also shared a photograph of a water sipper, which is a piece of movie merchandise from Rajput's 2019 film "Chhichhore"."The only property of Sushant that I possess," she said in a message sent along with the photo to the media.The ED, during the questioning sessions, is learnt to have confronted Rhea, Showik and Modi with certain bank statements that purportedly show transfer of small amounts into Showik's accounts from those of Rajput and Chakraborty.Rajput's 74-year-old father K K Singh, who resides in Patna, had on July 25 filed a complaint with the Patna police against Rhea, her parents (including mother Sandhya Chakraborty), Showik, Rajput's manager Samuel Miranda, Shruti Modi and unknown persons accusing them of cheating and abetting his son's suicide.The CBI had re-registered this FIR as a fresh case on Thursday and named as accused the same people.Singh also alleged financial irregularities in bank accounts of his son.In the complaint, Singh alleged that an amount of Rs 15 crore was siphoned off from Rajput's bank account in one year to accounts of persons not known or connected to the late actor.Under the ED's scanner are also at least two companies linked to Rajput and some financial deals involving Rhea, her father and Showik, who are stated to be directors in these companies.

11-08-2020||Chandigarh||Amid stand-off with China, ITBP to buy 358 silencer-fitted sniper rifles||As the stand-off with China continues along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force (ITBP) has moved to purchase new sniper rifles for its field units.The ITBP has projected a requirement for 358 sniper rifles with detachable sound suppressors as standard equipment. "On August 10, the force floated a global tender for procuring the new weapons,” said an ITBP officer.The force’s requirement is a 7.62 x 51 mm bolt action rifles with an effective killing range of 800 meters, and above, and fitted with integrated telescopic sights for daylight as well as low light conditions. These should be able to function effectively in temperatures up to minus 30 degree Celsius.Of its 56 service battalions, 32 are deployed for border guarding duties along the Himalayan frontier with China, manning 180 border outposts at altitudes ranging from 9,000 feet to 18,750 feet. These units were reinforced during the current stand-off and asked to step up their surveillance and monitoring activities. At present, the ITBP is using the Austrian SSG-69 bolt action rifle, a highly accurate and widely used weapon, as its standard sniper platform. The highly regarded Russian Druganov semi-automatic rifle, based upon the AK-47, is also in use. Snipers prefer single-shot bolt action rifles over semi-automatic as they are considered to be more accurate and reliable. According to an officer, bolt action rifles are not only lighter and simpler but also have lesser number of moving parts and internal mechanisms than gas-operated semi-automatics. Moreover, snipers do not require a high rate of fire, for which semi-automatic and automatic weapons are designed, as one or two shots are sufficed for a trained marksman to meet his objective.Snipers are considered to be force multipliers and many armies attach a great deal of importance to the role of snipers in the field. A single sniper can neutralize a high-value target or pin down a body of enemy troops for a considerable length of time. Much of a sniper’s work involves observation, surveillance and intelligence gathering. Snipers require a very high degree of training, enormous levels of patience and quick reactions. Every force has a dedicated institute and special courses for snipers. In the ITBP, this job is entrusted to the Support Weapons Training School co-located with the Support Battalion at Karera in Madhya Pradesh. The Army too was going in for new sniper rifles to replace the Druganov. Last year, it began inducting Italian Beretta and American Barrett weapons in units deployed along the Line of Control. Though the Army, which uses several types of sniper rifles, had a requirement of about 5,700 such weapons, late last year the procurement was reduced by about 70 per cent due to budgetary constraints. This month, 7.62 mm sniper rifles were among 101 items placed on the import embargo list by the Ministry of Defence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-stand-off-with-china-itbp-to-buy-358-silencer-fitted-sniper-rifles-125042

Gandhi said.He also shared a graph showing an increase in MGNREGA demand.During the lockdown period in the wake of the COVID-19 situation in the country, the Congress repeatedly demanded that the government deposit a sum of Rs 7,500 in all Jan Dhan accounts, all pension accounts and all PM-Kisan accounts to help the poor and vulnerable tide over the crisis.Ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, the Congress had proposed, and promised to implement the NYAY (Nyuntam Aay Yojana) scheme if voted to power.

The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has set a September deadline to conclude the process. Sources said complaints by fringe Naga groups were made only to derail the peace process, as insurgency in Nagaland serves their economic purposes, of which Ravi has taken a “stern view” and measures had been taken to curb insurgent groups’ practice of collecting “extra-constitutional levies” from business entities in the state. The sources said the Governor was coming to the national capital to resume negotiations in view of the health issues being faced by 86-year-old NSCN (IM) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah, who is undergoing treatment at a hospital in New Delhi. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/peace-talks-with-naga-groups-resume-today-124894

Hopefully, from next year there will be ample availability of water and fodder so that elephants do not have to venture out in search of food,” Javadekar said, releasing a compendium on best practices of human-elephant conflict management in India on the eve of World Elephant Day. Every year, human-elephant conflicts result in the death of around 500 humans, damage to thousands of houses and millions of hectares of crops. Over 100 elephants die due to human-related activities like poaching for ivory or meat, poisoning, electrocution and collision with trains, according to the report. A reminder of such a conflict came recently when a pregnant wild elephant died after eating a fruit stuffed with firecrackers, leading to public outrage. The minister said India was taking up the ambitious fodder and water augmentation in jungle areas using the LIDAR-based survey technology. The work will start in December, following which next year there would be plenty of food and water available and reduction in human-animal conflict.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/500-humans-100-jumbos-die-in-conflict-every-year-report-124895

We will consider all those suggestions and then will come out with a final draft,” he said.Ramesh again accused Javadekar of “misrepresenting the implications and impacts of the notification”.

Had tensions not cropped up at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), a RIC summit during a G-20 heads of government (HoGs) meeting would not have been out-of-ordinary because the previous two G-20 meets had also seen RIC summits that were unremarkable footnotes from the diplomatic point of view.Lavrov said the July RIC Foreign Ministers’ meet had also touched on expanding the format to include trilaterals among Defence Ministers.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has kept its cards close to the chest in the matter. It had chosen not to respond to Lavrov’s initial call to hold a RIC summit. It publicly acquiesced to a RIC Foriegn Ministers’ meet as the event served as an ice-breaker after the Galwan Valley clash.While Russia’s intention is to keep alive its project of a trilateral of Eurasian powers, China has backed its proposals for such arrangement in order to minimise the damage to its economic interests in India after the LAC clash.Speaking to the media last week, MEA official spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had spoken of a “full calendar” of events with Russia, including several multilateral meetings.These include the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and BRICS Foreign Ministers’ meetings in which both Russia and China are also present.India has already borrowed nearly $3 billion from China-led banks to combat the Covid pandemic.The middle path||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kremlin-renews-push-for-modi-xi-putin-trilateral-124893

Party chief Sonia Gandhi spoke to Gehlot this evening and decided to set up a three-member panel comprising Priyanka Gandhi, Ahmed Patel and KC Venugopal to “address the issues raised by Pilot and the aggrieved MLAs”. Pilot met the panel members late in the evening.What was immediately clear was that CM Gehlot had succeeded in the battle of nerves with young Pilot, who ran out of options and decided to return.As Pilot bought peace with the Congress, rebel party lawmakers began returning to Jaipur today and meeting Gehlot, who recently said he would do whatever the central leadership decided in respect of dissidents.The first rebel to resurface in Jaipur late tonight after days of staying at a resort in BJP-ruled Haryana was Bhanwar Lal Sharma.Sharma’s name figures in the FIR which the Rajasthan Congress recently lodged, alleging the MLA’s presence in audio tapes, which also features one Gajendra Singh discussing horse-trading in the state. The Congress has been alleging that Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat figured in the tapes, a charge the latter had rubbished.This development paves the way for stability of the Gehlot-led Congress government in the state, with the party regaining the original strength of 107 MLAs in the 200-member House.These 107 MLAs include six former BSP MLAs, who last year merged their legislative party with the Congress.On the political front, the Congress scored two points by pushing Pilot to a corner and forcing him to return today. One, it prevented another young leader from going to the BJP; two, it sent out a message that dissidence won’t be condoned.Even as it played firm, the top Congress leadership had kept doors open for Pilot and his loyalists. Asked if Pilot, who was sacked as state Deputy CM and party chief after he missed two CLP meetings in Jaipur, would be reinstated, a top Congress functionary said “no”. Pilot’s previous demand to remove Gehlot stands buried with the CM emerging stronger in the fight with his rival.He managed to keep party MLAs together and foiled any attempt to dislodge him. Pilot and 18 other rebel MLAs had been fighting the Congress in the High Court for a month, challenging the Assembly Speaker’s disqualification notices to them under the anti-defection law.Though the Pilot camp secured a stay from the HC, Gehlot moved strategically to call an Assembly session to take a trust vote. The plan of calling the Assembly and seeking a trust vote was key to the Congress strategy of taking the steam out of rebel MLAs, who would have faced disqualification in the House had they defied the whip to vote for the Gehlot government.Also, rebel MLAs had started to dither of late and some were in touch with Gehlot as nothing concrete was coming their way after Pilot’s original plan to secure the support of 30 rebel MLAs fell flat. “I told you I won’t join the BJP. My stand has been vindicated today,” said Pilot.It remains to be seen now as to how Pilot reconciles with Gehlot, who called him “nikamma, nakaara” in public. AICC sources didn’t rule out a central organisational role for Pilot. As part of the Pilot-Congress truce, the Rajasthan Congress will withdraw all cases against rebels and accommodate some should Gehlot agree to a state Cabinet reshuffle later.Ex-dy CM may be moved to central hierarchyA top Congress leader ruled out reinstatement of Sachin Pilot as state Deputy CM and party chief.

The top court had earlier already refused to stay the UGC’s decision.As Mehta said UGC would like to respond to the affidavits filed by Delhi and Maharashtra, the Bench posted the petitions challenging the UGC’s directive to conduct university examinations by September 30 for further hearing on August 14.Petitioners contended the July 6 UGC guideline for holding final-year examinations were illegal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/degrees-invalid-if-no-exams-held-ugc-124897

Media Channels are examining and cross-examining all the witnesses in the case,” Rhea submitted. She is being investigated by the CBI as an accused and the ED too has interrogated her.Alleging that the issue was being exploited for political mileage in the Bihar poll due in November, she told the top court that “she should be protected and not be made scapegoat of political agendas”.“The sad incident of the death of Sushant, who hailed from Bihar, unfortunately occurred just before the elections in Bihar. This has led to the issue being blown out of proportion. Actors Ashutosh Bhakre (32) and Sameer Sharma (44) also reportedly committed suicide, yet no whisper about the same in power corridors. In Sushant’s case, the Bihar Chief Minister is reported to be responsible for registration of FIR in Patna,” she said. The affidavit has been filed ahead of the hearing of her petition seeking transfer of an FIR registered in Patna against her to Mumbai later this week.Rhea said, “The petitioner (she) is already convicted by the media even before a foul play in the Sushant’s death is established.” Rhea also complained of violation of her right to privacy.The Enforcement Directorate, meanwhile, began a fresh round of questioning of Rhea and her family members in the laundering case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rhea-moves-sc-over-media-trial-124899
