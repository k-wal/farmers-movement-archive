However, due to COVID-19, their delivery has been delayed by a few weeks.During the travel of the VVIPs, the two B777 aircraft will be operated by pilots of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and not of Air India, an official said.Currently, the president, vice president and the prime minister, fly on Air India’s B747 planes, which have the call sign “Air India One”.Air India pilots fly these B747 aircraft for the dignitaries and the Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL) maintains them.When these B747 aircraft are not flying the dignitaries, they are used by the Indian national carrier for commercial operations.The new planes will be used for travel of the dignitaries only. These two aircraft were part of Air India’s commercial fleet for a few months in 2018 before they were sent back to Boeing for retrofitting them for VVIP travel.The B777 planes will have state-of-the-art missile defence systems called Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) and Self-Protection Suites (SPS).In February, the US agreed to sell the two defence systems to India at a cost of USD 190 million.The Centre has already initiated the process of divestment of its stake in Air India, which has a debt of over Rs 60,000 crore. However, the process has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

25-08-2020||New Delhi||Pulwama probe: NIA used DNA, other forensic tests to trace evidence that had ‘blown to pieces’||When the National Investigation Agency (NIA) began its probe into the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed last year, it faced a “blind case” in the absence of any solid proof against the perpetrators.The case posed unique challenges, such as a lot of evidence having blown to pieces in the suicide attack and seven accused being subsequently killed in encounters. However, the central agency used forensic tests, including DNA profiling of the meagre evidence, to breach the dead ends.“It was a blind case for us. There were a lot of murmurs but everything needs to be established beyond doubt in the court of law,” a senior official, who was part of the probe, said.The first challenge was to establish the ownership of the car used by Adil Ahmad Dar, the suicide bomber, according to the chargesheet in the case filed by the NIA in a special court in Jammu on Tuesday.There was nothing available from the vehicle which carried a cocktail of 200 kg of high-grade explosives — RDX, Calcium-Ammonium Nitrate, Gelatin Sticks and Aluminium Powder.As per the chargesheet, with the help of forensic methods and painstaking investigations the serial number of the car that was blown into pieces beyond recognition was extracted and within no time the ownership of the vehicle was established—from the first to the last owner.However, the last owner of the car, Sajjad Bhat (named in the chargesheet) of Bijbehara in Anantnag district, had disappeared hours before the February 14, 2019 attack and joined Jaish-e-Mohammed. He was subsequently killed in an encounter in June last year.“While it was clear that the suicide attacker was Adil Ahmed Dar but the same had to be established with evidence. After picking up human remains from various spots, they were sent for DNA profiling,” the official, who requested anonymity, said.“The suicide attacker was identified and confirmed by matching the DNA extracted from the meagre car fragments with that of the DNA of his father,” he said.Moreover, seven accused wanted in the case by the NIA were killed during different encounters in 2019.The chargesheet has named Mohammed Umar Farooq, the nephew of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar, as the main conspirator of the suicide mission. According to officials, Farooq had infiltrated into India in April 2018 and was subsequently killed in one of the encounters in South Kashmir last year. Officials said the role of conspirators which included Mudasir Ahmed Khan, Qari Mufti Yasser and Mohd Kamran came to light but all of them were killed in different encounters with security forces.Khan was killed on March 10, Kamran on March 29, Sajjad Bhat on June 18 of last year while Qari Yasser was shot in an encounter on January 25 this year.A team led by joint director of the NIA Anil Shukla gathered evidences and statements of terrorists and their sympathisers arrested in different cases in order to expose the conspiracy hatched for executing the audacious attack on the para-military convoy, officials said.After JeM spokesperson Mohd Hassan in a video claimed that his group was responsible for the attack, it was sent for forensic examination and the Internet Protocol address was traced to a computer based in Pakistan.“A lot of digital, forensic, documentary and oral evidence establishing a fool-proof case against the accused for this dastardly and barbaric attack has been collected,” NIA Deputy Inspector General and spokesperson Sonia Narang said. “The charge-sheet has brought on record the all-out involvement of Pakistan-based entities to carry out terrorist strikes in India and to incite and provoke Kashmiri youth,” she said.Culminating its 18-month long probe into the fatal terror attack that left 40 CRPF personnel dead in South Kashmir last year, the NIA on Tuesday filed a chargesheet in a special court in Jammu against 19 people including Masood Azhar, the chief of banned terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed, for planning the suicide operation.Giving details of the 13,500-page chargesheet, Narang said the chargesheet marks the culmination of a year-and-a-half long “painstaking and meticulous investigation with valuable inputs received from other central and state government agencies as well as foreign law-enforcement agencies. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pulwama-probe-nia-used-dna-other-forensic-tests-to-trace-evidence-that-had-blown-to-pieces-131298
25-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi panel to summon Fb officials; initiates proceedings on ‘hateful content’ issue||A Delhi Assembly panel on peace and harmony, on Tuesday, decided to summon Facebook officials as it initiated proceedings over complaints about the social media giant’s alleged “deliberate and intentional inaction to contain hateful content” in India, an official statement said.The development comes in the backdrop of a report published in the Wall Street Journal recently, citing interviews with unnamed Facebook insiders to claim that one of its senior India policy executives intervened in internal communication to stop a permanent ban on a BJP MLA from Telangana after he allegedly made communally charged posts.“It was unanimously decided by the committee, upon the revelations and insights gathered by the witnesses, that Facebook officials must be called upon to carry out a painstaking investigation into the allegations made by the complainants which were supported by the witnesses as well as the depositions of key witnesses summoned,” the statement said.The committee would “soon issue notices to top officials of Facebook” to examine them on record, it said.During depositions by “expert witnesses” and some journalists at the proceedings, panel chairman and AAP MLA Raghav Chadha, asked a range of questions over the alleged “Facebook BJP relationship”, hateful content and the role of social media in “aggravating” riots in Delhi earlier this year.Witnesses Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, a senior journalist and co-author of the book ‘The Real Face of Facebook in India’, and Nikhil Pahwa, a digital rights activist, gave their expert opinion on the alleged accusations raised in the complaints received by the assembly panel against Facebook.Last week, senior BJP leader and Union Law and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said that it was for Facebook to decide what to do as far as the new report in the Wall Street Journal is concerned.He had said that hundreds of pages of BJP supporters were also removed by Facebook.Meanwhile, the parliamentary standing committee on Information Technology has also summoned Facebook on September 2 to discuss the issue of alleged misuse of social media platforms.Earlier, Facebook had said its social media platform prohibits hate speech and content that incites violence and these policies are enforced globally without regard to political affiliation.“We prohibit hate speech and content that incites violence and we enforce these policies globally without regard to anyone’s political position or party affiliation. While we know there is more to do, we’re making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits of our process to ensure fairness and accuracy,” a Facebook spokesperson had said.

25-08-2020||New Delhi||India deploys troops with shoulder-fired missiles in key areas in eastern Ladakh||The Indian Army has further bolstered its combat readiness in eastern Ladakh by deploying troops with shoulder-fired missiles in several sensitive areas in the backdrop of increasing activities by Chinese helicopters in the region, official sources have said on Tuesday.“These missiles have a range of two to five km and they are capable of bringing down low flying helicopters and aircraft,” they added.The deployment of a sizeable number of troops with shoulder-fired missiles came as part of India’s overall approach to significantly ramp up combat capabilities of the Army and the Indian Air Force (IAF) in eastern Ladakh.There had been an increase in activities by the Chinese Air Force in the region in the past few weeks following which the Army had decided to deploy troops with shoulder-fired missiles, the sources said.The Indian Army has significantly increased deployment of troops and weaponry, including tanks and artillery guns, in various sensitive sectors along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the past few weeks.The IAF has also significantly enhanced deployment of its frontline jets, attack helicopters and transport fleet in all its key bases guarding the airspace along the LAC.It has enhanced deployment of its air defence systems in the region.The IAF has already moved a sizeable number of its frontline fighter jets including Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft to several key air bases, including Leh and Srinagar.It has also deployed Apache attack choppers and Chinook heavy-lift helicopters to transport troops to various forward locations.The frontline fighter jets have increased their sorties in Ladakh and nearby areas.India and China have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks in the last two-and-half months but no significant headway has been made in resolution of the border row in eastern Ladakh.The formal process of disengagement of troops began on July 6, a day after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tensions in the area.However, the process has not moved forward since mid-July.The Chinese People’s Liberation Army has pulled back from Galwan Valley and certain other friction points but the withdrawal of troops has not moved forward in Pangong Tso, Depsang and a couple of other areas, sources said.In the five rounds of Corps Commander-level talks, the Indian side has been insisting on complete disengagement of Chinese troops at the earliest and immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to April.Even as both sides have been engaged in diplomatic and military talks, the Indian Army is making elaborate preparations to maintain its current strength of troops in all key areas in eastern Ladakh in the harsh winter months.

25-08-2020||New Delhi||No need to be alarmed immensely over COVID-19 reinfection case reported in Hong Kong: ICMR||The apex health research body, ICMR, on Tuesday said there is "no need to be alarmed immensely" over the reinfection case of COVID-19 reported in Hong Kong, but at the same time maintained that it is not yet known how long the immunity lasts in case of coronavirus.At a press briefing, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director-General Balram Bhargava said the Hong Kong case is a stray example and the reinfection can depend upon various factors."We have read with interest the reports of reinfection in one case in Hong Kong. We are learning more and more about the disease as we go ahead. It can depend on several factors, one can be related to the patient itself, how is his immunity, how was his immune status, was it compromised. It can also depend upon the virus, whether the virus has mutated or turned virulent," he said.However, only one case of re-infection has been reported and it is very rare for viral infections, he said.Citing the example of measles, he said once it affects, it gives lifelong immunity. But rarely does one can get the measles a second time."Similarly, this is a stray example, but for this disease, we are trying to find out. We need to find out how long the immunity lasts. We need to closely follow it up, but at the same time we don't need to be alarmed immensely about it," Bhargava said.University of Hong Kong scientists have reportedly claimed to have the first evidence of someone being reinfected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after genetic tests showed that a 33-year-old man returning from a trip to Spain in mid-August had a different strain of the coronavirus than the one he was found infected with in March.On patients facing post-COVID complications like respiratory and heart problems, Union Health Ministry Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said a group of experts is presently working on a guidance note for people who have recovered from COVID-19 including possible complications that may arise and how to address them. He said the technical committee of domain knowledge experts, known as a joint monitoring group (JMG) in the health ministry headed by the DGHS, is working on the guidance note.The committee consists of domain knowledge experts from different central government hospitals, AIIMS, New Delhi, WHO India office and even experts from outside the government.To finalise the document, the JMG is obtaining data of the recovered patients, specifically of those who have come back with certain complications and then have been treated, from central government hospitals and AIIMS across the country.India's COVID-19 tally rose to 31,67,323 on Tuesday, while recoveries surged to 24,04,585 pushing the recovery rate to 75.92 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data.The death toll climbed to 58,390 with 848 fatalities being reported in  24 hours, the data updated at 8 AM showed.  Replying to a query, Bhargava said, "I would say irresponsible and less cautious people who are not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing are driving the pandemic in India."

25-08-2020||New Delhi||PNB receives Rs 24 cr from US bankruptcy proceedings of 3 Nirav Modi-promoted companies: MCA||The Ministry of Corporate Affairs on Tuesday said Punjab National Bank had received over Rs 24 crore as the first tranche of recoveries from bankruptcy proceedings of three Nirav Modi-promoted companies in the US.In 2018, the lender had informed the Ministry that three companies promoted by Nirav Modi — Firestar Diamond, Inc; A Jaffee, Inc; and Fantasy, Inc — had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of New York, the United States.The bank had also requested the Ministry to support and join the bankruptcy proceedings in New York in order to help PNB realise its claims in the debtors’ assets, the Ministry said in a release.According to the release, Punjab National Bank has informed the Ministry, which spearheaded the corporate governance litigation in a foreign jurisdictional court, that it had received $3.25 million (equivalent of Rs 24.33 crore) as the first tranche of recoveries.“Upon liquidation of the debtors’ assets by the US Chapter 11 Trustee, a sum of $11.04 million (equivalent of Rs 82.66 crore) is available for distribution to unsecured creditors, including PNB. Further recovery therefrom is subject to other expenses and settlement of claims of other claimants,” it added.Further, the release said the “maiden repatriation of $3.25 million is an unprecedented achievement of the Government of India and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in its fight against corporate fraud in the overseas territory.”The Ministry also has initiated proceedings for disgorgement of monies from the perpetrators — the entities promoted and/or controlled by fugitive jewellers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi.In an order dated July 26, the US Bankruptcy Court of Southern District of New York recognised the claims of the bank in the proceeds of the sale of assets of the properties of the debtor companies.It also authorised the bank to issue subpoenas to compel the examination of Nirav Modi, Mihir Bhansali and Rakhi Bhansali under oath, the release said.On August 24, 2018, the examiner appointed by the New York Bankruptcy Court submitted his report.“The report explains the modus operandi of the fraud and the manner in which the US-based employees of the debtors participated in the fraud. One prominent feature of the fraud was the apparent facade of independent companies, which were, in reality, entities promoted and/ or controlled by Nirav Modi, that engaged in 'round-tripping' of the diamonds amongst themselves,” the release said.Nirav Modi had perpetrated an over $2 billion worth financial scam at the Punjab National Bank.He is lodged in a UK jail after being arrested in London in March 2019 and is currently fighting extradition to India.He was declared a fugitive economic offender by a Mumbai court earlier this year. The court had also ordered the confiscation of his assets.

Besides the common need for tranquillity to allow both countries to develop and a history of high level bilateral engagements, Sun drew solace from the fact that both sides were currently working to properly handle an “unfortunate incident” that happened in the border areas.The Chinese Ambassador wanted both sides to take a long-term perspective instead of being focused on “a brief moment from the perspective of history” which was his term for the Galwan Valley clash that claimed the lives of 20 Indian soldiers.Sun was part of the Chinese team that had accompanied then Prime Minister Atal Vajpayee 17 years ago to the White Horse Temple in Luoyang, Henan Province. The 2,000-year-old temple was the first official temple after Buddhism spread eastward from India to China. In 2010, he accompanied then President Pratibha Patil to the temple for its inauguration after being renovated in Indian style.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hope-to-turn-the-corner-with-india-chinese-envoy-131286

The police station in-charge of Phephna, Shashi Mauli Pandey, has been suspended and efforts are on to nab the remaining accused, the ASP said. The ASP said that the journalist’s father, Vinod Singh, alleged that Sonu Singh of the same village had called his son at around 8 pm and invited him to his house where the accused were waiting with lathis and a revolver and they killed Ratan Singh.Meanwhile, the Ballia Working Journalist Union has demanded an ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore and a government job for the wife of the deceased.Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar had stated on Monday night that Ratan Singh had a property dispute with his neighbour and after a fight between the two, he was shot at.“Accused Dinesh Singh is parcener (pattidar) of Ratan Singh. The reason of the fight, which led to murder of the journalist is old enmity and property dispute with the neighbour,” the senior police officer said.He categorically stated that Ratan Singh’s killing had nothing to do with him being a journalist.“Action under the National Security Act and Gangster Act will also be ensured against the accused,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-journalists-murder-police-officer-suspended-6-arrested-131261

25-08-2020||Mumbai||MGNREGA monthly wages double to Rs 1,000 per person amid pandemic: Report||The rural distress following the pandemic has seen the average monthly income per person under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, (MGNREGA) doubling to around Rs 1,000 in the first four months of the fiscal from Rs 509 in FY2020, according to an analysis by Crisil.The April-July period typically sees around 25 per cent more work execution in terms of person-days under the scheme compared to the rest of the year, thereby aiding rural income.This is understandable as tens of millions of workers have returned home jobless from cities due to the pandemic-driven lockdowns.“This fiscal, however, these four months saw a growth of 46 per cent on-year in person-days, coupled with an increase of 12 per cent in average wage under the scheme thanks to the pandemic, which has pushed urban labourers back into their villages," says the report. The scheme has a mandate of providing at least 100 days of jobs in a financial year to every rural household.The budget for 2020-21 has allocated Rs 61,500 crore for the scheme and later the government increased it by Rs 40,000 crore amid the pandemic to support the rural economy. Of the total of Rs 1,01,500 crore, Rs 11,500 crore has to be spent on clearing pending dues of fiscal 2020, leaving Rs 90,000 crore for the current fiscal.Even after considering the revised allocation, more than 50 per cent of the funds have been spent in the first four months of the fiscal.The scheme has seen higher demand in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Odisha and Gujarat, where work allocation has increased more than 50 per cent on-year in the first four months.The maximum increase in absolute payout was seen in Andhra where it more than doubled to Rs 1,340 from Rs 533 during the reporting period, followed by Odisha where it increased to Rs 1,121 from Rs 421 and in Karnataka where it jumped to Rs 1,088 from Rs 593, Haryana at Rs 1,075 from Rs 600, Gujarat at Rs 1,031 from Rs 507 and UP where it rose to Rs 1,004 from Rs 576.

25-08-2020||Mumbai||Only first wife of man entitled to lay claim on his money: HC||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday said as per law, if a man has two wives and both lay claim to his money, only the first wife would be entitled for it but his children from both marriages would get the money.A Bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar made the above observation orally after the state government submitted that there existed a previous full Bench judgement of the high court’s Aurangabad Bench that gave a similar direction.The Bench led by Justice Kathawalla was hearing a petition filed by the second wife of Suresh Hatankar, an assistant sub-inspector in the Maharashtra Railway Police Force who died of COVID-19 on May 30.As the state government’s resolution promises a compensation of Rs 65 lakh to police personnel who die of COVID-19 while on duty, two women, both claiming to be Hatankar’s wives, had laid a claim to the compensation amount.Later, Shraddha, Hatankar’s daughter from his second wife, approached the Bombay High Court, seeking that she be given a proportionate share of the compensation amount to save her and her mother from “starvation” and homelessness.On Tuesday, state’s counsel Jyoti Chavan told the Bench that the state would deposit the compensation amount in the court for the time that HC takes to decide who is entitled to the amount.Chavan also informed the court about the judgement of the Aurangabad Bench.The court then said, “The law says that the second wife might not get anything. But the daughter from the second wife, and the first wife and the daughter from the first marriage will be entitled to the money.”Hatankar’s first wife Shubhada and the couple’s daughter Surbhi, who were present before the court through video-conferencing, claimed they were not aware that Hatankar had “another family”.However, Shraddha’s counsel Prerak Sharma told the court that Surbhi and Shubhada knew about Hatankar’s two marriages and they had contacted Surbhi on Facebook on previous occasions.Sharma also said that Hatankar had been living with his second wife and their daughter in the railway police quarters allotted to him in Dharavi.The high court, therefore, directed Hatankar’s first wife and her daughter to file an affidavit by Thursday, clarifying if they knew Hatankar had two families.The court posted the matter for hearing on Thursday.Hatankar married for the first time in 1992 and his second marriage took place in 1998.Shraddha told the court in her plea that both the marriages were registered with the Registrar of Marriages and under the Hindu Marriage Act.She claimed in her plea that being the child of Hatankar’s second wife, she too had the right to family pension, and death-cum-retirement gratuity.Therefore, she and her mother should get equal proportion of the compensation disbursed by the state government and the Railways.

25-08-2020||New Delhi||We are not ‘dissenters’, did not challenge leadership: Congress’ ‘Group of 23’||A day after being dissed at a stormy Congress Working Committee meeting over their letter seeking urgent organisational reforms, several members of the ‘group of 23’ said on Tuesday that they were “not dissenters” but “proponents of revival”. Many of them also backed Sonia Gandhi remaining at the helm.The letter was not a challenge to the leadership but a parchment of action to strengthen the party, Congress MP Vivek Tankha said. Former Union minister Mukul Wasnik said those who saw the letter as an “offence” will also soon realise that the issues raised are worth consideration.Senior Congress leader M Veerappa Moily said it was an “admitted fact” that the organisation was not in a position to take forward “the Congress philosophy and protect democracy”. He also asserted that Sonia Gandhi’s leadership was always required.The former union minister further said the intention of the letter was to keep the party ready for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls as also for assembly and local bodies elections in the country.Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal, another signatory to the letter, posted a cryptic tweet, saying: “It’s not about a post. It’s about my country which matters most.”Also read: It is not about a post, but about country, Kapil Sibal says day after stormy CWC meetingTankha took to Twitter to address the controversy surrounding their letter which led to a high drama at the CWC meet where many leaders, including former party chief Rahul Gandhi, lashed out at the letter writers.The CWC unanimously urged Sonia Gandhi to continue as its interim chief till an AICC session can be convened to start the process of electing a full-time president and authorised her to effect necessary organisational changes to deal with the challenges facing the party.Sonia Gandhi was made interim chief a year ago after Rahul Gandhi resigned from the position taking moral responsibility for the party’s disastrous performance in the Lok Sabha elections.“Friends, we are not dissenters but proponents of revival. The letter was not a challenge to leadership but a parchment of action to strengthen the party. Universally, truth is the best defence whether it be Court or Public Affairs. History acknowledges the brave & not the timid (sic),” Tankha said in a tweet.Replying to Tankha, Wasnik tweeted: “Well said. Sooner than later those who saw the letter as an offence will also realise that the issues raised are worth consideration.”Senior party leader Anand Sharma also tagged Tankha’s tweet and said: “The letter was written with the best interest of the party in our hearts and conveying shared concerns over the present environment in the country and sustained assault on the foundational values of the constitution.”Another Congress leader, belonging to the group which wrote the letter, said they were satisfied with the outcome of the CWC meet.Some leaders who signed the letter were present at the CWC meeting and agreed to the proposals, said the leader, who wished not to be named.“We have never expressed any doubts on the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and whatever decisions Sonia ji will take, will be acceptable to us,” the leader said.“We are working to strengthen the party, not working against anyone,” the leader said.Stating that the Gandhi family is always known for patriotism and sacrifice, Moily said Sonia Gandhi's leadership is always required and her consent to continue as president is the “most welcome step”.He said Sonia Gandhi is a “motherly figure” for the Congress and always inspired the rank and file of the party.“At any time of crisis, both at the national and state level, I always stood by the national leadership of the Congress party to preserve the unity and integrity of the party,” Moily said, underlining that he has been in the Congress since the last 50 years having joined under the leadership of Indira Gandhi.Many members from the ‘group of 23’ refused to comment on the matter officially, while some of them referred to the CWC resolution for the inner-party issues being raised only within the party and not in media or public fora “in the interest of propriety and discipline”.After the seven-hour meeting of the party’s top decision-making body, the CWC made it clear that no one will be permitted to undermine or weaken the party and its leadership.Some senior Congress leaders, including Sibal, Wasnik, Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari, had met at their senior colleague Ghulam Nabi Azad's house here on Monday evening soon after the CWC debated their letter.Having a “full time, active and visible” leadership, devolution of powers to state units and revamping the CWC in line with the party constitution are some of the key suggestions made by the 23 senior Congress leaders in the letter to Sonia Gandhi to revive the organisation.Sibal, who is not a part of the CWC, had hit out at Rahul Gandhi on Twitter on Monday for a purported remark slamming the letter writers. He withdrew his tweet a little later after being “informed by Rahul Gandhi personally that he never said what was attributed to him”.The Congress also officially denied that Rahul Gandhi had accused any party leader of “colluding with the BJP”.In addition to Azad, Moily, Sibal, Sharma, Tewari, Tharoor, Wasnik and Tankha, the signatories to the letter included P J Kurian, Renuka Chaudhary, Milind Deora, Ajay Singh, and Jitin Prasada.The ‘group of 23’ also included former chief ministers Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Rajender Kaur Bhattal and Prithviraj Chavan; former PCC chiefs Raj Babbar (UP), Arvinder Singh Lovely (Delhi) and Kaul Singh Thakur (Himachal); current Bihar campaign chief Akhilesh Singh, former Haryana Speaker Kuldeep Sharma; former Delhi Speaker Yoganand Shastri and former MP Sandeep Dixit.

But a different benchmark for imports was announced on July 23.The registration format released by the Government will be an annual affair and is subject to certain terms and conditions.“The bidders, who have beneficial ownership in countries which share land borders with India and intend to participate in public procurement in India, may submit applications for registration in the format,” said an office memorandum by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).The bidders are also required to submit an application for security clearance.The registration would be valid for a year but it will be cancelled and the company will be required to apply afresh in case of appointment of new directors with more than 10 per cent shares.Besides seeking security clearance, the format seeks details of beneficial ownership, the manufacturer, the item, financial details for the last five financials and details of contracts received in the last five years in India.In April, para 3 of the FDI policy was tweaked to make it compulsory for all countries and individuals with land borders with India to take the Government’s approval before investing. This was days after a Chinese Bank picked up shares of HDFC. Earlier these restrictions had applied only to investments from Bangladesh and India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-firms-need-security-clearance-for-government-tenders-131229

25-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi: Teachers, students of universities concerned over online classes, fee hike||A section of students and teachers of various universities in the national capital on Tuesday voiced their concern over holding online classes, fee hike and lack of infrastructural support in the varsities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Delhi University is conducting online open book exams for final semester students of postgraduate and undergraduate courses. The move was opposed by students and teachers who were demanding that the exams be scrapped. The varsity has also commenced online classes for third and fifth semester students from August 10.During an online briefing, Abha Dev Habib, a Delhi University professor, said teachers and students have been left out from the decision-making process to hold online classes."The decision of online open book exams was taken without thinking about students. What will happen to students in Kashmir and those stuck in floods. The students do not have gadgets for online classes. "The decision was taken without consulting the statutory bodies -- the Academic and Executive Council," she alleged.Unni Maya, a student of Lady Shri Ram College in Delhi University, said the varsity has gone ahead with the decision to hold online classes without thinking about the mental health and well-being of students. Taking online classes means that students have to spend a high screen time in front of their mobiles or laptops which impacts their health.She demanded that the varsity should think about funding and providing gadgets to students and it should also release department-wise data on how many students have availed online classes.Students and teachers of other universities also raised similar issues. Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union president Aishe Ghosh said the varsity administration is not concerned about teaching-learning process or about students in Kashmir who still do not have access to a proper internet connectivity, or about flood-affected students or those who contracted COVID-19. "Students are being pressurised to register for the next semester at a time when the UGC has also said that the varsities must finish the current semester by September 30. There is no meaning of registration. The varsity administration is continuously creating issues," she said.She also alleged that the students of MBA and Engineering are being charged lakhs of rupees despite not having access to labs and having part-time faculty."I would call it daylight robbery. Even the representatives from these departments have been pressurised to not raise their voice," she said.She also urged the varsity to ensure phased return of students to the campus by following proper medical protocols and establishing quarantine centres inside the premises.Voices were also raised from Delhi government-run Ambedkar University against online classes and how the administration and even the state government has not heard their pleas.Shubhojeet Dey of Ambedkar University said they had conducted a survey among students and found that 48 per cent of students had access to smartphones while two per cent did not have access to any gadget for accessing online classes. Only 50 per cent of the students have access to laptops, he said, adding that 62 per cent out of these do not have laptops for more than three hours since the laptop is also used by their siblings, who are either studying or are working."It was found that 73 per cent of students does not have stable internet connection and 98 per cent of the female students were also supposed to contribute to household chores. We have even approached  the authorities and even the Delhi government with our problems but there has been no resolution," he added.The students had boycotted the orientation class which was held to introduce the students to courses.Listing out the demands of the students, Dey said they want that the classes should be postponed by a month and laptops should be procured for students from disadvantaged sections and data packs should be given to all the students.

Patricia Mukhim, the paper’s fiery editor, has alleged that the closure order amounted to violation of the freedom of press.Mukhim, who is a recipient of the Padma Shri and number of other awards, today tweeted in exasperation, “It’s the 3rd day that The Shillong Times is barred from publishing because 3 machine operators and 1 driver tested Covid+ive. Since then all staff & family members have tested negative vide RT-PCR. Premises sanitized but for obscure reasons ban persists.”“Whither Press Freedom when forces inimical to it hold the keys to whether an entire newspaper establishment can be contained because 4 non-journalists test Covid+ive”, Mukhim added in another tweet.A note published on the paper’s website said that theirs was the only media house in the world to have fallen victim to Covid-19. “The administration has declared our building as a containment area after three non-journalists tested COVID-19 positive.

Initial information has been shared and some detailed information is awaited,” Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said today.He also said as on date 172 member nations of the UN had joined COVAX, the multilateral vaccine procurement system developed by the WHO with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Initiative and global vaccine giant GAVI.“COVAX pools the vaccine requirement and supply situation of member nations and has so far done this in respect of nine vaccine candidates under development,” said Bhushan noting that while testing in India had risen exponentially touching 3,68,25,520 today, the cumulative positivity rate of COVID is actually declining.On August 13 when we conducted 2,68,45,688 tests the COVID positivity rate was 8.93 pc and on August 25 with nearly 3.6 crore tests the positivity rate is down to 8.60 pc.“While the tests have risen exponentially there is a steady decline in the positivity rate,” said Bhushan noting as hugely positive the fact that out of 31,67,323 COVID cases today, 24,04,585 have recovered leaving 70,438 people on management.Recovery rate is now 75.92 per cent and recoveries are 3.4 times active cases which make up only 22.24 pc of total COVID cases.“In the last 24 hours we have seen a record reduction of active cases. Among the active cases, 2.70 pc are on oxygen support, 1.92 pc in ICU and 0.29 pc on ventilators,” the Health Secretary said.Gender analysis shows out of all 58,390 people who have died so far, 69 per cent are males and 31 per cent females.Age wise, 51 pc deaths are in plus 60 years, 36 pc in 45 to 60 years, 11 per cent in 26 to 44 years and one pc each in 18 to 25 years and under 17 years.Among top achievements the government cited today was the rise in testing from 363 per million on August 1 to 609 per million today.Case fatality rate has dropped to 1.84 per cent due to early detection from aggressive testing, said ICMR DG Balram Bhargava.He said India had gone from one test on January to one million this week and cost of test kits had fallen from RS 2,000 per kit in January to Rs 300 now due to huge indigenous capacity development.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-in-touch-with-russia-over-sputnik-5-covid-vaccine-131220

The swab was taken from the body which was disinfected and wrapped in plastic.The body being kept near where the morning beverages were distributed cannot be justified. A report has been sought and action will be taken accordingly so that it will not be repeated,” Dr Sharmad told PTI.The superintendent said the authorities tried to contact the relatives of the 85-year-old deceased woman as they had sought the photo and video of the body because they were also in quarantine.He termed as completely wrong reports that food was distributed in the COVID ward next to the body which had been lying there for nearly five hours, after 10.30 am.“That information is completely wrong. We could declare the death only after one hour. But there was a delay removing the body for taking the video for the relatives in quarantine. However, it was removed after around 8.30 am itself,” Sharmad said.He said since the relatives, who are also under quarantine, are unable to visit, the authorities normally send them the video of the body.“It was not the food, but tea or coffee for a few other patients that were served as some of them demanded.However, it should not have been done and a probe has been ordered and report sought,” the Superintendent said.The incident took place in ward number 5 of the medical college hospital here.

Ami is believed to have left India soon after the alleged bank fraud case came into light in 2018.According to the agreement reached among the comity of nations, once an RCN is issued against a fugitive, the Interpol asks its 192-member countries to arrest or detain the person, if spotted in their countries and following which extradition or deportation proceedings can begin.The ED has charged Ami Modi for conspiring and laundering money with her husband and jeweller Nirav apart from his uncle Mehul Choksi and others under the PMLA.Nirav Modi (49), is currently lodged in a UK jail after being arrested in London in March, 2019 and is currently fighting extradition proceedings in that country’s court. He has been declared a fugitive economic offender by a Mumbai court early this year and the court had also ordered the confiscation of his assets. The ED has already confiscated about Rs 329 crore of his linked properties.The businessman, Choksi and others are also being probed by the ED on money laundering charges in connection with PNB bank fraud case.Similar Interpol notices have earlier been issued against Nirav Modi’s younger brother Nehal Modi and his sister Purvi Modi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/interpol-issues-global-arrest-warrant-against-nirav-modis-wife-in-pnb-fraud-case-131185

He said if the top court wanted to debar Bhushan from practising law, it will have to hear him first.Dhavan’s submission came after Justice Mishra asked: “If we decide to punish him, what should the punishment be?”Attorney General KK Venugopal said: “My suggestion would be to give a quietus to this matter without getting into that exercise”.Maintaining that a warning would suffice, Venugopal said Bhushan must express regret and withdraw his affidavit justifying his controversial tweets against CJI SA Bobde and four former CJIs.A defiant Bhushan refused to apologise, saying an insincere apology would amount to “contempt of my conscience and of an institution that I hold in highest esteem”. He was convicted of contempt of court on August 14.Justice Mishra---who will retire on September 2---said it was quite painful to decide a contempt case just before demitting his office.Maintaining that criticism of judiciary was welcome, Justice Mishra said judges cannot be attributed motives. “Which judge is left out—sitting or retired? Judges are condemned, their families humiliated…and they can’t even speak…Who will protect them, if not the Bar?” he wondered.“It’s about the system. If we (Bar & Bench) are going to destroy each other, who will have faith in this institution? You have to be tolerant, see what the court is doing and why. Don’t just attack. Judges can’t go to press to defend themselves or explain,” Justice Mishra said.In another contempt case initiated against Bhushan in 2009 for his statement that half of the 16 former CJIs were “corrupt”, the Bench agreed to refer to an appropriate Bench the question of conflict between right to free speech and suo motu contempt powers of court.It directed that the matter be placed before the CJI for sending it to an appropriate Bench for further hearing on September 10 after Dhawan said these issues needed to be decided by a larger Bench.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-larger-bench-to-decide-conflict-of-free-speech-contempt-arising-out-of-prashant-bhushan-case-131182

The World Bank’s latest assessment also took note of the stress on PSBs and advised the Government to taper off their priority sector obligations to help them survive.The RBI said although NPAs had come down in March, the pandemic is “likely to test this resilience”, especially since the regulatory accommodations announced in the wake of the outbreak have “masked the consequent build-up of stress”.The RBI’s latest Financial Stability Report had said NPAs may rise by a minimum of 1.5 times over the March levels and a maximum of 1.7 times due to a “very severely stressed scenario”.The minimum capital requirements for banks, which are calibrated on the basis of historical loss events, may no longer suffice to absorb post-pandemic losses, it further cautioned.To avert this possibility, banks will need to shore up their governance standards, especially the risk governance framework. They will also need to boost their ability to raise capital as well as build resilience to ensure financial stability in anticipation of more frequent, varied and bigger risk events in the coming months.This is line with RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das recently asking banks to enhance their capital strength which led several of them to raise money from the market to cushion themselves against a big loan default.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rbi-seeks-govt-intervention-to-avert-banking-crises-131173

It's about my country which matters most," he tweeted, without elaborating.After the seven-hour meeting of the party's top decision-making body, the CWC urged Sonia Gandhi to continue as its interim chief till an AICC session can be convened and authorised her to effect necessary organisational changes to deal with the challenges facing the party.Also read: We are not ‘dissenters’, did not challenge leadership: Congress’ ‘Group of 23’It made it clear no one will be permitted to undermine or weaken the party and its leadership.The CWC also resolved that inner-party issues cannot be deliberated through the media or in public fora and all such issues must be raised within the party "in the interest of propriety and discipline".Some senior Congress leaders, including Sibal and Shashi Tharoor, met at their senior colleague Ghulam Nabi Azad's house here on Monday evening after the CWC debated their letter to Sonia Gandhi seeking urgent organisational reforms.The meeting was also attended by Mukul Wasnik and Manish Tewari, along with some other signatories to the letter who were present in the national capital, sources said.The leaders discussed the resolution passed at the CWC meeting.Having a "full time" leadership that is active in the field and "visible" in party offices, devolution of powers to state units and revamping the CWC in line with the party constitution are some of the far-reaching suggestions made by 23 senior Congress leaders in a letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi to revive the organisation.Sibal had hit out at Rahul Gandhi on Twitter on Monday for a purported remark slamming the letter writers.Sibal, who is not a part of the CWC, withdrew his tweet a little later after being "informed by Rahul Gandhi personally that he never said what was attributed to him".The Congress also officially denied that Rahul Gandhi had accused any party leader of "colluding with the BJP".Rahul, it is learnt, launched a sharp attack against the signatories of the letter, questioning their timing as well as the fact that they went public with their grievances.

There have been more than 170,000 deaths in the country.India’s COVID-19 tally rose to 31,67,323 on Tuesday, while the death toll climbed to 58,390.In India, the government and the private sector have worked together to ensure the integrity of medical supply chains, and essential medicines from India have continued to reach the United States and some 150 partner countries, Sandhu wrote.But more urgently, the India-US cooperation is proving crucial to confront health challenges posed by the pandemic, including future vaccine development and distribution, the Indian Ambassador wrote.“The India-US partnership in medical research has been complemented by the strength of our cooperation in pharmaceuticals,” he wrote adding that India’s capabilities in R&D and in manufacturing have made its pharmaceutical sector the world’s third-largest by volume.“These strengths have been bolstered by government incentives to encourage investments in the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Indian generic drugs have found a ready market across the globe, with Indian firms supplying about 40 per cent of generic formulations marketed in the United States,” he said.“This has allowed American health-care consumers to save billions and enjoy enhanced access to quality medicines. The pharmaceutical sector has also been a significant job creator in the United States, with Indian firms investing billions to establish manufacturing facilities in different states in this country,” Sandhu wrote.According to the envoy, when the coronavirus outbreak began, the network of existing collaborations between the countries sprang into action.Using the platform of the India-US Science and Technology Forum, an initiative led by both governments, calls were put out to support joint research and incubate start-up engagements.The initiative was directed at developing technologies for the containment and management of the novel coronavirus, including diagnostics and therapeutics, he said. The op-ed by Ambassador was highly appreciated and tweeted by many.“India-US cooperation is proving crucial to confront #health challenges posed by the COVID19 pandemic, including future vaccine development and distribution,” said US Indian Business Council.

25-08-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus most prevalent among those in 5-17 age bracket: Delhi Sero survey||Minors aged between 5 and 17 are most exposed to the novel coronavirus in Delhi, according to a serological survey conducted in the city this month.Conducted between August 1 and August 7, the survey, second in the city, showed that 29.1 percent of the population in the national capital has now developed antibodies against SARS CoV-2.As many as 15,000 people from four age groups participated in the survey – around 25 percent of them below 18, 50 percent between 18 and 50, and the rest aged above 50.A prevalence rate of 34.7 percent was found among the participants aged between 5 and 17, the survey results show.As many as 31.2 percent of the people aged above 50 have recovered from COVID-19, it shows.Among those in the 18-50 age group, 28.5 percent people have developed antibodies against the virus.Indian Council of Medical Research data suggests that people aged between 21 and 50 account for 61.31 per cent of the COVID-19 cases recorded in India till August 21.Experts say children could be contracting the infection from adults in their family and domestic helps.Dr Mahesh Verma, the head of a Delhi Government committee tasked with strengthening the preparedness of hospitals to battle coronavirus, said, "It is difficult to keep children and youngsters home-bound. Even if they are not going to school, they might be going out to play... or they might have contracted it through an indirect route. But it's just a prediction and needs to be studied.""It's still very complex how people are getting infected. I know a couple of families that are not stepping out but their members have still contracted COVID-19," he added.Dr Gauri Aggarwal, the founder of Seeds of Innocence and Genestrings Lab, New Friends Colony, said, “Children might have contracted the virus from someone in their house who was regularly stepping out. The schools are closed and there are very few people who are organizing gatherings where children are also present."     It is possible that they got infected while going to parks or through domestic helps. There are lots of cases where domestic helps have spread the infection, she said.

25-08-2020||Pune||So what if these students don’t own smartphones, house walls enough to impart lessons||With many poor students being unable to afford smartphones for online classes amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a school in Maharashtra's Solapur city has found a new way of imparting education by painting walls of houses in the vicinity with lessons from textbooks.Around 300 outer walls of various houses in Nilamnagar area of Solapur have been painted with simplified lessons from textbooks of various subjects of Classes 1 to 10.This makes it convenient for students to go and stand in front of a particular wall to revise the lessons while following the social distancing guidelines, Ram Gaikwad, a teacher from the Asha Marathi Vidyalaya primary school in Nilamnagar of Solapur told PTI.Nearly 1,700 students from nearby areas study in the primary school and its secondary section Shri Dharmanna Sadul Prashala.Gaikwad said these students come from poor families as their parents are labourers, mostly working in textile units of the district."Online education is the new norm in the current COVID-19 situation for which smartphonewith good internet bandwidth is a must. But, the parents of majority of our students do not have smartphones or any other gadget, so online classes is a distant dream for them," he said.Hence, the school came up with the idea of painting walls of the houses located near the educational institution with lessons from textbooks, he said."We painted contents from textbooks on the walls of houses in Nilamnagar by making them simpler, comprehensible and interesting. Students, as per their convenience, now go and stand in front of the walls following all the social distancing norms and revise the lessons," Gaikwad said.The lessons painted on the walls include introduction to letters, numbers, word and sentence formation, grammar, mathematical formulas, general knowledge and lessons from various other subjects, he said.The school is also conducting online classes for students who have smartphonesor other gadgets at home, Gaikwad added.Asha Marathi Vidyalaya's Principal Tasleem Pathan said nearly 1,700 students, mostly from Nilamnagar, are enrolled in the primary and secondary sections of the school.The lessons painted on the walls are not only benefitting them, but also students from two to three other schools located nearby, she said.Nagesh Kallur, who works at a canteen in the city and has enrolled his son in this school, said he cannot afford a smartphone for his child's online education."But, the lessons painted on the walls of houses in our area are turning out to be beneficial for students.Students follow the social distancing norms and wear masks while standing in front of these walls to study," he said.Surekha Kore, a parent of another student, said as their family income has dipped due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, it is difficult for them to afford a smartphone for online education."These lessons painted on the walls in our area are turning out to be quite useful for our children," she said.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/so-what-if-these-students-dont-own-smartphones-house-walls-enough-to-impart-lessons-131154
25-08-2020||Washington||Trump appreciates India for releasing American pastor||US President Donald Trump has appreciated India for listening to his request to release an American pastor who was arrested last October on charges of carrying USD 40,000 of undeclared currency.Tennessee pastor Bryan Nerren, who was released by India after intervention from Trump this May, attended a roundtable with the President in the Oval Office of the White House along with several other American citizens who were released from overseas abductions and detentions.“India responded very well to my request. Appreciate that,” Trump said as he appeared in a taped meeting with a group of US citizens who were abducted or detained overseas and the Trump Administration helped them to return home.The taped roundtable was broadcast during the first night of the four-day Republican National Convention on Monday.In his brief remarks, Nerren explained that he had been arrested by the Indian officials while travelling in the country.Nerren from the International House of Prayer Ministries was arrested in Bagdogra, West Bengal, last October on charges of travelling with USD 40,000 of undeclared currency.Among others who appeared along with Trump were Michael White, a US Navy veteran, who was arrested in July 2018 while visiting his girlfriend in Iran, and Sam Goodwin, a world traveller who entered northern Syria from Iraq on May 25, 2019 and was taken into custody for failure to have a visa.Others who appeared on the video were Andrew Brunson, a pastor, accused of being part of a terrorist group, the Gulen movement, and was arrested on October 7, 2016, by Turkey and Joshua and Tamara Holt, arrested in Venezuela shortly after their wedding and accused of stockpiling weapons.Each of them briefly recounted their stories and thanked President Trump for his efforts to secure their freedom.Trump's intervention to release Pastor Nerren came after Christian leaders from Tennessee and US lawmakers mounted a campaign for his release with both India and his administration.In February, Rhonda J Nerren wrote a letter to Trump seeking the release of her husband Pastor Nerren. The President is believed to have taken up the issue during his visit to India in February.Nerren was arrested in October 2019 and charged with violating the Foreign Exchange Management Act for travelling with USD 40,000 of undeclared currency. On October 11, he was released on bail.On December 31, 2019, Indian Customs issued a showcause order confiscating the USD 40,000 and imposing a penalty of Rs 3 lakh (roughly USD 4,000).In January, Nerren surrendered the entire amount and paid the fine. On May 15, 2020, after months of diplomatic efforts, Nerren was released and allowed to return home.

Sibal, who is not a part of the CWC, withdrew his tweet later.Led by former PM Manmohan Singh, who moved the resolution, the CWC warned leaders against voicing dissent in public and pledged to “strengthen the hands of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi”. Signalling Gandhi supremacy in the Congress, the committee went on to note, “No one can be, nor will be, permitted to undermine the Congress at this critical juncture and Sonia and Rahul Gandhi’s voices are the strongest voices fighting the BJP government and the assault on democracy.”Cong dissenters gather at Azad’s residence after the CWC meeting, signalling they are ready for a long haul to ensure party reforms Rahul GandhiIssues are not discussed in media. Soniaji must stay but it can’t be open-ended.The resolution followed a fiery seven-hour CWC meeting that commenced with Sonia asking to be relieved of the post following demands for an organisational overhaul by some leaders. “The Congress is a large family,” she said in her closing remarks, adding that she didn’t bear ill-will against anyone and had in the past too risen above hurtful remarks to ensure Congress unity. She was alluding to 1999 when Sharad Pawar, then Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, had questioned her foreign origins.Ambika SoniPeople who signed the letter and went public must be held accountable. The move today was aimed at ensuring the dissenters, including CWC members Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Mukul Wasnik and Jitin Prasada, endorsed the CWC resolution.“We are happy at Sonia Gandhi’s continuation. We are part and parcel of the CWC resolution,” Azad said after the meeting where he was at the receiving end of an unprecedented attack.Ghulam Nabi AzadWe wrote to strengthen party.... We had no problem with Sonia-ji’s continuation.Manmohan called the letter “unfortunate”, AK Antony termed it cruel while Ahmed Patel questioned its leak to the media. Ambika Soni sought disciplinary action against the signatories. Rahul questioned the timing of the letter when Sonia was hospitalised and the Congress was trouble-shooting in Rajasthan. “We discuss issues in the CWC, not media,” he said with sources claiming he mentioned how the letter would help the BJP. Priyanka chose not to speak. Amid raging tempers, Azad offered to resign only to retract his statement later, saying, “Rahul did not mention that the letter was written at BJP’s behest.”Ex-minister Kapil Sibal, another signatory to the letter, deleted a related tweet, saying Rahul had personally informed him of not having alluded to the BJP link. The CWC resolution hailed the Gandhis for their leadership through Covid, economic downturn and Chinese aggression. On the way forward, sources said Sonia said that her replacement could not be “open-ended”. AICC general secretary (Organisation) KC Venugopal said AICC session would be held “as early as possible”. The party also said the CWC favoured Rahul as Sonia’s successor. Rahul proposed a committee to assist Sonia – an exercise she would perhaps undertake to address some concerns raised by the dissenters in their August 7 letter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-stays-congress-president-till-aicc-meet-azad-co-happy-130924

The matter is to be heard today.Bhushan said he believed the Supreme Court was the last bastion of hope for the protection of fundamental rights, the watchdog institutions and indeed for constitutional democracy itself. He faces simple imprisonment of up to six months or with a fine of up to Rs 2,000, or both.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-apology-take-back-order-bhushan-to-sc-130926

This is an easy way to identify the minorities living in any area.”Responding to the charge, the poll panel said, “The anecdotal reports are not based on facts… the commission has not deviated in any manner from the original guidelines of 2008 and clarificatory orders of 2020.”The commission noted that as far as criminal investigations by regulatory or enforcement agencies were concerned, “it was under their own extant Acts, rules and guidelines, which in any case could be challenged in court”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/election-commission-illegally-shares-voters-pics-with-cops-130981

25-08-2020||---||SC rejects plea seeking NEET centres abroad||New Delhi, August 24The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a petition seeking directions to the Centre and the National Testing Agency (NTA) to allow examination centres abroad to hold NEET-2020 for admission to medical courses.A Bench led by Justice LN Rao asked the Centre to arrange Vande Bharat Mission flights for such students to appear for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).This year’s test was scheduled in May, but it was rescheduled to July 26 and then to September 13 due to Covid. It will be conducted by the NTA in pen-paper mode. The top court also refused to relax quarantine norms for them, citing public health issues. However, it allowed the petitioners to approach the state authorities to seek relaxation for candidates landing from abroad for NEET. Earlier, the NTA had told the top court that it wasn’t possible to hold NEET overseas as it was conducted in paper book format.In an affidavit filed in the SC, the NTA had pointed out, “NEET has to be conducted in a single shift at the same time on the same day to maintain uniformity and, further, the questions papers and other exam material are to be transported from the NTA headquarters to a number of examination centres in various cities, which would require meticulous planning for safe delivery of the same at the examination centres on time.” The affidavit was filed in response to a petition filed by parents of applicants for NEET 2020 working in Qatar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-plea-seeking-neet-centres-abroad-130990

The possibility of Abe stepping down on health grounds is unlikely to make a difference to the dynamics of Indo-Japan ties which enjoy all-round support in Tokyo.The Indo-US two plus two talks will follow the India-Japan summit and will be co-chaired from the Indian side by Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark Esper from the US side.The US and Australia recently held a similar two plus two meeting in Washington that saw Canberra pushing back at some of the US aggression on South China Sea. However, there is alignment on the fundamentals of stalling China’s attempt to dominate South China Sea and become a world leader in 5G technology.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-galwan-india-us-to-hold-first-high-level-meet-130992
