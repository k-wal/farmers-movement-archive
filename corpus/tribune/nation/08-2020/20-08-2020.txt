20-08-2020||New Delhi||29 pc people in Delhi sero survey have developed anti-bodies||The doubling rate of coronavirus infection in the national capital has gone up to over 100 days, the Delhi government said on Thursday as it revealed that 29.1 per cent people who took part in the latest sero-prevalence survey have anti-bodies against COVID-19.The national capital recorded 1,215 fresh coronavirus cases, taking the tally to 1.57 lakh, while the death toll from the disease mounted to 4,257, a health bulletin issued by the Delhi government said.Twenty-two fatalities have been recorded in the last 24 hours, the health bulletin said. This is the highest number of deaths since August 7, when the city recorded 23 fatalities, according to the data. On the sero-survey, Health Minister Satyendar Jain said 15,000 representative samples were taken in the August 1-7 survey from 11 districts, and the next exercise will begin from September 1.“In the previous survey, it was found that over 22 per cent people had developed antibodies. Now, the August survey shows it is 29.1 per cent, meaning they had got infected and recovered,” Jain said.The minister also said the prevalence of antibodies found in males was 28.3 per cent and 32.2 per cent in females in the latest survey.The sero-prevalence found in North East district was 29 per cent, South district 27 per cent, South East 33 per cent and New Delhi 24 per cent, Jain said.“The rise, rather than the exponential rise is not there. So, people are taking safety precautions it seems. But, we cannot afford to be complacent and lower our guard, even though the positivity rate at present is 7 per cent,” Jain said.The findings also mean that 71 per cent still have chances of getting infection, he said. “Also, experts say, herd immunity is said to have been built in the community if 40-50 per cent or more develop anti-bodies, so we have to be still very watchful,” he added.The exercise was undertaken for a comprehensive assessment of the COVID-19 situation in Delhi and to formulate strategies based on its findings.The previous sero-prevalance survey done from June 27 to July 10 by the Delhi government in association with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), had used 21,387 samples and found that around 23 per cent of the people surveyed had an exposure to the novel coronavirus.A statement by the Chief Minister’s Office said for the month of August, the mortality rate in Delhi is 1.4 percent, while the country has a mortality rate of 1.92 percent. The recovery rate in Delhi is 90.2 per cent as compared to 72.5 per cent for the rest of the country, it added.“The efforts made by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to deal with the Covid situation in Delhi are showing successful results. Delhi’s position is much better than the rest of the country,” the statement said.The statement also said there is a large drop in test positive rate between June 18 and August 16. Positivity rate of RT-PCR and rapid tests both have seen a sharp decrease, it added.“At present, the doubling rate of coronavirus in Delhi has gone up to 101.5 days, as compared to the rest of the country which stands at 28.8 days,” the statement said.           On July 1, the doubling rate of coronavirus cases in Delhi was the same as with the rest of India at 20 days, it said.“Since then, the doubling rate of Delhi has been steadily rising. It was 58 days on July 17, around 90 days on August 1, and has currently increased to 101.5 days. In comparison, for the rest of India, the doubling rate has remained between 20 and 27 days since July 1,” it added.On the positivity rate, the statement said it has dropped for both RT-PCR tests and Rapid Antigen Tests.“On June 18, 9,088 RT-PCR tests were conducted of which 2,804 positives emerged - a positivity rate of 30.85 per cent. In comparison, on August 16,  4,106 RT-PCR tests were conducted of which 434 positives emerged - a positivity rate of 10.57 per cent.“Similarly, on June 18, 3,316 rapid tests were conducted in Delhi of which 247 positives emerged - a positivity rate of 7.42 per cent. In comparison, August 16, 10,882 rapid tests were conducted in Delhi of which 353 positives emerged - a positivity rate of 3.24 per cent,” the statement added.On an average, the Delhi government roughly conducts 18,000-20,000 tests every day, but a majority of them are rapid tests, which experts say have very low sensitivity.

20-08-2020||New Delhi||Russia looking for partnership with India for producing COVID-19 vaccine: RDIF CEO||Russia is looking for a partnership with India for producing COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V, Kirill Dmitriev, the CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), said on Thursday.Russian President Vladimir Putin had announced that his country has developed the world’s first vaccine against COVID-19, which works “quite effectively” and forms a “stable immunity” against the disease.Sputnik V has been developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, along with the RDIF. The vaccine has not been tested in Phase 3 or larger clinical trials.Addressing an online press briefing, Dmitriev said several nations are interested in the production of the vaccine from countries in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.“The production of the vaccine is a very important issue. Currently, we are looking for a partnership with India. We believe that they are capable of producing the Gamaleya vaccine and it is very important to say that those partnerships to produce the vaccine will enable us to cover the demand that we have,” he said.Dmitriev said Russia is looking forward to international cooperation.“We are going to do clinical trials not just in Russia but also in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, probably in Brazil and India. We are planning to produce the vaccine in more than five countries and there is a very high demand from Asia, Latin America, Italy and other parts of the world regarding the delivery of the vaccine,” he said.Alexander Gintsburg, the director of the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology and an academician at the Russian Academy of Sciences, said more than 20,000 people have taken part in the clinical trials of vaccines and drugs, based on human adenoviruses or human adenoviral vectors.“Vaccines do not contain live human adenoviruses, but human adenovirus vectors, that is, human viruses that cannot multiply in the body and are completely safe,” he said.The Sputnik V vaccine consists of two shots that use different versions of adenoviruses—virus types, some of which cause the common cold—that the manufacturers have engineered to carry the gene for the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19.“The approach of the Gamaleya Institute with the vaccine, using two human adenoviruses serotypes: number 5 (Ad5) and number 26 (Ad26), has a clear advantage over the one-vector approach used by other developers,” Gintsburg said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-looking-for-partnership-with-india-for-producing-covid-19-vaccine-rdif-ceo-128956

20-08-2020||Bengaluru||Chandrayaan-2 completes a year around Moon||India's second lunar mission Chandrayaan-2 completed one year in orbit around the moon on Thursday and all instruments are currently performing well and there is adequate onboard fuel to keep it operational for about seven more years, space agency ISRO said.Chandrayaan-2 was launched on July 22, 2019 and inserted into the lunar orbit on August 20, exactly one year ago."Though the soft-landing attempt (of the lander carrying the rover) was not successful, the orbiter, which was equipped with eight scientific instruments, was successfully placed in the lunar orbit. The orbiter completed more than 4,400 orbits around the Moon and all the instruments are currently performing well," the Indian Space Research Organisation said.The agency in a statement said the spacecraft was healthy and the performance of subsystems normal."The orbiter is being maintained in 100 +/- 25 km polar orbit with periodic orbit maintenance (OM) maneuvers. So far, 17 OMs are carried out since achieving 100 km lunar orbit on 24th September 2019. There is adequate onboard fuel to remain operational for about seven years," it added.Chandrayaan-2 mission was India's first attempt to make a softlanding of a rover on the unchartered South Pole of the lunar surface.However, the lander Vikram hard-landed in September last year.The scientific payloads, including high resolution camera, onboard the oribter for mapping the lunar surface and study the exosphere (outer atmosphere) of the Moon.ISRO said raw data from the payloads have been downloaded at the Indian Space Science Data Centre (ISSDC) during the year.Public data release was planned by end of this year, after validation by a formal peer review, it said adding the first-year observations from Chandrayaan-2 demonstrate the in-orbit performance of payloads, strongly indicating its ability to contribute significantly to lunar science."The anticipated long life of this orbiter can contribute much to the current resurgence of interest among the global scientific community for a sustained presence on the Moon," the space agency said.Chandrayaan-2 was launched to further expand the knowledge about the moon through a detailed study of its topography, mineralogy, surface chemical composition, thermo- physical characteristics and atmosphere, leading to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of the moon.Indias first mission to the Moon Chandrayaan-1, launched in 2008, had given clear evidence on the extensive presence of surface water and the indication for subsurface polar water- ice deposits. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chandrayaan-2-completes-a-year-around-moon-128950

An online orientation for the English Language Assistants will be announced soon.Although France has started receiving applications, the French embassy’s claim that it has opened its borders will depend on actual issuance of visas. At present, decisions on visa issuance remains tied to any future evolution of existing Schengen regulations authorising third country students to enter France.Starting August 17, seven VFS centres have been receiving select visa applications which will be processed in small batches every week. Mobile biometric data collection and courier services are available to limit in-person contacts at the centres.Universities in France have also readied themselves to receive international students, either wholly or partly on campus.“France is returning to normalcy and I am delighted that international students will be among the first to benefit from it. The Embassy is fully mobilised to ensure that students can pursue their studies in France in the smoothest conditions possible, despite the challenges of the pandemic. This step reaffirms France’s priority to academic mobility,” said the Ambassador of France Emmanuel Lenain.The embassy accepts applications from Indian students travelling to France in autumn 2020 for studies for over three months on long-term visas as well as short-term studies or internships, with accommodation in France. Applications are also open for professors or researchers employed or invited by a French academic institution or research laboratory who are travelling at the end of their studies or for teaching as well as those having a valid long-term visa or a Talent passport.These persons must possess an International Travel Certificate to Mainland France (Attestation de déplacement international dérogatoire), available on the website of the French Interior Ministry. This certificate is to be presented to the travel company before departure and to border control authorities on arrival in France. This certificate must also be accompanied by an undertaking that the person does not have any Covid symptoms and has not been in contact with an infected person 14 days prior to departure.Before the outbreak, 10,000 Indian students were in France for higher studies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/france-prepares-to-open-to-indian-students-teachers-128936

The raising of altitude of this marshland would only endanger the surrounding villages, towns and habitats, in the long run, he said.The latest heavy rains have flooded and submerged the marshland supposedly acquired by the government for housing sites for the poor. If houses are constructed here, it would pose danger to the lives and property of the poor, pushing them into deeper poverty.He accused the YSRCP leaders of adopting a special modus operandi to perpetrate corruption in connivance with some local officials.They were selecting cheap lands with little or no market value, he said.The ruling party leaders were buying these lands from owners by showing inflated values during registration but actually paying low market values to the owners, Naidu added.Later, the government was acquiring these lands from the YSRCP leaders at inflated and feigned prices. This was all done under the housing scheme as per the Andhra Pradesh Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, claimed the former Chief Minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naidu-seeks-probe-into-purchase-of-land-for-housing-sites-for-poor-128919
20-08-2020||Agra/Firozabad||UP bus hijack mastermind held after encounter with police, NSA to be slapped||The alleged mastermind behind the hijacking of a bus with 34 passengers on board was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Police following an encounter in Firozabad district on Thursday, officials said.Agra Senior Superintendent of Police Babloo Kumar said the police will invoke the stringent National Security Act (NSA) against Pradeep Gupta alias Gudda for the “sensational and audacious” act once the case is chargesheeted.The gunfight broke out around 5 am near a village in Fatehabad area between the accused and police teams, including Agra and Firozabad units, and a special operations group, he said.“Key accused Pradeep Gupta and his associate Yatendra Yadav were on a motorcycle but seeing the police check, they opened fire and tried to flee. Gupta got injured in retaliatory firing, while Yadav managed to escape through the farmlands,” SSP Kumar told reporters.He said police teams are on the search for others accused in the case and will arrest them soon.Around a dozen people were involved in planning and executing the bus hijacking from Agra late on Tuesday night allegedly over monetary dispute between Gupta and vehicle owner Ashok Arora, a resident of Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, according to the officials.The bus was recovered from a dhaba in Etawah on Wednesday afternoon, after more than 12 hours of going amiss, with officials saying all 34 passengers on board it were safe and on their way to their destinations in other vehicles.Gupta, a native of Jaipur but a resident of Agra, is the mastermind of the bus hijacking episode. He worked as an agent and middleman at the Road Transport Office in Etawah, according to the officials.Five police teams were formed later for arresting Gupta and those linked in the case. The teams, including a special operations group (SOG), were scrambled around Agra, Firozabad, Etawah, Mainpuri and nearby areas for the job, the officials said.Kumar said Gupta has told the police that he worked for bus owner Arora, who passed away two days ago, since 2012 and used to do document works like registration and taxation of vehicles for him.“He claimed Arora and his transport firm owed him Rs 67 lakh for the works he got done for him,” the officer said.Last week, Gupta had been to Gwalior where he even threatened Arora in a bid to recover his money and then planned this whole episode with the same objective, he said.The bus was intercepted by accused persons late on Tuesday night. The driver, conductor and the helper were forcibly removed from the bus. The passengers were also alighted later and the bus was parked at a dhaba in Etawah, according to police.Gupta’s criminal history reveals he was jailed in 2018 for submitting forged documents in the Etawah RTO and cases, including those on corruption charges, were filed against him.Gupta and his partner Yadav together used vehicles which they had forcibly acquired from similar cases and that angle was being probed further. All such vehicles were being identified by the local police, the SSP said.“Such a sensational and audacious act created an environment of fear not only in Agra but also in nearby areas. We have got instructions for strict action against all accused in the case.

20-08-2020||Nashik||Leopardess takes shelter in unused house along with cubs||A leopardess has taken shelter in a vacant house outside a village along with her four cubs near here in Maharashtra, prompting forest department officials to deploy guards in the area and restrict entry of people.According to forest officials, the leopardess had brought her four cubs in the dilapidated house, located in an agriculture field of a farmer, Rajendra Tandale, on August 15 night.The house is near Nandgaon Sado village under Igatpuri taluka of Nashik district.Tandale lives in his house in the village at present and the one in the field is in a dilapidated condition and therefore remains unused.When it was found that the leopardess has taken shelter in the house along with her four cubs, which the officials said appear to be 15 days old, villagers informed the forest department about it.Following this, forest department officials set up CCTV cameras in the area to monitor the movement of the wild animal.An August 19 footage has captured the leopardess feeding her four cubs.Igatpuri taluka is receiving heavy rains for the last 10-12 days and therefore the wild animal may have taken shelter in the house after coming out of a nearby forest, the officials said.The animal may return to the forest when rains subside, they said.At present, forest guards have been deployed in the area, where entry of people has been restricted, the officials said.

I, therefore, appeal to your good self to persuade Dr. Tharoor to proceed on leave and thereafter,... choose another member of the Committee to act as Chairperson," Dubey said in the letter.Dubey and Tharoor have filed breach of privilege notices against each other on Wednesday after a spat on social media over the Congress leader's remarks on summoning the Facebook India executives over reports that the social media giant went soft on some BJP leaders who had made hate speeches ahead of the general elections last year.While Dubey said Tharoor was treating the committee as an extension of Congress party, the Congress leader had alleged that the BJP MP made "disparaging remarks" on social media over his decision to summon a panel meeting to discuss the alleged "misconduct" of Facebook.

20-08-2020||Patna||Manjhi’s HAM quits Grand Alliance in Bihar ahead of polls||Former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) on Thursday quit the Grand Alliance (Mahagathbandhan) but preferred to remain mum on future tie-up with any party or grouping."HAM will no longer be a constituent of the grand alliance. The party has decided to leave mahagathbandhan," party spokesman Danish Rizwan told reporters here.The decision to walk out of the five parties opposition coalition in Bihar was taken at the party's "core committee" meeting convened at Manjhis residence here, Rizwan said.The development comes months before the state is expected to see polls in October-November.The party, however, did not announce as whether it would merge with any other party or become part of some other alliance.The party has authorised its president to decide the future course of action that included decision to join any alliance or formation, Rizwan said, adding whatever decision he takes will be acceptable to all.Apart from HAM, the mahagathbandhan in Bihar comprises of RJD, Congress, Upendra Kushwahas Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and Bollywood set designer Mukesh Sahni headed Vikassheel Insan Party (VIP).Asked if HAM would merge with Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (United), Rizwan rejected the idea outrightly asserting that "there is no question of merging with any other party."Holding RJD responsible for failure to form a coordination committee within the grand alliance for its better functioning, the HAM leader said, "leaders who do not listen to the constituent partners, will they listen to the people after coming to power?His barb was apparently directed at Lalu Prasad's headed RJD, which has declared Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate."Our leader Jitan Ram Manjhi jee has categorically stated that there is no point in continuing with the alliance which does not follow democratic norms and listen to its partners, Rizwan said.Even Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said during a virtual meeting of his party in the state recently that a coordination committee would be formed within a week, but nothing happened, he added.Even though the idea of a coordination committee was supported by Kushwaha and the VIP party president, but the RJD leadership did not bother to take any action in this regard, he said.Manjhi had quit the NDA in February 2018 and joined the grand alliance. The party had unsuccessfully contested three Lok Sabha seats in 2019 general elections with the opposition grouping.Earlier, Manjhi had quit the JD(U) in 2015 after being forced to step down as the chief minister to make way for return of Nitish Kumar. He later formed HAM and joined NDA.After Nitish Kumar returned to NDA in July 2017, Manjhi broke ranks with the ruling alliance and became part of the opposition formation.

20-08-2020||New Delhi||NCB seizes ‘ecstasy’ pills suspected to be pumped into Mumbai drugs circuit||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has seized a very large cache of ‘ecstasy’, a party drug, that was sourced from Belgium by a Mumbai-based couple, officials said on Thursday.A total of 3,056 tablets of the narcotic have been seized in an operation conducted in the western metropolis last week, they said.Each ecstasy pill costs between Rs 1,500-Rs 2,500 in the domestic market, the officials said.They said the couple, identified as H A Choudhury and R Batharey, had ordered the ecstasy or MDMA pills from Brussels, Belgium’s capital city, and 3,010 were sent through a courier on August 10 by hiding them in the “false cavity” of a box that contained soft toys.The remaining 46 pills were recovered from the Navi Mumbai residence of the couple, they claimed.“The high quality ecstasy pills seized are in different colours like orange, pink and green. The drug was sourced from Brussels and was meant for supply in the Mumbai party circuit,” NCB Deputy Director (operations) K P S Malhotra said.“We are investigating the linkages of this case to the wider syndicate who traffic party drugs into India,” he said.At 3,056 tablets, this is one of the largest seizures of the narcotic pills in the country, he said.MDMA (methylenedioxy- methamphetamine), commonly known as ecstasy, is a party drug that alters mood and its perception is chemically similar to stimulants and hallucinogens. It produces a feeling of increased energy and pleasure. “As per UNODC’s World Drug Report 2020, ecstasy continues to be manufactured primarily in Europe, most notably in Western and Central Europe. Europe accounts for two-thirds of the ‘ecstasy’ laboratories dismantled worldwide,” an NCB statement said.The total quantity of ecstasy seized worldwide has doubled over the period of 2009-2018 and this is also reflected in the rapidly increasing popularity of such synthetic drugs in India, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncb-seizes-ecstasy-pills-suspected-to-be-pumped-into-mumbai-drugs-circuit-128897
20-08-2020||New Delhi||Govt to charge passengers higher aviation security fee from September 1||The Civil Aviation Ministry has decided to charge higher aviation security fee (ASF) from domestic as well as international passengers from September 1, senior government officials said on Thursday. Making the air travel slightly costlier, the officials said the ASF for domestic flyers will be increased to Rs 160 from Rs 150 starting next month, and international passengers will pay 5.2 USD instead of 4.85 USD as the ASF from September 1.Airlines collect the ASF from passengers when they book their tickets and then give it to the government. The ASF is used to fund the security arrangement at airports across the country.The ministry had increased the ASF last year too.On June 7, 2019, the ministry said domestic passengers would be charged Rs 150 instead of Rs 130 as the ASF and international passengers would be charged 4.85 USD instead of USD 3.25 as the ASF from July 1, 2019.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic. All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave-without-pay and firings of employees in order to conserve cash. After a gap of two months due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, India resumed domestic passenger flights on May 25. However, the average occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around just 50-60 per cent since May 25. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, special international flights have been operating with the approval of aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

20-08-2020||New Delhi||Scientists dispel coronavirus mutation fears, say ‘Malaysia strain’ no cause for concern||The mutant form of the novel coronavirus reported from Malaysia as being “10 times more infectious” is not a concern for India as it is widely prevalent here and isn’t any more virulent than the strain originating in Wuhan, say scientists.The D614G strain of the virus was discovered in Malaysia from a cluster, including a restaurant owner returning from India, the country’s Director General of Health said in a Facebook post this week.His assertion that it was “found to be 10 times more infectious and is easily spread by an individual super spreader” created a flutter but scientists here dispelled fears and said there is nothing to worry about.According to virologist Upasana Ray, the mutation may have just been reported in Malaysia but is not new for the world. “We saw it happening in April and it eventually dominated many countries. It is new for Malaysia but is not a new mutation,” the senior scientist at Kolkata’s CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology told PTI.While some reports claim the mutation is capable of enhancing the infectivity of the virus, this is not well established and also does not necessarily indicate more virulence or harmfulness of the disease.Ray said even a highly infectious and transmissible variant of the virus might actually have a lesser ability to cause disease in humans.In July, a study in the journal Cell by scientists, including Bette Korber from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US, noted that a variant of the novel coronavirus, dubbed ‘D614G’, can infect more lab-grown cells than other strains.The study said this mutant—in which a molecule ‘aspartic acid’ (denoted as D) is replaced by another building block ‘glycine’ (G) -- had quickly taken over as the dominant strain across the world soon after it first appeared, and grew more rapidly in lab-grown cells.This mutation is part of the spike protein that the novel coronavirus uses to enter host cells.The strain with the D614G mutation, dubbed the ‘G clade’, became widely prevalent in India even as far back as April, agreed Kumar Somasundaram, professor of Microbiology and Cell Biology at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore.The ‘G clade”, or variant, currently makes up about 70-75 per cent of the cases in India, he told PTI. In June, Somasundaram’s team published a study in the journal Current Science, analysing hundreds of samples of the virus in India. “Back in April, if 100 patient samples were analysed in India, 40-50 per cent of them had the G clade virus. If you look at those analysed in June, almost 95 per cent are G clade… cumulatively if you add up all the samples that have been analysed over the months, the G clade makes up 70-75 per cent of the cases in India,” he explained.While the original “wild type” of the virus from the first epicentre of the pandemic in Wuhan, China, had the D clade of the virus, much of the outbreak in India began from infected people returning from Europe with the G clade.“In February-March, the viruses we detected in Indian patients came mainly from Europe, and to some extent from the Middle East and Oceania. And Europe, even then, had an enrichment of the G clade virus. And then this strain started growing more and more in prevalence in India,” Somasundaram said.Unlike in several other parts of the world, such as the US, where other clades were initially present, the IISc microbiologist noted that in India the G clade was more prevalent even at the onset of the outbreak.“Because this virus can grow faster, it was able to take advantage over the other types, and it has started taking over almost completely the other strains. This is true even in the worldwide scenario where it is dominating other strains,” he added.“Over a period of time, the G clade took advantage of its ability to spread and has occupied almost 95 per cent of the infected patients at a point,” Somasundaram said.However, he explained that the strain is no difference compared to the wild type virus or the other strains in terms of COVID-19 disease outcome.“The G clade virus does not have any different impact on disease severity or outcome. So that way it is no different from the wild type.” Somasundaram said.While studies, such as the one by Korber and his team, have demonstrated that the G clade virus has the potential to infect more lab-grown cells than other strains, some virologists argue this still may not be evidence of increased transmissibility in humans.Scientists, including Angela Rasmussen from the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in the US, noted in a recently published commentary in the journal Cell that while lab tests can demonstrate the ability of a virus to infect a cell in culture, “it’s not clear what it means for the ability to productively transmit to a new host”.“These assays don’t account for the effect of other viral or host proteins and the parade of biochemical host-pathogen interactions that must occur to support infection and transmission,” Rasmussen and her colleagues noted.According to Somasundaram, the mutation in the G clade virus spike protein may also not have any implications for vaccine development.“Initially, it was implicated that a vaccine developed against the wild type virus may not work against the mutant form. But this mutation may not have any difference in terms of how the immune system recognises the virus,” he said.“The mutant S protein containing virus can also be neutralised by a vaccine developed against the wild type virus,” Somasundaram explained.Rasmussen’s team also noted the same.They said antibodies generated from natural infection with the D or G clade viruses could cross-neutralise, suggesting that “the D614G mutation is unlikely to have a major impact on the efficacy of vaccines currently in the pipeline”.Ray said a safe strategy for developing vaccines could be to look for targets in other areas of the spike protein that have not undergone mutation.“The spike protein has other areas that are more stable and thus should be targetable. Monitoring this mutant, and in-depth research on this mutation is definitely required,” she added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scientists-dispel-coronavirus-mutation-fears-say-malaysia-strain-no-cause-for-concern-128891
20-08-2020||New Delhi||India’s Covid recovery rate nears 74 pc, only 0.28 pc of active cases on ventilator support||Recoveries among COVID-19 patients in the country surged to 20,96,664 on Thursday, pushing India’s recovery rate to 73.91 per cent, while only 0.28 per cent people of 6,86,395 active cases are on ventilator support, the Union health ministry said.Meanwhile, with a record 9,18,470 tests been being done in a day, the cumulative tests conducted so far for detection of COVID-19 in India have reached 3.26 crore even as the national positivity rate has fallen below 8 per cent, the ministry added. With constantly increasing testing numbers, there has been a commensurate fall in the positivity rate, the ministry said.Of the active cases of coronavirus infection, 1.92 per cent are in ICU and 2.62 per cent on oxygen support. The country’s case fatality rate has further declined to 1.90 per cent, it said.Recovery of 20,96,664 patients has been made possible because of effective implementation of the policy of testing aggressively, tracking comprehensively and treating efficiently, the ministry said in a statement.“Focus on standard of care protocol, including use of non-invasive oxygen, better skilled doctors in the ICUs and hospitals, and improved ambulance services have culminated in yielding the desired results,” it said.With 58,794 recoveries in a span of 24 hours, India’s recovery rate amongst COVID-19 patients has reached nearly 74 per cent (73.91 per cent) reflecting that the number of patients recovering is on a steady rise over the past several months, it added.India has posted 14,10,269 more recoveries than active cases. There are 6,86,395 active cases of coronavirus infection which are under active medical care.The record high recoveries have ensured that the active cases, the “actual caseload” of the country, currently comprise only 24.19 per cent of the total cases.Early identification through testing, surveillance and contact tracing along with focus on timely and appropriate clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients have ensured that not only is the case fatality rate lower than the global average and progressively declining but also a small proportion of the active cases are on ventilator support, the ministry said.Testing rate improves“Although higher number of tests will push the positivity rate initially, but as the experience from several states and UTs has amply depicted, it will eventually lower when combined with other measures such as prompt isolation, effective tracking and timely clinical management,” it stated.India for the first time conducted a record number of more than 9 lakh COVID tests in a span of 24 hours on Wednesday and it is poised to see an exponential increase towards its resolve of testing 10 lakh samples daily.The cumulative tests conducted so far for detection of coronavirus infection in the country has increased to 3,26,61,252.Expanded diagnostic lab network across the country and effective measures to facilitate easy testing have given a substantial boost to the present numbers.“As a result of these focussed actions, the Tests Per Million (TPM) have seen a sharp increase to 23,668. The TPM continues to maintain a constant upward trend,” the ministry said.“As the national average falls below 8 per cent, there are 26 states and UTs that are reporting lower rates than the national average,” the ministry said in a statement.There has been a steady rise in the national network of diagnostic labs too. With 977 labs in the government sector and 517 private labs, the lab infrastructure has been enhanced to 1,494 labs today.India’s COVID-19 caseload increased to 28,36,925 with a record single day spike of 69,652 infections, while the death-toll climbed to 53,866 with 977 new fatalities being reported in a day,  the data updated at 8 am showed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-recovery-rate-nears-74-pc-only-0-28-pc-of-active-cases-on-ventilator-support-128887

20-08-2020||New Delhi||MS Dhoni grateful to PM Narendra Modi for emotional letter post-retirement: Thank you for the appreciation||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described Mahendra Singh Dhoni as the embodiment of a new India where family name does not make one's destiny in a letter to the two-time World Cup-winning former India captain, who retired from international cricket last week.A thankful Dhoni shared the letter on his Twitter page on Thursday, his first social media post since the "consider me retired" note on Instagram that stunned one and all on Saturday."You have been one of the important illustrations of the spirit of new India, where family name does not make young people's destiny, but they make their own names and their own destinies," wrote the PM in his letter."Where we come from does not matter as long as we know where we are headed -- this is the spirit that you have exuded and inspired many youngsters with," he said.Dhoni, who is also an Honorary Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army, thanked the PM for the appreciation."An Artist,Soldier and Sportsperson what they crave for is appreciation, that their hard work and sacrifice is getting noticed and appreciated by everyone.thanks PM @narendramodi for your appreciation and good wishes," he wrote.An Artist,Soldier and Sportsperson what they crave for is appreciation, that their hard work and sacrifice is getting noticed and appreciated by everyone.thanks PM @narendramodi for your appreciation and good wishes. pic.twitter.com/T0naCT7mO7  In the lengthy note to the celebrated cricketer, the PM also lauded the calm demeanour with which Dhoni led the Indian team."No matter what hairstyle you sported, your calm head remained the same in victory or defeat, which is very important for every youth," he said referring to different hair cuts that Dhoni made famous after sporting an eye-catching long mane at the beginning of his career.Calling him one of the greatest captains and one of the best wicketkeepers the game has seen, Modi said, "Your dependability in tough situations and your style of finishing matches, particularly the 2011 World Cup final will forever be etched in the public memory for generations.""The correct way to assess your impact is as phenomenon." The 39-year-old stumper-batsman was widely considered a game-changer in international cricket and earned widespread respect for his foresight on the cricket field, which made punts look like well-thought-out strategy."Rising from humble beginnings in a small town, you burst onto the national scene, made a name for yourself and most importantly, made India proud," Modi wrote.The PM said Dhoni's rise and conduct "gives strength and inspiration to crores of youngsters who like you haven't been to cushy schools or colleges, neither do they belong to illustrious families, but they have the talent to distinguish themselves at the highest level."Modi concluded by wishing him the best for all his future endeavours.

20-08-2020||New Delhi||Sitaram Yechury flays government; bats for increasing demand||Speakers, including CPI(M) chief Sitaram Yechury while addressing a "Janata Parliament" organised, here, by Civil Society groups, on Wednesday flayed Union government's "skewed" policy, which has further weakened country's economy during the period of the lockdown."The only way to revive the economy is to take measures to increase the demand in the market. This has to be done by increasing the purchasing power of the people," Yechury said.The six-day "Janata Parliament", which started on Sunday, is being held through video conference.Yechury said the economy had started going downhill even before Covid-19 set in, but exacerbated during the lockdown.He suggested for public expenditure on roads and other infrastructure projects on a large scale which would provide jobs, and thus, enhance the purchasing power of the people.He said that the present regime's policy has allowed concentration of business profits and accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few.The disparity between haves and have-nots has been widened."This has further marginalised the major section of the society and eroded their confidence and their capacity to make purchases.The erosion of demand in the market in effect has wrecked the supply side, which has rocked the market dynamics and ruptured the economic cycle which also encompasses Consumption and Investment.He gave thumbs down to the government's policy to make available loans to SMEs as a relief package in order to revive the economy.It is ironical that no one wants to take loans as the entrepreneurs do not find the rationale to reboot their operations due to lack of demand in the market.He took a potshot at the present regime, saying it has been promoting "crony capitalism".The profit so amassed by a cabal is used to destabilise non-BJP governments in the state, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sitaram-yechury-flays-government-bats-for-increasing-demand-128854

Who appointed them as Trustees?" questioned Chidambaram.Chidambaram continued: "If the fund is a private established fund, why are donations to the Fund counted against CSR?""Who authorised MCA to make a retrospective amendment to the Schedule to the Companies Act inserting the name of PM-CARES Fund in the Schedule? Will MCA insert the names of other privately-established funds in the said Schedule to the Companies Act?" he asked.The former minister said that the retrospective amendment is in favour of a privately established fund which is obviously an act of favouritism and discriminatory.“It is abundantly clear that the BJP government is making desperate efforts to shield PM-CARES Fund from any kind of scrutiny,” he concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chidambaram-questions-pm-care-fund-128853

20-08-2020||New Delhi||At least 27 per cent students do not have access to smartphones, laptops: NCERT survey||At least 27 per cent students do not have access to smartphones or laptops to attend online classes, while 28 per cent students and parents believe intermittent or lack of electricity is one of the major concerns hindering teaching-learning, according to a survey by the NCERT.The survey with over 34,000 participants, including students, parents, teachers and school principals from Kendriya Vidyalayas, Navodyaya Vidyalas and CBSE-affiliated schools, has pointed out that lack of knowledge of using devices for effective educational purposes and teachers not being well-versed with online teaching methodologies caused hindrance in the learning process."Approximately 27 per cent of the students mentioned the non-availability of smartphones and laptops. The maximum number of stakeholders has opted for mobile phones as a medium for teaching-learning during the COVID-19 period," the survey by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) said."About 36 per cent of the students used the textbooks and other books available with them. Laptops were the second most favoured option amongst teachers and principals. Television and radio were the least utilised devices for the teaching-learning in the pandemic situation. The absence of enriched interaction between the teacher and the students was one of the reasons as identified by the stakeholders," it added.The survey noted that almost all of the responsive states use physical (non-digital) mechanisms to track the progress of learners with majority of them either practising home visit by teachers or systematic parental guidance via phone calls."About half of the students stated that they did not have the school textbooks. Although the e-text books are available on NCERT website and DIKSHA, the probable reasons behind this feedback are that students are used to studying from the hard copy of the textbooks; there is lack of awareness regarding the availability of the e-textbook and paucity of devices with students and teachers," it said.The majority of the stakeholders pointed out that mathematics as a subject was difficult to learn via online medium."Since mathematics contains a number of concepts which require interaction, continuous support, monitoring from the teacher and these aspects were lacking in the online mode of teaching."Next to mathematics, science was identified as the subject of concern since it contains several concepts and practical experiments which could only be done in the laboratory under the supervision of the teacher. A few stakeholders also found social science as a difficult subject to grasp through online classes," the survey said.It said that around 17 per cent of students identified languages as being a difficult subject to learn through online medium."Many students and parents felt the need for physical education classes through online mode, as physical fitness is the need of the hour to combat this pandemic. Arts education can help to reduce stress and boredom. Around 10 per cent of the stakeholders mentioned art education as a subject of concern," the survey said.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.A nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25. While several restrictions have been eased, schools and colleges continue to be closed.The prolonged closure of educational institutions has mandated a shift from classroom teaching to online learning.Based on the NCERT survey findings, the Ministry of Education has formulated Students' Learning Enhancement Guidelines."The guidelines will help children, who do not have digital resources to get learning opportunities at their homes, with their teachers or volunteers. Apart from this, it will also help in our efforts to overcome the learning deficiencies of all those students who are learning at home through various alternative ways using radio, television or smartphone," Union Minister of Education Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' said.The minister informed that the guidelines and models are suggested for three types of situations."First, in which students do not have any digital resources. Second, in which students have limited digital resources available. Last, in which students have digital resources available for online education," he said.

20-08-2020||New Delhi||Will give Bhushan time to reconsider statement refusing to apologise for contemptuous tweets: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday granted two days to activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who has been held guilty of contempt, to reconsider his 'defiant statement' refusing to apologise for his contemptuous tweets against the judiciary.Bhushan told a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra that he would consult his lawyers and think over the apex court's suggestion.Attorney General KK Venugopal urged the bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, not to award any punishment to Bhushan in the contempt case saying he had already been convicted.The bench said it could not consider the request of Venugopal unless Bhushan reconsidered his earlier stand of not apologising for his tweets.The tone, tenor and content of Bhushan's statement made it worse; is it defence or aggravation, the court told Venugopal.The top court said it could be very lenient if there is realisation of mistake, and posted the matter for further hearing on August 24.At the outset, it rejected the submission of Bhushan's counsel that another bench hear the arguments on the quantum of sentence to be awarded in the case.A contemnor can be punished with simple imprisonment of up to six months or with a fine of up to Rs 2,000 or with both.The bench gave assurance to Bhushan that no punishment would be acted upon till his review against the order convicting him is decided.The bench told senior advocate Dushyant Dave, representing Bhushan, that he is asking them to commit an “act of impropriety” by saying that the argument on sentencing be heard by another bench.Justice Mishra said he would be retiring soon and adjournment should not be sought and the review would be decided after this matter is decided finally.The bench said it is not inclined to hear the application filed by Bhushan on Wednesday seeking deferment of hearing on the sentence till his review petition is decided.At the outset, Dave sought deferment of hearing on the quantum of sentence in the case saying that he would be filing a review petition against the conviction order. The top court on August 14 held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for his derogatory tweets against the judiciary saying they could not be said to be a fair criticism of the functioning of the judiciary made in the public interest. During the hearing on Thursday, Dave told the bench that “heavens are not going to fall” if the apex court will suspend the hearing on quantum of sentence.“You are asking us to commit an act of impropriety that arguments on sentencing should be heard by another bench,” the bench said. It added: “Has it been ever done that hearing on sentencing has been undertaken by the other bench when the main bench is existing?”The bench told the Attorney General that it would first hear Bhushan on the issue of sentencing. When Dave said that Venugopal should be allowed to argue first, the bench said, “Don't remind us of the professional norms.”Bhushan, who himself addressed the court, said he had been “grossly misunderstood”. “I am dismayed and disappointed that the court did not find it necessary to provide me the copy of the contempt petition,” he said. “My tweets simply showed my bona fide belief.”Bhushan said that open criticism is necessary in democracy to safeguard the constitutional order. “My tweets were a small attempt to discharge what I consider my highest duty,” he said."I do not ask for mercy. I do not appeal for magnanimity. I cheerfully submit to any punishment that the court may impose," said Bhushan.On August 14, in its 108-page verdict, the top court had said: “The tweets which are based on the distorted facts, in our considered view, amount to committing criminal contempt.“In the result, we hold alleged contemnor No.1, Prashant Bhushan, guilty of having committed criminal contempt of this court.”The top court had, however, discharged the notice issued to Twitter Inc, California, US, in the contempt case after accepting its explanation that it is only an intermediary and does not have any control on what the users post on the platform.It had said the company has also shown its bona fides immediately after the cognisance was taken by this court as it had suspended both the tweets.The top court had analysed the two tweets of Bhushan posted on the micro-blogging site on June 27 on the functioning of judiciary in the past six years, and on July 22 with regard to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde."In our considered view, it cannot be said that the tweets can be said to be a fair criticism of the functioning of the judiciary, made bona fide in the public interest," it had said.

20-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant case politicised to 'malign' Mumbai Police: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Thursday claimed the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death was politicised to "malign" the Mumbai Police and the Maharashtra government.If the FIR registered in Patna was right, then if other "characters" in the case who hail from other states file an FIR in West Bengal, will the Kolkata Police get power to investigate it? the Shiv Sena asked.The Mumbai Police's probe in the case was in the final stages when it was stopped and handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the recommendation of the Bihar government, the ruling party in Maharashtra said.It is surprising that even though the court found nothing wrong in the Mumbai Police's probe, the case has been handed over to the CBI, the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana'."Several criminal cases in Bihar were investigated by the CBI. How many real culprits did the CBI arrest so far?Sushant's case was politicised only to malign the Mumbai Police and the Maharashtra government," it said.Rajput, 34, was found hanging at his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14, and since then the Mumbai Police were probing the case keeping in mind various angles.The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the transfer of the FIR, lodged in Patna against actress Rhea Chakraborty and others for allegedly abetting Rajput's suicide, to the CBI.The apex court said the Bihar government is competent to transfer the case to the CBI for investigation.The Shiv Sena said the Mumbai Police were investigating "to unveil the mystery of why Rajput committed suicide"."It is an illusion that only the CBI or Bihar Police can unearth the truth. There is no harm in the CBI taking over any case from any state. But this would be an encroachment on the state's rights," it said."Today, the Indian Constitution will be shedding tears if it is observed that quarantining a Bihar Police official in Mumbai gives rise to suspicion due to which the case is handed over to the CBI," the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.

20-08-2020||New Delhi||Continuous rain submerges swathes of Delhi-NCR; IMD issues alert for heavy showers||Many parts of the national capital and key road stretches remained flooded as rains continued to drench the city on Thursday, triggering traffic snarls during morning rush hours.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned of heavy rains in the city on Thursday as well.The downpour may lead to "major traffic disruption" due to heavy water logging and there is an "increased chance" of road accidents, it warned.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, recorded 46 mm rainfall between 8:30 am on Wednesday and 8:30 am on Thursday.                  On an average, the city gauges 11.3 mm rainfall from 8:30 am on August 19 to 8:30 am on August 20 every year.The Palam weather station gauged 70.9 mm precipitation during the period, more than six times the normal rainfall.            The Delhi Traffic Police remained busy clearing traffic on Narela-Bawana road, Raja Garden flyover, Kasturba Underpass, MB Rad, Jhandewalan Mandir, Jhilmil underpass, Azadpur vegetable market, Sarai Pipal Thala, Jahangirpuri, Madanpur Khadar among other places.               Similar scenes played out on Wednesday, as incessant rains pummelled the national capital region, submerging roads, underpasses and parks in waist-deep water and bringing traffic on key stretches to a virtual halt.The flooding was particularly severe in Gurugram, where roads turned into small rivers and parks resembled swimming pools.Just a few hours of rains flooded swathes of Delhi, spelling trouble for commuters who remained stuck for hours on water-logged roads.             Pictures and videos of vehicles and people wading through waist-deep water were widely shared on social media.The rains also crippled electricity supply in many areas.Civic bodies reported incidents of uprooting of trees in a few areas due to the rains.A boundary wall of a school in Saket collapsed, damaging several vehicles parked alongside it.  Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, said climate change had led to a change rain pattern.             Earlier, we used to witness continuous light rains over two-three days. Nowadays, the same quantum of rainfall occurs in just 2-3 hours. These extreme events have been taking place across the tropical region since last 10 years," he said.Experts said the flooding was a result of bad urban planning."Flooding in Indian cities is largely a product of bad urban planning. In Delhi, the Yamuna floodplains have been encroached upon obstructing the natural water flow. Other issues include deforestation, poor drainage system and lack of integrated urban planning," Anjal Prakash, research director, Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, said.  Kuldeep Srivastava,the head of regional forecasting center of the IMD, said the axis of monsoon will remain close to the national capital till Thursday. Therefore, more rains are likely.Southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea and southeasterly winds from the Bay of Bengal are also feeding moisture to the region, he said.The downpour also reduced the rain deficiency in the capital -- from 13 per cent on Monday to 11 per cent on Wednesday.The Safdarjung Observatory has recorded 147.4 mm rainfall against the normal of 165.2 mm in August so far.              Overall, it has recorded 466 mm rainfall, six per cent more than the normal of 441.3 mm since June 1 when the monsoon season starts.

20-08-2020||Mumbai||'One in four Indians could have been infected with coronavirus'||At least one in four people in India may have been infected with the coronavirus - a much higher number than official government figures suggest, the head of leading private laboratory says.Dr A Velumani said an analysis of 270,000 antibody tests conducted by his company Thyrocare across India showed the presence of antibodies in an average of 26 per cent of the people, indicating they had already been exposed to the coronavirus."This is a much higher percentage than we had expected. The presence of antibodies is uniform across all age groups, including children," Velumani told Reuters.Thyrocare's findings are in line with government surveys done in Indian cities such as Mumbai, which showed that 57 per cent of the population in its crowded slum areas had been exposed to the coronavirus.The Thyrocare survey covers paid and tested patients, covering 600 cities in India for the last seven weeks, Velumani added. If the current trend continues, the percentage of India's population having antibodies may reach 40 per cent before the end of December.India currently has a total of 2.8 million cases, third only behind Brazil and the United States globally, but active patients are less than a fourth of its total caseload, according to health ministry figures.On Wednesday, the world's second-most populous country reported more than 64,000 new cases of the novel coronavirus in a single day, with more than 1,000 deaths in the same period.Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-in-four-indians-could-have-been-infected-with-coronavirus-128830
20-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt will fully cooperate with CBI in Sushant case: Pawar||NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday said the Maharashtra government would fully cooperate with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for probe in the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death.Pawar said he was sure that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government would respect the Supreme Court's order upholding transfer of Patna police's FIR in the case to the CBI.Rajput, 34, was found hanging at his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14.The NCP is a constituent of the Maha Vikas Aghadi and party leader Anil Deshmukh holds the Home portfolio.Pawar said he was hopeful that the investigation in the actor's death would not be carried on the way it happened in rationalist Narendra Dabholkar’s murder case, which had remained unresolved.Dabholkar, a well-known anti-superstition activist, was shot dead on August 20, 2013, in Pune."I am sure the Maharashtra Govt will respect the judgement of the Supreme Court to handover Sushant Singh Rajputs case to the CBI and fully cooperate in the investigation process," Pawar tweeted."I hope the investigation will not be carried on, as was done with Dr Narendra Dabholkars murder case also under investigation by the #CBI which commenced in 2014 and remains unresolved,” the former Union minister said.After Rajput was found hanging in June, the Mumbai police started a probe and recorded statements of 56 people, including the late actor's sisters, actress Rhea Chakraborty and some other film personalities.Rajput's father KK Singh had lodged a separate complaint with the Patna police in connection with the actor's death and the Bihar government later recommended a CBI probe into the case.The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the transfer of the FIR, lodged in Patna against Rhea Chakraborty and others for allegedly abetting Rajput's suicide, to the CBI.The apex court said the Bihar government is competent to transfer the case to the CBI for investigation.

20-08-2020||New Delhi||Rahul suited best for top post: Congress||Settling the debate on a non-Gandhi president, the Congress today publicly said Rahul Gandhi should assume the leadership and that he was the suited best for the role having singularly taken on PM Narendra Modi all these years since 2014.“All party workers want Rahul to lead us,” the Congress said after AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s one-year old interview made news for her remarks that she supported Rahul’s assertions for a non-family chief.Vadra’s remarks, the Congress said, were made in July last year and the situation has since changed with the party rank and file, hoping for Rahul to return as president.In the interview published in new book entitled “India Tomorrow: Conversations with the Next Generation of Political Leaders”, Priyanka is quoted as saying there were plenty of leaders capable of leading the Congress. The Grand Old Party, however, distanced itself from the interview.“The Nehru-Gandhi family has held together and served the Congress unmindful of the trappings of power. In 2004, Sonia Gandhi set an example by sacrificing power to serve the party. In 2019, Rahul showed the courage of conviction and stepped down as the Congress president. We at Congress appreciate the sudden media interest (egged on by the BJP) in the year-old remark. The context today is to take on the vicious attack on India’s polity by Modi-Shah dispensation and fight it fearlessly on front foot,” said AICC media chief Randeep Surjewala, hinting at where the party stood on the issue. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-suited-best-for-top-post-congress-128644

20-08-2020||---||Will finish pending projects by next year, India assures Bangladesh||New Delhi, August 19Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla wound up his two-day dash to Dhaka during which he discussed stepping up exchange of intelligence, sharing of Covid vaccine, possibility of several projects being completed next year and a roadmap for Indian developmental assistance with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and his counterpart Masud Bin Momen.The importance of the visit can be gauged from the fact that this was Shringla’s first visit since the pandemic broke out. Similarly, Shringla was Hasina’s first overseas visitor since March.Joint plans for Sheikh Mujib’s centenaryDuring his visit to Dhaka, Foreign Secretary HV Shringla discussed with PM Sheikh Hasina joint plans to observe Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary and the 50th anniversary of Indo-Bangladesh ties. India is likely to release a postage stamp of Sheikh Mujib.“I had a very satisfactory visit, a very short visit,” Shringla told the media in Dhaka. “When vaccine is developed, friends, partners, and neighbours will get it without any saying… for us Bangladesh is always a priority,” he said.“The reason is that our PM felt during Covid time there is not much contact, but the relationship (India-Bangladesh) must continue. We must continue to move forward towards our strong bilateral relations and I came primarily to look at that point,” he said.The Indian side opted to play up the intelligence-sharing angle in view of the dire strait of Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh amidst reports that their poverty was a breeding ground for criminal activity as well as radicalisation. Given India’s sensitivity on Pakistan once again trying to revive its network, this time through the Rohingyas, it was decided to hold a meeting between the two foreign ministers in the near future.Shringla explained to Hasina the Indian approach to contributing to Bangladesh’s development, including easy loans and possibility of completing several projects such as the Akhaura-Agartala rail link and the Khulna thermal plant on time to the mark the 50th anniversary of Indo-Bangladesh ties. He also spoke on the starting of a cargo ferry service and discussed the plans for an air bubble between the two nations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-finish-pending-projects-by-next-year-india-assures-bangladesh-128760
