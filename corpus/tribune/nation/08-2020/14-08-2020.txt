14-08-2020||Mumbai||Cops launch probe into ‘derogatory’ posts about Disha Salian||The Mumbai Police have initiated an inquiry into the complaint filed by the father of Disha Salian, former manager of late Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, about the “derogatory” posts shared on social media linked to his daughter’s death, an official said on Friday.Based on the complaint filed by Disha’s father Satish Salian a couple of days back, the Malvani police have launched an inquiry and the process of recording statements is on, the official said.Disha died on June 8 after allegedly jumping off the 14th floor of a building in Mumbai’s Malad. An accidental death case was registered in the alleged suicide. On June 14, Rajput was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai.Her father had recently written a letter to the police alleging that “derogatory” posts were being shared by people that defamed his deceased daughter and his family.“Salian lodged the complaint with the Malvani police against three persons, including actor Puneet Vashist, for tarnishing the reputation of their daughter through social media posts and for spreading rumours,” the police official said.Disha’s father had also requested the police to take action against the people concerned for their “insensitive act” towards his family, he said.In his letter to the police, Salian had said that the “news about her (Disha’s) involvement with any politician or attending parties with big names of the film fraternity, rape and murder are all stories cooked up by media people just to sell it to channels and these stories hold no truth”.          “The Malvani police, who are probing the case of Disha’s death, have also started an inquiry into the complaint filed by her father. Accordingly, statements of a few persons are being recorded in this connection,” the official said.The police have made an appeal to the people to come forward with any evidence or information linked to the case.Actor Sooraj Pancholi had recently submitted a complaint to the police over him being linked to the case of death of fellow actor Sushant Singh Rajput.“In the complaint filed at Versova police station, Pancholi had also accused Puneet Vashist of linking his name with the death case and using derogatory content in his Facebook post,” the official said.

14-08-2020||---||Coronavirus: How can there be exams without teaching, petitioners wonder||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 14 Maintaining that there is a direct nexus between examinations and teaching, several questioned the rationale behind the University Grants Commission’s decision asking universities to hold examinations without properly covering the syllabus before the Supreme Court on Friday.“How can there be exams without teaching?" senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi wondered while arguing before a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan.Linking education with right to life, he said a large section of students would have to travel long distances to the examination centres which would increase the health risk during COVID19 pandemic as many of the students would be forced to use public transport.Singhvi wondered how examinations could be conducted as educational institutions had been closed for almost five months on government’s orders.Another senior counsel Shyam Divan, representing one of the petitioners, also questioned the UGC’s circular mandating final year examinations by September 30.As arguments remained inconclusive, the Bench posted the matter for further hearing on August 18. It had earlier already refused to stay the UGC's decision.The UGC had on Monday questioned the decisions taken by governments of Maharashtra and Delhi to cancel final year examinations of state universities in view of COVID-19, saying they went against rules. Not holding examinations will not be in students' interest as their degrees may not be recognized if the states would act unilaterally and cancel final year examinations in violation of UGC norms, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had said on behalf of the UGC.States couldn't change the UGC rules which only the regular of higher education was empowered to prescribe for awarding degrees, Mehta said while opposing the decisions of Delhi and Maharashtra governments to cancel final year examinations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-how-can-there-be-exams-without-teaching-petitioners-wonder-126508
14-08-2020||New Delhi||India, Nepal to hold talks under ‘oversight mechanism’ on Aug 17: MEA||India and Nepal will hold talks on August 17 under their “oversight mechanism” for reviewing all bilateral economic and developmental projects in the Himalayan nation, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Friday.This would be the first major engagement since bilateral ties came under strain after the Himalayan nation came up with a new political map in May.Asked about reports that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Nepalese counterpart KP Sharma Oli could have a telephonic conversation on August 15, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “I have no information on this, I need to check.”On whether the issue of floods in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar could come up for discussion in the upcoming bilateral “oversight mechanism” talks and if any high-level dialogue between the two countries is proposed, he said: “On the scheduled oversight mechanism, I think you are referring to the meeting which is to take place on August 17.”This “oversight mechanism” was set up in 2016 to review all bilateral economic and developmental projects in Nepal, he said.This meeting will review all such projects across Nepal, Srivastava said.Earlier this week, official sources said Indian Ambassador Vinay Mohan Kwatra and Nepal’s Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi are scheduled to hold talks on August 17 in Kathmandu under the oversight mechanism.Asked about Nepalese Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali’s reported remarks that the 1947 agreement among India, Nepal and the United Kingdom that deals with the military service of Gorkha soldiers has become “redundant”, Srivastava said: “We are aware of the remark but we have no information on any official communication in this regard.”Srivastava also asserted that he has made India's stance clear several times and had nothing more to add.In June, Nepal’s Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it.In its reaction, after Nepal’s lower house of Parliament approved the bill, India termed as untenable the “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims by the neighbouring country.India had said Nepal’s action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks.Meanwhile, to a separate question on former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad raking up the Kashmir issue, Srivastava said: “You are aware of the outlook and position of Mahatir Mohamad on this issue.”“As the saying goes, you are known by the company you keep,” he said in an apparent reference to Mohammad’s closeness to Pakistan.Asked if any development has taken place on the extradition of Zakir Naik, he said India was in touch with the Malaysian government on the issue.Naik, a 54-year-old radical Islamic preacher wanted by the Indian authorities for alleged money laundering and inciting extremism through hate speeches, left India in 2016 and subsequently moved to the largely Muslim Malaysia, where he was granted permanent residency when Mahathir was the prime minister.On the case of the Income Tax Department detaining a 42-year-old Chinese man, identified as Charlie Peng, alleged to be the kingpin of a money-laundering racket, Srivastava said: “We have seen the reports and we are awaiting more information at this stage.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-nepal-to-hold-talks-under-oversight-mechanism-on-aug-17-mea-126507

Saheb (Sharad Pawar) has made comments on it, it is a family matter,” Rohit Pawar told reporters in Ahmednagar, refusing to say anything more.Sharad Pawar had said on Wednesday that he gave no importance to Parth’s demand for a CBI probe.Rohit, however, spoke about “politicisation” of Rajput’s alleged suicide against the backdrop of coming elections in Bihar, the actor’s home state.“Today, news came that a Maharashtra BJP leader will oversee the BJP’s election preparations in Bihar,” he said, apparently referring to Devendra Fadnavis.“The BJP had been raising the issue (Rajput’s death). The issue was being politicised from the beginning and now there is clarity (about why it was politicised),” the NCP MLA said.

14-08-2020||New Delhi||India believes in peace but also capable of giving befitting response to any attempt of aggression: Prez Kovind||President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday said while India believed in peace, it was also capable of giving a befitting response to any attempt of aggression as shown by its troops in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh after “some in our neighbourhood”, a veiled reference to China, tried to carry out their “misadventure of expansion”.In his address to the nation on the eve of the 74th Independence Day, Kovind also spoke about the ‘Aatmanirbhar’ initiative launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and allayed fears of foreign investors saying India’s self-reliance means being self-sufficient without alienating or creating distance from the world, with which it would continue to engage.Touching upon the COVID-19 pandemic, Kovind said: “The nation is indebted to doctors, nurses and other health workers who have been continuously on the forefront of the fight against the disease which has disrupted all activities world over and taken a huge toll.”India’s COVID-19 caseload surpassed 24 lakh on Friday after 64,553 more people tested positive and the recoveries rose to over 17 lakh, according to the Health Ministry.He also complimented the Modi government, noting it is very reassuring to note that the Centre while anticipating the tremendous challenge responded effectively and well in time. “For a country so vast and diverse with high population density, meeting this challenge requires super-human efforts.”Without taking China’s name, the President said: “While the world community needs to fight together against the greatest challenge (COVID-19) before humanity, some in our neighbourhood tried to carry out their misadventure of expansion.”He saluted the brave soldiers who laid down their lives defending the country’s borders.“Those worthy sons of ‘Bharat Mata’ lived and died for national pride. The entire nation salutes the martyrs of Galwan Valley. Every Indian feels grateful to their family members,” he said.As many as 20 personnel of the Indian army were killed during clashes with the Chinese PLA in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15.“Their bravery in combat has demonstrated that while we believe in peace, we are also capable of giving a befitting response to any attempt of aggression. We are proud of the members of our Armed Forces, paramilitary forces and police personnel who protect the borders and ensure our internal security.”The President also said construction of the temple at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya “was indeed a moment of pride for all”. Prime Minister Modi performed the ‘bhoomi poojan’ for the Ram temple on August 5.“People of the country maintained restraint and patience for a long time and reposed unflinching trust in the judicial system. The issue of Ram Janmabhoomi was resolved through the judicial process.”All concerned parties and the people respectfully accepted the verdict of the Supreme Court and displayed before the world, Indian ethos of peace, non-violence, love and harmony, he said.Talking about the economy, the President said it had been the tradition of India that “we do not just live for ourselves, but work for the well-being of the entire world”.“India’s self-reliance means being self-sufficient without alienating or creating distance from the world. It implies that India will continue to engage with the world economy while maintaining its identity,” President Kovind said, adding that the overwhelming support India got at the elections for the non-permanent seat of the United Nations Security Council was a testimony to the goodwill we enjoy internationally.The year 2020 had taught some tough lessons to the world as the “invisible virus has demolished the illusion that human being is the master of nature”, he said, adding he believed it is still not too late for humanity to correct its course and live in harmony with nature and ensure that 21st century is remembered as the century when humanity put aside differences and collaborated to save the planet.The pandemic, like climate change, has awakened the global community to our shared destiny.In my view, ‘human-centric collaboration’ was more important than ‘economy-centric inclusion’, in the present context, he said, adding “the greater this change, the better it will be for the humanity”.He said the second lesson was that “we are all equal before nature and we primarily depend on our fellow residents for survival and growth”.“Coronavirus does not recognize any artificial divisions created by human society. This reinforces the belief that we need to rise above all man-made differences, prejudices, and barriers. Compassion and mutual help have been adopted as basic values by the people in India. We need to further strengthen this virtue in our conduct. Only then can we create a better future for all of us.”He also said it was time for augmenting health infrastructure as public hospitals and laboratories had been leading the fight against COVID-19.“Public health services have helped the poor cope with the pandemic. In view of this, public health infrastructure needs to be expanded and strengthened,” he added.The President, while speaking about the lessons learnt, mentioned that the pandemic has highlighted the need to accelerate developments in science and technology.“During the lockdown and subsequent unlocking, information and communication technology has emerged as an effective tool for governance, education, business, office work and social connect. It has helped meet the twin objectives of saving lives and resumption of activities,” he said.He highlighted that government offices, as well as the judiciary, had been extensively using a virtual interface to discharge their functions and technology had enabled certain establishments in government and private sectors to work overtime to keep the wheels of the economy running.“Thus, we have learnt the lesson that adoption of science and technology, in harmony with nature, will help sustain our survival and growth,” he said.Kovind also spoke about the New Education Policy unveiled recently, and said he was confident that with the implementation of this policy, a new quality education system would be developed and this will transform the future challenges into opportunities, paving the way for a New India.He said when India won freedom, many predicted that our experiment with democracy would not last long....“but we have always nurtured them as our strengths that make the largest democracy in the world so vibrant. India has to continue playing its leading role for the betterment of humanity”.He complimented people for showing patience and wisdom being demonstrated in coping with the pandemic has been appreciated all over the world.“I am confident that you will continue to maintain caution and act responsibly,” the President said.India had a lot to offer to the global community, especially for intellectual and spiritual enrichment and promotion of world peace, he said and added: “With this spirit, I offer a prayer for the well-being of one and all.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-believes-in-peace-but-also-capable-of-giving-befitting-response-to-any-attempt-of-aggression-prez-kovind-126499

14-08-2020||Lucknow||Hapur rape accused shot, captured, say police||Uttar Pradesh Police on Friday a man accused of kidnapping and brutally raping a six-year-old girl in Hapur district last week, officials saidThe suspect, Dalpat, was shot in the leg when he allegedly snatched a policeman’s gun and tried to flee after his arrest, police said.  The child was allegedly kidnapped on August 6 evening while playing outside her house in Garhmukteshwar Kotwali area. She was found a day later in critical condition in a field where the accused left her to die. The victim has been undergoing treatment in Meerut and her condition remains critical.Hapur Police Chief Sanjeev Suman said: “Dalpat was taken to the site of the crime for investigation after his arrest where he snatched a policeman’s pistol and tried to fire at them. He was hit on the leg in retaliatory firing, and has been admitted to a hospital”. The doctor at the hospital said Dalpat had a bullet wound in his leg but was out of danger.The suspect will be questioned as soon as he is out of the hospital, a police official added.Earlier this week, the police had released a photo of the suspect days after three sketches were released based on the statements of the victim’s parents and neighbours. For the last few days Dalpat carried a reward of Rs 50,000 as police sought information about the attacker and was under pressure to solve the case.Earlier on Friday, the Amroha police had found a set of clothes, an identity card and a purported suicide note from Dalpat that said that he did not want to be killed in an encounter and was choosing other means to end his life.“I know I will be killed in an encounter and I do not want to die like that. I will choose my own means to end life. Please do not harass my children,” the note read.Police, however, were suspicious about the note and said it could be an attempt to mislead the investigations.“Till we trace him or his body or any evidence to corroborate it, we are not going to rely on the suicide note. We are trying to match the handwriting on suicide note with the original,” said a senior police official.The ‘suicide’ note were found near Mehmoodpur village in Amroha, where accused Dalpat Singh lived. The villagers had reportedly spotted Dalpat with country-made liquor on the outskirts of his native village on Monday and informed the police. But Dalpat gave the police team a slip.

14-08-2020||New Delhi||India believes in peace but also capable of giving befitting response: President on Galwan Valley clashes||President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday said while India believes in peace it is also capable of giving a befitting response to any attempt of aggression as shown by its troops in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh after “some in our neighbourhood”, a veiled reference to China, tried to carry out their “misadventure of expansion”.In his address to the nation on the eve of the 74th Independence Day, Kovind also spoke about the ‘Aatmanirbhar’ initiative launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and allayed fears of foreign investors saying India’s self-reliance means being self-sufficient without alienating or creating distance from the world, with which it would continue to engage.Touching upon the COVID-19 pandemic, Kovind said the nation is indebted to doctors, nurses and other health workers who have been continuously on the forefront of the fight against the disease which has disrupted all activities world over and taken a huge toll. India’s COVID-19 caseload surpassed 24 lakh on Friday after 64,553 more people tested positive and the recoveries rose to over 17 lakh, according to the Health Ministry.He also complimented the Modi government, noting it is very reassuring to note that the Centre while anticipating the tremendous challenge responded effectively and well in time. “For a country so vast and diverse with high population density, meeting this challenge requires super-human efforts,” he said.    Without taking China’s name, the President said “while the world community needs to fight together against the greatest challenge (COVID-19) before humanity, some in our neighbourhood tried to carry out their misadventure of expansion”.He saluted the brave soldiers who laid down their lives defending the country’s borders.“Those worthy sons of ‘Bharat Mata’ lived and died for national pride. The entire nation salutes the martyrs of Galwan Valley. Every Indian feels grateful to their family members,” he said. Twenty personnel of the Indian army were killed during clashes with the Chinese PLA in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15.“Their bravery in combat has demonstrated that while we believe in peace, we are also capable of giving a befitting response to any attempt of aggression. We are proud of the members of our Armed Forces, paramilitary forces and police personnel who protect the borders, and ensure our internal security.”     The President also said construction of the temple at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya “was indeed a moment of pride for all”. Prime Minister Modi performed the ‘Bhoomi Pujan’ for the Ram temple on August 5.“People of the country maintained restraint and patience for a long time and reposed unflinching trust in the judicial system. The issue of Ram Janmabhoomi was resolved through judicial process.” All concerned parties and the people respectfully accepted the verdict of the Supreme Court and displayed before the world, Indian ethos of peace, non-violence, love and harmony, he said.Talking about the economy, the President said it has been the tradition of India that “we do not just live for ourselves, but work for the well-being of the entire world.“India’s self-reliance means being self-sufficient without alienating or creating distance from the world. It implies that India will continue to engage with the world economy while maintaining its identity.” President Kovind said the overwhelming support India got at the elections for the non-permanent seat of the United Nations Security Council is a testimony to the goodwill we enjoy internationally.The year 2020 had taught some tough lessons to the world as the “invisible virus has demolished the illusion that human being is the master of nature”, he said, adding he believed it is still not too late for humanity to correct its course and live in harmony with nature and ensure that 21st century is remembered as the century when humanity put aside differences and collaborated to save the planet.The pandemic, like climate change, has awakened the global community to our shared destiny.In my view, ‘human-centric collaboration’ is more important than ‘economy-centric inclusion’, in the present context, he said, adding “the greater this change, the better it will be for the humanity.He said the second lesson was that “we are all equal before nature and we primarily depend on our fellow residents for survival and growth. “Coronavirus does not recognise any artificial divisions created by human society. This reinforces the belief that we need to rise above all man-made differences, prejudices, and barriers. Compassion and mutual help have been adopted as basic values by the people in India. We need to further strengthen this virtue in our conduct. Only then can we create a better future for all of us.”       He also said it was time for augmenting health infrastructure as public hospitals and laboratories have been leading the fight against COVID-19.“Public health services have helped the poor cope with the pandemic. In view of this, public health infrastructure needs to be expanded and strengthened,” he added.The President, while speaking about the lessons learnt, mentioned that the pandemic has highlighted the need to accelerate developments in science and technology.“During the lockdown and subsequent unlocking, information and communication technology has emerged as an effective tool for governance, education, business, office work and social connect. It has helped meet the twin objectives of saving lives and resumption of activities,” he said.He highlighted that government offices as well as judiciary has been extensively using virtual interface to discharge their functions and technology has enabled certain establishments in government and private sectors to work overtime to keep the wheels of the economy running.“Thus, we have learnt the lesson that adoption of science and technology, in harmony with nature, will help sustain our survival and growth,” he said.Kovind also spoke about the New Education Policy unveiled recently, and said he was confident that with the implementation of this policy, a new quality education system will be developed and this will transform the future challenges into opportunities, paving the way for a New India.He said when India won freedom, many predicted that our experiment with democracy will not last long “but we have always nurtured them as our strengths that make the largest democracy in the world so vibrant. India has to continue playing its leading role for the betterment of humanity”.He complimented people for showing patience and wisdom being demonstrated in coping with the pandemic has been appreciated all over the world.“I am confident that you will continue to maintain caution and act responsibly,” the President said.India has a lot to offer to the global community, especially for intellectual and spiritual enrichment and promotion of world-peace, he said and added, “With this spirit, I offer a prayer for the well-being of one and all”.

14-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi violence: Court grants police time till Sep 17 to complete probe in UAPA case||A Delhi court has granted an extension till September 17 to the police to complete investigation against 10 people booked under the stringent anti-terror law UAPA in a case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi in February.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat allowed the police further time to complete its pending probe against Jamia Coordination Committee member Meeran Haider; Jamia students Asif Iqbal Tanha and Gulfisha Khatoon; Jamia Alumni Association President Shifa-Ur-Rehman; JNU students and Pinjra Tod members Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita; suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain; former Congress Councillor Ishrat Jahan; and United Against Hate member Khalid and Shadab Ahmed.The court had earlier extended time till August 14 for completion of the investigation against Khalid and Jahan, till August 24 in case of Rehman and till August 29 for Haider, Hussain and Khatoon.The court in its August 13 order said that the investigation was still going on regarding the conspiracy which was “deep rooted, large scale and multi-layered” and all different aspects pertaining to different accused persons, including inter-linkages, were being investigated as regard to the conspiracy.“Specific reasons for seeking extension have been set out and compelling reasons qua each individual accused of their custody and the investigation so far is also borne out from the case diaries. The number of witnesses has been examined in the case and even statements of witnesses including protected witnesses have been recorded which points to the conspiracy and role of accused persons and others,” it said.The court further stated that the role of various organisations involving different accused and different groups were being investigated.“The role of other persons, having links to accused persons, who may be involved in the conspiracy has also come during the investigation. The huge electronic data and evidence were being examined. The money trail/ suspicious funding for riots was also being investigated. The role of other accused persons was also under examination. The new facts that have emerged during the investigation have to be confronted. The different dimensions of conspiracy including organisations, WhatsApp groups and different accused persons and their inter-linkages along with the electronic records among other things were being investigated,” the court said.During the hearing held through video conferencing, Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad told the court that after seeing the case file, he was satisfied with the progress of the investigation conducted so far against all the 10 accused and it was not possible to complete the probe within their period of detention.He further said the investigation could not be completed for Khalid and Jahan by August 14 in view of the inter-linkages and overall conspiracy.The police sought extension of time till September 17 for concluding investigation against the 10 accused, under section 43D (2) (b) of the anti-terror law.Section 43-D (2) of UAPA provides that if it is not possible to complete the investigation within the 90-day period, then upon the report of the public prosecutor indicating the progress of the probe and the specific reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the 90 days period, after satisfaction, the court can extend the period of the probe to 180 days.The counsels for some of the accused opposed the application saying since the earlier application for extension of the investigation was allowed for 60 days, the second application cannot be allowed as the extension has to be one time only.To this, the court said that if conditions were being met, it can extend the period of investigation by another 90 days and it would depend on the stage and progress of the probe in the case.United Against Hate was a citizens’ campaign launched in 2017 to protest against series of lynching in the country and was allegedly involved in the violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in which financial support was provided by the PFI, formed in 2006 in Kerala as a successor to the National Democratic Front (NDF).Pinjra Tod (Break the Cage) was founded in 2015 to make hostels and paying guest accommodations less restrictive for women students.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

14-08-2020||New Delhi||Sino-India row: Cannot state of border and future of our ties, says MEA||The Ministry of External Affairs said on Friday that while it appreciated the complexity of disengagement of troops from the Line of Actual Control (LAC), it called on the Chinese side to sincerely work towards that objective. The comments by MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava come against the backdrop of slow process of disengagement in some areas, near-nothing progress in others and the Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong stating that the onus lies on India.On a parallel track, India has been narrowing the space for Chinese trade and investments with its telecom majors expected to lose out on the forthcoming 5G tenders. Goods of Chinese origin are also being barred from governmental purchases and while there has been record foreign direct investment in recent months, Chinese companies did not get any piece of the action.  Meanwhile, Indian Ambassador Vikram Misri held another meeting in Beijing to persuade the Chinese forces to act as per the spirit of the talks between Special Representatives (SR) for Border Talks---National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. He met a serving general in the Chinese Central Military Commission on Friday and informed him about India’s stance vis-à-vis the situation on the borders in eastern Ladakh UT. On Wednesday, Misri had met a senior official from the Chinese Communist Party to discuss the tensions along the LAC. MEA official spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said several meetings of WMCC and also of Senior Commanders have taken place to discuss the implementation of the ongoing disengagement process as well as further steps to ensure it is completed at the earliest. Further meetings are likely to happen in the near future. Last month too, Srivastava had said both sides have agreement on broad principles of disengagement and based on it, some progress has been made.“I must add that translating these principles on ground is a complex process that requires re-deployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC. It is natural that this can be done only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions,” he said on Friday.“While we would like the ongoing disengagement process to be completed at the earliest, it is important to bear in mind that achieving this requires agreed actions by both sides. We therefore expect that the Chinese side to sincerely work with us towards the objective of complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquility in the border areas as agreed by the Special Representatives,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sino-india-row-cannot-state-of-border-and-future-of-our-ties-says-mea-126465

14-08-2020||New Delhi||India exported 23 lakh PPE to 5 countries in July: Health Ministry||India exported 23 lakh personal protection equipment to five countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and the UAE in July, after the government relaxed export norms and this had substantially helped the country to position itself in the global market of these kits, the Union Health Ministry said.The other two countries are Senegal and Slovania, it said.According to the Ministry, the ‘Make in India’ spirit “embedded in the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan has resulted in providing resilience and self-sufficiency” to the country for various medical equipment, including PPE.While the Union Government is supplying PPE kits, N95 masks, ventilators etc, to the state governments and Union Territories administrations, states are also procuring these items directly.“Between March and August 2020, they have procured 1.40 crore indigenous PPE from their own budgetary resources. During the same period, the Centre has distributed 1.28 crore PPE to states, UTs and central institutions, free of cost,” the Ministry said in a statement.The Centre has been leading the graded, pre-emptive, proactive and collaborative response and management of COVID-19, along with the states and the Union Territories.As part of its continued efforts towards progressively augmenting and strengthening the medical infrastructure across the country, various policy decisions have been taken on a regular basis.At the start of the pandemic, there was a global shortage of all kinds of medical equipment including N95 masks, PPE kits, ventilators etc, the Ministry underlined.Most of the products were not being manufactured in the country in the beginning as many of the necessary components were to be procured from other countries. The rising global demand due to the pandemic resulted in their scarce availability in the foreign markets, it stated.“Turning the pandemic into an opportunity to develop its domestic market for the production of medical equipment, with the combined efforts of Ministries of Health, Textiles and Pharmaceuticals, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, the Defence Research and Development Organisation and others, India has hugely ramped up its own manufacturing capacity,” the Ministry said.“In view of the strengthened domestic production capacity and having met the domestic requirements for PPE, the revised notification of the Director-General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in July permitted export of these kits. As a result of this relaxation, in the month of July itself, India exported 23 lakh PPE to five countries. These include the USA, the UK, the UAE, Senegal and Slovania. This has substantially aided India to position itself in the global export market of PPE,” the statement said.

Prior to my seat being changed, I was safe and part of the government. Then I thought why our Speaker and chief whip have given me a seat here? I thought for two minutes and then saw that this is a border. On one side is the ruling party and on the other is the Opposition. Who is sent to the border? The strongest warrior is sent,” Pilot said, interrupting Rathore.Pilot’s seat in the House was changed after he was removed as the deputy chief minister. Earlier, he used to sit next to the chief minister.“Many things have been said during the discussion on trust vote and many more will be said. Over time, everything will be revealed. But I want to say that whatever I or my companions had to say, we have told the doctor about our complaints... After getting the treatment, all of us today... 125 people are standing in the House,” Pilot said.From his new seat, he added, he would ensure the safety of his party.Following the intervention of the party high command, Pilot and 18 rebel MLAs supporting him participated in a Congress Legislature Party meeting held here on Thursday. Earlier, Pilot had also met Gehlot separately.In a House of 200, the Congress has 107 MLAs and the support of Independents and allies. The BJP has 72 members.The trust motion in favour of the Gehlot government was later passed by a majority.Speaking to reporters later outside the House, Pilot said it was not important where one sat but what mattered was what people had in their heart and mind about him.He said the sitting arrangement was decided by the Speaker and the party and he would not like to comment on it.“Earlier, I was part of the government and now I am not. It is not important where you sit but it matters what people have in heart and mind,” he said.The former chief deputy chief minister asserted that he is fully committed to the state “till his last breath” no matter what speculations and rumours are spread about him.“The government and the party will reap the benefit from the path chosen by the party high command,” he said, adding a roadmap would be revealed soon and concerns would be dealt in a satisfactory manner. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pilot-says-he-is-congress-strongest-warrior-will-protect-party-at-all-costs-126419

An accidental death case was registered in the alleged suicide. On June 14, Rajput was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai.Her father had recently given a written complaint to the police, stating that "derogatory" posts and forwards were being shared by people that defamed his deceased daughter and his family.In his complaint, he had also alleged that the "news about her (Disha's) involvement with any politician or attending parties with big names of the film fraternity, rape and murder are all stories cooked up by media people just to sell it to channels and these stories hold no truth." Disha's father had also requested the police to take action against the people concerned for their "insensitive act" towards his family."The Malvani police, who are probing the case of Disha's death, have also started an inquiry into the complaint filed by her father. Accordingly, statements of a few persons are being recorded in this connection," the police official said.The police has made an appeal to the people to come forward with any evidence or information linked to the case.

14-08-2020||Mumbai||I was lucky to have support from family and IAF: Gunjan Saxena||Former IAF officer Gunjan Saxena, whose life story has been made into a Netflix feature film, says she was lucky to have the support of commanding officers and supervisors in the Indian Air Force but whenever there is a major change in an organisation some individuals take more time to adjust than others.Saxena's response comes after the Indian Air Force (IAF) wrote a letter to the Censor Board objecting to its "undue negative" portrayal in the movie "Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl", which released on Netflix on Wednesday.According to a senior official, the letter mentions "concerns related to the movie's portrayal of gender bias as an institutional work culture" at the IAF. In a statement, Saxena, who became the first woman pilot to take part in the 1999 Kargil war, said there are different kind of individuals who make up the environment in an organisation."Whenever you are in any kind of environment, there are different kinds of individuals that make up that environment so when there is a major change happening, some of these individuals are ready to accept this change more readily than the others and some take more time to adjust to this change. "What is really of importance here is - even though it took time for some individuals to change, those individuals did change, it did happen and in a very positive and right direction," she said in a statement.Saxena called it a privilege to be the first to do something. "I think I was always lucky to have people around me who supported and rooted for me be it my family or in the IAF, at both the places I got support to pursue my dream. It's a privilege to be the first one to be doing something, but along with privilege comes a lot of responsibility. "Whenever there is a major change happening in any organisation or in any field for that matter, it is never easy - there are troubles," she said.She said she remains grateful to her fellow officers, supervisors, and commanding officers for helping her whenever she found herself in a difficult situation.Saxena also clarified that officers in the IAF never differentiated between male and female trainees."Even when we started the flying training, the first lesson that was given to us as lady cadets or trainees was that the aircraft doesn't know and doesn't differentiate whether the person flying it is a male or a female. "So the instructors told us that they are not going to differentiate whether it is a lady trainee or a male trainee and they are going to give us the same level of training and will also set the same standards for us and I think that is the reason that when I was performing any of my sorties, I was performing equally well," she said. Saxena said she was proud of the film made on her life and hopes it will inspire young girls to go after their dreams fearlessly."Over the last three years, an incredible team poured their hearts into this film that dramatises the real-life events of my life and yet is true in its portrayal of hope, love and determination. I am proud of the film and the love it has received."I hope that this story inspires all young Indians, especially young girls, to be fearless and encourages them to dare to dream." Directed by Sharan Sharma and produced by Dharma Productions, "Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl" also features Pankaj Tripathi, Angad Bedi, Vineet Kumar Singh and Manav Vij.

14-08-2020||Jaipur||Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot wins trust vote in Rajasthan Assembly||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot won trust vote in the state assembly on Friday, bringing down the curtain on the drama and uncertainty that has racked the state government for over a month now. The state government moved a motion of confidence in the house through its Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal.The motion as passed by voice vote---an expected win after the return of the 19 dissident MLAs led by Sachin Pilot to the party-fold.During the discussion, Pilot said he will fight for the Congress as its “strongest warrior”.Replying to the debate on the motion, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot criticised the BJP, accusing it again of trying to bring down his government. “I will not let the government topple at any cost even if you make all attempts,” he said.Gehlot said the crisis had come to an end in a “beautiful manner” and this had hurt the Bharatiya Janata Party.“What was done in Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Goa, Madhya Pradesh? Elected governments are being toppled and democracy is under danger,” he said, accusing the BJP of targeting Congress governments.Without taking names, he alleged that a Union minister was involved in the “conspiracy” to topple his government, saying this had become clear after some audio clips surfaced.The indirect reference was to Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who has earlier rejected the Congress allegation.The BJP had earlier said it will move a no-confidence motion against the government, but called off the move after the Congress itself announced that it will seek a floor test.During the debate, the opposition BJP accused the Gehlot camp of blaming it for the infighting within the Congress.Gehlot dismissed the opposition allegation that his government was “misusing” the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police, and also indirectly countered the Pilot camp’s claim that the dissident leader had been targeted by the unit.He reminded that he too got an SOG notice, seeking any information on attempts to topple the government.The chief minister also rejected allegations that the MLAs’ telephones were tapped.Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria targeted Gehlot over his comments against his now sacked deputy and questioned how Pilot became “useless” after the formation of the government, when he had “strengthened” the party while in opposition.Mocking Gehlot for keeping his loyalists holed up in hotels for a month, the BJP leader said if the government had a majority it could have proven it earlier.He also questioned the Congress government over the deployment of the state police at hotels where the MLAs were staying.The rebellion by Sachin Pilot ended earlier this week after the intervention of the party’s top leadership in Delhi, which assured that his grievances will be heard. On Thursday, Gehlot and Pilot shook hands.Pilot intervened in the debate, reacting to remarks by Kataria and Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore.Referring to his seat being changed—earlier he sat next to Gehlot as the deputy chief minister—Pilot said he is now placed at the ‘border’ between his party and the opposition in the House.“Who is sent to the border? The strongest warrior is sent,” he said.The House maintained social distancing. Two members sat on benches meant for three and additional seats were placed. Pilot said in the second row on one such seat between two benches.Indirectly, he also referred to his meeting with the party high command.“But I want to say that whatever I or my companions had to say, we have told the doctor about our complaints,” he said, adding that the MLAs were now all together in the assembly after receiving the “treatment”.BJP state unit president Satish Poonia said while the Congress talked about “horse-trading”, it had indulged in “elephant-trading” with the induction of six MLAs who were elected on Bahujan Samaj Party tickets in the 2018 assembly polls.The BSP’s election symbol is the elephant.The BSP has challenged the merger in the Rajasthan High Court, which is expected to pronounce its verdict on Monday. Its petition is being heard along with a similar plea by BJP MLA Madan Dilawar.The BSP-Congress merger in the state took the ruling party’s strength in the 200-member assembly to 107, and it also has the backing of some independents and allies.

Besides this, six personnel have been awarded for their courage in anti-Naxal operations in Chhattisgarh."The ITBP troops not only effectively used shields to protect themselves but also responded fiercely to PLA advancing troops and brought the situation under control," an ITBP spokesman said."With the highest order of professional skills, ITBP troops fought shoulder to shoulder and also brought the injured Indian Army troops to the rear," he added.Even when the ITBP troops fought the whole night, they suffered minimum casualties and gave a befitting reply to the stone palters of the PLA. At places, they were involved in the standoff for 17 to 20 hours throughout the intervening nights, he said.Due to the high altitude training and manoeuvre experience of the force in the Himalayas deployments, the ITBP troops kept the PLA troops at bay and due to the response of ITBP jawans at almost all fronts, many areas were safeguarded in the hypersensitive sector, the ITBP claimed.The Force also recommended the names of 318 ITBP personnel and 40 other Central Armed Police Forces personnel for the Union Home Minister Special Operation Medals for their services in the fight against the Covid-19.The ITBP has been at the forefront of the Covid-19 battle since January 2020 when it had established the biggest quarantine facility in Chhawla Camp for evacuees from Wuhan and Italy.Besides dedicating its hospitals for Covid-19 patients of the central forces, it is also looking after the world’s biggest 10,000 bed capacity Sardar Patel Covid19 Care Centre and Hospital at Radha Soami Beas, New Delhi, since July 5.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/itbp-recommends-gallantry-awards-for-21-personnel-involved-in-ladakh-faceoff-with-china-126402
14-08-2020||Washington||Bipartisan resolution condemning Chinese aggression against India introduced in US Senate||A bipartisan group of two influential US senators has introduced a resolution in the Senate, condemning Chinese military aggression to change the status quo at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India and calling for a diplomatic solution.Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated after the June 15 Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers died.The resolution was introduced by Senator John Cornyn, Republican Senate Majority Whip, and Senator Mark Warner, ranking member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on Thursday.Cornyn and Warner are co-chairs of the Senate India Caucus. The Senate resolution follows the passage of a similar resolution by the House of Representatives as part of the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) last month."As a cofounder of the Senate India Caucus, I know firsthand the importance of a strong relationship between the US and India. I commend India's commitment to standing up to China and maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. It is more important than ever that we support our Indian partners as they defend against Chinese aggression," Cornyn said.The June 15 conflict between China and India, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, should set off alarm bells regarding Beijing's "provocative actions" in disputed territory, Warner said."This resolution condemns PRC's (People's Republic of China) actions to change the Line of Actual Control, especially in the midst of diplomatic negotiations between the two countries; and encourages the two nations to find a diplomatic resolution that restores the April 2020 status quo at the LAC," he said.Warner said the US had long enjoyed a partnership with India strengthened by shared democratic values."That partnership only becomes more important as we work to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific," he said.In a joint press statement, the two senators said the deadly conflict broke out on June 15 on the China-India border following weeks of minor military confrontations along the LAC that separates China and the Indian regions of Ladakh and Sikkim.The "lethal conflict" occurred in the Galwan Valley — one of the sites of tension in recent weeks — as the two sides were in the process of negotiating a mutual "disengagement" of forces. The last time the border conflict escalated to the point of casualties was in 1975, it noted.Over the past several weeks, there has been outpouring of support from top American lawmakers, across the aisle, against Chinese efforts to grab Indian territories.Support for India against China has come in the form of tweets, public speeches, House and Senate floor, letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, and Congressional resolutions.Several lawmakers have also made a call to Sandhu to express their outrage against China.Sandhu, who has been meeting top American lawmakers, virtually, on a daily basis has received multiple Congressmen and Senators expressing their strong support to India against China.

14-08-2020||Melbourne||New low-cost test can diagnose COVID-19 in just 20 minutes||Scientists have developed a new low-cost nasal swab test which can accurately diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 in just 20 minutes.The findings, published in the Journal of Medical Microbiology, show the test called N1-STOP-LAMP, is 100 per cent accurate in diagnosing samples containing SARS-CoV-2 at high loads.The rapid molecular test is highly accurate and easy to use, making it a prime candidate for use in settings with limited testing capabilities, according to the researchers.The method involves using a small portable machine, which can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 from just one nasal swab, they said."In the race to control the COVID-19 pandemic, access to rapid, precision diagnostics is key," said Tim Stinear, a professor at the University of Melbourne in Australia."We have developed an alternative COVID-19 molecular test that can be readily deployed in settings where access to standard laboratory testing is limited or where ultra-rapid result turnaround times are needed," Stinear said.This new test uses only one tube and involves only a single step, making it more efficient and lower cost than many of the current tests for SARS-CoV-2.The N1-STOP-LAMP method was found to be 100 per cent accurate and correctly identified 87 per cent of tests as positive when used to assess 157 confirmed-positive samples.The results were fast, with an average time-to-positive of 14 minutes for 93 of those clinical samples."We see this kind of technology having benefit in settings liked aged care facilities, or overseas laboratories with limited resources and equipment," Stinear said."The test requires a small shoebox-sized machine, as well as reagents, but everything is portable," he said.The researchers noted that STOP-LAMP is what is referred to as a 'near care' test, and is not intended to replace the current gold standard PCR testing.It's a robust diagnostic test for the specific and rapid detection of COVID-19, but it's important to note that it trades some detection sensitivity for speed and ease-of-use, they said. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-low-cost-test-can-diagnose-covid-19-in-just-20-minutes-126395

14-08-2020||New Delhi||SC holds advocate Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt of court||The Supreme Court on Friday held activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt of court for his tweets against Chief Justice of India SA Bobde and four last CJIs, saying, “Such an attack which tends to create disaffection and disrespect for the authority of this court cannot be ignored.”A three-judge Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said, “The scurrilous/malicious attacks by the alleged contemnor No.1 (Bhushan) are not only against one or two judges but the entire Supreme Court in its functioning of the last six years. Such an attack which tends to create disaffection and disrespect for the authority of this court cannot be ignored.”It said, “If an attack is made to shake the confidence that the public at large has in the institution of judiciary, such an attack has to be dealt with firmly…If such an attack is not dealt with, with requisite degree of firmness, it may affect the national honour and prestige in the comity of nations.”The Bench – which also included Justice BR Gavai and Justice Krishna Murari—will hear arguments on sentence on August 20.The maximum sentence prescribed under Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 is six-month imprisonment with a fine of Rs 2,000.Last week, the Bench had decided to go ahead with contempt proceedings against the activist-lawyer in an 11-year-old contempt case in which he had expressed regret but refused to apologise.Describing “fearless and impartial courts of justice” as the bulwark of a healthy democracy”, the top court said, “the confidence in them cannot be permitted to be impaired by malicious attacks upon them”.Recently Bhushan had tweeted, “CJI rides a 50 Lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP leader at Raj Bhavan Nagpur, without a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC in Lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access Justice!”In another tweet, he had on June  27, said, “When  historians  in  future  look  back  at  the last  6  years  to  see  how  democracy  has  been  destroyed  in  India  even without  a  formal  Emergency,  they  will  particularly  mark  the  role  of the  Supreme  Court  in  this  destruction,  &  more  particularly  the  role of the last 4 CJIs.”The top court had on July 22 taken strong exception to both the tweets and initiated suo motu contempt proceedings against Bhushan and Twitter Inc.However, it let off Twitter as it was only an intermediary which didn’t have any control on what the users posted on the platform and it also showed its bona fides by immediately suspending Bhushan’s both controversial tweets.On behalf of Bhushan, senior counsel Dushyant Dave had argued that no institution should be free from public criticism.“Mr Bhushan’s contribution to development of the PIL jurisprudence is immense. He criticises the court because of love and affection for the institution. He did not impute any motives.“The foundation of the judiciary is the trust and the confidence of the people in its ability to deliver fearless and impartial justice. When the foundation itself is sought to be shaken by acts which tend to create disaffection and disrespect for the authority of the court by creating distrust in its working, the edifice of the judicial system gets eroded,” it said.It may be better in many cases for the judiciary to adopt a magnanimously charitable attitude when utterly uncharitable and unfair criticism made out of bona fide concern for improvement, it noted.“However, when there appears some scheme and design to bring about results which have the tendency of damaging the confidence in our judicial system and demoralize the Judges of the highest court by making malicious attacks, those interested in maintaining high standards of fearless, impartial and unbending justice will have to stand firmly,” the top court said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-holds-advocate-prashant-bhushan-guilty-of-contempt-of-court-126388

Their tendency to feed on meat may be a factor behind their abnormal behaviour of attacking children in the village. I have asked the block development officer, the veterinary officer of Bisalpur and the tehsildar to visit the village to review the situation. The animal husbandry department can catch these dogs and shift them to a more secluded place."However, chief veterinary officer, Akhilesh Kumar Garg, said, "These stray dogs can only be trapped by trained dog catchers that are not available in this department. They are usually brought from other places, whenever required." IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mauled-by-stray-dogs-10-year-old-dies-in-up-126383

India’s participation in the Greater Malé Connectivity Project (GMCP) is in keeping with its declaration of expertise in completing infrastructure projects of the kind required by smaller nations. Recently, India completed the Supreme Court building in Mauritius, another Indian Ocean island-country with which diplomatic ties have been intensified.“Once implemented, GMCP will render the Chinese project insignificant in comparison. It will help in demonstrating India’s overarching presence through a high-visibility project in the Greater Malé region and showcase India’s expertise in conceptualising and implementing a complex infrastructural project of this scale,” said sources.Jaishankar also said a cargo ferry service between India and Maldives will begin shortly. India’s total financial commitment in Maldives covering all loan and grant projects is well over $2 billion, all of which have been announced after the coming into power of President Solih in November 2018.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said, “India will continue to support the Maldives in mitigating the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic,” asserting that their “special friendship” will always remain as deep as the waters of the Indian Ocean.Modi was responding to Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s tweet, thanking him for India’s financial assistance to the island country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-aided-project-to-dwarf-chinese-bridge-in-maldives-126203

They were suspended from the party’s primary membership last month over their alleged involvement in a “conspiracy” to topple the government in the state.The Congress announcement, made hours after the BJP said it would bring a motion of no confidence, was seen as a move to counter the Opposition strategy.CM Gehlot and former Deputy CM Pilot earlier shook hands at the former’s residence before attending the CLP meeting, where the CM asked everyone to “forgive and forget” and promised resolution of everyone’s grievances. AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said the CLP meeting went well and the “Congress was united and determined to stall BJP’s designs in the House session where the CM will bring a motion of confidence”.The numbers are stacked favourably for the Congress, which has 107 MLAs (including six BSP MLAs who “merged” with the party last year) in the 200-member Assembly. The BJP has 72 MLAs and its ally RLP has three. Despite low numbers, Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Gulab Chand Kataria today said, “We will bring a motion of no confidence against the Gehlot government.” The decision was taken at the BJP Legislature Party meet. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gehlot-to-seek-trust-vote-126173
14-08-2020||New Delhi||Tax assessment goes faceless, PM Modi unveils IT charter||Prime Minister Narendra Modi today launched a platform to provide faceless assessment and appeal in income tax cases, which, he said, was part of the process to overhaul various colonial-era tax laws."The previous system, instead of expanding the taxpayer base, was harassing honest businessmen, workers and those providing employment," observed the PM while also launching the taxpayers' charter, first announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her Budget speech.New Assessment NormsA central computer will pick tax returns for scrutiny and allot these randomly to officers in any city across IndiaThis scrutiny will then be reviewed by officers at another locationTaxpayer can respond to notices electronically without visiting any tax officeThe PM said after the Independence, the coercive and colonial system of tax collection was only tinkered with. "But largely, the system and the character remained the same. As a result, the taxpayer, who is a strong pillar of national development, was put in dock," he said.“Soch and approach dono badal gayi (Thinking and approach, both have changed). Reforms should be policy-based, holistic and one reform should form the basis for further reforms," the PM said while pointing out that earlier regimes would label changes made under pressure as reforms and they would become an end to themselves."We have not done just one reform. There have been consistent efforts over the last few years," said the PM while pointing to the junking of 1,500 outdated laws, a huge improvement in the ease of doing business and major changes in laws and rules."Seeing this commitment, the trust of foreign investors has increased, leading to record inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) even during the Covid pandemic," he said.He said the changes were due to four reasons: Policy-driven governance, narrowing of grey areas of discretion, limiting human interface by use of technology, and awarding efficiency in bureaucracy.The earlier system enabled the flourishing of "black and white" (money) because it was complex. The new GST slab system has removed the need for unnecessarily providing several documents; schemes like "Vivad Se Vishwas" have helped settle around 3 lakh cases out of court; and the tax system is being now made seamless, painless and faceless.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tax-assessment-goes-faceless-pm-modi-unveils-it-charter-126194
