09-08-2020||Aditi Tandon||One year on as interim, Sonia to remain Congress chief||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 9Ahead of the completion of one year of Sonia Gandhi as interim Congress president, party leader Abhishek Singhvi on Sunday said she would continue in the post till a proper procedure was followed, which would be in the near future.Singhvi said the fact that Sonia Gandhi’s one-year tenure as interim party president ends on Monday did not mean that the position would fall vacant.Sonia Gandhi had been nominated as interim party chief by the Congress Working Committee (CWC) last year after her son, Rahul Gandhi, vacated the post taking moral responsibility for the Congress rout in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Even after a CWC consultation wanted him to return, Rahul Gandhi declined, saying at the time that a non-Gandhi should come in as the party president.Since no consensus emerged on a non-Gandhi and the exercise to find one remained a non-starter, the CWC fell back on Sonia Gandhi to lead the Congress once again.Sonia completes one year as interim chief tomorrow.“Sonia Gandhi is the president. She will continue till the time a proper procedure is implemented and it will be implemented in the not too distant future,” Singhvi said today.Rahul Gandhi is said to be unwilling to lead the party even though he remains its de facto chief, with party insiders saying he is the one still calling the shots.“She has hardly been active all this while. It is Rahul Gandhi who is taking the decisions and calling the shots,” said a senior Congress functionary ruing the uncertainty at the top position.Meanwhile, there is near unanimity in the Congress that a non-Gandhi chief was immaterial so long as the Gandhis remain active in the party.“A non-Gandhi president would work if and only if the Gandhis step aside and say it is now for others to manage the Congress. That won’t happen. So, the Gandhis are the best bet,” an ex-minister said.With Rahul’s stamp visible in major decision making and his reluctance to accept party chief’s post visible too, Congress insiders say the flux is costing the Congress.“Clarity of leadership is needed,” said a leader adding that Rahul Gandhi’s de facto management of party affairs was clear from several recent sequences of events — the appointment of Ajay Makan and Randeep Surjewala as observers for the crisis-hit Rajasthan; the launch of an open offensive against ex-UPA ministers recently by Rahul aide Rajeev Satav and the key recent appointments including that of Shakti Singh Gohil as Bihar in-charge.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-year-on-as-interim-sonia-to-remain-congress-chief-124309

09-08-2020||London||Spectacles believed to be worn by Mahatma Gandhi emerge at UK auction||A pair of gold-plated spectacles believed to have been worn by Mahatma Gandhi and presented as a gift in the 1900s have emerged on the UK auction circuit, estimated to fetch between 10,000 pounds and 15,000 pounds.East Bristol Auctions in Hanham, south-west England, said on Sunday that they were pleasantly surprised to find that the spectacles, dropped through their letterbox in an envelope, may have such a rich history behind it.“It’s a huge find of great historical importance. The vendor had presumed them to be interesting, but of no value and did tell me to dispose of them ‘if they’re not worth anything’,” said auctioneer Andy Stowe of East Bristol Auctions.“I think he nearly fell off his chair when we presented our valuation. It’s a really great auction story – and one that we all dream of,” he said.The glasses, which have already attracted an online bid for 6,000 pounds, are said to have been in the family of the unnamed elderly gentleman vendor in England, who was told by his father that they were a gift to his uncle when he was working for British Petroleum in South Africa between 1910 and 1930.“The vendor’s uncle definitely worked for British Petroleum in South Africa, and I believe Gandhi didn’t wear glasses until the late 1910s early 1920s,” says Stowe in reference to the provenance of the glasses, which are likely to be one of Gandhi’s earliest pairs during his time in South Africa.“The story that appears with the lot is exactly what the vendor told us, and exactly what was told to him by his father some 50 years ago,” explains Stowe.The lot, titled “Pair of Mahatma Gandhi’s Personal Spectacles”, forms part of the auctioneers’ Military, History and Classic Cars online sale and will go under the hammer on August 21. It has already attracted much interest, including from India.“A pair of early 20th century c1920 gold plated circular rimmed spectacles by repute owned and worn by Mahatma Gandhi,” notes the auction lot details.“The spectacles of usual form, with sprung gold plated arms and prescription lenses. Jointed by a gold plated nose bar, the spectacles formed an important and somewhat iconic part of Gandhi’s overall appearance. It was known that he would often give away his old or unwanted pairs to those in need or those who had helped him. A rare and important pair of spectacles,” it notes.“The uncle working for British Petroleum at the time and was stationed in South Africa, and it can be presumed that these were gifted by way of thanks from Gandhi for some good deed. A note from the vendor is included,” the auction lot adds.Gandhi became synonymous with the iconic round-rimmed Windsor-style glasses, common during the period when he was studying law in England in the late 1800s and 1900s. While initially used infrequently, the glasses became a regular feature during the national movement and Gandhi’s civil disobedience protests in India.He is known to have handed over his personal items as gifts to admirers and a number of similar items have emerged on the auction circuit over the years. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/spectacles-believed-to-be-worn-by-mahatma-gandhi-emerge-at-uk-auction-124298

There is no doubt that Gautam Buddha was born in Lumbini, which is in Nepal,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava in a statement today.Jaishankar’s remarks came weeks after Nepal PM K P Oli had courted controversy by claiming that Lord Ram was born in Nepal and was a Nepali. On that occasion, Oli was criticised for his remarks. As Foreign Minister, Jaishankar has seen rocky Indo-Nepal diplomatic ties since November last year when India released a map that included some areas also claimed by Nepal. On the ground though, India has plugged away with developmental projects, including an oil pipeline.On Sunday, Indian Ambassador to Nepal Vinay Mohan Kwatra handed over 10 ventilators to Nepal Army chief Purna Chnadra Thapa during a ceremony at Nepali Army Headquarters. The gift was handed over on behalf of the Indian Army.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-walks-back-on-jaishankars-buddha-was-an-indian-remark-124297

The explosion was so powerful that the common wall between the flats of Surwades and Temkars collapsed,” Dighi police station’s senior inspector Vivek Lawand said on Sunday night.Prima facie, the woman did not turn on the gas stove as believed earlier, but switched on the electric switch which led to the explosion as the gas was leaking from the cylinder and accumulated inside her flat, he said.Dnyaneshwar Temkar, who might have been near the wall, got trapped under its debris and died on the spot, he said.His eight-year-old daughter also received injuries, the official said.Archana Surwade was seriously injured as she received around 80 per cent burns. Five other members of her family also received injuries, the official said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-killed-7-injured-in-wall-collapse-caused-by-lpg-explosion-124296
09-08-2020||Mumbai||‘Quit India’ day: Martyrs remembered at August Kranti Maidan||Tributes were paid to martyrs on Sunday at an event held at the August Kranti Maidan here to mark the 78th anniversary of the Quit India movement.The movement is a major milestone in the history of India’s struggle for independence from the British rule.Floral tributes were paid to freedom fighters and others who laid down their lives in the freedom struggle.This is the same ground from where Mahatma Gandhi gave the clarion call of ‘do-or-die’ for independence.Mumbai Mayor Kishori Kishor Pednekar visited the August Kranti Maidan and offered floral tributes at the Gandhi Smruti Stambh.Maharashtra Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat was among those who offered floral tributes to the martyrs.The movement in August 1942, with Mahatma Gandhi’s call for immediate independence, was launched at Mumbai’s Gowalia Tank, which later came to be known as August Kranti Maidan due to its association with the historic occasion.Members of some labour unions and activists gathered at the August Kranti Maidan to mark the occasion. Their number was less as compared to previous years in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.“Every year, we all meet for our common demands and to strengthen the bond. This year, there have been restrictions due to the coronavirus crisis. We asked only a few members to reach the ground to maintain physical distancing,” a union leader from Mumbai said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quit-india-day-martyrs-remembered-at-august-kranti-maidan-124292
09-08-2020||New Delhi||Airports in India lack norms compliance, prone to accidents: Experts||Sector experts say airstrips at several airports in the country, including Patna and Jammu, have failed to comply with safety norms---a development that comes as authorities now analyse what led to the accident at Kozhikode that killed 18 people, including pilots.  Air safety expert Capt Mohan Ranganathan told the Tribune that many of the airports including Calicut (Kozhikode) Jammu and Patna are “safe only on paper” because audits done do not meet established national and international norms.“I had warned authorities in 2011 that the runaway at Kozhikode airport is unsafe and needed to be re-evaluated, especially in wet conditions during the rainy season. Audits are mostly done on paper. Several times safety issues are flagged and the DGCA might have issued show-cause notices, but they are never followed up and no action has been taken for non-compliance,” Rangnathan said.In the instances of non-compliance of the safety norms, authorities should take action to the extent of shutting down of airports or at least suspending operation till the norms are met, Rangnathan said, insisting that only in such situations will airports wake up and do something.“But, if you just do these things on paper, nothing will happen,” he said.People involved in the processes need to be made accountable, as he said, adding: “I have on several occasions pointed out to the chairman of Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Council (CASAC) and other authorities that the Runway 10 of the Kozhikode airport could be risky for landing in tailwind conditions in rain”.Lawyer and aviation safety activist Yashwanth Shenoy put the blame on aviation regulator DGCA, saying that it understood little of the sector’s needs.  “The biggest threat to the aviation sector is the DGCA itself, as it is the biggest violator of the norms. The DGCA is headed by an IAS officer, who knows nothing about aviation. Nowhere in the world are administrators appointed as civil aviation regulator,” he said.What’s important now, he says, is to do what can be done to prevent such incidents. “I believe that Calicut airport is done and dusted. The question is can we prevent Calicut from happening again,” he said. And what will that take? “All we need to comply with the existing air regulation norms,” he says.A former DGCA official said airports must follow safety standards set by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation).“There are standard procedures for the rainy season and it is there in the flight manual requiring simulator training of pilots before every rainy season,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/airports-in-india-lack-norms-compliance-prone-to-accidents-experts-124289
09-08-2020||---||Centre’s Environment Impact Assessment draft ‘disgraceful’, ‘dangerous’: Rahul Gandhi||New Delhi, August 9The Congress on Sunday came down heavily on the new Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 draft the government has placed in the public domain for comments, with former party chief Rahul Gandhi leading the offensive.Gandhi said the draft was “not only disgraceful, but it is also dangerous”.In a Facebook post, Gandhi said not only did the draft have the potential to reverse many hard-fought gains won over the years in the battle to protect the environment, but it could also potentially unleash widespread environmental destruction and mayhem across India.Also read: Noteban, ‘faulty’ implementation of GST, lockdown ‘destroyed’ India’s economic structure: Rahul Gandhi“Consider this — according to our Swachh Bharat propagating Government, if labelled ‘strategic’, highly-polluting industries such as coal mining and other mineral mining will no longer require EIA and neither will the highways or the railway lines passing through dense forests and other eco-sensitive areas require clearances. This will result in the massive hacking of trees, leading to the destruction of habitats of thousands of endangered species,” said Gandhi.Congress veteran and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh, who heads the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment, has been in the forefront of opposing the EIA draft.Gandhi backed the former minister citing the EIA a “terrible idea”.“Environment Impact Assessment can be given post facto! That is, EIA can be done after a project has already destroyed the environment. This EIA 2020 draft is a disaster. It seeks to silence the voice of communities who will be directly impacted by the environmental degradation it unleashes,” said the Congress leader urging people to protest.He said the youth, who have always been at the forefront of every battle to protect our environment, must take up this cause and make it their own.“A fight to protect our environment cuts across political and ideological beliefs. If nothing else, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown us how fragile human life is. For millions of Indians, already living on the edge, the environment isn’t an abstract term but a life and livelihood issue. If the EIA 2020 is notified by the government, the long-term consequences of the widespread environmental degradation will be catastrophic for us and future generations of Indians,” Rahul Gandhi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centres-environment-impact-assessment-draft-disgraceful-dangerous-rahul-gandhi-124286

He sold a dream but the reality is that 14 crore people have become unemployed due to the policies of Narendra Modi,” Gandhi alleged.Also read: Centre’s Environment Impact Assessment draft ‘disgraceful’, ‘dangerous’: Rahul Gandhi“Why did this happen?

09-08-2020||Mumbai||Senior actors happy after HC quashes ‘discriminatory’ work order amid coronavirus||There is a sense of relief and happiness among the senior film and TV actors after Bombay High Court dismissed the Maharashtra Government orders that barred performers above 65 years from resuming production amid the coronavirus lockdown.The high court on Friday quashed the provisions of the two circulars issued by the state government, terming them “discriminatory”.A Bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla, while setting aside the resolutions issued by the state, held that such restriction breached the fundamental rights of the artistes to practice their trade and earn a livelihood with dignity.The fight for the elder artistes was spearheaded by actor Promod Pandey and his industry colleagues, veteran artistes Raza Murad, Suhasini Mulay and Kanwaljit Singh among others have expressed gratitude to him for highlighting the plight of senior members in the field.The court was hearing two petitions, one filed by 70-year-old actor Pandey, and another by the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association (IMPPA).A lesser known face, Pandey has worked in films such as Rajesh Khanna-starrer “Chhailla Babu”, TV shows like “Tujhse Hai Raabta”, and Ekta Kapoor’s web series “Aapharan”.Pandey said, as a struggling actor in pre-coronavirus times, he was happy earning Rs 30,000-35,000 a month for a two-three day job in TV shows.But when the lockdown came into effect in late March, expenses started piling up with no income.“We were waiting for shoots to begin. Finally when the government gave its nod to begin but didn’t allow 65 plus actors and crew due to health reasons, I was surprised as we all have the right to earn livelihood,” Pandey told PTI.The actor somehow arranged fees to file a petition and petitioners counsel Ashok Sarogi “helped a lot”.“We are glad the high court gave the judgement in our favour,” he said, adding he has received job offers after the court ruling.Murad, popular for films like “Ram Lakhan”, “Gupt: The Hidden Truth”, and “Padmaavat”, said as a character actor who hasn’t amassed wealth which can last 30 years, he was “feeling quite insecure” when the government guidelines were announced.“We are character actors, not stars... The government’s guidelines were detrimental to our future income and we were feeling suffocated. We had a group of senior actors called ‘Mumbai 65’ but hats off to invisible crusader Pramod Pandey, who came out of nowhere and took this head on,” the 69-year-old actor said.Murad welcomed the judgement and said he will soon begin shooting for a web series.Mulay, 69, said the court order has come as a “great relief” for people her age. The actor, known for films like “Bhuvan Shome”, “Dil Chahta Hai”, and “Lagaan”, also thanked Pandey.She also made a case for the lesser privileged crew members, including lightmen, electricians, makeup artistes, saying these artistes are the “most vulnerable”.“Pramod Pandey isn’t a big actor but the fact that he went to court shows his desperation. If he didn’t work, how was the guy going to feed his family?” asked Mulay.Expressing concern over the pandemic-induced uncertainty, the actor said she might have to be idle for the coming four months as the shooting of a Netflix show she was supposed to work on before the lockdown has been pushed to November.“We aren’t on a monthly salary. The day we work is the day we get paid. As an actor, I can still charge some amount of money, but the more vulnerable ones depend on daily shoots,” she added.Singh, 68, said he too lost out on a job opportunity, the upcoming show “Sandwich”, due to the now-quashed order.“I was working on it and I was replaced because of the decision. The producers waited for months. Since they started shooting for the show recently, I suggested they go ahead with another actor.”               The actor, known for films like “Satte Pe Satta”, “Maachis”, and TV shows “Buniyaad”, “Saans”, said the overturning of the decision was only a matter of time.“The prime minister of our country, all those in the Parliament are above 65 and they all were working, so why not allow us?” he argued.“This is because of one man Pramod Pandey. All thanks to him. He is not a member of CINTAA and he did it all on his own. There is a group of 65-year-old actors and we all are sharing the cost with him,” Singh added.Veteran actor Surekha Sikri, 75, said she is “extremely happy” with the decision.“I am relieved... There were few offers for ad films that I had received a while ago, but I couldn’t do it due to the age factor guidelines. I am waiting to get back on set,” the “Badhaai Ho!” star said.Popular TV actor Ghanshyam Nayak, who plays Nattu kaka in the long-running hit comedy series “Tarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah”, is looking forward to restarting work on the show.“I have received a call from the production team saying my work will begin soon. I am thankful to all those who raised our issue and supported us,” the 76-year-old said.Megastar Amitabh Bachchan, the busiest senior actor in the industry, too expressed “anxieties” over finding work opportunities amid the pandemic as a septuagenarian.The 77-year-old actor returned home after testing negative for COVID-19 last week.Though the actor hailed the court’s decision in favour of the elder artistes, he said it may be “packers” for the senior workforce in the film industry as legal procedures take time to come into effect.“I believe the Honourable High Court has disallowed the age limit restrictions and so for the moment those above 50 are safe to work .. but Courts and Legal procedures take time and I wonder what shall come out of it.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/senior-actors-happy-after-hc-quashes-discriminatory-work-order-amid-coronavirus-124276

09-08-2020||Jodhpur||11 members of Pak Hindu migrant family found dead in Jodhpur||Eleven members of a family of Pakistan Hindu migrants were found dead at a farm in Rajasthan’s Jodhpur district on Sunday morning, police said.A member of the family, however, was found alive outside the hut they lived at Lodta village of the Dechu area, over 100 km away from Jodhpur city, an officer said.“But he claimed to have no idea about the incident, which believed to have happened in the night,” said Superintendent of Police (Rural) Rahul Barhat.“We are yet to ascertain the cause and means of death. They appeared to have committed suicide by consuming some chemical in the night,” Barhat said.He said there was a smell of some chemical in the hut, suggesting they consumed something.The family belonging to the Bhil community had come to India from Pakistan’s Sindh province in 2015 on a long-term visa. They had been living at the Lodta village farm, which they had hired for farming, for the past six months.”There was neither any injury mark on any of the bodies nor any evidences of any foul play,” the SP said. “But we have roped in a forensic team and a dog squad before arriving at any conclusion,” he said.Preliminary investigation indicated that there was some dispute in the family over some issue.“Once we interrogate the survivor, we would be in a position to find out what had led to this incident,” he said.According to a police officer, the victims lived under threat from the family of their daughter-in-law, the wife of Kewal Ram (35), the surviving member of the victim family.“She has been living with her family in Jodhpur for the past some time due to some dispute,” said the police officer, citing this as a possible trigger for their suicide.According Kewal Ram (35), they had dinner between 9 pm and 10 pm on Saturday night and went to sleep.“I went to guard our crop from animals and slept there,” he said.In the morning, when he came back, he found all his family members dead. “I then called my nephew who rushed to the spot with some other persons and informed police,” said Kewal Ram, expressing his ignorance about the incident. Those, who died have been identified as Budharam (75); his wife Antara Devi; son Ravi (31); daughters Jiya (25) and Suman (22); grandsons Mukdash (17) and Nain (12); Laxmi (40) and three minor sons of Kewal Ram.The bodies have been sent for autopsy in Jodhpur and a medical board has been constituted to find out the cause of their death.Meanwhile, Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Sunday slammed the Rajasthan Government over deaths of 11 members of a Hindu migrant family from Pakistan, saying the incident reflects the “working style” of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.“The deaths of nearly a dozen refugees from Pakistan put a question mark on @ashokgehlot51’s working style“The deceased include two men, four women and five children. One after other, very frightening incidents reflecting the deteriorating situation of the state, are coming to the fore.

09-08-2020||Jaipur||BJP in Rajasthan riddled with factionalism: Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday questioned the shifting of Bharatiya Janata Party legislators to Gujarat, saying the opposition party was ridden with factionalism.His comments came in the wake of the BJP herding 18 members of legislative assembly in the past two days to party-ruled Gujarat ahead of the Rajasthan assembly session beginning August 14.The BJP had claimed that their MLAs were being harassed by police and the administration at the behest of the Congress government in the state.Gehlot, on the other hand, defended the stay of Congress legislators at a Jaisalmer hotel, saying the party required to keep them together to thwart horse-trading.“But, what is worrying the BJP? They are herding their legislators to 3-4 places. I see a big split in them,” Gehlot told reporters in Jaisalmer.Lashing out at the opposition party, Gehlot said the “tradition they are setting up is dangerous to democracy”.He said while BJP is trying to topple his government, the government is making efforts to save lives amid the coronavirus crisis.“Unfortunately, such people sitting in power are weakening democracy, which we saved for the past 70 years,” Gehlot said.He added that their fight to save democracy will continue even after August 14 and the truth will prevail.“I can say this that the victory will be ours, truth will win,” he said, stressing that his “government will complete its five-year term”. Gehlot on Sunday also wrote to all Rajasthan MLAs, urging them to listen to the voice of people to save democracy and stand with the truth in the interest of people of the state.The assembly session in the state, which has been witnessing a political turmoil after the rebellion by Congress Sachin Pilot and 18 legislators loyal to him, will start on August 14. Gehlot is likely to seek a trust vote during the session.Replying to question on the Special Operations Group (SOG) notices given to MLAs in connection with alleged horse-trading, Gehlot said the investigation agencies wanted to talk to them but it was projected as a sedition case was registered against them. He also rejected allegations that phone numbers of MLAs were being tapped. “The information was spread to mislead people. The government neither can, nor should, tap phones,” he said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-in-rajasthan-riddled-with-factionalism-chief-minister-ashok-gehlot-124267

09-08-2020||New Delhi||Indus Water Treaty meeting: India suggests video-conference, Pak for Attari meeting||India has suggested to Pakistan that the talks for discussing pending issues under the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) be held through video-conferencing in view of the coronavirus pandemic, but Islamabad has been insisting that the parleys be conducted at the Attari check post, sources said on Sunday.In a letter last week, the Indus Commissioner of India told his Pakistani counterpart that it is not conducive to hold the meeting at the Attari Joint Check Post due to the pandemic.On Pakistan’s request, a meeting was scheduled in last week of March to discuss pending issues under the Indus Water Treaty. However, it was deferred due to current pandemic.Considering the fact that it may take some time for the situation to normalise and international travel to resume, the Indian Commissioner, in the first week of July, proposed to hold the meeting through video conference or any alternative means, sources said.In response, the Pakistan Commissioner, in his letter sent in last week of July, insisted on holding the conventional meeting at Attari Joint Check Post instead.“The Indian Commissioner responded stating that the situation in India is still not conducive for travelling of his delegation and holding the meeting at Attari JCP as proposed by his counterpart and may take some time to allow such meeting at Attari JCP or New Delhi as desired by Pakistan,” a source said.The Indian Commissioner also requested the Pakistan side to consider holding a virtual meeting as a viable option to discuss the pending and new issues, sources added.They noted that even the diplomatic talks with other countries have been taking place through virtual meetings and the Indus meeting can take place in a similar manner.Currently, one of the pending issues between the two sides is the disagreement over the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectricity projects.The Kishenganga project had been in operation since 2018 while work on Ratle stands abandoned since 2014 due to a contractual dispute between the Jammu and Kashmir government and the contractor.After prolonged negotiations, India in 2016 sought appointment of a neutral expert to resolve this issue while Pakistan made a request for appointment of a Court of Arbitration (COA).In November 2019, after a meeting of the Indian delegation headed by Jal Shakti Ministry Secretary with the World Bank to explore a way forward, it was agreed that the matter may be discussed by the two commissioners as per the Treaty provisions to decide the mode of resolution --- by the CoA or a neutral expert.The World Bank initially proceeded with both the process of appointment of a neutral expert and constituting the Court of Arbitration but later, in December 2016, it instituted a ‘pause’ on both the processes to allow the two parties to bilaterally choose one option with the help of its good offices, sources said.Under the Treaty, the World Bank has only the procedural role and there is no provision for the global financial institution to take an independent decision in this regard.The pause is still continuing. In between two trilateral meetings at the secretary-level were held in Washington at World Bank office in August and September 2017 but the logjam persisted, the sources added.After the November 2019 talks, the Indian Commissioner invited his Pakistani counterpart in February 2020 to hold the meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission.The meeting was scheduled in March but had to be postponed due to the pandemic.The Permanent Indus Commission, formed under the Indus Waters Treaty, was signed between India and Pakistan in 1960. Indus commissioners of both the countries act as representatives of the respective governments for the Treaty matters.The Treaty provides for both the commissioners to meet at least once every year, alternately in India and Pakistan.It specifies that the waters of three eastern rivers namely Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, have been allocated exclusively to India.The western rivers, namely Indus, Chenab and Jhelum, are for Pakistan with India given some rights like agriculture, navigation, domestic use and also the unrestricted rights to develop hydroelectric power projects within the specified parameters of design and operations. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indus-water-treaty-meeting-india-suggests-video-conference-pak-for-attari-meeting-124260

Pandey was involved in this incident,” the STF said.Pandey was a sharpshooter of mafia dons Ansari and Munna Bajrangi, it said.Around 12 cases were registered against Pandey, who was out on bail, in various districts of Uttar Pradesh, it added.The police have also recovered two pistols, ammunition and two mobile phones from the spot.The STF claimed that Pandey was among the most reliable men of Ansari, who is the sitting BSP MLA from Mau assembly constituency in Uttar Pradesh, and managed contracts in the district.The STF said it received a tip-off that Pandey had been seen in Lucknow’s Gudumba area, and was collecting weapons to commit a crime.“When the STF team reached Gudumba, it was learnt that the criminals are heading towards Kanpur Road. Around 4.20 am, police tried to stop an SUV in which Pandey was travelling. He tried to flee and open fire at the police party,” the police said.“However, the SUV collided with a roadside tree. A person stepped out of the SUV and opened indiscriminate firing on the STF team,” the statement said.“The STF fired in a controlled manner for self-defence to catch the criminal,” it said.“After some time, when the firing stopped, the criminal was taken to Sarojini Nagar community health centre, where he succumbed to his injuries. Another criminal fled from the spot,” it said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mukhtar-ansaris-aide-gunned-down-in-encounter-in-lucknow-124253
09-08-2020||Indore||MP Congress MLA booked for tweeting tampered image of PM||A case was registered against Madhya Pradesh Congress working president and MLA Jitu Patwari for allegedly posting a doctored image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which the ruling BJP claimed hurt the dignity of the Prime Minister as well as religious sentiments of the Hindus.In the image uploaded by Patwari, the Prime Minister is seen wearing a mask and holding a bowl during the Ram Temple ‘bhoomi poojan’ ceremony in Ayodhya on August 5.Accompanying the image was a tweet in Hindi which said: “The country’s economy, business and income, declining economic status of farmers, jobs and unemployment, decline of economy, labourers and their struggle. These are not the subjects of television debate. Because, (we) will walk with the bowl.”Chhatripura police station in charge Pawan Singhal said Patwari was booked under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 464 (making false electronic record) of the IPC on the complaint of city BJP president Gaurav Randive.Singhal said, at first glance, it seemed the image uploaded on Patwari’s Twitter handle was a “tampered” one, adding that Section 188 of the IPC was invoked as the district administration had already banned provocative social media posts.Indore Lok Sabha MP Shankar Lalwani and local leaders expressed displeasure on Patwari’s tweet and gave a memorandum and complaint to Deputy Inspector General of Police Harinarayanachari Mishra.They said Patwari had “not only hurt the dignity of the Prime Minister, but also religious sentiments of the Hindus”.While Patwari, MLA from Rau and higher education minister in the previous Kamal Nath government, deleted the image later, it didn’t stop the BJP leaders from ridiculing him for spelling errors in his Hindi tweet.BJP leaders said the Congress had made someone like Patwari, who can’t get Hindi spellings right, as state higher education minister.

09-08-2020||New Delhi||Congress must find full-term president to arrest perception of being ‘rudderless’: Tharoor||The Congress must expedite the process of finding a full-term president to arrest the growing public perception that the party is “adrift and rudderless”, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said on Sunday. Tharoor also said that he certainly thinks Rahul Gandhi has the “mettle, capability and aptitude to once again lead the party”, but if he does not wish to do so then the party must “take action” to elect a new chief. His comments assume significance as they come just ahead of Sonia Gandhi completing one year as interim chief on August 10, with the party yet to find her successor. “I certainly believe we should be clear about our leadership going forward. I welcomed Sonia ji’s appointment as interim president last year, but I do believe it’s unfair to her to expect her to carry this burden indefinitely,” Tharoor told PTI in an interview. “We also need to arrest the growing public perception, fuelled by a dismissive media, that the Congress is adrift and rudderless, incapable of taking up the challenge of a credible national opposition,” the former Union minister said.That is precisely what the Congress needs to urgently address by expediting the process of finding a full-term president, through a participatory and democratic process that will offer the winning candidate a legitimate mandate and the credibility that will be indispensable in ushering in much needed organisational and structural revival of the party, Tharoor said. Asked about growing voices in the Congress that Rahul Gandhi must come back as party chief and if it was the best possible scenerio that he returns, Tharoor said, “Of course, if Rahul Gandhi is ready to resume the leadership, all he has to do is to withdraw his resignation. He was elected to serve till December 2022 and can just pick up the reins again.”         “But if he does not, we have to take action. My own personal view, which, as you know, I have been advocating for some time now, is that elections to the CWC (Congress Working Committee) and for the post of president would certainly have a number of beneficial outcomes for the party,” Tharoor said. A participatory democratic process would significantly add to the incoming leader’s credibility and legitimacy which, in turn, would be vital assets as they set about the significant organisational challenges associated with re-energising the rank and file of the party, the Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram said. Tharoor asserted that his larger argument was not about any individual but about advocating a process or a system through which the Congress can address existing leadership issues and then embark immediately on the process of revitalising and energising the party nationally.“Through his activities during this lockdown, whether it has been on the issue of the COVID-19 virus or Chinese transgressions, Rahul Gandhi has without a question and almost single-handedly done a remarkable job in holding the present government accountable for its actions and failures,” he said.Rahul Gandhi has also displayed tremendous foresight and vision, been a constructive voice that has offered critical inputs and has shown an impressive capability to really understand the aspirations of the people of this country during these challenging times, Tharoor said.“I hope he will continue doing that, whether as president or in any other capacity of his choosing,” he said. A reluctant Sonia Gandhi had taken over as interim chief on August 10 last year after Rahul Gandhi resigned taking responsibility for the party’s debacle in the Lok Sabha election. Asked about the Congress coming under attack from various quarters over what was seen by many as a subtle shift in its position on the Ram temple issue and allegations that it was being “BJP-lite”, Tharoor said he does not believe that the party has compromised on its secularism. The Congress has traditionally furthered a brand of secularism that recognises India’s pluralism. In other words, it acknowledges a profusion of religions and beliefs, where all are equally respected and can peacefully co-exist, Tharoor said.Asked about questions being raised over many Congress leaders making remarks on the Ram temple issue which are at variance with the party’s secular stance, Tharoor said those who look at the Congress as ‘BJP-lite’ or ‘Hindutva-lite’ do not take Congress’ own assurances at face value---“that it remains a party for all, the safest refuge for the minorities, the weak and the marginalised, and fundamentally committed to secularism”.           “But the truth is that Congress is the only major party to say all of this and mean it. The BJP does not even bother to pretend that it has the interests of any of these sections at heart,” he claimed. “Our critics see the Congress party’s distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva as specious. They reject its leaders’ arguments that the Hinduism respected by Congress leaders is inclusive and non-judgemental, whereas Hindutva is a political doctrine based on exclusion,” Tharoor said. The critics are quick to conclude that what the Congress offers is merely a watered-down version of the BJP’s political messaging, he said. Asserting that nothing could be farther from the truth, Tharoor said Rahul Gandhi has himself made it explicitly clear that, for all his willingness to avow his personal Hinduism, he does not support any form of Hindutva, “neither soft nor hard”.

09-08-2020||New Delhi||BSF orders ‘Independence Day walk’ at border posts on August 15||The Border Security Force (BSF) has directed organising an ‘Independence Day walk’ at all its borders posts and field units along the Pakistan and Bangladesh fronts on August 15, officials said on Sunday.The headquarters of the about 2.5 lakh personnel strong force has asked all its formation commanders to ensure that a senior officer spends two nights—August 14 and 15 -- at each border post along the Pakistan and Bangladesh front along with other offices and training centres of the paramilitary.This is a part of the 74th Independence Day celebrations.The officials said an order has been issued by the headquarters of the force here on August 6 on the directions of BSF chief S S Deswal, who has launched a slew of fitness programmes in the force.Deswal is heading the BSF in an additional capacity for over four months now and he is the regular Director-General (DG) of the ITBP that guards the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.He has initiated these activities in the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) too, they said.As per the order for August 15, the officers who visit and halt at the border posts will undertake four things: Flag hoisting, tree plantation, 10-km ‘Independence Day walk’ with all the troops and officers of the post and organise a ‘badakhana’ or grand fest with 50 selected troops who have done “exceptional work”.It has been directed that all COVID-19 protocols and precautions should be adhered to and security concerns at “sensitive” posts should be kept in mind, the officials said.These fitness drills and courses have been initiated by Deswal who has ordered that all fat and obese personnel in the border guarding force should be identified and sent for physical training.He himself takes part in numerous such walking and trekking sessions along with senior officers and other personnel.Recently, disciplinary action has been ordered against a doctor of the force for alleged lapses in declaring a 160 kg jawan fit for undertaking a physical fitness course during which he died.The 45-year-old constable had died on July 17 just after he reported for a physical fitness course at the BSF subsidiary training centre in Rajasthan’s Jodhpur.

They were taken to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared them ‘brought dead’. All of them died after inhaling toxic fumes inside the tank,” he said.The bodies will he handed over to the family members after post-mortem, he added.

09-08-2020||Etah (Uttar Pradesh)||Artisans in Etah make 2,100kg bell for Ram temple||A team of artisans at Jalesar town in Etah district of Uttar Pradesh have forged a bell weighing a whopping 2,100 kg for the new Ram temple in Ayodhya and are preparing to give it final touches before sending it to the holy town.While Dau Dayal, 50, was primarily responsible for making the 'ashtadhatu' bell, Iqbal Mistri, 56, was in charge of the designing, grinding, and polishing work. Both pointed out that it was the first time in their lives that they were working on a bell of this size."When you work on a bell of this size, the challenges are greater. It is really hard to ensure you do not make a single mistake in the process," said Dau Dayal.Explaining the process, he said: "What is unique is that the bell is in one piece—no multiple pieces welded together. This is what makes the task much more difficult. The whole effort will go to waste even if there is a delay of five seconds in pouring the molten metal into the mould."The casting of the bell involves many lengthy steps—determining the shape and measurements painstakingly, cutting out wooden templates to make the mould, preparing metal, tuning, grinding, and fitting the clapper. A crane was used to pour the alloy into the mould.The 'ashtadhatu' bell is a combination of eight metals—gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead, tin, iron, and mercury.A team of around 25 workers, both Hindus and Muslims, worked for a month for eight hours a day to make what would be 'among the largest bells' in the country."This piece, one of the largest bells in India, will be donated to the Ram temple," said Vikas Mittal, Chairman of Jalesar Municipal Council and owner of the workshop where the bell has been made.The Mittals got the order to prepare the bell from the Nirmohi Akhara—one of the litigants in the Ayodhya title dispute—immediately after the matter was decided last November by the apex court, paving the way for the construction of the temple."We believe there is some divine reason that this work came to us. So, we decided to donate it to the temple," says Aditya Mittal, a brother of Vikas.The bell cost them Rs 21 lakh. From the initial plan to design finalisation to manufacture, the entire manufacturing process took around four months."Final touches are needed before it is sent to Ayodhya," said Shubham Mittal.The Mittals had also presented a 51-kg bell to Yogi Adityanath, when he came to Etah to address his first public meeting after becoming the Chief Minister.Earlier, Dayal had cast a 101-kg bell put up at the Kedarnath temple in Uttarakhand."This is the largest and the heaviest bell we have worked on, so far. We had also cast a 1,000-kg bell for the Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain," he said.Dayal, a fourth-generation bell-maker, said that making bells for schools was a part of his business.He said that the bells cast in Jalesar's soil ring better. The sound of the bell, prepared for the Ram temple, can be heard up to 15 km, he claimed.Jalesar's brass handicraft has benefited under the Yogi Adityanath government's 'one district-one product'(ODOP) scheme.

09-08-2020||Mumbai||Politicisation of Sushant Singh Rajput case a conspiracy against Maharashtra: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday claimed "pressure tactics" were being used in the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death and the issue was being politicised as part of a conspiracy against Maharashtra.It is wrong to see the unfortunate suicide of the actor from a political angle, Raut said in his weekly column 'Rokhthok' in the party mouthpiece 'Saamana'.Rajput, 34, was found hanging at his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) recently took over the probe in the case, based on a Patna police FIR related to alleged criminal conspiracy and abetment to suicide against Rajput's girlfriend and actor Rhea Chakraborty."If one wants to indulge in politicisation and pressure tactics, anything can happen in our country. It looks like the script of Sushant's case was already written.Whatever has happened behind the curtains is a conspiracy against Maharashtra," Raut said.When it is decided to politicise an incident,one cannot say to what extent it can be done and "this is what is happening in the unfortunate suicide of Rajput", he said.Raut said the Bihar government alleged involvement oftop political, film and business personalities and it claimed Mumbai Police will not investigate the case properly."That government demands CBI probe which is accepted in 24 hours. Attorney General Tushar Mehta tells the Supreme Court that the Centre has decided to hand over the probe to the CBI," Raut said, claiming this was a "direct attack on a state's autonomy".Describing Mumbai Police as the "best investigating agency in the world" and a professional force, he said, "It investigated the Sheena Bora murder case where some top names were involved and sent all to jail. The Mumbai Police probed the 26/11 terror attack which resulted in the hanging of the accused Ajmal Kasab," the Rajya Sabha member said.The Centre's "interference" in Rajput's case was an insult of the Mumbai Police, he claimed, adding the CBI may be a central agency, but it "wasn't independent and impartial"."Even Narendra Modi and Amit Shah had earlier questioned the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI. They had said the Godhra riots case shouldn't be handed over to the CBI because it was a political weapon in the hands of those ruling at the Centre. If the same view is aired now, what's wrong in that," the executive editor of 'Saamana' said."Prima facie, Sushant Singh Rajput's case is that of suicide. There is no basis for repeated allegations that he had been murdered," he said.Raut alleged that since the BJP cannot topple the Uddhav Thackeray government (comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) in Maharashtra, it has decided to "malign it and with the help of news channels."(NCP chief) Sharad Pawar called me when he saw a news channel anchor referring to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in first person. 'The chief minister is not an individual but an institute. What is the government doing'?" he said quoting Pawar.Raut claimed that Bihar Director General of Police Gupteshwar Pandey giving interview to a channel against Maharashtra was "violation of police discipline".Pandey wanted to contest the Assembly elections from Buxar (in Bihar) in 2009, but his plan was aborted after the BJP candidate from there threatened to contest against as an independent, Raut further claimed."It is laughable that Pandey should question the professionalism of Mumbai Police. It is being said Pandey can now fight the Bihar polls from Shahpur seat," he said.Raut said the Mumbai Police should have registered a 'zero FIR' and continued with the probe in Rajput's case.But Rajput's family had no complaints and left Mumbai for Patna (some days after his death). "The BJP politicised the incident and created a sensation" by linking a young minister in the Maharashtra cabinet to the case. Two English news channels started challenging the chief minister and confused the police, he said.The Mumbai Police should have started media briefing, considering the case is becoming high profile, and should have declared that if any minister or politician name crops up, his statement will be recorded, Raut opined.He said a party at the house of actor Dino Morea before Rajput's death was being linked to the case. "Morea and others are friends of (state cabinet minister) Aaditya Thackeray and if that friendship is the cause of targetting the latter, it is wrong," he added.Raut claimed Rajput did not share good relations with his father."His father's second marriage was not acceptable to him (Rajput). Let the facts come out how many times  Rajput visited his family in Patna. Why did (Rajput's former girlfriend) Anita Lokhande split from Rajput and this should be part of the probe. It is wrong to see the unfortunate suicide from a political angle," he said.Raut lamented that Rajput's former manager Disha Salian, who allegedly committed suicide a week before the actor's death, was also being maligned.Rajput's father K K Singh on July 25 lodged a complaint with the Bihar police against Chakraborty, her parents, brother, her former manager Shruti Modi and one Samuel Miranda, whom Chakraborty had employed as the manager in Rajput's house.Based on the complaint, the Bihar police registered an FIR against the accused persons and booked them under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including abetment to suicide, criminal conspiracy, cheating and wrongful confinement.

The Vashi GRP returned Rs 300 to me. They deducted Rs 100 for stamp paper work and said the remaining Rs 500 would be returned after exchanging the scrapped currency note with a new one," Padalkar told PTI.He said when he went to the GRP office, there were many who had come to collect their stolen money, amounting into several thousands in demonetised currency, and wondered how they would get it back.Padalkar said he was happy to get his money back.A GRP official said those who stole Padalkar's wallet were arrested sometime back."We recovered Padalkar's wallet containing Rs 900 from the accused. We handed over Rs 300 to Padalkar and the remaining Rs 500 would be returned to him after the currency note is exchanged with a new one," he added.

09-08-2020||New Delhi||Defence Minister promised a ‘bang’, ended with a ‘whimper’: Congress||The Congress on Sunday played down Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s announcement on the import embargo on defence equipment, saying it was only “high sounding jargon” and that ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ was merely a slogan.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi also criticised Singh for dubbing the import restrictions as a push to achieve a self-reliant India, saying there was a "big difference between claims and reality.The Prime Minister has given the slogan of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ but has not said when, how and what would be the direction. Just a slogan has been given because this government and the Prime Minister are fond of slogans,” Singhvi said at an online media briefing.Also read: Embargo on import of 101 defence items, focus on self-reliance: RajnathSenior Congress leader P Chidambaram said the Defence Minister promised a “bang” on a Sunday morning but ended with a “whimper”.“The only importer of defence equipment is the Defence Ministry. Any import embargo is really an embargo on oneself,” the former home minister said.What the Defence Minister said in his “historic Sunday announcement” deserved only an office order from the minister to his secretaries, Chidambaram said in a series of tweets.“Import embargo is high sounding jargon. What it means is we will try to make the same equipment (that we import today) in 2 to 4 years and stop imports thereafter!” he said.Singhvi, in response to a question, said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s statement was both “funny as well as unfortunate”.“Who is the biggest importer of these defence items, it is the Defence Ministry departments. So, the Defence Ministry will reduce its imports. Secondly, it will take three to four years to reduce the imports,” he said.The country should achieve self-reliance in the private sector instead, he said, adding that the Defence Ministry could have reduced its imports whenever it wanted to.The opposition party was reacting after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced restrictions on import of 101 weapons and military platforms including artillery guns, assault rifles and transport aircraft, in a major reform initiative to boost the domestic defence industry.“The Ministry of Defence is now ready for a big push to #AtmanirbharBharat initiative,” Singh said on Twitter while making the announcement.He said the Ministry has prepared a list of 101 items for which the embargo on imports was planned to be progressively implemented between 2020 and 2024.

Government authorities have stipulated that those at 65 age and above cannot go out to work... For people like me, my profession and my 78 yrs, it's packers then!" Bachchan, 78, wrote on his blog on Saturday.The court was hearing two petitions, one filed by 70-year-old actor Pramod Pandey, and another by the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association (IMPPA).According to government resolutions, while the state was permitting a gradual resumption of some activities, including shootings and pre and post-production work of films, television and OTT programmes, such cast and crew members who were above 65 years of age would not be permitted to report to work at sets or studios.The regulations barred such artistes from remaining present in studios or on shoot sets.The government counsel, Purnima Kantharia, told the court that the prohibition had been imposed since those above 65 were at a higher risk of contracting coronavirus."The Film body that formally we are all associated with did put in a counter to that in the Courts and I believe the Honourable High Court has disallowed the age limit restrictions and so for the moment those above 50 are safe to work .. but Courts and Legal procedures take time and I wonder what shall come out of it," said Bachchan.In the meanwhile, the senior actor also asked his fans and followers to suggest alternate career options for him."Are there any alternate work jobs for me, that the Ef could in their kindness suggest, in case everything goes down in the Courts?" he said.Bachchan, his son, actor Abhishek Bachchan, actor-daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and granddaughter Aaradhya Bachchan were all admitted at the isolation ward of the Nanavati Hospital here after they tested positive for COVID-19 in July. While Abhishek tested negative on Saturday and returned home, Aishwarya (46) and Aaradhya (eight), who were initially quarantining at their home, were shifted to the hospital on July 17 and were discharged 10 days later.

09-08-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi releases Rs 17,000 crore to 8.5 crore farmers under PM-KISAN scheme||Asserting that the government’s agri-reforms are focused on empowering small farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday launched a financing facility of Rs 1 lakh-crore under the Agri-Infra Fund that will help create post harvest infrastructure in villages and generate jobs.Meanwhile, the Prime Minister transferred Rs 17,000 crore directly into the bank accounts of 8.5 crore farmers under the PM-KISAN scheme.Modi also said that the country does not face problems in farm production but in post-harvest losses and therefore efforts are being made to strengthen post harvest infrastructure facilities and ensure better income for farmers.Modi launched the fund through a video conference on the auspicious occasion of Balram Jayanthi, a day when farmers worship plough. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and farmers from some states also participated in the video conference.“On this auspicious occasion, a special fund of Rs 1 lakh-crore has been launched to create agriculture-related infrastructure facilities in the country.“This will help in creating better storage facilities and modern cold storage chains in villages. Many employment opportunities will get created in villages,” Modi said after the launch.The Prime Minister reiterated that India has a huge opportunity to invest in post-harvest management solutions like warehousing, cold chain, and food processing, and build a global presence in areas such as organic and fortified foods.He also mentioned that this scheme provides a good opportunity for start-ups in agriculture to avail the benefits and scale their operations, thereby creating an ecosystem that reaches farmers in every corner of the country.Modi also interacted with farmers from Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh who are among the initial beneficiaires of the credit facility under this new fund through Primary Agricultural Credit Societies for creating post harvest facilities.Under the Agri-Infra Fund, about Rs 1 lakh-crore will be sanctioned under the financing facility in partnership with multiple lending institutions as loans to Primary Agri Credit Societies (PACS), farmer groups, Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), agri-entrepreneurs, start-ups and agri-tech players.Already, 11 of the 12 public sector banks have signed initial agreements with the Agriculture Ministry.Under the fund, about 3 per cent interest subvention and credit guarantee of up to Rs 2 crore will be provided to the beneficiaries to increase the viability of the projects.Loans will be disbursed in four years starting with a sanction of Rs 10,000 crore in the current year and Rs 30,000 crore each in the next three financial years.PM releases Rs 17,000 cr to 8.5 cr farmers      Meanwhile, the Prime Minister transferred Rs 17,000 crore directly into the bank accounts of 8.5 crore farmers under the PM-KISAN scheme.He said the scheme has been successful in its objective to provide financial support to farmers without any involvement of middlemen.The Centre provides Rs 6,000 per year in three equal instalments under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme that was launched in December 2018.The Prime Minister “released the 6th installment under the PM-KISAN scheme of Rs 17,000 crore to nearly 8.5 crore farmers. The cash benefit was transferred directly to their Aadhaar verified bank accounts with the press of a button”, an official statement said.The amount was transferred to farmers at a function organised through video conference to launch financial facility of Rs 1 lakh crore under the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund.“No middlemen, no commisison. The amount was transferred directly to farmers,” Modi said.The scheme has been successful in its objective to provide direct help to farmers and when needed, he added.Modi said the government has transferred Rs 75,000 crore to farmers under this scheme in the last one-and-a-half years, of which Rs 22,000 crore was remitted during the lockdown period.The PM-KISAN scheme was launched to provide income support by way of a cash benefit to all landholding farmers (subject to certain exclusion criteria) to enable them to fulfill their agricultural requirements and support their families.With this transfer, the scheme has provided over Rs 90,000 crore in the hands of more than 10 crore farmers since its launch on December 2018, the statement said.

09-08-2020||New Delhi||Embargo on import of 101 defence items, focus on self-reliance: Rajnath||The Ministry of Defence has come out with a ‘Negative Import List’ of 101 types of military equipment, weapons and ammunition which will be progressively barred from imports starting December 2020.This includes weapon systems like artillery guns, assault rifles, Warships, sonar systems, transport aircraft, light combat helicopters (LCHs), radars.The list also includes, wheeled Armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) with indicative import embargo date of December 2021, of which the Army is expected to contract almost 200 at an approximate cost of over Rs 5,000 crore.Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi has given a clarion call for a self-reliant India based on the five pillars, i.e., Economy, Infrastructure, System, Demography & Demand and announced a special economic package for Self-Reliant India named ‘Atamnirbhar Bharat’.  Also read: Defence reforms to steer India towards ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, boost indigenous production: Industry 'PM Modi to present new outline for a self-reliant India on Aug 15'Similarly, the Navy is likely to place demands for Submarines with an indicative import embargo date of December 2021, of which it expects to contract about six at an approximate cost of almost Rs 42,000 crore. For the Air Force, it is decided to enlist the LCA MK 1A with an indicative embargo date of December 2020. Of these, 123 are anticipated at an approximate cost of over Rs 85,000 crore.The embargo on imports is planned to be progressively implemented between 2020 to 2024.With an embargo on the import of 101 items, it is estimated that contracts worth almost Rs 4,00,000 crore will be placed upon the domestic industry within the next five to seven years. Of these, items worth almost Rs 1,30,000 crore each are anticipated for the Army and the Air Force while items worth almost Rs 1,40,000 crore are anticipated by the Navy over the same period.In another major step, the MoD has bifurcated the capital procurement budget for 2020-21 between domestic and foreign capital procurement routes. A separate budget head has been created with an outlay of nearly Rs 52,000 crore for domestic capital procurement in the current financial year.The Department of Military Affairs (DMA) headed by the Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat prepared a list of 101 items for which there would be an embargo on the import beyond the timeline indicated against them.This offers a great opportunity to the Indian defence industry to manufacture the items in the negative list by using their own design and development capabilities or adopting the technologies designed and developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).The list is prepared by MoD after several rounds of consultations with all stakeholders, including Army, Air Force, Navy, DRDO, Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and private industry to assess current and future capabilities of the Indian industry for manufacturing various ammunition/weapons/platforms/equipment within India.More such equipment for import embargo would be identified progressively by the DMA in consultation with all stakeholders.Taking cue from that evocation, the Ministry of Defence has prepared a list of 101 items for which there would be an embargo on the import beyond the timeline indicated against them. This is a big step towards self-reliance in defence. #AtmanirbharBharat||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/embargo-on-import-of-101-defence-items-focus-on-self-reliance-rajnath-124197

The saffron party may also move some MLAs to Madhya Pradesh, it is learnt.The move comes amid reports of Ashok Gehlot trying to influence them. Though according to BJP leaders, the MLAs were being “harassed” by the state police and administration, and therefore decided to go on a “pilgrimage voluntarily”, until now it was Gehlot who was accusing the BJP of “horse-trading” and trying to “poach” Congress MLAs to topple his government in Rajasthan.BSP MLAs move SC for transfer of pleaSix MLAs, elected to the Rajasthan Assembly on BSP ticket and later merged with Congress, on Saturday moved the Supreme Court seeking transfer of their disqualification plea from the High Court, contending similar petitions are pending before it. PTIThe Congress imbroglio in Rajasthan has also exposed factionalism and contours of different groups within the BJP. Though the BJP leaders say “it is just a matter of time” before the Gehlot government falls under its own weight, they do not want to take any chance, given the long gap before the Assembly session.There appears to be a clear “directive” from Nagpur that the person holding the top post should be from saffron/Sangh ‘parivaar’. Therefore, if the Gehlot government falls, the next question would be “which BJP leader will be the Chief Minister”. Former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who has been keeping away from the BJP meetings in Jaipur, met party chief JP Nadda “to discuss the political situation in Rajasthan”.In states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan, there is no dearth of in-house talent from the Sangh background.In those terms, Congress rebel Sachin Pilot is “certainly a misfit” despite BJP state chief Satish Poonia saying: “Sachin Pilot revolted to become the Chief Minister...there is a history in the country that those who have fewer MLAs go on to become chief ministers.”Though Raje is said to have the support of around 40 MLAs, there are others in the running, including Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and state leaders Om Mathur and Satish Poonia with their large network of party cadres and “Nagpur” connection. Leader of the Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria is another hopeful, though he is above 75.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-bjp-shifts-mlas-to-gujarat-124110

Sources said the meeting time was finalised late Friday night. The General Officer Commanding 3 Division, Major General Abhijit Bapat, led the talks.Depsang is a flat plateau at an altitude of 16,000 feet through which passes the Darbuk-Shayok-DBO (DSDBO) road that links up to the DBO landing ground and further northwards to the Karakoram pass. Any bid to cut off the DBO could restrict access to the Karakoram pass and even attempt to seize the 20,000 feet high Sasser La, west of Depsang. It further opens a route to Sasoma and crucially the road to Siachen.All such attempts by the PLA can be thwarted for now, explained an official.
