These states may also witness rain or thundershowers over the next two days.In Uttar Pradesh, light to moderate rains and thundershowers occurred at many places, with the MeT department predicting similar weather for Tuesday too.Heavy rains continued to pound Gujarat, especially the Saurashtra region, flooding low-lying areas and disrupting normal life.With many rivers in a spate in the state, over 1,900 people in Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Sabarkantha, and Patan districts were shifted to safer places.Many dams, including the Aji Dam in Rajkot and Kadi Dam in Mehsana, received a large inflow of water. Many low-lying areas were marooned as gates of overflowing dams were opened.Gujarat received more than 102 per cent of the annual average rainfall till Monday morning.Of the nine rain-related deaths in the state, two were due to collapse of houses in Junagadh and Tapi districts, while seven drowned in separate incidents in Mehsana, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Tapi, Narmada and Morbi, officials said.As on Monday morning, the state received 102.73 per cent of the annual average rainfall, with Kutch recording the highest 188.04 per cent so far, according to government data.The state is very likely to witness an “active wet spell” till Tuesday.In the east, a low-pressure area has formed over the north Bay of Bengal that can bring heavy to very heavy rains in most parts of Odisha and south Bengal, raising fears of floods, landslide and waterlogging.The IMD issued an ‘orange’ coloured warning for Gangetic Bengal and Odisha’s Balasore, Bhadrak, Jajpur, Kendrapara, Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar districts.A ‘red’ colour warning has been issued for Balasore, Bhadrak, Jajpur, Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj, Dhenkanal, Angul and Deogarh districts of Odisha for Tuesday and Wednesday.The Odisha government has asked district collectors to deal with a possible flash flood, landslide and waterlogging.Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the deep sea in north Bay Of Bengal from August 25 to 27 as squally weather with wind speed up to 55 kmph may prevail in the region, the weatherman said.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has expressed concern at the possibility of floods and asked officials to be prepared to deal with the emerging situation.Speaking to district officials from state secretariat, Banerjee said already some places have got inundated owing to overflowing of some rivers and breaches in embankments. She said that while there is a forecast for heavy rain in some districts over the next few days, rivers have already crossed the danger-mark in Malda and some other places.Banerjee called for proper planning to ensure that hospitals and healthcare centres are not flooded if the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) releases water from its dams in Jharkhand.Several places in Ghatal subdivision of West Midnapore district have been submerged owing to overflowing of the Shilabati river and continuing rain, officials said, adding at Minakha in North 24 Parganas, the Bidyadhari river breached embankment at a few places, flooding agricultural fields.The weatherman said that the low-pressure system is likely to intensify in the next couple of days. Heavy rain is likely to occur in the districts of East and West Midnapore, South 24 Parganas, Jhargram, Howrah, Hooghly, Bankura and Birbhum, while thunderstorm with lightning is likely in other places of Gangetic Bengal.With several rivers in the region already in spate owing to heavy downpour over he past few days, people living in the coastal districts are apprehensive of flooding of agricultural fields and low-lying areas.Heavy rains lashed Birbhum district, while other parts of Gangetic Bengal also received showers since Sunday morning, the weather department said.In Bihar, the flood situation remained critical with 83.62 lakh people across 16 districts still being affected, even as no fresh areas were hit by the deluge in the last two days.The number of flood victims and affected areas remained the same since Saturday, the Disaster Management Department’s bulletin stated, adding that 83,62,451 people in 1,333 panchayats of 130 blocks are reeling under the impact of the calamity.Flood-related deaths also remained unchanged at 27.However, the number of people being served cooked food has come down to 1.60 lakh on Monday from 1.78 lakh the previous day. The number of community kitchens also reduced by 21 since Sunday to reach 198, the bulletin said.

Those are genuine demands including the CWC elections, the constitution of the Parliamentary Board and elections to the central election committee,” a leader said adding that the mention by Sonia Gandhi herself that her continuation couldn’t be open-ended is signal enough that the AICC session would be held as early as possible to elect the new chief.“We will take it from there,” said an ex-minister who signed the pro-reform letter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-dissenters-meet-say-ready-for-long-haul-in-party-interest-130784

24-08-2020||New Delhi||Did he say it or did he not—Rahul’s remarks on letter writers create flutter||Did Rahul Gandhi say it or did he not? This was the question on everyone’s mind after his purported remarks on a letter written by over 20 party leaders seeking urgent organisational reforms created a flutter.High drama played out at the nearly seven-hour Congress Working Committee meeting with sources saying that Rahul Gandhi lashed out at the letter writers and some leaders found it to be insinuating that it was written in cahoots with the BJP.However, the Congress promptly denied this and said “not a word of this nature” was said by the former party chief.Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal, one of the 23 signatories to the letter addressed to Sonia Gandhi seeking an immediate organisational overhaul and a collective leadership, hit out at Rahul Gandhi in a tweet, saying, “Rahul says ‘we are colluding with BJP’. Succeeded in Rajasthan High Court defending the Congress Party. Defending party in Manipur to bring down BJP government.”“Last 30 years have never made a statement in favour of BJP on any issue. Yet ‘we are colluding with the BJP’!”                 But Sibal posted another tweet a little later, saying he was withdrawing his earlier tweet after being “informed by Rahul Gandhi personally that he never said what was attributed to him”.Tagging Sibal’s earlier tweet, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also said that Rahul Gandhi hasn’t said a word of this nature nor alluded to it.“Please don’t be misled by false media discourse or misinformation being spread. But yes, we all need to work together in fighting the draconian Modi rule rather than fighting & hurting each other and the Congress,” Surjewala tweeted.Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad was also at the centre of the controversy with a section of the media reporting that he offered to resign over Rahul Gandhi’s remarks.Seeking to set the record straight, the leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha said a section of the media was “wrongly attributing that, in CWC I told Shri Rahul Gandhi to prove that the letter written by us is in collusion with BJP”.“Let me make it very clear that Shri Rahul Gandhi has neither in CWC nor outside said that this letter was written at the behest of BJP. What I said was, yesterday some Congress person had said that we did it at behest of BJP & in that context I said ‘It is most unfortunate that some colleagues (outside CWC) have accused us of collusion with BJP, and if those people can prove this allegation, I will resign’”.Congress MP Manickram Tagore also tagged Sibal’s earlier tweet and said, “Kapil Sibal ji We all have great respect for you. @INCIndia made you cabinet minister and gives a lot of importance. you are NOT inside the CWC. You are reacting to a leak that is false. It does not reflect well on a leader as senior as you are, to react to hearsay.”              He later posted another tweet to thank Sibal after the former cabinet minister clarified his remarks and withdrew his earlier post.Some BJP leaders also hit out at Rahul Gandhi over his purported remarks that the letter by over 20 Congress leaders seeking changes in the organisation will help the ruling party. They said Gandhi was “obsessed” with the saffron party and that “one’s destruction is near when one stops using his own mind”.“So obsessed is Rahul Gandhi with the BJP that he is beginning to see Congress’ veteran leaders as those working in ‘collusion’ with BJP. Someone rightly said when one’s destruction is near, one stops using his own mind,” BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav said.BJP’s Tom Vadakkan, who was in the Congress for decades and was considered close to the Gandhi family before he joined the saffron party last year, said the opposition party’s internal politics is being played out as a result of their “misdeeds”.“Mirror has cracked. When a mirror cracks, there is no way to put it together. You have to throw it out,” he said in a swipe at the Congress leadership over the letter.Vadakkan also said the commitment of the leaders, who are signatories to the letter and include veterans like Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Ghulam Nabi Azad, to the Congress is “definitely much more” than Rahul Gandhi.“They are not born in the party. They have lived in the party. They have only suggested a course correction and free and fair elections and a leader who is available to lead the party round the clock,” he said.Vadakkan claimed that the denial by the Congress that Rahul Gandhi made any statement linking the letter’s signatories to the BJP was an “afterthought”.“He (Rahul) believes if you are not with him, then you are with the BJP, not even the Trinamool Congress or any other party,” the BJP leader said.

24-08-2020||New Delhi||Flat buyers entitled to compensation for delayed possession, lack of assured amenities: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday held that the flat buyers are entitled to compensation for “delayed handing over of possession” and for the failure of the developer to fulfil their promises with regard to amenities.The top court set aside the verdict of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) which, on July 2, 2019, had dismissed the complaints of 339 flat buyers by holding that they were not entitled to the compensation in excess of what was stipulated in their flat purchase agreements for delayed possession and the lack of assured amenities.The purchasers had booked residential flats with DLF Southern Homes Pvt Ltd, now known as Begur OMR Homes Pvt. Ltd, in a project called Westend Heights at New Town, DLF, BTM Extension at Begu, Bengaluru.The project was being developed in an area admeasuring 27.5 acres and was to consist of 1980 units, spread across nineteen towers each consisting of a stilt and eighteen floors.They had moved the NCDRC seeking compensation on account of delay in handing over possession of the flats, reimbursement of taxes and interest charged to the flat purchasers under the agreement , deficiency in providing amenities, levy of electricity charges by the developer and failure to construct the club house.The NCDRC had held that delay in the handing over of flats to the purchasers was admitted, but the agreements had provided compensation at the rate of Rs 5 per square foot of the super area for every month of delay.The NCDRC had also held that the flat purchasers who agreed to this stipulation in the agreements were not entitled to seek any amount in addition.“We have come to the conclusion that the dismissal of the complaint by the NCDRC was erroneous. The flat buyers are entitled to compensation for delayed handing over of possession and for the failure of the developer to fulfil the representations made to flat buyers in regard to the provision of amenities.“The reasoning of the NCDRC on these facets suffers from a clear perversity and patent errors of law which have been noticed in the earlier part of this judgment. Allowing the appeals in part, we set aside the impugned judgment and order of the NCDRC dated July 2, 2019 dismissing the consumer complaint,” a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and K M Joseph said in its 53-page judgement.The bench said the flat owners are entitled to the compensation in excess of the amount stipulated in their agreements with the developers.“Save and except for eleven appellants who entered into specific settlements with the developer and three appellants who have sold their right, title and interest under the ABA (agreement), the first and second respondents (developers) shall, as a measure of compensation, pay an amount calculated at the rate of 6 per cent simple interest per annum to each of the appellants,” it said.The compensation amount shall be computed on the total money paid towards the purchase of the respective flats with effect from the date of expiry of thirty-six months from the execution of the respective flat purchase agreements until the date of the offer of possession after the receipt of the occupation certificate, it said.The compensation amount shall be in addition to the money which has been paid over or credited by the developer at the rate of Rs 5 per square foot per month at the time of the drawing of final accounts, it said.The top court asked developers to pay the compensation within a period of one month from the date of this judgment and cautioned that failure in making payment, shall carry interest at the rate of nine per cent per annum until payment.The plea was filed by Wg Cdr Arifur Rahman Khan and others against the order of the NCDRC dismissing their consumer complaints.The purchasers had said after booking their flats, they were informed in January 2011 that possession of the apartments was expected to be completed by the middle of 2012.“This assurance was not fulfilled. By a communication dated 18 June 2013, the developers issued a revised timeline intimating all flat buyers that the delivery of possession would commence from October 2013. However, on 8 August 2013 another communication was issued stating that the real estate industry was affected by an economic slowdown which had hampered the pace of construction. The date for handing over possession was extended to June 2014…,” the judgement said, noting the grievances of purchasers.

However, the House withdrew the motion later in the day after the BJP legislator expressed regret over his behaviour.The House was adjourned sine die in the evening after passing 13 Bills.Rathore had argued with the Speaker complaining that Opposition members were not allowed enough time to speak on the Bills.BJP members had also trooped into the Well of the House, shouting slogans. Amid the din, the House was briefly adjourned four times.During the discussion on the Rajasthan Rehabilitation of Beggars or Indigents (Amendment) Bill, 2020, the Speaker asked BJP MLA Madan Dilawar to confine himself to the Bill, saying it was not a general debate.When BJP MLA Kiran Maheshwari was also asked to stick to the Bill, Rathore intervened, asking the Speaker to let the members speak.The Speaker then asked Opposition members to return to their seats.  When Rathore challenged the Chair, the Speaker asked Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal to move a proposal for his removal from the House.Opposition members continued their protest and squatted in the Well of the House even after the Congress-dominated House passed the motion.The Speaker then suggested that Rathore should leave the House for two minutes and he will ask the ruling party to move another proposal to bring him back. But the BJP MLAs continued with the protest.Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said the MLAs had no intention of violating the Speaker’s ruling, but they had not been given any time to examine the five Bills introduced by the government on Monday.“No member has studied them, how can they be discussed?” he said. The Opposition then staged a walk out.While the opposition members were not present in the House, Speaker C P Joshi said the Question Hour had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.He said other state assemblies too had followed the same practice during the pandemic.Joshi said another session can be called when the situation improves.He added it was distressing that the Opposition did not take part in the discussions.On the Speaker’s directions, the parliamentary affairs minister moved another proposal withdrawing the earlier resolution against Rathore.

She said a new technology to dissolve farm residue will be put to test this year.As the court wasn’t satisfied with the affidavits of the Centre and the Delhi Government on smog towers, it asked them to file fresh ones.During the hearing, advocate Charanpal Singh Bagri, representing farmers, complained that the issue was not being discussed with the farmers.Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to do so because of lack of financial incentives to switch over to environment-friendly farm waste management practices.Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes paddy residue of which farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it, while the figures in Haryana stood at 7 million tonnes and 1.23 million tonnes, respectively.State governments were now providing 50 to 80 per cent subsidy to farmers and cooperative societies to buy modern farm equipment for in-situ management of paddy straw. They’re also running an awareness campaigns against stubble burning.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, stubble burning was an important factor behind air pollution in Delhi-NCR last year, contributing up to 44 per cent of the air pollution in November.The Punjab Government had earlier told the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) that it has been utilising crop residue through biomass-based power plants and various bio-CNG projects are under process. It has proposed to set up a 25-megawatt solar-biomass project.Both Punjab and Haryana have set up thousands of custom hiring centres (CHCs) to give farm machinery on rental basis to farmers who cannot afford to buy high-end equipment for crop residue management.The court had on August 10 asked Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and UP to spell out steps taken to stop stubble burning that badly affected air quality in Delhi-NCR on the onset of winter.It had asked the Chief Secretary about the steps taken to providing machines and equipment to small and marginal farmers so as to dissuade them from burning stubble.The Punjab Chief Secretary had told the Bench that subsidy was being provided to small and marginal farmers but the state was facing financial constraints due to COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stubble-burning-sc-asks-punjab-haryana-and-up-to-hold-meeting-with-all-stakeholders-130756
24-08-2020||---||Indo-US meet to set tone for post-Galwan Valley interaction||New Delhi, August 24The first high-level Indo-US interaction, involving Cabinet Ministers and industry captains, to be held virtually later this week will set the framework for bilateral cooperation in the post-Galwan Valley environment.The deliberations, expected later next month, would feed into a joint meeting of the Foreign and Defence Ministers of both countries, said sources.US Vice President Mike Pence, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goel besides the captains of industry, including from the US Defence Industry, will address a week-long virtual conference on a raft of subjects in the economic and strategic spheres at the third summit of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum.The interaction is expected to see firm statements of intent from the newly-created US International Development Finance Corporation about countering China’s communication and infrastructure building spree in the Asia Pacific.India has gone along with the US-Japan-Australia troika’s formulations on the security side in the South China Sea but is keen to give a push to the economic leg.The latter aspect is also being deliberated in the run-up to a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, said sources.The possibility of Abe stepping down on health grounds is unlikely to make a difference to the dynamics of Indo-Japan ties which enjoy all-round support in Tokyo.The Indo-US two-plus-two talks will follow the India-Japan summit and will be co-chaired from the Indian side by Jaishankar, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and US Defence Secretary Mark Esper.The US and Australia recently held a similar two-plus-two meeting in Washington that saw Canberra pushing back at some of the US aggression on the South China Sea. However, there is alignment on the fundamentals of stalling China’s attempt to dominate the South China Sea and become a world leader in 5G technology.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indo-us-meet-to-set-tone-for-post-galwan-valley-interaction-130752
24-08-2020||New Delhi||EC says not violated any rules on allegation of illegally sharing voters’ ID database with police||The Election Commission of India (ECI) has made an alleged exception of its own “policy and practice” and shared electoral database with photos of voters of North-East Delhi with police for the purpose of identification after February 2020 communal violence in the city, revealed an RTI response received by activist Saket Gokhale.Sharing a letter from the ECI on Twitter, Gokhale alleged that the entire voter list with photos was handed over “illegally to the Delhi Police to enable identification of people”.But the poll panel, while responding to the allegation, in a statement asserted that it has not violated any of the guidelines in this regard.In the letter, the poll panel directed the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Delhi to “display the electoral roll along with images of electors of North-East Parliamentary Constituency” with the police.“I am directed to refer to your letter No F 2.(12/CEO/ER/ 2012351 dated 06.03.2020, on the subject cited, and to state that the electoral database of entire AC/District should not be shared with the Police Authorities in accordance with the Commission’s prevailing policy and practice.”However, the commission, keeping in view of the request of Delhi Police that photographs of electors, as available in the electoral roll of North-East Shahdara and East Delhi districts are to be matched with those of culprits captured through CCTV and other video footage available with the investigation team of recent incidences of violence in Delhi, “has directed to advise CEO Delhi to display the electoral roll along with images… before the investigating officer in his office. Action be taken accordingly”, read the letter.               Gokhale tweeted saying: “The 1st line of the order itself admits that voter lists shared with police CANNOT contain photos. ECI broke these rules & made these full voter lists WITH PHOTOS available to police after the Delhi pogrom. This is an easy way to identify minorities living in any area.”Responding to the allegation, poll panel said, “It is hereby clarified in view of the anecdotal reports which are not based on empirical facts that the commission has not in any way deviated from the original guidelines of 2008 and clarificatory orders of 2020 in any manner.”The commission in its detailed statement noted that as far as criminal investigations by regulatory/enforcement agencies are concerned, “it is under their own extant Acts, Rules and guidelines, which in any case can be challenged in the Hon’ble Courts of law”.It further said, “In fact, the entire super structure of the criminal justice system is erected on this. It is only when the Model Code of Conduct is enforced that the Commission invariably takes note of any such event(s)/incident(s), which have the potential of disturbing and/or disrupting the smooth conduct of electoral process and ECI does not interfere in the day to day functioning of the regulatory departments/enforcement agencies.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-says-not-violated-any-rules-on-allegation-of-illegally-sharing-voters-id-database-with-police-130741

24-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s CSMT station to get Rs 1,642 crore makeover||The iconic Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, which is a UNESCO recognised world heritage site and the biggest railway terminal in Mumbai, is set to get a makeover with world class facilities at a cost of Rs 1,642 crore, officials said on Monday.Under the project, the plan is to shift some railway offices from the premises to Byculla and Wadi Bunder yards, create more pedestrian area and have an access control system at the station, they said.The 130-year-old majestic building, constructed in Victorian Gothic style, houses the Central Railways headquarters and also platforms of the suburban and long distance trains.The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC) on August 20 invited the Request For Qualification (RFQ) for the redevelopment of the station through the public private partnership (PPP) model.Addressing reporters via virtual mode on Monday, ISRDC Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Sanjeev Kumar Lohia said the redevelopment of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) in south Mumbai would not only be limited to improving the facade of the station.“Since it is a heritage structure, the first important element is to restore its heritage. We will restore the heritage to the 1950-level, Lohia said.The project has received in principle approval of the public private partnership appraisal committee (PPPAC) and RFQ for the redevelopment of CSMT has been invited, he said.According to IRSDC, the project cost is Rs 1,642 crore, including the construction cost of Rs 1,231 crore and financing cost of Rs 328 crore.The re-devlopment of the structure will be done on DBFOT (design, build, finance, operate and transfer) basis.The bidding process will be done in two stages- RFQ and Request for Proposal (RFP).“The selected bidder at the RFP stage shall take up redevelopment of the railway station and commercial development of the surrounding railway land on leasehold basis, up to 60 years for commercial development and up to 99 years for residential development on selected plots, along with operation and maintenance of the station for 60 years on concession basis,” a release issued by IRSDC said.Under the project, authorities have planned to demolish some existing buildings in the CSMT premises and shift some railway offices to Byculla and Wadi Bunder yards, to create more pedestrian area on the southern end of the station.Even the existing taxi stand will be shifted close to the boundary wall adjoining the Saint George Hospital, officials said.Also, the Harbour line, which connects south Mumbai with western suburbs and Navi Mumbai, will be shifted to the P D’mello Road side on east of the main line station on an elevated level, they said.According to IRSDC, the stations will have an access control system and the passengers will have to pay a user fee, which the railway board will decide in future.The station was designed in 1878 by British architect F W Stevens in Victorian style, well aided with traditional Indian themes.Originally named as the Victoria Terminus, it was built at a cost of around Rs 16 lakh. The structure, which took nearly 10 years to be constructed, gave the 19th century Mumbai its gothic city look.

24-08-2020||Ahmedabad||Covid-19: EC broad guidelines on polls challenged in Gujarat High Court||The broad guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India for holding polls during the coronavirus pandemic was on Monday challenged in the Gujarat High Court as being in “complete contravention” of a Union Ministry of Home Affairs circular that prohibits any large gathering.As per a fresh set of guidelines issued by the ECI on Friday last, voters will be provided gloves while using EVMs and COVID-19 patients in quarantine will be allowed to vote in the last hour of polling, among other measures.The submission against the ECI guidelines has been made in a draft amendment to a PIL filed earlier seeking postponement of yet-to-be-declared schedule for by-elections to eight assembly seats in Gujarat in view of the pandemic.Petitioner Farsu Goklani said the ECI guidelines for conducting general and by-elections during the pandemic is in “complete contravention” of the circular issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on July 29.The MHA circular strictly prohibits “social/political/ ports/entertainment/academic/cultural/religious functions and other large congregations, Goklani said in the plea.The petition has sought the ECI guidelines to be quashed also because, it claimed, the poll body did not consult the Central Government before issuing them.It said as per the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the ECI can defer an election after consulting the Central Government, and if the latter certifies that it is difficult to hold the election.The draft amendment to the PIL moved by the petitioner said the ECI guidelines were not in consonance with the July 29 order of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).“The risk of conducting elections following the prescribed guidelines from the EC in the middle of such a pandemic is much higher and is not worth taking,” it said.The matter is likely to come up for hearing on August 31 before the division bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice JB Pardiwala.In its response to the PIL, the ECI had told the HC early last week that it is assessing the COVID-19 situation, and will take appropriate decisions on whether to announce elections or defer them after following due process as prescribed in law.The ECI had also said it was in the process of framing broad guidelines, for general election/by-elections during COVID-19, which were eventually issued on Friday (August 21).The PIL has sought postponement of by-elections to eight assembly seats -- Dhari, Abdasa, Limbdi, Gadhda, Dang, Karjan, Morbi and Kaprada - which fell vacant following resignation of sitting Congress MLAs.As per the ECI guidelines, voters will be provided gloves while using EVMs and those in quarantine can vote in the last hour of polling.Also, a separate set of guidelines would be issued for voters residing in areas notified as “containment zones”, with the option of postal ballot for electors who are marked as persons with disabilities and those above 80 years of age.Electors who are COVID-19 positive or are suspected of having the infection and in quarantine at home or at an institution can also exercise the postal ballot option, the ECI has said.

24-08-2020||New Delhi||India prepared to look at military options if no result from talks on border standoff with China: CDS Rawat||India’s armed forces are prepared to look at any military option if the extensive talks to restore status quo ante along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) do not yield any positive result, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat has said on the prolonged border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh.Gen Rawat, who has been part of the top military brass strategising on the Sino-India border issue, said a “whole of government” approach was being followed to peacefully resolve the row.The armed forces were always prepared for military actions if all efforts to restore status quo ante along the LAC didn’t “fructify”, the CDS said when asked about the over three-month-long border row.Gen Rawat, who was the Chief of Army Staff from December 2016 to December 2019, said the transgressions took place along the LAC because of varying perceptions about it by the two countries.India and China have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks in the last two-and-half months but no significant headway has been made for a resolution to the border standoff.On Thursday, the two sides held another round of diplomatic parleys following which the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said they had agreed to resolve outstanding issues in an “expeditious manner” and in accordance with the existing agreements and protocols.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Gen Rawat and the three service chiefs are regularly meeting to review India’s military preparedness in eastern Ladakh as well as to take measures in sync with the evolving situation in the region.At the military talks, the Indian Army has been strongly insisting that the restoration of the status quo ante of April this year by China is the only way to resolve the row, according to government sources.There is a growing view in the Army that the Chinese military is not serious about the resolution of the border conflict as it is resorting to “back and forth” negotiations while the Indian side has very clearly conveyed about its position on the matter.Sources said notwithstanding the border row, India had been carrying on with the work on laying new roads in the Ladakh region besides developing other key infrastructure.“Our road construction is not in response to PLA infrastructure development but based on our requirements and those of our people,” said a source.The formal process of disengagement of troops began on July 6, a day after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tensions in the area. However, the process has not moved forward since mid-July.The PLA had pulled back from Galwan Valley and certain other friction points but the withdrawal of troops had not moved forward in Pangong Tso, Depsang and a couple of other areas, sources said.In the five rounds of Corps commander-level talks, the Indian side has been insisting on complete disengagement of Chinese troops at the earliest, and immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to April.Even as both sides are engaged in diplomatic and military talks, the Indian army is making elaborate preparations to maintain its current strength of troops in all key areas in eastern Ladakh in the harsh winter months.Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane has already conveyed to all the senior commanders of the Army, overseeing the operation of the frontline formations along the LAC, to maintain a significantly high state of alertness to deal with any Chinese “misadventure”, the sources said.The Army is also in the process of procuring a number of weapons, ammunition and winter gears for the frontline troops, they added. The temperature in some of the high-altitude areas along the LAC drops to minus 25-degree Celsius in the winter months.The tension between the two sides escalated manifold after the violent clashes in Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.

24-08-2020||New Delhi||AICTE nod for admission to MBA, PGDM courses on basis of marks in qualifying UG exams||The All-India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) has allowed business schools and institutions offering MBA and PGDM courses to admit students based on marks obtained in qualifying undergraduate exams as several entrance tests could not be conducted due to COVID-19, officials said.The technical education regulator has also clarified that the relaxation is being made available only for the 2020-21 academic session and should not be seen as a precedent for future academic years.“All-India tests such as CAT, XAT, CMAT, ATMA, MAT, GMAT and the Common Entrance Test of respective states are the qualifying tests for admission to MBA or the Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) course. In many states, some of these entrance tests could not be conducted due to the fear of coronavirus spread, and there is no indication as to whether these tests are postponed or likely to be held or cancelled,” AICTE Member Secretary Rajive Kumar said.“AICTE, being more a facilitator than a regulator, considered alternative proposition through which selection of students could be made for admission to the PGDM course which will benefit both the institutions as well as the students. Therefore, in the current scenario, the PGDM and MBA institutions are allowed to admit students on the basis of marks obtained in qualifying examinations by preparing a merit list in a transparent manner. However, first preference will be given to candidates who have appeared in any of the entrance tests and have qualified, irrespective of their marks secured at degree level as long as minimum marks are secured,” Kumar added.The council has directed institutions to select candidates based on merit in the qualifying UG exams if there are vacant seats available.“The states may also use this relaxation while allotting seats through counselling. It may be noted that this relaxation to the PGDM and MBA institutions shall be applicable only for the academic year 2020-21, this cannot be taken as a precedent for the future academic years,” Kumar said.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain COVID.A nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25. While several restrictions have been eased, schools and colleges continue to be closed.Many MBA entrance exams, including MAT and ATMA, have moved to the Internet-Based Testing (IBT) platform. Global MBA entrance exam, GMAT, too, is being conducted in IBT mode.

24-08-2020||New Delhi||Govt mulls ‘Mission COVID Suraksha’ with Rs 3,000-cr corpus||To accelerate the process of developing and manufacturing safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in the country that can be easily accessible and affordable for the public, a ‘Mission COVID Suraksha’ has been proposed to be set up with a corpus of nearly Rs 3,000 crore, sources said.Piloted by the Department of Biotechnology, the proposed mission will focus on end-to-end vaccine development from the clinical trial stage to regulatory facilitation to manufacturing, sources added.The aim of the mission is to accelerate the development of at least six vaccine candidates and ensure that they are licensed and introduced in the market for emergency use at the earliest.While there is no official word on the proposed mission as yet, multiple officials confirmed that a proposal has been made. A senior official said this was still in “a proposal stage”.According to the draft proposal, the mission has been proposed to have a timeline of 12 to 18 months and a budget of approximately Rs 3,000 crore.The proposed mission will also look to ensure that sufficient volumes are manufactured to meet India’s COVID-19 vaccine requirement and to introduce it in public health systems of the Ministry of Health post the approval by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) to combat the further spread of the COVID-19 infection.“While several efforts already under way have helped in quickly putting together best groups, and for encouraging them to accelerate the COVID-19 vaccine development, it is now imperative that the vaccine development and manufacturing is taken up ‘in a mission mode and not in a project mode’,” the draft proposal reads.“Efforts till now for vaccine development have been fragmented,” it noted.“Therefore, to ensure a steady supply of vaccines in the next 12 to 15 months, there is a need to establish a mission with an end-to-end focus from pre-clinical development through clinical trials, manufacturing and scale-up development of the prioritised vaccine candidates that would consolidate all available and funded resources towards a warpath for accelerated product development,” it said.Accordingly, it was proposed to launch the Indian COVID-19 vaccine development programme — ‘Mission COVID Suraksha’, it said.According to the draft, the national mission will work towards bringing to the citizens of the country a safe, efficacious, affordable and accessible COVID vaccine at the earliest with a focus on ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ and also fulfil the commitment of serving not just the country but the entire globe.The proposed mission will work on an “aggressive integrated plan of action” for timely availability of resources, facilities and capabilities to avoid delays in development pathway, availability of expertise and technologies required for market entry and meeting the demand, the draft proposal said.It will also support multiple vaccine candidates in the pipeline to increase the probability of a successful vaccine entering the market, pre-planning to avoid bottlenecks and delays and ensuring safety and efficacy is not compromised during acceleration.The proposed mission also aims to make available clinical trial sites, immunoassay laboratories, ensure all vaccine candidates being introduced through this programme have preferred characteristics applicable for India.It also aims to support manufacturing capacity in the country for different vaccine platforms and ensure vaccine deployment and its uptake by the National Immunisation Programme. Besides, it aims to work with indigenous and global candidates to ensure their successful trial and manufacture in the country.The government has been ramping up efforts to manufacture a vaccine to combat the deadly infection that has so far infected over 31 lakh people and claimed the lives of over 55,000 people in the country.India has nearly 30 vaccine candidates at different stages of vaccine development for COVID-19.Currently, the two vaccine candidates, indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR and Zydus Cadila Limited had moved to the phase-2 of human clinical trials, ICMR Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava recently said at a press briefing.Pune-based Serum Institute of India, which has partnered with AstraZeneca for manufacturing a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by the Oxford University, has been permitted for conducting phase 2 and 3 human clinical trials of the candidate in India. It is likely to start the trials soon.In collaboration with HDT Biotech Corporation, USA, Gennova Biopharmaceuticals has also developed an mRNA vaccine candidate (HGCO19) and seed funding for it has been proposed by the Department of Biotechnology. The department had said last month that it is likely to enter clinical trials later this year.The national expert group on vaccine administration for COVID-19 met leading domestic vaccine manufactures, including Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila, last Monday to take inputs about the present stage of various vaccine candidates as well as their expectations from the Centre, the Health Ministry had said.

24-08-2020||New Delhi||India conducts nearly 3.6 cr COVID-19 tests so far; tests per million scale new peak of 26,016||India’s COVID-19 tests per million rose sharply to 26,016 as cumulative tests surged to 3.59 crore, the Health Ministry said on Monday underlining that a key component in India’s COVID-19 response has been early identification of cases by timely and aggressive testing.The number of people recuperating from COVID-19 has crossed 23 lakh pushing the recovery rate to over 75 per cent while the case fatality rate, maintaining a steady downward trajectory, has further dropped to 1.85 per cent, it said.Also read: COVID recoveries more than 3 times the active cases; case fatality rate drops to 1.85 pcNational coronavirus tally crosses 31-lakh mark“A key component in India’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been early identification of positive cases by timely and aggressive testing,” the Ministry said.Prompt identification and isolation synced with efficient treatment have led to the rising number of recoveries, and low and declining mortality due to COVID-19, the Ministry underlined.A cumulative 3,59,02,137 samples have been tested up to August 23 with 6,09,917 being tested on Sunday. Easy access to testing through expanded diagnostic lab network across the country has given a substantial boost to the figures.“As a result of these focussed actions, tests per million (TPM) have seen a sharp increase to 26,016. TPM continues to maintain a constant upward trend,” the Ministry said.India has also seen a rise in the tests per million per day, as advised by the WHO in its guidance note on ‘Public Health Criteria to Adjust Public Health and Social Measures in the Context of COVID-19’.“The WHO has advised that a country needs 140 tests per day per million population as a measure for comprehensive surveillance for suspected COVID19 cases,” it stated.A prominent determinant of the evolving testing strategy is the steadily widening diagnostic lab network in the country. This has significantly grown to 1520 labs, which included 984 in the government sector and 536 private labs.With a single-day spike of 61,408 infections, India’s COVID-19 tally mounted to 31,06,348 on Monday while the death toll climbed to 57,542 with 836 fatalities being reported in a span of 24 hours, the Union Ministry data updated at 8 am showed.

24-08-2020||New Delhi||COVID recoveries more than 3 times the active cases; case fatality rate drops to 1.85 pc||India’s COVID-19 recoveries have crossed 23 lakh and are more than three times the number of active cases of the infection in the country while the case fatality rate, maintaining a steady downward trajectory, has further dropped to 1.85 per cent, the Union Health Ministry has said on Monday.With 57,469 patients having recuperated in a day, the total number of recoveries have surged to 23,38,035, pushing the recovery rate to 75.27 per cent as on date. They exceeded the active cases by 16,27,264.“This has been made possible because of effective implementation of the policy of testing aggressively, tracking comprehensively through surveillance and contact-tracing and treating efficiently,” the Ministry underlined.Also read: National coronavirus tally crosses 31-lakh mark“Focus on the standard of care protocol, including use of non-invasive oxygen, better-skilled doctors in the ICUs and hospitals and improved ambulance services have led to improved recovery rate among the severe and critical COVID patients. Those under home isolation, being medically supervised and monitored, are also recovering at a fast pace,” the Ministry said.The record high recoveries have ensured that 7,10,771 active cases, which is the “actual caseload” currently, comprise only 22.88 per cent of the total cases.“Effective clinical management of the patients in the ICUs has been instrumental in keeping the case fatality rate low and on a steady downward trajectory. It has further dipped to 1.85 per cent today,” the Ministry said.A major role in India’s substantial rate of recovery and a declining case fatality rate has been played by the ‘National e-ICU on COVID-19 Management’ exercise being conducted by AIIMS, New Delhi, in active collaboration with the Ministry of Health, it mentioned.The National e-ICU is held twice a week — on Tuesdays and Fridays — and covers ICU doctors of COVID hospitals in states and answers their queries related to COVID-19 treatment. So far, 14 such National e-ICUs have been held, covering 117 hospitals from 22 states across the country.With a single-day spike of 61,408 infections, India’s COVID-19 tally mounted to 31,06,348 while the death toll climbed to 57,542 with 836 fatalities being reported in a span of 24 hours, the data updated at 8 am showed.

24-08-2020||New Delhi||HC extends stay on investigation in criminal case against journalist Vinod Dua||The Delhi High Court extended stay on the investigation in a criminal case against senior journalist Vinod Dua for allegedly making statements conducive to public mischief on Monday.Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani noted that another similar matter relating to FIR against Dua is pending before the Supreme Court and said it found it appropriate to hear the case thereafter.“It is proper that we await the decision of the Supreme Court. It can have some bearing on this case. I may get valuable guidance from the Supreme Court on the issue…. It is deemed appropriate to await the decision of the Supreme Court in that matter. Accordingly, list for consideration on September 22,” the judge said.The high court was hearing the journalist’s plea seeking quashing of an FIR lodged against him by the Delhi Police Crime Branch on a complaint by a Delhi BJP leader.The FIR was lodged on June 4 on the complaint of BJP spokesperson Naveen Kumar who claimed that “Dua, a known India media personality, committed offence of public nuisance, mischief, printing and engraving matters known to be defamatory, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace”.It said that on March 11, Dua on his YouTube show had spoken about riots that started from February 23 in northeast Delhi and the contents of the show were like other national and international news, which highlighted the mishandling of the riots by the police authorities and the central government.During the hearing in the high court, advocate Anil Soni, appearing for Kumar, submitted that a petition filed by Dua in another FIR lodged against him is pending before the apex court and will come up for hearing on September 9.He said considering that the matter before the top court may have some bearing on the case pending in the high court, the hearing be adjourned.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing Dua, opposed the plea and submitted that the present matter relates to a different FIR and webcast and need not await Supreme Court’s decision.However, the high court said it should await the decision of the apex court and listed the matter for further hearing on September 22, and extended the interim stay order till then.Dua has approached the Supreme Court against the FIR registered against him in Himachal Pradesh’s Shimla over his YouTube show on communal riots in Delhi earlier this year.In a relief to Dua, the apex court in June had restrained the Himachal Pradesh police from arresting him and had asked him to join the investigation and said there shall be no stay on the ongoing probe undertaken by the state police.Dua has already been granted interim protection in anticipatory bail proceedings by a trial court here.In the proceeding before the high court he has also sought investigation into the alleged malicious and malafide activity of the police and an order seeking payment of Rs 1 crore under public law remedy for compensation for violating his fundamental rights.The petition claimed that the FIR is a “proof of the political vendetta” and is nothing but an attempt to stifle the independence of free speech.In his complaint to the Crime Branch, Kumar accused Dua of “spreading fake news” through “The Vinod Dua Show” on YouTube.Dua was also accused by Kumar of “misreporting” on the Delhi communal violence and stating that the “central government had done nothing to stop the violence”.Kumar has alleged that Dua had called the prime minister “toothless”.Dua contended in his plea that the FIR was bogus as it was lodged after 75 days of the alleged incident and it has been maliciously filed against him on false, bogus and stale claim.“However, the offences mentioned are serious and any action taken by the respondent (Delhi Police) would be life threatening,” the plea, filed through advocate Varun Singh, said.It added that he is a senior citizen with co-morbidities like thalassemia minor with iron deficiency, anaemia, hypertension and diabetes.“Dua has blatantly lied or has misinformed his viewers about the series of events. There are also a series of old instances where bizarre and unfounded allegations have been made against the government, police and political leaders. The reporting’s full of false content misleading context...(sic)” Kumar has said in his complaint.A case has been lodged under IPC sections 290 (punishment for public nuisance in cases not otherwise provided for) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes),  police said.Police has lodged FIR for the offences in which the maximum punishment is three years imprisonment.

It will be conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA) in pen and paper-based mode.The top court also refused to relax quarantine norms for them, citing public health issues relating to COVID19 pandemic.However, it allowed the petitioners to approach state authorities to seek relaxation for candidates landing from abroad for NEET.Earlier, the NTA had told the top court that it’s not possible to hold NEET overseas as it's conducted in "paper book format".In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, NTA had pointed out that “…NEET (UG) has to be conducted in single shift at the same time, on the same day to maintain uniformity and, further, the questions papers and other exam materials are to be transported from NTA headquarters to a large number of examination centres in various cities, which would require meticulous planning for safe and secured delivery of the same at the examination centres on time."The affidavit was filed in response to a petition filed by parents of applicants for NEET (UG) 2020 working in Qatar.The Supreme Court had last month issued notice to the Centre, MCI and NTA on their petition challenging a Kerala High Court order dismissing their demand for allotment of NEET centres in Gulf region.The NTA asserted that the manner in which examinations had to be conducted was a policy decision purely within the domain of the examining body viz., Medical Council of India (MCI) and if examination centres should be provided in foreign countries was for the MCI to decide.There was nothing on record to show that the MCI’s decision was “arbitrary or illegal", it said.Last month, the top court had asked the Centre, MCI and NTA to respond to the petition which demanded that if it was not possible to have NEET examination centres abroad the test should be postponed until the COVID19 crisis was over.Filed by Abdul Azeez, general secretary, Kerala Muslim Culture Centre, Qatar, the PIL submitted that there were 4,000 such students registered with NEET-UG from Qatar who faced problems in getting their documents attested from Indian Embassy in Qatar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-rejects-plea-to-hold-neet-overseas-130704

In any event no sentence be imposed,” Dhavan’ written submission read.Dhavan said Bhushan’s comments were opinion made in good faith founded on true facts, adding similar opinions were made before as was demonstrated by Attorney General KK Venugopal.The AG too had urged the court not to punish Bhushan for contempt of court.Dhavan sought to highlight the fact that in the present controversy similar comments were made by Justices Lokur, Kurian Joseph and AP Shah, besides veteran journalist Arun Shourie and others in the public and reported by the medui. “It would follow that they were all in contempt,” Dhavan submitted.Following intervention of the Attorney General, the top court had on August 20 granted time till August 24 to Bhushan to reconsider his “defiant statement” refusing to apologise. A Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra had rejected his request that quantum of punishment be decided by another Bench and posted the matter to August 25 for considering the “unconditional apology”, if any filed by Bhushan. Bhushan said as an officer of court, it was his duty to speak up when he believed there was a deviation from its sterling record.“Therefore, I expressed myself in good faith, not to malign the Supreme Court or any particular Chief Justice, but to offer constructive criticism so that the court can arrest any drift away from its long-standing role as a guardian of the Constitution and custodian of peoples’ rights,” he said.  He said, “My tweets represented this bona fide belief that I continue to hold. Public expression of these beliefs was I believe, in line with my higher obligations as a citizen and a loyal officer of this court. Therefore, an apology for expression of these beliefs, conditional or unconditional, would be insincere.” Bhushan said an apology cannot be a mere incantation and any apology has to, as the court has itself put it, be sincerely made.“This is especially so when I have made the statements bona fide and pleaded truths with full details, which have not been dealt with by the court. If I retract a statement before this court that I otherwise believe to be true or offer an insincere apology that in my eyes would amount to the contempt of my conscience and of an institution that I hold in highest esteem,” he said.Bhushan said he believes the Supreme Court is the last bastion of hope for the protection of fundamental rights, the watchdog institutions and indeed for constitutional democracy itself.   “It has rightly been called the most powerful court in the democratic world, and often an exemplar for courts across the globe. Today in these troubling times, the hopes of the people of India vest in this Court to ensure the rule of law and the Constitution and not an untrammelled rule of the executive,” he said. The activist-lawyer said that he has never stood on ceremony when it comes to offering an apology for any mistake or wrongdoing on his part and it has been a privilege for him to have served this institution and bring several important public interest causes before it.  “I live with the realisation that I have received from this institution much more than I have had the opportunity to give it. I cannot but have the highest regard for the institution of the Supreme Court,” he said. The court had on August 14 held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for his two derogatory tweets against the judiciary, saying they can’t be said to be a fair criticism of the functioning of the judiciary made in the public interest.He faces simple imprisonment of up to six months or with a fine of up to Rs 2,000 or with both as punishment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prashant-bhushan-refuses-to-apologise-to-sc-issues-fresh-statement-130686

One-third of the cadets would be girls.More than 1,000 schools and colleges have been identified in the border and coastal districts where the NCC will be introduced.As part of the expansion, 83 NCC units will be upgraded to impart training to the cadets in these areas. These include 53 Army units, 20 Naval units and 10 Air units.The NCC, the largest youth volunteer organisation in the world, imparts training to school and college students in basic military skills, leadership qualities and adventure activities.It conducts about 1,500 camps annually, each with a strength of 400-600 cadets along with 4-5 officers and about 20 instructional staff.Earlier, camps used to be conducted in open areas with the staff and cadets living in tents, but now camps are held where permanent built-up accommodation like barracks or hostels are available.Many of the CAPF establishments have requisite facilities like permanent accommodation, classrooms, obstacle courses, firing ranges, auditorium, recreational and sports facilities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-expansion-mode-ncc-looks-at-paramilitary-for-training-facilities-130679

24-08-2020||New Delhi||No judicial directions for compensating kin of those who died of Covid: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to direct the Centre and states to formulate guidelines for providing adequate ex-gratia monetary compensation to the next of kin of those who died due to COVID-19.Each state may have a different system depending upon its policy and financial condition and there can't be judicial directions for it, said the top court.Advocate Deepak Prakash, appearing for petitioner Hashik Thayikandy, said that all he is asking for is a national policy to be formulated that would provide for uniform compensation throughout the country.So many people have died in India due to COVID-19 and the victims are not getting equal compensation, he said.Prakash said that in some cases, the Delhi government has given Rs 1 crore as compensation, while some states are giving Rs 1 lakh. There is no uniform policy on compensation, he said.The bench said it is dismissing the plea, after which the counsel sought to withdraw it.The petitioner, has also sought a direction to the Centre as well as state governments to formulate an appropriate "compensation plan" to provide ex-gratia monetary compensation to the kin of essential workers and healthcare workers who have succumbed to COVID-19.It has urged the court to seek a status report from state governments on the total number of COVID-19-related causalities and measures taken by authorities for compensating for loss of life due to the coronavirus pandemic.The petition claimed that a majority of the country's population belong to financially weaker sections, wherein only one person is an earning member and others in the family are solely depend on that income for their sustenance."The said citizens are also the tax payers of our country. In such a structure, whereby the death rate is only increasing at an alarming rate per day, it is imperative for the state to formulate appropriate guidelines, on compassionate grounds, for ex-gratia compensation to families of the COVID-19 casualties, especially for frontline workers such as doctors, nurses, paramedical staff etc., solely with the purpose of aiding the families for their basic survival and sustenance during this pandemic," the plea said.Pertinently, "the death of an Indian citizen not only impacts his/her own personal life", but it affects the lives of all the members of the family who were dependent "on the sole source of income", it said."In the event of a death of such a family member and while regarding the huge unemployment which COVID-19 has encompassed globally, the dependents are with no finances for survival, the plea," filed by Prakash said.It claimed that the death rate due to COVID-19 is exponentially increasing with each passing hour, especially in cases of frontline workers such as police officials, doctors, paramedical staff, government employees, journalists, thereby rendering the family of the deceased in an extremely vulnerable position."Till date, COVID-19 has no cure/vaccine and has been declared as a notified 'disaster', thus, it is the duty of the State, on compassionate grounds, to provide relief to its citizens by adequately compensating the kin of the deceased in order to financially assist the families thereof, who are in an extremely vulnerable and helpless position, having suffered due to the outbreak of this deadly virus," it said. --with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-judicial-directions-for-compensating-kin-of-those-who-died-of-covid-sc-130674
24-08-2020||New Delhi||Group of ex-civil servants ask Zuckerberg to audit Facebook’s hate speech policy||A Constitutional Conduct Group of former civil servants on Monday wrote an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking him to make serious efforts to audit the implementation of the social media platform’s hate speech policy in India and not undermine the secular and democratic basis of the Indian Constitution by demonising minorities.In an official release, the group, having 54 members including IAS (Retired) Salahuddin Ahmad, IPS (Retired) Shafi Alam and IPS (Retired) K Saleem Ali, said, “We have written to him in the expectation that he will make serious efforts to audit the implementation of Facebook’s hate speech policy in India and not permit business considerations to demonise minorities and undermine the secular and democratic basis of the Indian Constitution.”Noting that as a group the members have no political affiliation and believe in being committed to the Indian Constitution, in the letter they said, “We are writing to you now…, because certain actions (or the absence of certain actions) by Facebook in their operations in India have thrown into danger some of the fundamental rights of the people of India.”In the letter, the group said that Zuckerberg, being a US citizen, would understand and appreciate the adverse impact of hate speech on democratic and fundamental rights of people and that is why Facebook has made it part of its policy not to allow content, which attacks people on the basis of “race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity and serious disabilities or diseases.”.“Given this clear definition in your own policy, we are surprised that Facebook did not take action against some clear and serial offenders in India - persons like T Raja Singh and a few others – for their derogatory comments against people belonging to a different religion, accusing Muslims of spreading COVID 19, indulging in ‘love jihad’ and various other misdemeanours. What is striking about Facebook’s leniency towards these persons is that all of them happen to be members of the political party in power,” the letter read.The group said, their attention was drawn to this by an article in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dated August 14, 2020, and most democratic countries assure their citizens of several basic rights and freedoms.“We are dismayed to learn, again from the WSJ article, that the Public Policy Head of Facebook India consciously opposed applying Facebook’s hate speech rules to members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) because doing so would adversely affect the company’s business prospects in India,” the letter read.Further reminding the Facebook CEO that he could not be unaware that religious unrest has become a serious problem in India, the group highlighted saying: “The recently passed Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), coupled with the proposed National Registry of Citizens (NRC), threatens to take away the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Muslims and other minorities in India and put them in detention centres”.The group said, “You cannot also be ignorant of the communal riots that took place in Delhi in February 2020, in which 53 persons were killed, two-thirds of them Muslims. Several cases of lynching and torture, primarily of Muslims and Dalits (oppressed castes and groups), have also occurred in India in recent years. The majority of these are related to ‘cow vigilantism’, i.e. religious extremists resorting to violence in apparent efforts to protect cows from being illegally slaughtered.” Many of these crimes have been instigated through hate speech spread through various communication channels, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter, they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/group-of-ex-civil-servants-ask-zuckerberg-to-audit-facebooks-hate-speech-policy-130671

We knew Rahul Gandhi didn’t want to be president and Sonia Gandhi’s term as interim chief was getting over and she also didn’t want to continue so we wrote the letter asking to be consulted for the appointment of full-time president. Our letter was written in the interest of the party and we never questioned Sonia ji’s leadership,” said Azad after Antony called his letter “cruel” and Soni questioned the letter saying the party had given Azad so many positions.Soni also demanded disciplinary action against the signatories.The CWC while rejecting Sonia’s offer to be relieved and her suggestion to start the process to find a new chief attacked Azad and other signatories to the letter with Azad offering to resign against some party leaders alluding that signatories were influenced by the BJP.The committee with majority lauded the leadership of Sonia Gandhi asking her to continue and decide the future course of action.The meeting also saw Rahul Gandhi attacking the signatories over the letter’s timing as it was sent when Sonia was hospitalised, and when the party was troubleshooting in Rajasthan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cwc-backs-sonia-gandhis-continuation-as-party-chief-azad-says-happy-130664

It had issued similar orders earlier “as per statutory requirements to meet our international obligations’’. It denied that the naming of certain people (such as Dawood Ibrahim) in the SROs amounted to admitting their presence in Pakistan.“The SROs reflect information contained on the list of UN-designated individuals and entities. These lists contain names of those designated under the two-sanction regime established pursuant to the UNSC resolutions,” said Pakistan Foreign Ministry in a statement.The statement did not mention whether it intended imposing sanctions against the 88 terrorist organisations and their leaders if they, as it admits, have been named by the two-sanction regime set up by the UNSC. The Pakistan Foreign Office said reports about Pakistan imposing new sanctions were not factual.Later, Pakistan underlined that the information in the two orders had been “reproduced as per the details on the list under the two-sanction regime, and contains names of individuals who despite their confirmed deceased status still continue to be on the sanction list.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/day-later-pak-says-terror-list-routine-130552

24-08-2020||---||Dissenters seek collective decision-making||New Delhi, August 23The Congress Working Committee tomorrow is set to be a stormy one with party chief Sonia Gandhi likely to offer her resignation amid calls for a full-time president and collective decision-making.It could well be a replay of the 1999 events when Sonia, questioned by a Sharad Pawar-led camp on her foreign origins, quit but the resignation was rejected by the CWC, leading to Pawar’s exit from the party. What dissidents say “Sonia Gandhi may well offer to resign tomorrow and ask the CWC to find a full-term president. Even last year, she had accepted the Congress leadership after the CWC urged her to do so,” sources said though officially AICC media chief Randeep Surjewala denied reports she was mulling to quit.Surjewala also denied knowledge of the letter to Sonia by some leaders seeking collective leadership, effectively calling for a non-Gandhi chief. Among the signatories to the letter are Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Kapil Sibal, Mukul Wasnik, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Punjab CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal and former Himachal Congress chief Kaul Singh Thakur.Parallel to the calls for an organisational overhaul, the challenge to the Gandhis was firmly rebutted by CMs Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan), Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh) and V Narayanasamy (Puducherry) with Amarinder and Gehlot slamming attempts to “divide the party”. WILL IT BE 1999 REPEAT?Baghel wrote directly to Rahul, seeking his return. Narayanasamy said leaders seeking changes was a “BJP ploy to divert attention from the Facebook controversy.” All Congress Chief Ministers will attend the Congress Working Committee meeting tomorrow and vociferously back the Gandhis for the top post.Former ministers Ashwani Kumar and Salman Khurshid, former Chief Minister of Karnataka Siddharamaiah, leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja and MP Manicka Tagore today openly favoured the Gandhis with Kumar and Khurshid rubbishing calls for organisational elections, calling these “divisive.” This public support for the Gandhis is seen as CWC’s preparation to ensure they stayed at the helm, unless Sonia wills it otherwise.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dissenters-seek-collective-decision-making-130548
