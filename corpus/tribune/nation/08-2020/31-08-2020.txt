31-08-2020||New Delhi||SC to pronounce verdict on Tuesday on telecom companies’ AGR-related issue||The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce its verdict on Tuesday on issues, including the timeline for staggered payment of Adjusted Gross Revenue-related dues which run into about Rs 1.6 lakh crore by telecom companies.A bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra is also all set to deliver the verdict on the point as to whether spectrum can be sold by the telecom companies facing proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and how the AGR-related dues can be recovered from them.The top court had in October 2019 delivered the verdict on the AGR issue for calculating government dues of telecom companies, such as Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices, as licence fee and spectrum usage charges.Later, the Department of Telecom had in March this year moved a plea seeking permission for staggered payment in a time period of nearly 20 years for the telecom companies.The bench, which also comprised justices B R Gavai and Krishna Murari, had reserved the verdict on July 20 on the aspect of granting timeline to telcos for staggered payment of AGR- related dues by saying that it will not hear “even for a second” the  arguments on reassessment or re-calculation of the AGR.Prior to this, it had asked the telecom companies to file their books of accounts for last 10 years and give a reasonable time frame for paying the AGR dues and later got miffed when some senior lawyers started disputing the dues being calculated by the DoT.It had said the period of 15-20 years sought by some of the telecom companies was not reasonable and had asked the Centre as to how it would secure the payment of dues by them.Later, the top court on August 24 was informed by the DoT that all liabilities, including AGR-related dues, should be cleared by telecom firms prior to spectrum trading as per the guidelines.After hearing arguments, it had then reserved the verdict on the point as to whether spectrum can be sold by the telecom companies facing proceedings under the IBC and other related issues.The DoT had further told the top court that it can seek to recover dues from sellers and buyers of spectrum, jointly or individually.The DoT had said assessment of dues is under process and once the Supreme Court clarifies the legal position on spectrum sharing, it will move to recover the outstanding amounts from the telecom firms.The DoT had said no demand has been raised against Reliance Jio and Airtel for part dues of Reliance Communications (RCom) and Videocon respectively.The top court will also give its finding on payment of dues, if any, on Jio and Airtel which have spectrum sharing pacts with RCom, Aircel and Videocon respectively.On August 21, the top court had directed the DoT to apprise it the basis of spectrum sharing done by telecom companies and how much is the liability of the sharers.The top court asked the DoT secretary to file a specific affidavit apprising it about who was using the spectrum from the date of grant of license and from which date the respective sharing of spectrum has taken place.It had asked the DoT what was the amount paid by Reliance Jio for using 23 per cent of Reliance Communication (RCom’s) spectrum.On August 20, the top court had expressed concern over non-payment of the AGR related dues by the telecom companies which are under insolvency saying “without paying for the horse, telcos are taking a ride”.On August 14, the top court had sought the details of spectrum sharing pact between RComm and Reliance Jio and said as to why the company using the spectrum of the other firm cannot be asked to pay the AGR related dues to the government.The Centre had earlier told the top court there was a difference of opinion between two of its ministers (DOT and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs) on the issue of sale of spectrum during insolvency proceedings. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-pronounce-verdict-on-tuesday-on-telecom-companies-agr-related-issue-134275
31-08-2020||New Delhi||FB removed accounts of supporters in run up to foundation day event, alleges TMC||The Trinamool Congress on Monday claimed that Facebook removed the online accounts of the party’s supporters in the run up to its Foundation Day on August 28 and that it has raised the issue in a letter to the social media company.TMC leader of Rajya Sabha and national spokesperson Derek O’ Brien, in the letter, said the party had last year raised the issue of “collusion” between Facebook India and the BJP and that recent reports in the international media about the same have vindicated its stand on the matter.“The NDA also had a hidden partner, non-disclosed allies. Facebook’s senior management in India are de facto campaign managers for the BJP, Facebook’s Delhi office is virtually extended IT cell. Facebook censored anti-BJP content,” Brien had said in his speech during the motion of thanks to the President’s address in July last year. In his letter to Facebook, Brien said after his speech he had hoped that Facebook would take some remedial action.He said the recent articles in The Wall Street Journal and Time magazine highlighting the link between BJP and Facebook has vindicated the TMC’s stand on the matter.“We want to bring to your attention the removal of hundreds of TMC supporters’ pages and accounts on both WhatsApp and Facebook for ‘community standard violation’ in the run up to the preannounced Foundation Day event,” he wrote in the letter.Brien said with the revelations now about the link between the BJP and Facebook, his “worst fears” have come true with the Bengal elections just six months away.

31-08-2020||Mirati (WB)||Pranab Mukherjee: Mirati man who craved slice of village||He strode the corridors of power in New Delhi like a colossus, but always craved a slice of his village.Mirati, the sunswept village in West Bengal’s Birbhum district, some 200 km from state capital Kolkata, was in mourning on Monday following the death of its most famous son—Pranab Mukharjee—the 13th President of India.From the dusty lanes of Mirati, life took the scholar politician to the imposing Rashtrapati Bhavan through a warren of powerful offices he held, but the village stuck, the bond only grew stronger.It will be for the first time in many years that his absence will be sorely felt at his ancestral village during Durga Puja festivities. Clad in dhoti with a stole thrown around his shoulders, Mukherjee would perform ‘aarti’ of the most revered deity in West Bengal.He was there even last year, months before the deadly coronavirus spread its tentacles across West Bengal and the rest of India. Mukherjee, too, contracted the disease before undergoing a surgical procedure after which he slipped into a coma never to wake up again.“For the people of this village, he was Pranab da, Pranab Kaku or jethu (uncle). A down to earth man, he never made us feel that he was a senior minister or the president.He loved children,” said Susmita, a resident who made a dash for Mukherjee’s ancestral home on hearing the news of his death.Susmita, like almost every villager, was a regular at Mukherjee’s Durga Puja.“Durga Puja at his residence was the biggest annual event of our village. All of us would have lunch or dinner at his house during the five days of the festival. He was our own. Durga Puja in Mirati will never be the same again,” Rabi Chattoraj, a close associate of the Mukherjee family told PTI.He said Mukherjee would personally call from New Delhi to ask if everything was in place.“Every year, two months before the puja, he used to call us and sought to know about every detail. During the five days of puja, he himself used to recite Chandi Path (hymns to Goddess Chandi), he said.Eyes closed and prayers on their lips, the villagers of Mirati collected every single day over the the last fortnight so he could be in their midst once again this Durga Puja. But that was not to be.Mukherjee died while in coma at the Army’s Research and Referral Hospital in the national capital on Monday.“He was seriously ill but we thought with his indomitable spirit and by the grace of Ma Durga he will survive. We have been praying for his recovery but finally, he left us forever,” Chattoraj said.Mukherjee, who did his schooling at Shibchandra High School in nearby Kirnahar, visited his alma mater thrice after becoming the president.“In 2012 (the year he became the president), we had felicitated him. He again came in 2013 and 2014. Whenever he visited the school, he would come and talk with teachers and students. He was always affectionate,” Nilkamal Banerjee, the headmaster of the school said.Mukherjee’s son Abhijit, a former Congress MP, recently told a national newspaper that his father, before he was put on ventilator support, had asked him to bring some ‘kathaal’ (jackfruit) from Mirati.Abhijit Mukhherjee went to Mirati from Kolkata, bought a 25 kg ripe jackfruit and boarded a train to New Delhi on August 3.Pranab Mukherjee savoured the pulpy, juicy treat from Mirati and was very happy, Abhijit Mukherjee had told The Times of India.Life’s journey took him out of home but could not take home out of him. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pranab-mukherjee-mirati-man-who-craved-slice-of-village-134266
31-08-2020||New Delhi||SC directs Centre to convene meeting to devise a master plan for poor||The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Centre to convene a meeting of Health Ministers or secretaries within a week to devise a master plan that focuses on the marginalised sections of society.A Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde said that in the first meeting all the States and Union Territories may be advised to come up with a master plan by taking a cue from the already existing Public Health Acts of various States and the National Health Bill, 2009, which focuses on the marginalized sections of society.“Thereafter, a second meeting of the Health Ministers/Secretaries of all States and Union Territories may be convened for the purpose of collating the information received from the States and Union Territories regarding the steps taken by the states. “After receipt of the information from all the states and Union Territories, the Government of India may file a comprehensive report with a compilation of the information received from the States and Union Territories,” the Bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said.The top court said the states already having Public Health Acts could fine­-tune their existing enactments along the lines of the National Health Bill, 2009.“In the meantime, all the State governments and UTs are suo moto impleaded as parties to this writ petition. Issue notice to the State Governments and UTs,” the bench said while posting the matter for hearing after four weeks.The apex court was hearing a plea filed by advocate Sachin Jain who has sought direction for regulating the cost of treatment of COVID-19 at private hospitals across the country and suggested that there should be a cheaper treatment for coronavirus infected patients in smaller towns.The top court had earlier said that no one should be turned away from hospital due to higher cost of treatment.It had asked the government to consider framing guideline on the issue of cost of treatment for COVID-19 infection.In June, the apex court had asked private hospitals whether they were ready to provide treatment to COVID-19 infected patients at the charges prescribed under the government’s Ayushman Bharat Scheme.The ‘Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana’ is aimed at providing health cover to poor and vulnerable persons in the country.

31-08-2020||New Delhi||Choksi appeals against dismissal of plea for pre-screening of Netflix’s ‘Bad Boy Billionaires’||Mehul Choksi, an accused in the nearly USD two billion PNB scam, has filed an appeal in the Delhi High Court against the dismissal of his plea to conduct pre-screening of Netflix documentary, ‘Bad Boy Billionaires’.Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, representing Choksi, confirmed that an appeal has been filed against a single judge’s August 28 decision dismissing the plea.The appeal is listed for hearing on Tuesday before a Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan.The single judge Bench on August 28 had denied any relief to Choksi saying a writ petition for enforcement of a private right was not maintainable.The high court had said his remedy lies in a civil suit and granted him the liberty to raise the issue in a civil suit.Choksi, the promoter of Gitanjali Gems, and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.Choksi left the country last year and was granted citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda.The documentary, scheduled for release in India on September 2, is promoted by Netflix as: “This investigative docuseries explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built up - and ultimately brought down - India’s most infamous tycoons”.The plea for pre-screening of the documentary was vehemently opposed before the single judge by Netflix which said the petition was wholly misconceived and mischievous.In the proceedings before the single judge, Aggarwal had contended that Choksi has a right to fair trial which should not be prejudiced with the release of the documentary and had vehemently objected to the submission of Netflix lawyer that Choksi was a fugitive.Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma and Central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul, representing the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, had told the court that there is no statutory mandate to regulate or review Over The Top (OTT) content.Opposing Choksi’s claims, Netflix had told the court that there was no reference of any trial going on against him or he being related to any case allegedly involving Nirav Modi.The plea before the single judge had also sought postponement of the documentary’s release.In the petition before the single judge, Choksi claimed he has been falsely accused of various crimes in India and is presently under investigation or standing trial by and before various authorities and/or courts.“The petitioner is entitled in terms of Indian law, that is, Article 21 of the Constitution of India to a presumption of innocence and a free and fair trial. Reputation being a facet of a person’s life, the petitioner is also entitled to a right to a reputation,” it had said.

It is our neighbour so we are very directly impacted by the rise of a potential global power. India is also one of major global growth stories. It is very important that they reach some sort of understanding or equilibrium between them. This is extremely consequential for both countries.On immigrationWe are talking of a more digital world that puts a premium on talent. One thing India can offer is trusted talent. They have always done well and there is a great deal of regard and trust for them. A more knowledge-driven global economy will require more trusted talent. This should be reflected in some degree in American immigration policies.“This is an area [skilled immigration] where the US should recognise what is in American interest. And that is in Indian interest,” the Minister said at a webinar organised by US-India Strategic Partnership Forum. Jaishankar twice mentioned “trust” with Indian talent as if to draw a line with immigrants to the US from some other countries who have been indicted for espionage and data theft.The Minister was seeking freer immigration policies for “trusted” talent from his country against the backdrop of a severe squeeze on visa categories such as H-1B availed by tens of thousands of Indian every year.On observations from the US side that the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” policy had led to confusion among defence suppliers, the Minister said, “Products should be made in India which is among the world’s top economies. Why should they be bought from abroad? This is a great opportunity for countries to invest in defence manufacturing. Terms have become more liberal. It is good for your business.”He also sought to dispel the impression that India was seeking a closer security relationship as a hedge to China. “The partnership is not tailored to a particular situation or focused on a country. It is about the larger ability of India and US to think alike in so many ways…to secure the world and make it a better place.”The US-India partnership, he said, was an important and integral part of the larger world situation. “The US is looking at a country like India, which has never been in any alliance situation, with a more open mind than in the past. India is looking at countries with a strong identity of interests. We have become more pragmatic than in the past,” he said, while quoting from his forthcoming book.To the curious American business, he described Atmanirbhar Bharat as a programme to increase national capacities, with manufacturing at its heart. This will open up new business opportunities along with more liberal ownership norms for foreign investors. “We are much more interested in global value chains passing through India and using Indian manufacturing capacity.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-bats-for-more-us-visas-for-trusted-indians-134257

Mohan Reddy for taking out his licenced revolver to threatening construction workers, who were digging a canal near his fields. According to the complaint lodged by the site engineer and other workers with the police, the incident took place on Sunday evening in Urumadla village of Chityala Mandal in Nalgonda district. “The workers were digging an irrigation canal when Gutta Mohan Reddy, a former minister, came and threatened the workers to stop the work. He had an argument with the site engineer and JCB operator and soon afterwards he pulled out his weapon, asking the workers to leave.”The video of the former minister threatening the workers went viral on social media. Initially hesitant to take on a politician, but the site engineer Narender decided to lodge a complaint. The former minister has been booked under the Arms Act and arrested the former minister, who was later released after furnishing a personal bond. Reddy had won the 1978 and 1983 legislative council elections in undivided Andhra Pradesh and had also served as agriculture minister in Nadendla Bhaskar Rao’s cabinet. “Mohan Reddy obstructed the canal digging work and wanted the site engineer to change the alignment of the canal so that it does not cut across his field,” said Chityala Circle Inspector of Police Shankar Reddy. He said the police had seized his weapon along with 25 bullets that he is permitted to keep as per his licence. Officials said the land belonging to the politician had been acquired by the government for the purpose of digging an irrigation canal and the compensation had already been paid. But despite taking the compensation, the minister did not want to hand over possession of the land. The Chityala police have booked him under Section 30 of the Arms Act (Punishment for contravention of the license or rule) and Sections 503 (criminal intimidation), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 341(punishment for wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code.  Police said they have also imposed Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code, which is cognizable and non-bailable. The said section says whoever commits the offence of criminal intimidation shall be punished with simple or rigorous imprisonment for a term extending up to 2 years, or with fine, or with both; if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-andhra-minister-arrested-for-brandishing-gun-134247
31-08-2020||New Delhi||NTA set to conduct JEE-Mains from Tuesday||The National Testing Agency (NTA) is all set to conduct the engineering entrance exam JEE-Mains from Tuesday amid elaborate arrangements to maintain social distancing at centres in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.While the governments of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have assured students that they will provide transportation to candidates, a group of IIT alumni and students have also launched a portal to provide transport facilities to exam centres for the candidates in need.Union Minister of Education Ramesh Pokhiyal ‘Nishank’ has appealed to the chief ministers of various states to support the students appearing for the exam.There has been a growing chorus for postponing JEE-Mains and medical entrance exam NEET amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases.The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Mains for admission to engineering courses in IITs, NITs and Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs) is scheduled to be held from September 1 to 6. The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) is scheduled on September 13.As many as 8.58 lakh candidates have registered for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Main and 15.97 lakh have registered for NEET.“I appeal to chief ministers of all states that support our students in such unprecedented circumstances and make appropriate arrangements so the aspirants do not have to face any inconvenience. I also appeal to students to have faith in agencies behind conduct of the examination,” the Education Minister said.Increasing the number of examination centres, alternate seating plans, fewer candidates per room and staggered entry and exit are among the steps the National Testing Agency has taken for safely conducting NEET and JEE.According to NTA officials, before the start of each exam shift and after the last shift ends, all seats will be thoroughly sanitised and the work stations and keyboards will be disinfected.“Hand sanitisers will be available at the entrance of the examination centre and inside the exam hall at all times. The usual process of checking the admit cards of candidates will be replaced with barcode readers, which have been made available to the examination centre authorities,” an official said.“While all the candidates will be asked to go to the exam centres with masks and sanitisers, once they enter the centre, they will have to use the masks provided by the examination authority. Each candidate will be offered a 3-ply mask at the time of entry and expected to wear the same during the examination in order to avoid any form of unfair means at the time of examination,” the official said.There have been demands from several students and parents to further postpone the entrance exams in view of the increasing number of coronavirus cases.Several opposition leaders including Congress’ Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, her Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik, DMK President MK Stalin and Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia have also demanded that the exams be postponed.The Supreme Court had earlier dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the two exams amid a spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases, saying a “precious year” of students cannot be wasted and life has to go on.With barely days left for the JEE exams to start, the issue had escalated into a full blown political battle last week with ministers from six states—Rajasthan and Punjab (Congress), West Bengal (Trinamool Congress), Jharkhand (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), Maharashtra (Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena) -- seeking postponement of the exams “in a manner that achieved the twin objectives of ensuring that the academic year of the students is not wasted and their health and safety is not compromised”.They filed a petition in the SC to review its order of conducting JEE and NEET UG 2020 entrance tests during the novel coronavirus crises.The crucial exams have already been deferred twice in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.The JEE-Main was originally scheduled to be held from April 7-11, but was postponed to July 18-23, the NEET-UG was originally scheduled for May 3, but was pushed to July 26. They were postponed again and are now scheduled in September.Based on the results of the JEE-Mains Paper 1 and Paper 2, the top 2.45 lakh candidates will be eligible to appear for the JEE-Advanced exam, which is a one-stop exam to get admission into the 23 premier Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). JEE-Advanced is scheduled to take place on September 27. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nta-set-to-conduct-jee-mains-from-tuesday-134245

31-08-2020||KV Prasad ||Pranab Mukherjee: Quintessential politician who made invaluable contribution to party, govt||Tribune News Service New Delhi, August 31Pranabda or Pranababu, as Pranab Mukherjee was addressed by those who knew him, remained a quintessential politician whose enormous contribution both in the Congress party and the government remains invaluable.For nearly 50 years, Mukherjee remained integral to politics, policy and processes that shaped the country from the time he became member of the Indira Gandhi Cabinet in 1969 till 2012 when he consciously moved away following his election as the President of India.Mukherjee holds the unique distinction of having worked in three of the four important Ministries on the Raisina Hill – Defence, Finance and External Affairs – and one who entered Rashtrapati Bhawan with decades of administrative experience. Former PM Indira Gandhi relied on Mukherjee’s acumen and trusted him to preside over Cabinet meetings in her absence. Yet, this proved politically expensive after her assassination. For when talks about successor began, a theory of Mukherjee pushing the envelope swirled and the fallout was swift. He was out of the Congress during Rajv Gandhi’s time spending in political wilderness floating Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress which he eventually merged with the parent party.Mukherjee’s career took off again in 1991 with P V Narasimha Rao rehabilitating him in Planning Commission. Having spent decades in Parliament and a Leader of both the Houses, Mukherjee had absolute understanding of the processes and was relied upon even during his stint in the Opposition. Mukherjee’s expertise to draft papers both for the party and government was phenomenal as was his memory. On any occasion, Pranabda could string events together dipping into pages of history with reference year from memory. While Mukherjee wrote books of his years in public life, his diligently maintained diary with inner thoughts remain bequeathed with his daughter Sharmishta who may choose to make it public.One could knock and walk into his room. The knack of starting a conversation was to approach him with the sincerity of a student eager to learn and Pranabda would make everyone comfortable but a silly question would invite an immediate scold. His temper and outbursts mellowed after a serious road accident in 2007 but as Congress president Sonia Gandhi remarked when he was declared the presidential candidate “I will miss his tantrums”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pranab-mukherjee-quintessential-politician-who-made-invaluable-contribution-to-party-govt-134239
31-08-2020||New Delhi||SC to commence physical hearing of cases in limited manner, issues SOP||The Supreme Court has issued standard operating procedure (SOP) for proposed physical hearing of the cases which will commence on an experimental basis on the request of various lawyers’ bodies.The apex court has been holding hearings through video conferencing since March 25 due to the COVID-19-induced nationwide lockdown and even after the restrictions were relaxed; it has decided to continue with the practice. A seven-judge committee headed by Justice N V Ramana has earlier this month after consideration of requests made by various Bar Associations has recommended to the Chief Justice of India S A Bobde, to resume physical hearing of the cases on an experimental basis while adhering to additional safety norms.However, no date has been mentioned in the SOPs, as from when the physical hearing of cases in limited manner will commence.The SOP issued by secretary general Sanjeev S. Kalgaonkar of the top court said, “On an experimental basis, and as a pilot scheme, physical hearing of matters may initially commence in three Court-rooms; eventually, number of matters or the number of Court-rooms may be increased or reduced, as the situation may warrant or permit.”It said only such number of lawyers or parties may be permitted to appear during physical hearing inside Courtrooms, so that the total number does not exceed the working capacity of the Court(s) as determined considering the physical distancing norms.“If in a matter the number of parties is more, then one Advocate on Record (AOR) and one arguing counsel per party will be allowed entry; one registered Clerk per party, as may be chosen by the AOR, shall be allowed entry to carry paper-books/journals etc. of the Counsels upto the Court-rooms,” it said.The top court administration has said that entry into the High Security Zone through proximity cards/long term passes shall be kept suspended, till further orders.It said the entry of counsels/parties or such other stakeholders to appear for such limited physical hearing will be through daily “Special hearing passes” which will be issued by the Registry, on the basis of authorization by the concerned Advocate on Record.The two-page SOPs said multiple sets of one chair and table are being placed inside the Court Rooms, in the areas demarcated for Advocates/Parties-in-Person, and it shall be incumbent upon the users to maintain minimum prescribed physical distancing norms between each set, which should not be removed from their positions.“Advocates/Parties-in-Person/Clerks or other stakeholders, who have been issued Special Hearing Passes, upon completion of necessary formalities, online or otherwise as may be notified in due time, shall enter the High Security Zone through the designated Gate, after subjecting themselves to the thermal and such other scanning devices as may be installed for detecting body temperature, infection status,” it said.The administration said on entering the High Security Zone, Advocates/ Parties-in-Person would proceed to the staging areas/vacant Court-rooms as may be designated, and wait for their turn to enter respective Court Rooms where physical hearing of their respective case(s) may be scheduled, and they would proceed only through the movement corridors created and demarcated for the purpose.“The entry into and exit from each Court Room shall be by separate doors; entrants into the Court Rooms are advised to use the sanitisation devices for sanitising their hands and also the papers and other items/articles that they may seek to carry into the Court Rooms, with them”, it said.Earlier, the top court administration had informed bar bodies that three among the bigger courtrooms will be readied within that time for physical hearing of the final hearing cases, while adhering to the prescribed distancing and other norms and as per medical advice.It had clarified that all other matters, including miscellaneous ones which are listed on Mondays and Fridays, shall continue to be heard through video/teleconferencing mode, as per existing Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) till further orders.On August 11, a committee of seven Supreme Court judges, which is looking into the suggestions and requests for resumption of physical hearing, recommended sitting of three out of the 15 benches in the apex court with some additional safety measures.The judges’ panel has met leaders such as Bar Council Chairperson Manan Kumar Mishra, Supreme Court Bar Association President Dushyant Dave and Supreme Court Advocates On Record Association (SCAORA) Shivaji Jadhav on the issue of resumption of physical hearings in the top court.Bar leaders have been demanding the start of the physical hearings as soon as possible, while continuing with virtual court hearings with an improved system for limited types of matters. However, several lawyers have been opposed to the idea of starting of physical court hearing of the cases while referring to the rise in number of COVID-19 cases. Justices Ramana, Arun Mishra, Rohington Nariman, U U Lalit, A M Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and L N Rao are part of the committee set up by the CJI to look into the issue of resumption of physical hearings in the top court. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-commence-physical-hearing-of-cases-in-limited-manner-issues-sop-134222
31-08-2020||New Delhi||Army kept India’s sovereignty secure; why is Congress crying: BJP||Hitting back at the Congress after it targeted the Union government over the Chinese aggression at the Ladakh border, the BJP asked why the opposition party was “crying” when the Indian Army had kept the nation’s territorial integrity secure by thwarting the neighbouring country’s designs.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra at a press conference said India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had shown “red eyes” to China and questioned as to why was the Congress showing “moist eyes”.He was responding to Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala’s jibe at the government.The Congress leader had said in a tweet: “Another brazen attempt at aggression by China in Pangong Tso Lake. Everyday there is a Chinese intrusion...Pangong Tso Lake area, Gogra and Galwan valley, Depsang plains, Lipu Lake, Doka La and Naku La pass. Our armed forces are standing fearlessly to protect Mother India. But when will Modi ji show his red eyes.”Patra said the issue pertaining to China is not about one party but about the country and noted that the Ministry of Defence had issued a statement in which it said that the Chinese army tried to violate Indian sovereignty but its attempts were thwarted.“The BJP and the people of India salute the Indian Army. The bravery with which they have discharged their duty and protected India’s sovereignty deserves our salute,” he said.Attacking the Congress, he said: “India and Modi ji have red eyes. Indian Army has shown its red eyes. That is why India’s sovereignty is intact. Nobody can challenge it. Everyone has trust in the Indian Army and Modi, and stands by them.”Patra said that as long as this government and the army are there, nobody can play with the country’s sovereignty.“I want to ask Randeep Surjewala, Rahul Gandhi that we have red eyes but why do you have moist eyes? Whenever we are attacked or we carry out a surgical strike to destroy terrorist camps, then why do you start crying? You should be happy,” he said.“Our army has valour, and our government and the prime minister have self-confidence,” he said, asking why does it bother the Congress and why is it crying.In a fresh incident in eastern Ladakh, the Chinese PLA carried out “provocative military movements” to “unilaterally” change the status quo on the southern bank of Pangong Tso lake but the attempt was thwarted by Indian troops, the Army said on Monday.Army Spokesperson Col Aman Anand said troops from China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) “violated” the previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements on the ongoing standoff in eastern Ladakh and carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo on the night of August 29-30.Reacting to the development, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy said it was sad that the government does not realise that the Chinese have made a decision about India. India should get tough, he said.“It (is) sad that the government does not realise the Chinese have made a decision about India. We must make a decision about China. Get tough, I repeat, get tough and not sit at a table. After sitting with Xi Jinping 18 times in five years Chinese could not care less for Indian leaders,” he said in a tweet.

31-08-2020||Bengaluru||‘Not warranted’: Former Law Minister Moily on SC punishing Prashant Bhushan||The Supreme Court on Monday punishing activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan was unwarranted, former Union Law Minister M Veerappa Moily said and felt that the case against him could have been referred to the Bar Council of India.The senior Congress leader said that Attorney General KK Venugopal and many jurists and lawyers had urged the Supreme Court not to punish him.Moily expressed the view that judges should not take upon themselves to punish a person who makes allegations against them.“It looks as if it was not warranted,” he said on the Supreme Court imposing a token fine of one rupee against Bhushan as punishment in the contempt case against him.“It’s not in keeping with the question of natural justice. It’s not in keeping with the high standards of judiciary,” he said.Bhushan, who has been convicted for two tweets against the judiciary, has to deposit the fine with the Supreme Court registry by September 15, said a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra.Failure to comply would entail a three-month jail term and debarment from law practice for three years, it said.Politicians, judges or anybody should “bear this kind of criticism” and not take upon themselves to punish a person who makes allegations against them, said Moily, a former Karnataka Chief Minister.“Judiciary will have to lay down certain norms, methods to deal with such situations,” Moily told PTI.“At the most, they (SC) can make a reference to Bar Council of India. That is the right body to punish the lawyers.”The Bench, also comprising Justices B R Gavai and Krishna Murari, said freedom of speech cannot be curtailed but rights of others need to be respected.On August 14, the apex court held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for his two derogatory tweets against the judiciary and said they cannot be said to be a fair criticism of the functioning of the judiciary made in public interest.

Searches were conducted by the ED at the residential and business premises of Hussain and his relatives and associates in Delhi, Noida and Greater Noida on June 23, 2020,” the official said,  adding that these raids had led to the recovery of incriminating documents and pieces of evidence, including fake invoices, which were used for the fraudulent transfer of money.He also said over the past few days, Hussain had been interrogated by the ED officers in Tihar Jail while under arrest by Delhi police. Subsequently, he was arrested under the PMLA for his role in money laundering and brought to the agency’s office here for custodial interrogation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-arrests-suspended-aap-councillor-tahir-hussain-under-pmla-134217

31-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant case: ED questions Goa hotelier; NCB continues probe||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday questioned a Goa-based hotelier, Gaurav Arya, in connection with a money-laundering probe linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, officials said.Arya arrived at the central probe agency's office here in Ballard Estate area around 10:30 AM accompanied by his legal team.The ED had summoned Arya last week to join the probe after it recovered some mobile phone messages reportedly sent by actor and Rajput's live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty to him in 2017 and they purportedly indicated discussion of certain banned narcotics, officials had said.The agency will record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), they said.Arya, who runs two hotels in Goa, had earlier told news channels that he has never dealt in narcotics and his last interaction with Rhea was about three years ago, adding he will "comply" with all legal procedures.He had also said that he never met Rajput, 34, who was allegedly found hanging at his duplex flat in the Bandra area of Mumbai on June 14.The agency is looking at the money laundering angle in this case and hence all conversations and entities that are linked to the matter are required to be questioned to establish facts and to find out if any criminality is involved, a senior ED official had said.The ED has also recently intimated the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) about these purported drugs-linked chats which it recovered after 'cloning' two mobile phones of Rhea.It has already recorded Rhea's version, under the PMLA, about these chats that purportedly indicate procurement of banned drugs.Rhea, 28, the main accused in the case, her father Indrajit Chakraborty, brother Showik and multiple staff members of her and Rajput have been grilled by the ED till now.She is also being questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the Santacruz area for the fourth time on Monday apart from few others who worked for Rajput.The ED has questioned two out of Rajput's four sisters and his father, K K Singh.It is going to question a few more people who are linked to Rajput and Rhea during this week, officials said.Meanwhile, the NCB, the third federal agency probing the circumstances surrounding the death of the actor, is investigating the overall network of drug syndicates, suppliers and couriers who operate in Mumbai and some adjoining western India states like Goa.The NCB is mandated with an "overarching charter" to check narcotics cartels and suppliers. Hence, it is probing a larger "criminal conspiracy and contravention of anti-narcotics laws" that includes the present case where Rhea and others have been allegedly found messaging about procurement and consumption of certain banned drugs, they said.It had also arrested two persons last week for allegedly dealing in marijuana (weed) but sources said the action was not linked to this probe.A special NCB team from Mumbai, led by Deputy Director (operations) K P S Malhotra, is stationed in Mumbai for the probe.The ED case under the PMLA stems from an FIR filed by Rajput's father on July 25 with the Bihar Police in Patna against Rhea, her father, mother Sandhya Chakraborty, Showik, Rajput's manager Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi and unknown persons, accusing them of cheating and abetting his son's suicide.Rajput's father has also alleged financial irregularities in his complaint to the police.Singh had alleged that an amount of Rs 15 crore was siphoned off from Rajput's bank account in one year to accounts of persons not known or connected to the late actor.However, the ED has not found any direct transaction made from Rajput's account to that of Rhea except an instance where it intercepted a mobile phone message where Rhea allegedly talks about obtaining details of a debit card used by the late actor from his house manager Samuel Miranda.Some cash deals, in this case, are also under the scanner of the agency.Rhea has maintained that she "never consumed" any banned narcotics and that she will cooperate with all the probe agencies as a law-abiding citizen.

31-08-2020||New Delhi||Treat doctors losing lives in Covid fight at par with martyrs of armed forces: IMA to PM||The Indian Medical Association has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking that all doctors who have died of COVID-19 be treated at par with martyrs of the armed forces, and their dependents be provided government jobs in accordance with their qualifications.In a letter to the prime minister, the country’s largest body of doctors said only an “inclusive national solatium” for all doctors, who have lost their lives fighting the pandemic, would render justice to the sacrifice of their families.The IMA cited government data and said 87,000 healthcare workers had been infected and 573 of them had lost their lives due to COVID-19.However, the Centre has not officially released these figures.Noting that the data has raised concerns all across the country, the IMA said its data for doctors alone has registered 307 deaths and a total 2,006 infected. It said 188 of those died are general practitioners who are the first point of contact for people.“Doctors suffer a higher viral load and a higher CFR (Case Fatality Rate) as a community. IMA is constrained to point out that they could have stayed back at home during the epidemic safely. They chose to serve the nation in the best traditions of the medical profession,” said the letter dated August 30.The solatium approved by the government for their colleagues in government services in all fairness is deserved by the children of these martyrs as well, the association said.“All doctors who have laid down their lives in fighting this epidemic should be treated at par with the martyrs of Indian Armed Forces and acknowledged appropriately. The surviving spouse or dependent should be provided a government job as per their qualifications,” the IMA said.It also raised the issue that whatever solatium that is in place had failed to reach the beneficiaries due to the inadequacy of the chosen instrument and the “indifference”.“The scheme is reported to have been lapsed as well. There is a pressing need to reconsider the same on merit and create a dedicated system to administer,” the IMA said.A national scheme to support the “soldiers fighting a pandemic” cannot be allowed to degenerate into just another pecuniary benefit for government servants, it said.“We once again appeal to your goodself that such a sacrifice by doctors needs to be acknowledged by the highest office of the nation irrespective of the sectors,” the IMA said in the letter to Modi.“We are also writing to you at this juncture since it has been predicted that India will top the world in number of cases in a few weeks. Healthcare manpower is precious. Uniform practices have to be put in place throughout the country,” it said.The IMA said substantial differences were noticed from district to district in how doctors and healthcare workers were deployed. It asserted that districts were not sensitive to the safety angle, and the concerns of stress and fatigue of the medical manpower.Noting that the nation deserves a radical approach to the situation, the IMA appealed to the prime minister for the government to bring in appropriate reforms, which it said were long overdue.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/treat-doctors-losing-lives-in-covid-fight-at-par-with-martyrs-of-armed-forces-ima-to-pm-134209

This has been reclassified into five zones using natural break criteria.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/15-area-around-mussoorie-highly-susceptible-to-landslides-say-geologists-134199

It is evident that the Congress, instead of encouraging democratic discourse, is encouraging violence against CPI(M)-DYFI workers in the state.

31-08-2020||New Delhi||Govt attacking informal sector, lockdown was deliberate: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday posted a video alleging that the government was deliberately attacking the informal sector and the recent lockdown was one such calculated move.Gandhi said the aim was to enslave the poor who form the backbone of India’s informal economy.“The BJP government has attacked the informal structure. There is an attempt to turn you into a slave,” he said adding that demonetization, flawed GST implementation and lockdown were all examples of how the government was undermining a whole sector.Claiming that in 2008 India survived the final recession due to a strong informal sector, Gandhi said: “Till the time India's informal sector is strong, no economic storm can touch India. Now let's come to present day. The BJP government has been attacking the informal sector over the past six years. I am giving you three massive examples right now- Demonetisation, wrong GST and Lockdown. Don't think the lockdown was unplanned. Don't think it was done at the last minute. The aim of these three decisions was to destroy our informal sector,” he said.जो आर्थिक त्रासदी देश झेल रहा है उस दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण सच्चाई की आज पुष्टि हो जाएगी: भारतीय अर्थव्यवस्था 40 वर्षों में पहली बार भारी मंदी में है।‘असत्याग्रही’ इसका दोष ईश्वर को दे रहे हैं।सच जानने के लिए मेरा वीडियो देखें। pic.twitter.com/sDNV6FwqutGandhi argued that the PM needed the media and marketing to run the government and this was being done by 15-20 people of the formal sector.“The informal sector has a lot of money which the government can't touch. They want to break this sector and extort this money from them. The effects of this attack on informal sector will be seen soon. The results will be that India won't be able to produce jobs. Because the informal sector produces 90 per cent of the jobs. Once the informal sector is destroyed India won't be able to produce jobs,” said the Congress leader.He said the poor, farmers and small traders of the informal economy run this country, take it forward and “there is a conspiracy against them.”He said the informal sector workers were being cheated.“We have to understand this attack and the entire country has to unite to fight against this,” he said.The former Congress chief said when he asked then PM Manmohan Singh now India survived the 2008 recession, Singh told him it was due to the strength of the informal sector comprising farmers, labourers and MSMEs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-attacking-informal-sector-lockdown-was-deliberate-rahul-gandhi-134160

Indian troops pre-empted this activity on the Southern Bank of Pangong Tso and undertook measures to strengthen our positions and thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on ground,” read the MoD statement.Brigade Commander-level Flag Meeting is in progress at Chushul along the LAC to resolve the issues.The Army has so far not responded to questions on injuries or any casualties in the incident. Sources, however, said additional troops had been rushed to the spot and the surrounding areas.This action by the PLA troops violated the previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements following the standoff in Eastern Ladakh since May this year.The Indian Army is committed to maintaining peace and tranquility through dialogue, but is also equally determined to protect its territorial integrity, said the MoD.Since May, there had been clashes at Galwan Valley and North bank of Pangong Tso. The South Bank of the lake has multiple Indian Army posts.

31-08-2020||New Delhi||People’s President Pranab Mukherjee is no more||Former President and distinguished parliamentarian Pranab Mukherjee passed away at the Army Research and Referral Hospital on Monday evening after suffering septic shock this morning during the course of his lung infection treatment. Mukherjee was 84.He had been admitted to the hospital on August 10 for a surgery of a large brain clot. He was also found to be COVID-19 positive at admission to the hospital.Ever since the surgery, Mukherjee had been in deep coma and on ventilator support with lung infection that was soon followed by renal complications.The death of Mukherjee was announced by his son and former MP Abhijit Mukherjee who tweeted, “With a Heavy Heart , this is to inform you that my father Shri #PranabMukherjee has just passed away inspite of the best efforts of Doctors of RR Hospital & prayers ,duas & prarthanas from  people throughout India ! I thank all of You.”With a Heavy Heart , this is to inform you that my father Shri #PranabMukherjee has just passed away inspite of the best efforts of Doctors of RR Hospital & prayers ,duas & prarthanas from people throughout India ! I thank all of You 🙏  His last rites will be held at Lodi Road crematorium in New Delhi at 2 pm on Tuesday.The central government has announced seven-day state mourning.Only last year Mukherjee was conferred the highest civilian honour of the country, the Bharat Ratna, in recognition for his service as a long-term parliamentarian who served in the Congress in various capacities including as the party’s chief crisis manager.Mukherjee served in the Cabinets of late Indira Gandhi, PV Narasimha Rao and most recently Manmohan Singh.Under the UPA, Mukherjee was minister of defence, external affairs and finance starting 2004 and the Congress’ strategist in parliament until his journey as a parliamentarian ended in July 2012 when he became the 13th President of the Indian Republic.On July 25, 2017, Mukherjee’s association with Parliament also ended after he demitted the highest office followed 48 action packed years.Mukherjee began his career in politics in 1969 as an independent member representing Bangla Congress — a regional party in Parliament from 1969 to 1971.Pranab’s relationship with the Congress began with the merger of Bangla Congress into the Congress Parliamentary Party in 1971.There was no looking back since. Mukherjee was a member of Rajya Sabha for five termstill 2004 when he was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time ever from Jangipur after having lost two previous LS polls from Malda in 1977 and Bolpur in 1980. At that time he resigned as Congress Treasurer to contest.The only time when Mukherjee was out of Parliament was from 1987 to 1993.During this period he was out of Congress too for a year from 1987 to 1988.Groomed in early politics by late Indira Gandhi who he always considered his mentor, Mukherjee repaid his mentor by never giving any evidence to the Shah commission the Janata government set up to look into the excesses of the emergency declared by Indira Gandhi.After serving in the Cabinet of Narasimha Rao, Mukherjee went on to grow close to Sitaram Kesri who succeeded Rao as Congress president in 1996.“I shared an excellent working relationship with Sitaram Kesri,” Mukherjee said in his memoirs adding that Kesri immediately appointed him the head of party’s foreign affairs cell.Mukherjee’s indispensability to the Congress and his knowledge of party constitution later came in handy when the Congress Working Committee stalwarts came to him asking how to dislodge Kesri to install Sonia Gandhi as party president.And Mukerjee showed the way forward that led toKesri’s ouster from the party and Sonia’s installation in 1998.During UPA years, Mukerjee grew closer to Sonia Gandhi who refused to spare him to contest forPresident in 2007 saying “you are needed in the government”.It was only later in 2012 that Mukherjee contested for the office of President and won.In his memoirs Mukherjee recalled how everyone had hoped that after Sonia Gandhi declined to be prime minister in 2004 after Congress staked claim to form government he had anticipated that she would name him for the post.“The prevalent expectation was that I would be the best choice for prime minister after Sonia Gandhi declined....There was later speculation in the media that I wouldn’t join the government because I couldn’t work under Manmohan Singh who had been my junior. The fact was I was reluctant to join the government and told Sonia Gandhi accordingly. She insisted I should join and that I would be vital to its functioning. As it turned out Dr Singh would talk to me on all important issues and seemed to depend on me. We shared a good working relationship,” he wrote in his last book “The Coalition Years: 1996-2002”.Mukerjee who could never be PM rose to be President, the highest constitutional office, which he made accessible for the people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/peoples-president-pranab-mukherjee-is-no-more-134157

Of these, Maharashtra has contributed the maximum caseload amounting to almost 21 per cent, followed by Andhra Pradesh (13.5%), Karnataka (11.27%) and Tamil Nadu which stands at 8.27%. Uttar Pradesh with 8.27%, West Bengal with 3.85%, and Odisha with 3.84% are the remaining states contributing to the increased caseload,” the Health Ministry said.Of the total 36,21,245, cases in the country, three states make up 43 per cent of the load. These are Maharashtra, AP, Karnataka.The ministry said India had exhibited determined resolve to expand the testing which has led to an exponential hike of COVID-19 testing to over 4.3 crore.Starting from a single test in one lab in Pune in January 2020, the daily testing capacity has been scaled up to more than 10 lakh in August.The cumulative tests have crossed 4.23 crore as 8,46,278 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours.“India has registered 78,512 cases in the last 24 hours. The report by certain media entities of about 80,000 cases in the last 24 hours is without any basis. Of the total cumulative number of cases, 43 per cent were recorded in just three states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. While Tamil Nadu has contributed 11.66 per cent of the total cases,” the Ministry said.Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka also account for about 50 per cent of the deaths added in the last 24 hours due to COVID-19, with Maharashtra leading with 30.48 per cent.The toll from COVID has climbed to 64,469 with 971 deaths in 24 hours.Recoveries have risen to 27,74,801 with 76.62 per cent national recovery rate as of today.There are 7,81,975 active COVID cases in India as of Monday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/43-of-total-covid-cases-in-maharashtra-ap-and-karnataka-alone-134156
31-08-2020||Ahmedabad||Surge not so worrying if serious cases, deaths are low: Experts||The rise in number of Covid-19 cases should not be a cause of concern as long as the number of serious patients and deaths due to the disease remain low, say public health experts in Gujarat.They are of the view that the new cases being reported daily should be categorised as mild, moderate or severe to better understand the pandemic."We are finding new cases every day, but the first thing we need to know is how many of them are serious," said Dileep Mavalankar, Director of the Gandhinagar-based Indian Institute of Public Health."The government should report how many new patients have been put on oxygen or ventilator support...we are reporting low mortality," he said.The new cases should be divided into three categories- mild, moderate, if a patient needs oxygen, and severe, if he/she needs ventilator support, he said.In a recent study, Mavalankar found that between March and July, the percentage of deaths due to COVID-19 compared to other diseases in India was 1.3, as against 13 per cent in the US and 17.6 per cent in the UK.He said the government should not neglect fatalities due to other reasons just to control the over one per cent COVID-19 deaths.At the same time, the government should provide more data in the public domain for experts to understand the pandemic situation better, he said.The data should include the nature of new daily cases, as to how many of them are mild, moderate or severe. The government should also provide data separately on the number of suspected COVID-19 cases and the cases being reported in urban and rural areas, Mavalankar said."The disease will, of course, spread. Even high-profile people are getting the disease. We need to focus on reducing the number of deaths. In terms of data, we need to ask the government to separate mild cases from moderate and severe," he said.In Gujarat, Surat city has reported the highest number of new COVID-19 cases in recent times."But, that alone should not concern us as only about 400 patients are hospitalised, and the rest, around 500, are in home isolation, taken care of by a dedicated team of doctors," Surat Municipal Commissioner BN Pani said.There is a perception that the situation is quite bad because of the number of cases being very high. But a look at the bed occupancy shows the number of people in hospitals is very low, he said."There are currently 872 active COVID-19 cases in Surat, out of whom 400 patients are hospitalised. Plasma therapy and medicines like Ramdesivir have helped treat severe cases and reduce the number of deaths. Early detection is also reducing the mortality," he said.Pani said the COVID-19 death rate has come down in Surat and the severity of cases has also considerably decreased.He claimed Surat has achieved the highest number of plasma donations and use of plasma therapy in the entire country. So far, around 994 patients here have been given the plasma therapy, he added.Also, the civic body has formed a task force for the diamond and textiles industries and issued standard operating procedures for them.Till Sunday, Surat reported 20,855 COVID-19 cases and 809 deaths due to the disease. The state has so far reported 95,155 cases and 3,008 deaths, as per the health department.Gujarat COVID-19 task force member Dr Tushar Patel said though more new cases of the disease are being reported every day, a large number of patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic."Hence, the situation is not worrying as such patients get treated with home isolation," he said."There are active cases, but the number of critically ill patients has gone down, as we can see empty beds in ICUs of dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. Active cases will remain, but at the same time the positivity rate has come down," he said.Three months ago, reports of eight out of 10 people tested used to come out positive for COVID-19. Now only about two out of 10 come out positive, said Dr Patel, who is a pulmonologist.

31-08-2020||New Delhi||SC fines Prashant Bhushan Re 1 for contempt; will pay, reserve right to file review plea: Activist-lawyer||The Supreme Court on Monday ordered activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan to pay a fine of Re 1 by September 15 for contempt of court, failing which he will be sent to jail for three months and debarred from practising before it for three years.A three-judge Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra—which had held Bhushan guilty of contempt of court on August 14 for scandalising the Judiciary by his tweets against CJI SA Bobde and four former CJIs—took strong exception to the contemnor talking to the press and releasing his statement to journalists in advance.“We are of the view that, in the circumstances, the defence taken cannot be said to be either in the public interest or bona fide one. On the contrary, it is more derogatory to the reputation of this court and would amount to further scandalising and bringing administration of justice in disrepute, in which the common citizen of this country has faith and approaches this court as a last resort for getting justice,” the Bench said, adding the contemnor has indulged in making reckless allegations against the institution of justice.Hours later, Bhushan told reporters that he will “respectfully” pay the fine as he has “the greatest respect for judiciary”.Insisting that his tweets were not intended to disrespect the Supreme Court or the judiciary, he said he reserved his right to file a review petition.“An advocate cannot forget his ethical duty and responsibility and cannot denigrate the very system of which he/she is an integral part,” said the Bench which also included Justice BR Gavai and Justice Krishna Murari.It said Bhushan brought further disrepute to the court by giving wide publicity to his statements before they were considered by the top court. His act of releasing his statement to the press before it was considered by the court amounted to interference in the administration of justice, it added.“Fair criticism is not to be silenced, but an advocate has to remind himself/herself, where he/she crosses the zone of propriety, and the court cannot continuously ignore it, and the system cannot be made to suffer. When the criticism turns into malicious and scandalous allegations thereby tending to undermine the confidence of the public and the institution as a whole, such a criticism cannot be ignored,” the top court said.The top court had on August 25 reserved its order on sentence after hearing detailed arguments from senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, representing Bhushan and Attorney General KK Venugopal.A defiant Bhushan had refused to apologise, saying an insincere apology would amount to “contempt of my conscience and of an institution that I hold in highest esteem”.Dhavan had urged it not to make him a martyr and that if it wanted to debar him from practising law, it should hear him first.Venugopal had said a warning would suffice but Bhushan must express regret and withdraw his affidavit justifying his controversial tweets against CJI Bobde and four former CJIs.Justice Mishra – who is due to retire on September 2 – had noted during the hearing that it was quite painful to decide a contempt case just before demitting his office.Another contempt case initiated against Bhushan in 2009 for his statement that half of the 16 former CJIs were “corrupt”, had already been referred to an appropriate Bench for considering the question of conflict between right to free speech and suo motu contempt powers of court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-fines-prashant-bhushan-re-1-for-contempt-will-pay-reserve-right-to-file-review-plea-activist-lawyer-134142

Only then would the delimitation commission visit the states to meet locals. Once the framework is drawn, it would also interact with associate members to seek their views and inputs,” said an official aware of the developments.The delimitation panel will redraw the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of the four north-eastern states and work on increasing the Assembly seats of the Union Territory of J&K as per the provisions of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act. The delimitation commission for the four north-eastern states and J&K was set up in March.It is headed by former Supreme Court Judge Justice Ranjana Desai (retd).

The two brave dogs were awarded the Chief of Army Staff’s Commendation Cards on August 15.Sophie and Vida received this honour because they performed their duties diligently while protecting their country, the PM said.Military sources said Vida, belonging to an Army dog unit under Udhampur-headquartered Northern Command, was instrumental in the timely detection of five mines and one grenade buried underground, preventing possible casualties and injuries to soldiers.Sophie of the Special Frontier Force (bomb disposal squad) saved lives by sniffing out the presence of initiator/accelerant which could have been hastily used to fabricate an IED (improvised explosive device), they said.“Such canines have played a very important role in thwarting numerous bomb blasts and terrorist conspiracies,” PM Modi said.In the past one year, Army dogs have contributed to 53 successful missions for the Indian Army, including tracking of terrorists and recovering individuals from snow-bound areas. The PM also exhorted those planning to raise a pet dog to adopt one from the Indian breeds, saying they are “very good and capable”. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-lauds-brave-army-dogs-sophie-vida-134093

Congress chief whip in Lok Sabha and Tharoor’s Lok Sabha colleague from Kerala K Suresh, however, sounded dismissive of the campaign backing the UN ex-bureaucrat as Congress chief and said Tharoor was a “guest artist” in the party. “He may be a global citizen, but he is a guest artist in the Congress. He must remember he has to follow party policies,” said Suresh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fb-campaign-for-tharoor-as-cong-chief-134091

Strong action must be taken against party persons, no matter how senior, who continue to needle the leadership daily even after our president Sonia Gandhi graciously told them she bore no ill-will against anyone. These dissenters are aware that the Congress is going through difficult times. They think they are untouchables and can continue to exploit the party’s predicament. They must be dealt with sternly,” said Jakhar days after another veteran Ambika Soni demanded disciplinary action against letter writers in the meeting of the Congress Working Committee.Jakhar also slammed the dissenters for talking inner party reforms and said their demands lacked credibility and conviction. “Some of these people who are asking for reforms have spent quarter of a century in the Rajya Sabha. Their attempt even today is not to cement the party, but to secure their personal positions. If they were so concerned about grooming others and strengthening the Congress, why didn’t they step back from the Rajya Sabha and vacate the seats for youngsters. Had they done so, maybe Jyotiraditya Scindia would not have left for the BJP,” said Jakhar.He also questioned Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, one of the signatories to the controversial letter, for seeking CWC elections now and recalled how Azad had in the 2018 AICC session moved a resolution authorising Congress chief to appoint CWC members.“What has changed in two years for Azad, except that his RS term is now expiring. Now, he says the CWC elections would ensure fixed tenure for a CWC member who can then speak his mind openly. I want to ask Azad, my senior, whether he needs a secure job to speak his mind. Well, if he does he should look for a government job. When in politics leaders need courage of conviction, not secure CWC tenures, to say what they have to say,” said Jakhar, attacking former Punjab CM Rajinder Bhattal for joining the letter writers.The Punjab Congress chief also said the party will have to bite the bullet one day and put its foot down against indiscipline by leaders.“Too many indiscretions have gone unpunished in Congress. We have seen this in Rajasthan, Punjab and now with this letter. The party will emerge stronger by telling people enough is enough,” Jakhar said.He also said the letter on the one hand seeks elections for party president’s post and CWC and on the other says NSUI and Youth Congress elections have weakened the cadre feeding organisations.“So, elections to IYC are bad and elections from block committee up to AICC are good? What’s this logic?” asked Jakhar, adding that those who never contested elections are seeking elections today.The Punjab Congress president also accused senior letter writers of betraying Sonia Gandhi and writing a “caustic” letter to her when she was ailing.“What these seniors did was no less than what Brutus did to Caesar,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-congress-chief-sunil-jakhar-slams-party-dissenters-134090

Was Ssingh the reason for showing alacrity in ordering a CBI probe? Why are such people linked to the BJP?” he asked.Singhvi said Fadnavis and senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari should answer as to why Ssingh made these many calls to the Maharashtra BJP office and who was his boss.On the drugs angle coming up during the investigation into the Rajput death case, Singhvi asked what was the Fadnavis government doing at the time as it was in power in 2017 and 2018.He also alleged that a case of assault on a minor Swiss national was lodged against Ssingh on March 29 in Mauritius, as per documents available from the Indian Embassy. — PTIRhea grilled by CBI for third dayMumbai: Actor Rhea Chakraborty was questioned by the CBI’s Special Investigation Team for eight hours on Sunday, on issues including the medical treatment and medicines administered to Sushant Singh Rajput and mention of drugs in her chats, and is likely to be questioned again as her answers were “not satisfactory”.

Sources said the first phase of both exercises was scheduled to be over by September 30, but now, it might be delayed by a year.They said though a final decision on new dates had not been taken yet, it was for certain that these could not be undertaken in 2020 in view of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the country.A senior Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) official, however, said: “At present, the government’s priority is not Census. The entire machinery is involved in containing the pandemic. The delay by even a year in conducting Census and NPR would not have any adverse impact.”The Indian Census is one of the largest administrative and statistical exercises in the world, with the involvement of more than 30 lakh officials, who visit each household across the length and breadth of the country.The house-listing phase of the Census and the exercise to update NPR was scheduled to be carried out across the country from April 1 to September 30, 2020, but was postponed due to the pandemic.As per the original plan, the Census had its reference date as March 1, 2021, and in the snow-bound areas of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, it was October 1, 2020.In March, when the lockdown was announced, the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India was all set for the first phase of the twin exercises.

This group formed the nucleus of the 1st Indian anti-air regiment at Colaba, Mumbai. Immediately, a unit was dispatched to defend oilfields in Digboi, Assam. The remaining troops sailed to Malaya and Singapore to protect assets against the anticipated Japanese onslaught.In the last days of the World War II (1939-45), the British army overran Burma in May 5, 1945. The Indian anti-aircraft regiments played role in keeping the air space clear and won gallantry awards. The heaviest concentration of the anti-aircraft guns in the British Army outside Britain was with the Indian command.The AAD had played an active role during the 1965, 1971 and Kargil wars. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-air-defence-changes-raising-day-134057

From around 7,000 entries, some two-thirds of them were made by youth of tier 2 and tier 3 cities.“This is a very auspicious indication for self-reliant India, for future of the country. You will definitely be impressed on seeing the results of the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” app innovation challenge. After a lot of scrutiny, awards have been given to around two dozen apps in different categories,” he added.Stating that the global toy industry is worth over Rs 7 lakh crore, PM Modi said, “India’s share is meagre and asked the toy manufacturers to go vocal for local toys. Citing several clusters of where toys are famous like Channapatna in Ramnagaram in Karnataka, Kondapalli in Krishna in Andhra Pradesh, Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, Dhubari in Assam and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, he said there were many such places.On the subject of children, PM Modi said September would be observed as “nutrition month”. “Nation and nutrition are closely inter-related. We have a maxim — “Yatha Annam Tatha Mannam”, which means our mental and intellectual development is directly related to the quality of our food intake. Experts are of the opinion that the better nutrition a child imbibes in the womb and during childhood, greater is the mental development and he/she remains healthy,” he added.“The effort will be not just how much and how often does one eat, but focus whether they are getting essential nutrients like iron, calcium, sodium and vitamins. Peoples’ participation is essential to make the campaign successful,” he said, adding that several measures like nutrition card, quiz and meme competition would be held to popularise it.The PM also praised the farmers and thanked them for their contribution. “Even during these trying times of Covid-19, our farmers have proven their mettle. This time around in our country, sowing of kharif crops has increased by 7 per cent compared to last year.‘Farmers have proven their mettle’Even during these trying times of Covid-19, our farmers have proven their mettle.

Besides, many candidates have moved to different cities during lockdown and hence are at far off locations from the examination centres.“During the Covid-19 crisis, one of the major concerns among students is regarding difficulty in reaching the exam centres. Students and alumni of IITs have promptly come forward and launched a dedicated portal to connect with good samaritans who may want to help the needy candidates. The portal called “Eduride” will ease burden of commuting for the candidates, especially from remote locations and poorly connected areas,” IIT Delhi Director V Ramgopal Rao said.“After registration of alumni, volunteers and candidates, the portal will connect appropriate combinations of volunteers and candidates via exchange of contact details. The two can then coordinate to plan the travel to the exam centre. The donated money will help the organisers fund cab service for the exam-takers on the day of the exam,” he said.There has been a growing chorus against holding of crucial entrance exams like JEE-Mains, JEE-Advanced and NEET in September, in view of rising Covid-19 cases.However, the Ministry of Education has asserted that further delay in conducting the exams can lead to a zero academic year and hence, the exams will be conducted as per schedule in September. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-students-alumni-launch-portal-to-provide-transport-facilities-to-neet-jee-candidates-134054
