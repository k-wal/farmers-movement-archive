08-08-2020||New Delhi||Future of India-China ties depends on reaching ‘some kind of equilibrium’: Jaishankar||The world has a lot riding on India and China given their size and the impact, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday, suggesting that the future of ties between the two countries would depend on reaching “some kind of equilibrium or understanding”.In an online interaction at a CII summit, Jaishankar said there are “problems” between the two countries which are “well laid out”.He was replying to a question on whether India and China will be able to become friends in the next 10-20 years just like the way France and Germany overcame their past to forge a new relationship.Jaishankar did not give a direct reply, but briefly delved into broader historical aspects of the relationship.“We are neighbours of China. China is already the second largest economy in the world. We will be one day third. You can argue when. We are demographically two very unique countries. We are the only two countries in the billion plus (population) category,” he said.“The period of our difficulties were similar which really started at least vis-a-vis the Europeans around the same timeframe,” he said.The external affairs minister said the period of re-emergence of the two countries in a very strong way in international politics is also not that far apart.“We are seeing a sort of parallel but differential rise of the two countries. But all of this is also happening when we are neighbours. To my mind what it does is, it puts a huge premium on reaching some kind of equilibrium or understanding between the two,” he said.“Because not just in my interest, equally in their interests, and how to do that, I think is, one of the big challenges that we face. In their own way, somebody at their end would be saying something,” he added.India and China are currently locked in a bitter border row in eastern Ladakh.“And I would argue that the world actually has a lot riding on us given our size and given our impact that would be the case. It is not an easy question to answer. There are problems; problems are well laid out. But certainly I feel, you know, (it) is very central to our foreign policy calculations,” Jaishankar said.Referring to evolving geo-politics, the external affairs minister also mentioned how the era of western dominance is diluting in the wake of rebalancing of global power with the rise of countries like India and China.About the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a free trade agreement, Jaishankar said trade pacts should serve the national economic growth and suggested that it would be a key condition on India’s decision whether to go for such agreements.Talking about India’s foreign policy, the external affairs minister said the country will continue to strive for a just and equitable world as not advocating for international rules and norms could lead to the “law of the jungle”.He also touched upon a range of key geo-political issues like changing character of global alliances, how technology and connectivity are becoming key parameters of global power and India’s strategic autonomy in foreign policy and importance it commands for its values and ethical approach.Highlighting centrality of India’s foreign policy, Jaishankar said the country is recognised for moral leadership globally and that it strongly stands for its quest for a more just and equitable world with strong commitment for international laws and norms.If we do not advocate for a world which is based on law and norms, “then frankly, it will be the law of the jungle,” the external affairs minister said adding virtues of Lord Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi are still recognised globally.“We have an ability to handle, manage and internalise diversity in a very very unique way,” said Jaishankar.Referring to current geo-politics, changing dimension of alliances and diplomacy, he pitched for a less dogmatic and much more open-minded and pragmatic approach in dealing with various countries and situations.Jaishankar said though military and economic powers used to symbolise global clout in the past, technology and connectivity are becoming new parameters of power and influence.“Technology has never been politically neutral,” he said, adding India has to be prepared to deal with new realities of the changing world order. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/future-of-india-china-ties-depends-on-reaching-some-kind-of-equilibrium-jaishankar-123932
08-08-2020||New Delhi||Centre alerts states, industry to be vigilant about ‘mystery seed parcels’||The Centre has alerted state governments as well as the seed industry and research bodies to be vigilant about “suspicious/unsolicited seed parcels” from unknown sources entering into India which can be a threat to the country’s biodiversity.A directive in this regard has been issued, the agriculture ministry said as in the last few months thousands of suspicious seed shipments have been reported across the world.The threat of “unsolicited/suspicious seed parcels with mislabelled packages from unknown sources” was reported in many countries like the US, Canada, the UK, New Zealand, Japan and some European nations, it said. The ministry also mentioned that “the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) termed it as “brushing scam” and “agriculture smuggling”.The USDA has also reported that the unsolicited seeds parcels may contain seeds of alien invasive species or an attempt to introduce pathogens or disease that may pose serious threat to the environment, agriculture ecosystem and national security, it added.The agriculture ministry said unsolicited/mystery seed parcels can be a threat to biodiversity of India.Therefore, all state departments of agriculture, state agriculture universities, seed associations, state seed certification agencies, seed corporations, Indian Council of Agriculture vis-a-vis their crop based research institutes are directed to be “vigilant” about the suspicious seed parcels, it stated.Commenting on the directive, Federation of Seed Industry of India Director General Ram Kaundinya in a statement said, “Right now it is only an alert for a possible spread of plant diseases through seeds coming from unauthorised sources without orders. Seed terrorism is too big a word to use for it. There are limitations to what diseases a seed can carry. But nevertheless, it is a threat.”  He said that these seeds could be of an invasive species or weed which if established in Indian environment will compete or displace native species.“It’s best to proactively work to avoid their release than to have to bear huge costs for controlling them in future. All of us should be careful not to use any seed coming from unknown sources.”  Plant quarantine and customs checks at ports and airports have to be stringent. This situation can be handled through vigilance and by following precautions, he said.“People in the US have received such unsolicited packets and subsequently, the USDA issued an alert. We should not plant seeds that have come to us unsolicited and destroy them immediately,” Kaundinya added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-alerts-states-industry-to-be-vigilant-about-mystery-seed-parcels-123930

She came in contact with Sushant only to grab money, it added.Ahead of the August 11 hearing, Maharashtra government is also said to have filed a detailed report in a sealed cover in the top court on the probe conducted by Mumbai Police in the case.Rea, said to be the deceased actor’s girlfriend, is now being probed as an accused in the case by the CBI after an FIR lodged against her in Patna got transferred to the central agency.Through her social media account, Rhea had requested the Union Home Minister for a CBI inquiry and now that it has become a reality.“However, now it seems that the Petitioner (Rhea) has taken a complete U-turn against the investigation being conducted by the CBI,” Singh submitted.Singh said he had informed the Mumbai police about his apprehension regarding the threat to Sushant’s life but no action was taken resulting in his son’s death.In its affidavit filed in the court on Saturday, the Maharashtra Government opposed registration of FIR by Bihar Police and its subsequent transfer to the CBI.It said, "Not a single legally permissible and sustainable ground existed, nor does it exist, either for the registration of the FIR at Patna or for the transfer of such non-maintainable FIR to the CBI."Bihar Police could have registered a zero FIR and transferred the same to Bandra Police Station in Mumbai, it said.Accusing the CBI of showing indecent haste in taking over the probe into the Patna FIR, Mumbai police said it spoke of the agency's bonafide in the entire exercise.The CBI should not have gone ahead and registered a FIR in the case on Bihar government's request, it said.Mumbai police said the CBI should not have constituted a team for probe into Sushant's death and the agency should have waited for the top court's decision on Rhea's petition for transfer of the  FIR registered at Patna to Mumbai.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-police-probe-an-eyewash-sushants-father-tells-sc-123924

Its purpose is to provide knowledge on the success and journey of the mission which achieved the goal to make India open-defecation free (ODF).The ODF Mission was the biggest people movement undertaken by any country in the world, and was hinged on behavioural change. Modi asked district authorities concerned to repair the community toilets in their areas, among others, during the weeklong campaign.He said in hindsight, the country’s six-year long Swachh Bharat Mission has proved to be pragmatic as it has helped fight coronavirus.“Imagine the spread of Corona in the country had the situation remained the same like pre-2014,” Modi said, and added that social distancing, among others, would have been difficult to maintain in the absence of toilets at home.He said all the villages of the country declared themselves ODF by the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi last year. He pitched for achieving “ODG plus”.He said Gandhi was a visionary in linking cleanliness with struggle for Independence.“Uncleanliness robs a person of vitality. It demoralises him and plagues him with diseases,” Modi said stressing on the need to sustain the present efforts of cleanliness.Modi interacted with 36 schoolhildren from all the States and UTs in the 360 degree amphitheatre constructed in the RSK, and said children played a role in success of the ODF campaign and other aspects of Swachh Bharat campaign.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-calls-for-a-weeklong-swachhta-abhiyan-123920

With focused efforts to reduce mortalities due to COVID-19, India has registered one of the lowest deaths per million at 30 as compared to the global average of 91 deaths per million," the ministry said.There has been a sharp increase in COVID-19 recoveries. With 48,900 patients discharged in 24 hours, India's total recoveries from COVID-19 has reached 14,27,005."The recovery rate, on a steady rise, stands at 68.32 per cent," the ministry said.According to the health ministry, 6,19,088 active COVID-19 cases, which is the actual caseload of India, account for 29.64 per cent of the total positive cases as on date. These patients are under medical supervision either at hospitals or in home isolation.Expanded diagnostic lab network and facilitation for easy testing across the country has resulted in India testing a total of 2,33,87,171 samples for COVID-19 infection. A total of 5,98,778 tests were conducted on Friday, the ministry said."Tests Per Million has seen a sharp increase to 16,947 today," it said.A key factor in this widespread testing is the continuously expanding network of diagnostic labs. With 936 labs in the government sector and 460 private labs, India has 1,396 labs for COVID-19 testing.With a single-day rise of 61,537 cases, India's coronavirus tally reached 20,88,611 while the death toll due to the disease rose to 42,518 with 933 fresh fatalities being reported in a day, the health ministry data updated at 8 am showed.

08-08-2020||Islamabad||Indus Water Treaty: World Bank expresses inability to appoint neutral expert or Court of Arbitration||The World Bank has expressed its inability to take an independent decision on the appointment of a neutral expert or a Court of Arbitration for the settlement of a long-pending water dispute between India and Pakistan, saying the two countries will have to bilaterally choose one option, a media report here said on Saturday.India and Pakistan signed the treaty in 1960 after nine years of negotiations, with the Washington-based World Bank being a signatory.The treaty sets out a mechanism for cooperation and information exchange between the two countries regarding their use of the rivers. However, there have been disagreements and differences between India and Pakistan over the treaty."Both India and Pakistan should come together as to which option to take forward,” Patchamuthu Illangovan, the World Bank's former Country Director of Pakistan, was quoted as saying by Dawn newspaper on completion of his five-year term in Islamabad.Pakistan had made a request for the appointment of a Court of Arbitration (COA) while India had sought a neutral expert to resolve the dispute on two hydroelectric projects, he said.Due to the two conflicting positions under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, the bank was facilitating the two governments to find ways in resolving their differences and move forward, Illangovan said.Asked if the bank was shying away from its role even though it was part of the treaty and had been sitting on Pakistan's request for a COA for almost four years now, he said: “There is no provision in the treaty for the World Bank to take an independent decision”.When asked about bank's reluctance to fund the Diamer-Basha Dam, Illangovan said that while the bank was supporting other projects on the Indus river like Dasu-1 and Dasu-II, India had raised objections over the Diamer-Basha's location in a disputed area (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) and that it was not the bank's policy to finance disputed projects.Pakistan had called for the resolution of disputes over the 330MW Kishanganga project on the Neelum river and 850MW Ratle Hydropower project on the Chenab river.In December 2016, the bank “paused” the process for either appointing a COA or a neutral expert, and started mediation between the two countries on how to advance and develop consensus in the light of the treaty on the mechanism for the resolution of faulty designs of the two projects.The last round of bank-facilitated and secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan were held in Washington in September 2015 which ended in the disappointment for Islamabad. Pakistan raised a number of objections over the design of the two projects at the level of Permanent Indus Waters Commission almost a decade ago, followed by secretary-level talks and then requests for arbitration through the bank.Under the treaty, in case the parties fail to resolve disputes through bilateral means, the aggrieved party has the option to invoke the jurisdiction of the International Court of Arbitration or the neutral expert under the auspices of bank.

She had also met the party's general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh.However, there was no official word on what transpired in these meetings.Raje's interactions with the party's top brass assume significance as she has largely maintained silence and kept away from BJP meetings in Jaipur since the crisis within the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in the state erupted last month.Sachin Pilot was sacked as Deputy Chief Minister and the president of the state unit of the Congress after he and some MLAs loyal to him rebelled against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. Many believe that Gehlot still has an edge in the numbers game and is confident of having a majority.The state Assembly is meeting from August 14 and Gehlot may call for a trust vote.While a section of the BJP has been keen to topple the Gehlot government with support of the Congress rebels, sources claim that Raje has not been very enthusiastic about it.

08-08-2020||New Delhi||At least five Indian airports have tabletop runways||Constructed on elevated terrains and mostly having little space for last minute maneuver, tabletop runways at times pose challenges for pilots while landing their aircraft.And Air India Express planes have crashed at least twice on such runways in little over a decade.At least five airports, including at Kozhikode where an Air India Express aircraft crashed on Friday, have tabletop runways.Tabletop runways are constructed on hilly or elevated terrains. Also, there could be low lying areas adjacent to such runways and there could be gorges at the end of such runways.Airports Authority of India (AAI) Chairman Arvind Singh told PTI that tabletop runways are there at four airports operated by it. They are at Kozhikode, Mangalore (Karnakata), Shimla (Himachal Pradesh) and Pakyong (Sikkim).The Lengpui airport in Mizoram, which is with the state government, also has a tabletop runway.State-owned AAI operates 137 aerodromes, including the ones through joint ventures.A senior Air India pilot said that automation might not help in the case of tabletop runways. There is also the issue of optical illusion, where the runway might seem to be nearer whereas it would actually be further away, he added.The pilot also stressed that there is not much buffer zone unlike normal runways.There are tabletop runways in different parts of the world and only when the runway length is less, there could be issues with landing of aircraft. In the case of Kozhikode airport, the runway is about 9,000 feet which is quite long, according to a senior regulatory official.Tabletop runways are there at some airports, both in north and south India, he added.According to the official, pilots are generally told about such runways and various restrictions.In the Court of Inquiry report about the plane crash at Mangalore airport in May 2010, it was mentioned that there were three tabletop airports in the country from where scheduled flights operate at Mangalore, Kozhikode and Lengpui.“Because of the undulating terrain and constraints of space, these airfields require extra skill and caution while carrying out flight operations.“The hazard of undershooting and overshooting, in particular, can lead to grave situations, as was the case in this accident,” the report had said.It had also said that tabletop runways have a problem of access roads around the airfield, which may need to be used in case of aircraft accidents.Citing ICAO data, the report had also said that most of the accidents occur during landing and take-off phases, with a large number of runway excursions and aircraft overrunning into the overshoot area.“Considering the large momentum of these aircraft, a downward slope in the overrun area can worsen the outcome. It is therefore recommended that such downward slopes as obtaining in Mangalore be brought to the same level of the runway surface.“This also needs to be ensured at all tabletop airports in the country,” the report had said.Regarding the Air India Express plane that crashed on Friday, AAI said it had touched down around 1,000 metres from the beginning of the runway at the Kozhikode airport before breaking up into two pieces.The Boeing 737-800 aircraft while landing overshot the runway and went down 35 feet into a slope before breaking up into two pieces. The pilot of the flight—IX-1344---could not sight the runway in the first landing attempt due to heavy rains.An AAI spokesperson said that runway 28 was in use and in the first landing attempt the pilot could not sight the runway and requested for runway 10.The pilot then steered the plane to runway 10 and came from the other side, according to an AAI official.Citing information from the Air Traffic Controller (ATC), the spokesperson said the aircraft touched down near taxiway ‘C’, which is approximately 1,000 metres from the beginning of runway 10. The total length of the runway is 2,700 metres.The spokesperson also said that it was raining over the airfield and reported visibility at the time of landing was 2,000 metres.

08-08-2020||New Delhi||Border row: India, China hold Major General-level talks||Talks between senior army commanders of India and China were held on Saturday to take forward the disengagement process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) at a number of friction points, including in Daulat Beg Oldie and Depsang in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the developments said.The Major General-level talks were held at a border personnel meeting point in Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) area on the Chinese side of the LAC, they said.The meeting comes a week after the two armies held the fifth round of Corps commander-level (Lt Gen) discussions in an effort to expedite the disengagement process.At the military talks, the Indian side has been insisting on complete disengagement of Chinese troops at the earliest, and immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to May 5 when the standoff began following a clash between the two armies in Pangong Tso.The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has pulled back from Galwan Valley and certain other friction points but the withdrawal of its troops has not moved forward from the Finger areas in Pangong Tso, Gogra and Depsang as demanded by India, according to sources.India has been insisting that China must withdraw its forces from areas between Finger Four and Eight. The mountain spurs in the area are referred to as Fingers.The formal process of disengagement of troops began on July 6, a day after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tensions in the area.Both sides held several rounds of Major General-level talks in May and June before the level of negotiations was upgraded to the level of Corps commanders.The people familiar with the developments said Saturday’s talks will primarily focus on the disengagement process in Daulat Beg Oldi and Depsang areas.Considering the situation on the ground, the Indian Army and the IAF have decided to maintain a very high-level of operational readiness in all areas along the LAC in Ladakh, North Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh till a “satisfactory” resolution to the border row with China is arrived at, sources said.Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane has already conveyed to all the senior commanders of the Army, overseeing operation of the frontline formations along the LAC, to keep up a significantly high state of alertness and maintain the aggressive posturing to deal with any Chinese “misadventure”, they said.The fresh directive to maintain a very high-level of alertness came in the wake of lack of forward movement in implementation of the disengagement process by Chinese military in friction points like Pangong Tso, Depsang and Gogra.The Indian army has already made elaborate plans to maintain current strength of troops and weapons along the LAC during the harsh winter months in eastern Ladakh and all other sensitive areas along the LAC.It is also in the process of procuring a number of weapons, ammunition and winter gears for the frontline troops.The temperature in some of the high-altitude areas along the LAC drops to minus 25 degree Celsius in the winter months. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/border-row-india-china-hold-major-general-level-talks-123876

08-08-2020||Satya Prakash||SC administration seeks explanation from officials for ‘wrongly’ listing N Ram’s PIL before Justice Chandrachud||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 8The Supreme Court administration has sought an explanation from its Registry officials for ‘wrongly’ listing a petition filed by noted journalists N Ram and Arun Shourie and activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan before a Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud ignoring the fact that similar contempt matters were already pending before a Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra.The officials concerned have been asked to explain their conduct for flouting relevant rules, sources said.Justice Mishra’s Bench has already reserved its orders on two cases of criminal contempt against Bhushan.The PIL filed by Ram, Shourie and Bhushan challenging the Constitutional validity of ‘criminal contempt’ under Section 2(c)(i) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, is listed before Justice Chandrachud next week.Bhushan is a party to all three cases.The trio, on August 1, had moved the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of ‘criminal contempt’ with regard to scandalising the Judiciary, contending it had a “chilling effect” on free speech.They challenged Section 2(c)(i) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, that defines ‘criminal contempt’ as publication of anything — whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever — which scandalises or tends to scandalise, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court.Section 2(c)(I) was a manifestly arbitrary and a vague provision of the law which violated the Right to Equality and the Right to Free Speech guaranteed under the Constitution, they contended in the petition filed on Friday“The broad and ambiguous wording of the sub-section violates Article 14 by leaving the offence open to differing and inconsistent applications. This uncertainty in the manner in which the law applies renders it manifestly arbitrary and violates the right to equal treatment,” they submitted.Terming it as unconstitutional, the trio argued that “It is incompatible with preambular values and basic features of the Constitution, it violates Article 19(1)(a), is unconstitutionally and incurably vague and is manifestly arbitrary.“The offence of ‘scandalising the court’ is rooted in colonial assumptions and objects, which have no place in legal orders committed to democratic constitutionalism and the maintenance of an open robust public sphere,” the petition read.The Supreme Court had, on July 22, issued notices to Bhushan and Twitter Inc for his tweets allegedly scandalising the Judiciary through his tweets. Two days later, it resumed hearing in another criminal contempt case against him pending since 2009. It has now reserved its orders in both cases.Bhushan expressed regret but refused to tender an apology.Earlier, a group of 131 former judges, ex-bureaucrats and activists have come out in his support, terming it as an attempt at stifling criticism.The group — which included former Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur, former Delhi High Court Chief Justice AP Shah and several retired bureaucrats and academics — appealed to the top court to drop the criminal contempt proceedings against Bhushan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-administration-seeks-explanation-from-officials-for-wrongly-listing-n-rams-pil-before-justice-chandrachud-123863
08-08-2020||New Delhi||IMA says nearly 200 doctors in India have succumbed to COVID-19 so far; requests PM’s attention||A total of 196 doctors in the country, majority of them being general practitioners, have succumbed to COVID-19 so far, said the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Saturday, requesting the prime minister for his attention on the issue.“As per the latest data collected by the IMA, our nation has lost 196 doctors, out of which 170 of them are above the age of 50 years, with general practitioners attributing to around 40 per cent of it,” the IMA said expressing concerns over the safety of doctors losing their lives in the fight against the COVID-19 crisis.While an increasing number of doctors are getting infected and losing their lives every day, a substantial number of them have been found to be general practitioners.Since a significant proportion of the population consult general practitioner due to fever and its related symptoms, they remain the first point of contact as well as care, the doctors’ body.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the IMA requested him to ensure adequate care for doctors and their families who are a special risk group and extend the state-sponsored medical and life insurance facilities to doctors in all sectors.“The IMA represents over 3.5 lakh doctors spread across the country providing next door affordable healthcare, it is pertinent to mention that COVID-19 does not differentiate between government and private sector and affect all same. Further disturbing are the reports that state that the doctors and their family members are not getting beds for admission and deficiency of drugs in most of the cases. The IMA thus requests the government of India to provide adequate attention for the safety and welfare of doctors during the pandemic,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, National President, IMA.Dr RV Asokan, Secretary-General, IMA, said the mortality rate among doctors due to COVID-19 had reached an “alarming proposition” now.“Saving each and every life of a doctor will ensure the safety of thousands of patients who depend on their care. Doctors who have died in the line of their professional duty merit favourable consideration for succour and solace to their families. It is thus pertinent for the IMA to also draw your attention to the demoralising effect to our healthcare community,” he said.

08-08-2020||New Delhi||10 years ago, AI Express plane went up in flames after overshooting runway at Mangalore airport||Back in 2010, an Air India Express aircraft overshot the runway at Mangalore airport, fell into a gorge, caught fire and 158 people lost their lives. And the crash of the airline’s plane in Kozhikode on Friday is a stark reminder of that accident ten years ago.In both instances, Air India Express pilots had overshot tabletop runways. Also, the flights were coming from Dubai.In its report on the Mangalore accident that happened on May 22, 2010, the Court of Inquiry had said the direct cause was the captain’s failure to discontinue the unstabilised approach of the plane.“Despite the constraints of the terrain surrounding the tabletop runway, the rescue and fire fighting operations had been carried out with due diligence,” the report dated October 31, 2010, said.As per the report, Air India Express’ Boeing 737-800 aircraft overran the runway, including the strip and the Runway End Safety Area (RESA).“It then impacted the concrete mounting structure of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) Localiser Antenna and fell into a gorge. In the resultant impact and post-crash fire, 152 passengers and all six crew members lost their lives. There were eight survivors,” the report said.On Friday, the airline’s plane overshot the runway at Kozhikode airport, fell into a slope before breaking into two pieces. While there was no fire, at least 18 people, including two pilots, are dead in the crash, which also happened when there were rains.Tabletop runways are constructed in a hilly or an elevated terrain.The 2010 report had said there were three tabletop airports in the country from where scheduled flights operate at Mangalore, Kozhikode and Lengpui.“Because of the undulating terrain and constraints of space, these airfields require extra skill and caution while carrying out flight operations. The hazard of undershooting and overshooting, in particular, can lead to grave situations, as was the case in this accident,” the report said.Further, the report also said the tabletop runways had a problem of access roads around the airfield, which may need to be used in case of aircraft accidents.Citing the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) data, the report had also said most of the accidents occur during landing and take-off phases, with a large number of runway excursions and aircraft overrunning into the overshoot area.“Considering the large momentum of these aircraft, a downward slope in the overrun area can worsen the outcome. It is therefore recommended that such downward slopes as obtaining in Mangalore be brought to the same level as the runway surface. This also needs to be ensured at all tabletop airports in the country,” the report said.The Court of Inquiry had said the cause of the accident was the captain’s failure to discontinue the “unstabilised approach” and his persistence in continuing with the landing, despite three calls from the first officer to “go around” and a number of warnings from Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS).This was mentioned as the direct cause of the accident.At the time of the Mangalore crash, there was no Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which was set up only in 2012.The AAIB is probing the Kozhikode accident.

08-08-2020||Mumbai||Capt Sathe survived air crash in 1990s, but returned to flying||Captain Deepak Sathe, pilot of the Air India Express flight who died along with 17 others after the plane crashed at Kerala's Kozhikode airport, had survived an air crash in the early 1990s when he was in the Air Force and was hospitalised for six months, his cousin said.Sathe had suffered multiple injuries on his skull in that incident, but due to his strong will power and passion he cleared the test and started flying again, he said.The Air India Express flight from Dubai with 190 on board overshot the tabletop runway in Kozhikode airport in Kerala on Friday night while landing in heavy rains and fell into a valley 35 feet below and broke into two portions.Captain Sathe, 58, who was the pilot-in-command and his co-pilot Akhilesh Kumar were among those who died in the incident.Sathe was a former Wing Commander of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and had served at the force's flight testing establishment.His cousin, Nilesh Sathe, who is Advisor Finance at the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), said in a Facebook post, "It's hard to believe that Deepak Sathe, my friend more than my cousin, is no more. He was pilot of Air India Express carrying passengers from Dubai in 'Vande Bharat Mission', which skidded off the runway at Kozhikode International Airport yesterday night.""Deepak was an experienced aerial operator with 36 years of flying experience. A passout of NDA, topper in the 58th course and an awardee of 'Sword of Honour', Deepak served Indian Air Force for 21 years before joining as a Commercial Pilot with Air India in 2005. He called me just a week before and was jovial, as always.""When I asked him about the 'Vande Bharat' Mission, he was proud of bringing back our countrymen from Arab countries.I asked him, 'Deepak, do you carry empty Aircraft since those countries are not allowing entry of passengers?' He had replied, 'Oh, No. We carry fruits, vegetables, medicines etc to these countries and never the aircraft flies to these countries empty.' That was my last conversation with him."He survived in air crash in early nineties when he was in the Air Force. He was hospitalised for 6 months for multiple skull injuries and nobody thought that he would fly again. But his strong will power and love for flying made him clear the test again. It was a miracle," Sathe said.According to him, Captain Sathe is survived by his wife and two sons, both pass outs of IIT Bombay.Captain Sathe was a son of Brigadier Vasant Sathe who stays in Nagpur along with his wife. His brother, Captain Vikas, was also an Armyman, who laid his life while serving in Jammu region, his cousin said.Meanwhile, a neighbour of Capt Sathe remembered him as a jovial and friendly man.Sathe lived in Nahar Amrit Shakti housing complex in Chandivali in Mumbai with his wife Sushma for nearly 15 years."Everyone in the housing society knew Sathe sir and his wife. When he wasn't flying, the couple would go on morning and evening walks," said neighbour Pankaj Nagpal.Sathe sir had a jovial, friendly personality, and he exuded positivity, he said."Sathe sir had one or two flights every week. When we heard about the plane crash, we knew it was him," Nagpal said.Sathe's wife and their elder son, who lives in Bengaluru, have already reached Kerala, Nagpal said, adding that the mortal remains of the deceased pilot may be brought back to the city for the last rites.Meanwhile, Air India sources said the airline was making arrangements to bring Sathe's younger son, who is based in the US, back to the country.

08-08-2020||New Delhi||When AI Express mentioned Kozhikode airport and runway as among ‘most beautiful’||Four years ago, Air India Express mentioned Kozhikode international airport in a list of India’s “most beautiful airports and runways”. On Friday, the budget airline’s Boeing 737 aircraft crashed at the same aerodrome killing at least 18 people.The tabletop runway at the airport, located in Kerala, poses challenges for pilots at the time of landing and there cannot be any margin for error. A tabletop runway is constructed on a hilly or an elevated terrain.In a blog post titled ‘India’s Most Beautiful Runways and Airports’ dated August 26, 2016, the airline said the joys of flying were made even more spectacular when you were greeted by the scenic beauty of your dream destination.Listing out some of the “most beautiful airports and runways located in places that are even more picturesque”, Air India Express mentioned about Kozhikode airport.Kozhikode is also known as Calicut.“Calicut International Airport, also known as Karipur Airport, is an international airport serving the cities of Kozhikode and Malappuram in Kerala, India. It is located in Karipur, about 25 km from Malappuram and 28 km from Kozhikode. The airport is one of only three tabletop runways in the country... built on hilly terrain and can be challenging to pilots,” the blog post on its website had said.Other airports mentioned in the blog included those at Mizoram, Lakshadweep, Leh and Shimla.About the Lengpui airport in Mizoram, the airline had said it was among the three aerodromes having a tabletop runway.“The 2,500-metre runway of the Lengpui airport is unique as it has many hilly streams running underneath. The airport is one among the three airports in India that has a tabletop runway, which creates an optical illusion. It is located at a distance of 32 km from Aizawl at an altitude of 504 m from sea level,” the blog said.On Friday, the Air India Express aircraft overshot the runway at Kozhikode airport amid rains and went down 35 feet into a slope before breaking up into two pieces. The flight was operated as part of the Vande Bharat Mission.Air India Express is part of Air India group and operates a large number of flights from Kerala to the Gulf region.

We wish him a speedy recovery. Trinamool MPs are not attending. For 4 months we have been urging that these meetings happen virtually. Enough scope to tweak rules. Anyone listening!” O’Brien tweeted.

The touchdown zone is ahead of the threshold area of the runway.The notice also said “excessive rubber deposit” was observed in the area from runway C/L marking to three metres on both the sides of touchdown zone of runway 28.Similar excessive rubber deposits were found by the DGCA along runway C/L marking of touchdown zone of runway 10, according to the notice.“Water stagnation of about 1.5-metre length was observed on the area between runway edge and intermediate turn pad on runway 28,” it said.Besides, the DGCA found several cracks in aircraft stand number 5. It also observed that a “portion of Apron surface” of about 111 metres was damaged, it said.An apron is the area of the airport where aircraft are parked, refuelled and where passengers board.“A steep downward slope of approximately five feet depth is observed immediately after the apron behind aircraft number 1, which needs to be levelled and graded,” the notice said.The DGCA observed a shortage of reserve stock of 6,630 litres of Aqueous Film Forming Foam concentrate (AFFF) and 140 kg of “DCP complementary agent” — both are used to put out fires — at the Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) station of the airport.Air India Express, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Air India, said on Saturday three relief flights had been arranged to Kozhikode in Kerala to assist passengers and their family members affected by the plane crash a day ago.Officials said Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri will go to Kozhikode on Saturday.Officials of the AAIB (Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau), the DGCA and the flight safety department of the airline had reached the accident site to investigate the accident, said the airline on Saturday morning.Scheduled international passenger flights remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.However, special repatriation flights have been operated by Air India and Air India Express since May 6 under the Vande Bharat Mission to help stranded people reach their destinations. Private carriers have also operated a certain number of flights under this mission.

08-08-2020||Kozhikode||Kozhikode crash: CISF personnel quarantined after passengers test positive for Covid||One of the 18 passengers, who died when an Air India Express flight from Dubai crashed landed at the airport here, has tested positive for COVID-19.Higher Education Minister KT Jaleel told the media that samples of the passenger, Sudheer Varyath (45), were sent for testing and it had returned positive for the disease.The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has directed its personnel to go into preventive quarantine after at least two passengers of the Air India Express flight that crashed at Kozhikode tested positive for COVID-19, officials said on Saturday.The CISF has said it was the “first responder” to rescue passengers on Friday as its Assistant Sub-Inspector, Ajit Singh, was on runway patrol when the Air India Express flight from Dubai with 190 people on board overshot the tabletop runway, fell into a 35-foot valley and broke into two.Health Minister KK Shailaja has asked all people engaged in the rescue operations to report to the health authorities and go on self-quarantine as a precautionary measure and get themselves tested.The flight with 190 passengers and crew on board had overshot the runway here while landing on Friday night and fell into a valley about 35 feet below and broke into two portions.The condition of 16 passengers, admitted to various hospitals, was serious, Malappuram Collector K Gopalakrishnan said.“We are identifying our personnel, who rescued the passengers who have tested positive for coronavirus,” CISF Special Director General (Airports) M A Ganapathy told PTI.Another senior officer said the force had information that two passengers have tested positive for COVID-19.Around 50 CISF personnel, who were involved in the rescue operation, and their family members have been asked to quarantine themselves, he said.The force will also conduct COVID-19 tests of all those who were exposed, the officer said.The CISF provides a counter-terrorist cover to the Kozhikode airport.Another official said the rescuers of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and other airport officials had also been asked to go into self-quarantine in view of the COVID-19 positive report of some passengers.ASI Singh, who saw the crash first, had immediately alerted his control room, which later informed the airport authorities and rescue teams from the CISF, airport authority, fire and police were subsequently rushed to the spot.The CISF was inducted at this airport in 2001-2002 and has a strength of about 350 personnel, an officer said.

08-08-2020||Washington||Indian-Americans welcome restoration of OCI card travel benefits||Indian-Americans have welcomed India's decision to restore the Overseas Citizens of India card benefits, including the visa-free travel to the country, which were suspended in view of the coronavirus pandemic.The OCI card, which allows lifelong visa-free travel to India with certain limitations to people of Indian-origin, was suspended by the Indian government on April 11 amidst a nationwide lockdown and travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 outbreak.The sudden decision had created chaos and anxiety among the hundreds and thousands of Indian-origin people. A large number of them had taken to the social media platforms like Twitter to vent out their anger.The travel restrictions on those having OCI cards were subsequently relaxed, which so far have been mainly in the emergency categories, those travelling for work or minors with OCI card holders whose parents are Indian citizens.On Friday, the Ministry of Home Affairs notified to restore the full travel privileges for OCI card holders for having passports of the US, the UK, Germany and France. India has created an air bubble (bilateral air travel arrangements) with all these countries.“We welcome the decision of the Indian government on the OCI card holders from the US, the UK, Germany and France. This was long due. This decision and creation of an air bubble with these countries would end unnecessary harassment of thousands of Indian-origin people from these countries,” social activist Prem Bhandari said.Bhandari, who has been taking up the cause of OCI card holders for the years, said that abruptly banning OCI card holders, even due to a pandemic, resulted in a lot of heartburn among the Indian-origin people.“If we cannot take shelter in India during a crisis like this, who else will help us?” he asked.Over the past few months, Bhandari, who heads Jaipur Foot USA, has been leading efforts on behalf of the Indian-American OCI card holders to lift travel restrictions.Bhandari said he spoke with senior Indian officials, including Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla.The decision to restore visa-free travel for Indian-Americans would facilitate a greater people-to-people exchange between the two countries, said Alok Kumar, former president of the Federation of Indian Associations of the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which is one of the largest esteemed umbrella organisations of the Indian community.“It's the Indian diaspora which plays the most important role in strengthening bilateral relationship between the world's oldest and largest democracies,” he said.New Jersey-based social activist Deepender Singh said: “This is a great news for OCI card holders since the Indian government has considered the need for relaxation of visa and travel restrictions for more categories of foreign nationals who want to travel to India and Indian nationals intending to visit other countries like the US, the UK, Germany and France.”There will be addition of many countries in the air bubble scheme, Singh said.“Wonderful air bubble initiative started by the Indian government for OCI citizens. This way they can visit their family,” said Indian-American Rajendra Bafna.In its notification, the Ministry of Home Affairs said it had further considered the need for visa relaxation and travel restrictions for more categories of foreign nationals who wanted to travel to India and Indian nationals intending to visit other countries in the context of the air bubble scheme.Indian missions of these countries with whom the air bubble arrangement is in place will grant appropriate visa, provided papers of the applicants are in order and there is no adverse input about them.“We welcome the relieving news that the Government of India has uplifted the travel sanction on OCI card holders. While being thankful, we urge the Government of India to consider the OCI card holder community in virtually the same ballpark with nearly the same extended privileges as those extended to NRIs and Indian citizens,” said Ankur Vaidya, Chairman of the Federation of Indian-Associations.

08-08-2020||Chennai||Slippery runway, strong tailwind likely caused Kozhikode crash: Experts||A deadly combination of a slippery runway, strong tailwind, bad weather conditions, and landing ahead of the threshold spot could have resulted in the skidding of the ill-fated Air India Express in Kozhikode that claimed 18 lives, two aviation experts said on Saturday.Also read: 18 killed as Air India Express flight overshoots runway in heavy rain in Kozhikode in Kerala; both pilots among deadPilot of ill-fated Air India Express plane was ‘Sword of Honour’ winnerDGCA had issued notice to Kozhikode airport in July 2019 over critical safety lapsesBlack box of crashed AIE flight recovered, toll rises to 18; probe under wayLeaders of Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Maldives offer condolences to families of Kerala plane crash victimsKozhikode crash: CISF personnel quarantined after passengers test positive for CovidAn Air India Express aircraft flying in from Dubai skidded off the runway while landing at Kozhikode on Friday evening and plunged into the deep valley below. At least 18 people were killed, including two pilots, and hundreds injured.The aircraft carrying 190 persons, including six crew members, battled heavy rain while landing at 7.41 pm on Friday, and careered off the runway after landing at the table-top airport.“It may be due to lack of friction between the tyres and the runway. There may be the factor of hydroplaning due to waterlogging,” a pilot not wanting to be quoted told IANS.Hydroplaning is a condition in which presence of water causes a moving wheel to lose contact with the load-bearing surface, the runway in this case. This makes braking or manoeuvring of the vehicle (plane), impossible. Hence, the aircraft’s speed could not be reduced after landing, the pilot said.Speaking to IANS, a former Indian Air Force (IAF) navigator pointed out that the standard 9,000-feet Kozhikode runway is not an issue for this kind of aircraft.“Probably, the pilot landed ahead of the threshold or the usual spot, owing to bad visibility, strong tailwind, and a slippery runway—all odds were stacked against him,” the former navigator said.“With a reduction in distance available to bring the plane to a halt, the pilot would have to literally sit on the brakes with full reverse engine power. The ditch at the end of the runway must have been on his mind. The slippery runway seems to have done the rest,” he added.According to him, it was “bad luck” and perhaps “error of judgement” on part of the pilot that led to the tragedy. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/slippery-runway-strong-tailwind-likely-caused-kozhikode-crash-experts-123816
08-08-2020||New Delhi||Centre asks states to test grocery shop workers, vendors; says they can be potential COVID spreaders||Expressing concern that grocery shops, vegetable and other vendors can be potential spreaders of coronavirus infection to a large number of people, the Union Health Ministry has advised all states and UTs to take up testing of such people to ensure early detection of cases which can lead to a reduction in mortality rate.In a letter to the states and the UTs, Secretary in the Health Ministry, Rajesh Bhushan, also stressed on the need for operationalising ambulance transport system with oxygen facility and quick response mechanism.He underlined that the refusal rate of ambulances must be monitored on a daily basis and brought down to zero.With the COVID-19 pandemic now spreading to newer areas in the country, Bhushan said there were likely to be scattered cases, a cluster of cases or large outbreaks in districts and that the primary aim was to control outbreaks, especially in new locations.“The focus at the same time should be to save lives at all cost,” he said.“While we have so far done better than many other countries in this respect, our aim should be to further reduce mortality and ensure that it does not cross the one per cent mark,” Bhushan said in the letter, addressed to additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and secretaries (health).He pointed out that early detection of cases through aggressive testing, prompt isolation or admission in a healthcare facility and ensuring proper clinical management were major components of mortality reduction.“Early detection of cases is the most crucial element to ensure that the case fatality is reduced. It helps in terms of not only identifying the case before it may become critical but also supports in terms of checking the spread of infection,” he said in the letter.Bhushan stressed on enhanced surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI)/severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) as their symptoms are mostly the same as COVID.“Once a positive case is identified, a prompt contact-tracing should be undertaken and at least 80 per cent of the contacts must be identified and quarantined within 72 hours,” he said.Normally, a person would have an average of 30 contacts for a period of tracking that two days before the symptom onset, Bhushan said.“There can be potential hotspots for the spread of infection like industrial clusters with the closed work environment, people coming from high prevalence areas, other high-density areas such as slums, prisons, old age homes, etc. In addition, grocery shops, vegetable and other vendors, etc. can be potential spreaders of infection to a large number of people. Testing in such areas and of such people should be taken up proactively as per ICMR guidelines,” Bhushan underscored.He also asked states and UTs to undertake weekly death audits to assess the determinants of death such as age differentials, comorbidities, late reporting to hospital and clinical protocols that were followed.“This will help identify challenges to be addressed and will facilitate effective case reporting and ensure timely and required medical interventions,” Bhushan highlighted.In the letter, Bhushan also said a regular house-to-house search must be done periodically to identify those who are at high-risk, that is the elderly, people with comorbidities and pregnant women among others.Alongside this exercise, containment and buffer zones should be set up and the perimeter of the containment zone must be properly secured. The buffer zone should also be identified properly so that any diffusion of infection outside the containment zone is monitored, he pointed out.For early detection, all suspected cases needed to be tested immediately, the health secretary said, emphasising that at least 140 tests per million per day (although a higher number is encouraged) must be ensured along with strict monitoring of daily positivity rate.Depending on the test result, those found positive should be sent to a COVID care centre or under home isolation if there is requisite provision at home.“An ambulance transport system with oxygen facility and quick response mechanism needs to be operationalised. The refusal rate of ambulances must be monitored on a daily basis and must be reduced to zero,” Bhushan stressed.“Availability of COVID beds in all healthcare facilities (government and private) must be proactively put in the public domain,” he said, adding that responsible administrative officers should coordinate the transparent allocation of beds and timely admission.A communication mechanism between the patients and their family members must be organised, he stated.He also urged districts to analyse the requirement of health infrastructure in terms of availability of sufficient oxygen supported beds, ICU beds and ventilators and take advance action to upgrade health infrastructure based on expected caseload in future.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-asks-states-to-test-grocery-shop-workers-vendors-says-they-can-be-potential-covid-spreaders-123815

It also shows another policeman push a turbaned man, who comes to save Singh.The turbaned man can be seen requesting the police with folded hands to not beat up Prem Singh.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal took to Twitter to condemn the incident."Too shocking for words! The barbaric & humiliating attack on Giani Prem Singh Granthi & other Sikhs in Madhya Pradesh is utterly inhuman & unacceptable. I urge CM @ChouhanShivraj to set an example of punitive action against those who treat the sword of the nation with such contempt," Badal tweeted.Too shocking for words!

I urge CM @ChouhanShivraj to take imm & examplary action against all those guilty of this brutality," Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal tweeted.State Congress spokesperson Narendra Saluja tweeted the video and criticised the police."The granthi has long been running a lock-keys shop near the Pulsood police outpost. He was beaten, his turban desecrated and then he was pulled through hair on the road in full public view by cops. This amounts to insulting religious sentiments of the Sikh community," Saluja tweeted.Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath tweeted, "This atrocity and anti-social act is disrespect to the holy Sikh religion. Such incidents cannot be tolerated. I demand from the government to immediately take strong action against those responsible for it and justice for the victims."Meanwhile, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has suspended an assistant sub-inspector and a head constable.Chouhan said in a tweet that assistant sub-inspector Sitaram Yadav and head constable Mohan Jamre have been suspended with immediate effect.Chouhan said, "Such barbarism and erratic behaviour won't be tolerated at any cost. The guilty will be punished for the misdeeds." Chouhan has also ordered a probe into the matter.Prem Singh said he runs a small shop close to the police 'chowki' and deals in old locks and keys. But police claimed Prem Singh was inebriated and created ruckus when he was asked to show his driving licence during a checking drive.

08-08-2020||Patna||Bihar police’s probe into Sushant case had made good progress, says IPS officer||The Bihar police’s investigation into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput had progressed well until it got stymied on August 2, said IPS officer Vinay Tiwari, who visited Mumbai on that date to lead the probe but ended up being quarantined by municipal authorities.Upon his return to Patna late Friday night, Tiwari, who is posted here as the SP City (East), however, declined to spill the beans on the findings of the investigation carried out by his team asserting that doing so would be “inappropriate”.“I had duly informed my counterparts in Mumbai about my official tour. I had sought accommodation and requisitioned a vehicle. Since my visit and its purpose were well known, people from the media approached me with their questions at the airport itself to which I replied,” Tiwari told reporters upon his arrival at the airport here.The IPS officer, who was released from quarantine on Friday, remarked with disappointment that despite intimation about his tour, “nobody came to the airport to receive me”.Also read: Rhea Chakraborty's call records reveal she talked to Mahesh Bhatt 16 times and Aditya Roy Kapur 23 times in last one year“Nonetheless, I checked into a guest house and then went out to meet members of my team, who had been in the city since July 27, and take stock of the investigation. At around 10 pm, I received a call from BMC authorities who spoke about the need to quarantine me. As a law-abiding person, I returned to the guest house and extended my cooperation,” Tiwari said.“It is for all to see that a few visitors to Mumbai, where so many people reach every day, are quarantined in this fashion. Even my four subordinates were not placed in quarantine. Now, try to make sense of that,” he remarked wryly.The four junior rank officials had returned from Mumbai on Thursday.Tiwari, however, hastened to add that he did not wish to take personal affront for being quarantined and pointed out that “it was our constitutional right and obligation to carry out an investigation into the FIR lodged in Patna. Things moved fine till August 2 after which everything got derailed”.To prying queries whether his investigation sensed any connivance of the Mumbai Police with actress Rhea Chakraborty, accused by Rajput’s father of abetting his son’s suicide, Tiwari said: “I would not say anything on that. It would be inappropriate to do so.”“But I must add, our investigation had progressed at great speed in 10 days and had moved in the right direction,” he concluded.The case filed by the deceased actor’s father, KK Singh, at Rajiv Nagar police station has now been taken over by the CBI, upon a recommendation of the state government which acted on a request to the effect by the complainant to DGP Gupteshwar Pandey.Pandey, who had fumed at the forced quarantine of the young IPS officer, terming it a “house arrest”, was among those who were at the airport at the unearthly hour to receive Tiwari.

However, the government launched VBM in May to evacuate stranded Indian abroad and according to data available with the MoCA at least 10 lakh people have so far been repatriated from across the world.On July 16, the MoCA announced setting up bilateral “air bubbles” with countries to partially resume international flights to various destinations. Under the scheme, deals were struck with the US, the UK, Germany, France and the UAE.An air bubble is a travel corridor between two countries under which scheduled commercial flights can be operated in a regulated environment.
