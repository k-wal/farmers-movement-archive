JEE-Advanced is scheduled to take place on September 27. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jee-main-result-declared-24-candidates-score-100-percentile-139850

It is and will remain the new reality and the new normal...The Committee believes that this move will unlock the Courts and also mitigate the inconvenience of attending Courts as long-distance travels can be dispensed with and proceedings become less expensive as well,” the panel said.Headed by Rajya Sabha BJP MP Bhupender Yadav, the report said virtual courts will “strike a balance between these two extremes and extend expeditious justice to the litigant public without compromising quality.”However, the panel expressed unhappiness over the fact “that e-Courts Integrated Mission mode project is progressing at a tortoise’s pace”. Emphasising the need to augment infrastructure, it said “the benefits of Virtual Courts will percolate down only when all court complexes are fully ICT enabled.”Noting that court proceedings were recorded in some form or the other world over, the report said live-streaming of certain proceedings will promote transparency."The apex court has time and again emphasised the significance of live streaming of court proceedings in promoting openness and transparency, which in turn reinforce public faith in the judicial system. The committee agrees with the observation made by the apex court that live streaming court proceedings, especially cases of constitutional and national importance having an impact on the public at large or a section of the public will promote transparency and openness,” the report stated.It said the judiciary may also consider broadcasting virtual hearings of certain specified categories of cases to further the principle of open justice and open court.It said, “To continue with the functioning of virtual courts in all the courts even during non-pandemic time, the committee feels that the present system should be allowed to continue on an experimental basis with the consent of all parties for certain categories of cases like appeals, etc, and final hearings where physical presence of the parties/counsels is not required and online virtual hearing alone is sufficient...”“This will also reduce the crowd in the court and cut down other litigation costs and overheads,” it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/par-panel-for-continuing-with-virtual-courts-post-covid-19-139847

He sought a direction to the authorities concerned to prepare a scheme for providing the option to people of these states to either avail ‘Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana’ or the insurance scheme implemented by the respective states.The Centre has been implementing the health insurance scheme for 50 crore people of the country with an annual budget of Rs 6,400 crore and under this scheme, poor people are entitled to avail treatment for various health problems including testing and treatment for COVID-19, Rao submitted.He alleged that except Telangana, Delhi, West Bengal and Odisha, all the states in the country are implementing or availing the Ayushman Bharat scheme.“This has resulted in the denial of health insurance benefits provided by Union of India to the people of four states which is contrary to Article 14 (equality before law) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution,” the petitioner submitted.“It is submitted that all the states in the country irrespective of political parties are utilizing the Central government health scheme to benefit the people but except the states such as Telangana, Delhi, Odisha and West Bengal are not using the well-crafted universal health scheme by the Union of India,” the PIL submitted.It said that due to non-availability of health insurance and lack of proper facilities in government hospitals, poor and middle class people were forced to pay huge money for treatment of COVID-19 at private hospitals.A comprehensive scheme may be framed by the Centre and National Health Authority to provide Ayushman Bharat scheme for desiring and eligible people and those interested may be given the option to avail either this scheme or the local health schemes run by state governments, it said.Over 16,000 hospitals, including around 8,050 private hospitals, have been empanelled under the Ayushman Bharat scheme across the country and the authority has also fixed the rates for about 1,500 treatment procedures considering the expenses required for treatment and hospitalisation, it stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ayushman-bharat-sc-issues-notice-to-centre-4-opposition-ruled-states-for-not-implementing-health-scheme-139837

11-09-2020||New Delhi||Social activist Swami Agnivesh dies at 80||Social activist and reformer Swami Agnivesh, who spent a lifetime opposing slavery and bonded labour, died on Friday just ten days short of his 81st birthday on September 21.Doctors at the Delhi-government run Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences said he was under treatment for cirrhosis of the liver and was on ventilator support after multi organ failure. Agnivesh eventually died this evening of a cardiac arrest.Born Vepa Shyam Rao on September 21, 1939, in an orthodox Brahmin family of Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh, Agnivesh went on to make Haryana the chosen land for his political activism. His tryst with politics began with a struggle for Haryana’s fair share when the state was being separated from Punjab. Agnivesh also went on to spearhead ‘Total Prohibition’ in Haryana besides working for remunerative prices for farmers’ produce and within a few years, found himself becoming part of Jaiprakash Narayan’s call to oust then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.The later leader was arrested during the Emergency and jailed for 14 months. His political career started after 1977 when he was elected to the Haryana Legislative Assembly, went on to become Education Minister in the cabinet of then Chief Minister Bhajan Lal.A rare politician, Agnivesh, while still being minister, protested against his own government demanding a judicial enquiry into police firing in the Faridabad industrial township that killed 10 workers. He was asked to go, and that led to Agnivesh going on to devote his life to the abolition of bonded labour as the founder ofHe founded the Bandhua Mukti Morcha (BMM or the Bonded Labour Liberation Front) in 1981, an organisation he was still heading when he died.Earlier in life, Agnivesh served as lecturer in management at St Xavier’s College in Kolkata and for a while practiced law as a junior to Sabyasachi Mukherji who later became the Chief Justice of India.In his student days, he also joined the Arya Samaj and began a life-long relationship with it before becoming a full-time worker in 1968.Swami Agnivesh won the Alternative Nobel Peace Prize (the Right Livelihood Award) in 2004.The demise of Swami Agnivesh is a huge tragedy. A true warrior for humanity&tolerance. Among the bravest that I knew,willing to take huge risks for public good.Was brutalised in Jharkhand by a BJP/RSS lynch mob 2 yrs ago. Liver got damaged.

The handing over is likely to take place anytime tomorrow i.e. 12th September 2020 at a designated location,” Kiren Rijiju, union minister of state for sports and youth welfare, who is also a Member of Parliament from Arunachal Pradesh, said in a tweet.The boys, who belong to Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh, were hired by the Indian Army as porters. The youths were picked up by the PLA on September 3 when they were returning to their villages from the LAC.The Chinese had initially feigned ignorance about the missing boys but the PLA later confirmed their presence when the army contacted them through hotline.In March this year also the PLA had picked up a man from Asapila sector in Arunachal Pradesh.

11-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt caused ‘Rs 270 cr loot’ in COVID-19 tests, says BJP||Allowing private laboratories to conduct RT-PCR and antibody tests for the coronavirus outbreak instead of an agency of the Centre by the Maharashtra government had resulted in “loot” of Rs 270 crore due to difference in test rates, BJP leader Pravin Darekar said on Friday.The leader of opposition in the Legislative Council claimed the Centre’s HLL Lifecare Ltd was offering such tests as lower rates but the Uddhav Thackeray government opted for private laboratories, leading to a loss of Rs 270 crore.“This loot must be probed by a retired judge. The Centre’s agency had, on July 7, said it would conduct each RT-PCR test for Rs 1,700. However, at the time, the state government fixed the rate at Rs 1,900-Rs 2,200 for private laboratories. On August 19, the Centre’s agency said it would conduct the RT-PCR test for Rs 795,” Darekar said.“The difference in rates of the Centre’s authorised company and private laboratories was Rs 1,256. Now, if we consider that private laboratories conducted 50 per cent of the total tests in the state, they have conducted 19,34,096 tests so far,” he said.“And people had to pay Rs 1,256 extra for each of the tests. That means people had to shell out Rs 242.92 crore more. Similarly, the HLL Lifecare offered antibody tests at Rs 291 as against the Rs 599 quoted by private laboratories. This difference comes to Rs 27 crore. In all, Rs 270 crore was looted,” he claimed.Darekar said had HLL Lifecare been given the contract for testing, then people headed for the Konkan for Ganpati festivities from Mumbai in late August could have got themselves tested for the virus for Rs 796 instead of Rs 4,500.This would have benefited 15 lakh people, he said.The Maharashtra government had asked those wanting to travel to Konkan within 10 days of the start of the festival to get themselves tested for the infection.He said the state government gave the contract to private entities rather than a Central government one as “they wanted to make money”.

11-09-2020||New Delhi||Hold NLAT, but don’t declare results, SC tells NLSIU||The Supreme Court on Friday allowed National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bangalore, to hold its separate entrance examination NLAT-2020 on Saturday but stopped it from declaring results and admitting students until the issue was finally settled.“It’s an important matter. It’s a matter that needs to be decided,” a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said.The court is seized of a petition filed by former NLSIU Vice Chancellor Prof R Venkata Rao and a parent of a law aspirant challenging the university’s decision to walk out of Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) and to instead opt for a separate entrance test for admission to law courses.Prof Rao contended the decision to go for a separate National Law Aptitude Test (NLAT) will make NLSIU an “island of exclusion” from an “island of excellence”.  He wanted the top court to quash the September 3 decision of the NLSIU, Bangalore, to hold NLAT on September 12.The Bench issued notices to NLSIU and its Vice Chancellor Prof Sudhir Krishnaswamy asking them to respond in three days and posted the matter for further hearing on September 16.The interim order allowing NLAT-2020 was mainly due to the fact that it was scheduled to be held on Saturday and there was not much time left. However, the court said NLAT results can’t be declared and no admissions can take place during pendency of the matter.Terming the decision to conduct a separate test as whimsical, baseless, manifestly arbitrary and illegal, Prof Rao contended that the Present NLSIU Vice-Chancellor did not have the requisite consent from the academic council for it.“The technical requirement of having a laptop and 1 Mbps of internet speed for taking home proctored examination, is onerous, arbitrary, discriminatory and illegal,” the petition submitted. Unlike general universities that admit only those having already completed a three-year B.A., B.Sc. or B.Com. Course, admission to NLUs is open to candidates passing their Class 12 examination, provided they clear CLAT---a feat with a success rate of less than 5 per cent. This year’s CLAT was slated to be held on September 28 but after an August 28 meeting of the consortium of National Law Universities, the NLSIU on September 3 decided to hold its own entrance test---NLAT---on September 12 for which applications have to be made by September 10. The NLSIU said it won’t accept CLAT scores for admissions to its law courses this year.The petitioner submitted the sudden and unilateral decision of NLSIU has created unprecedented uncertainty, fear and confusion among the applicants who have been put to extreme pressure and mental stress.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hold-nlat-but-dont-declare-results-sc-tells-nlsiu-139818
11-09-2020||Hyderabad||Security cover to Kangana based on her father’s request: MoS Home Kishan Reddy||The Y-plus security cover to actress Kangana Ranaut has been provided based on a request from her father to the state government in her native Himachal Pradesh which in turn forwarded it to the Centre, Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy said on Friday.According to Kangana’s father, the actress was responding to social issues which caused “heartburn” to some people in Maharashtra, he told reporters here.Himachal Pradesh Government has asked (for security for her). Kangana Ranaut’s father wrote a letter to the chief minister of Himachal. He had also met the CM and submitted a memorandum that his daughter was being subjected to harassment... based on his request, the Himachal chief minister informed the Centre about the situation, Reddy said.However, when asked, the minister did not clarify who is going to foot the bills for the security—the state government or the actress herself.The Bollywood actor was given Y-plus category security and is protected by about 10 armed commandos round-the-clock after she and some of the Maharashtra politicians indulged in a bitter war of words over the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June and also other issues.The decision to provide the security cover was taken as there were also threats that Ranut would not be allowed to enter Maharashtra as she did not belong to the state.He said the CBI has been probing the death of Sushant Singh as per the Supreme Court’s direction and the Centre has no role in that.Reddy, however, said the Centre will interfere when there was a dispute between two states.There is a necessity to upkeep law and order and also if there are disputes between two states, the Centre will interfere, he added.The minister, who hails from Telangana, also said the Centre has been extending all support to the state government in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic like any other state.He brushed aside allegations that the Centre was turning a Nelson’s eye to Telangana issues.

Arrest him immediately.”    The incident happened in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, during a review meeting being held at the Town Hall when Dr Somlu Naik, a Medical Officer working at Nandendla Primary Healthcare Centre, pointed out the shortage of beds. Kumar lost his cool and ordered Dr Naik’s suspension and arrest. The entire incident was caught on camera. Sources said that the Collector first contradicted the concern raised by Dr Naik by saying, “This was not true.” He asked if the concern was raised before the District Medical Health Officer (DMHO).  When Dr Naik quietly tried to take his seat in the auditorium of the Town Hall, the Collector, who is only heard and cannot be seen in the video, said: “What nonsense. Where is this doctor from? Take him away and arrest him. How dare he asks me – who am I? Arrest him under disaster management sections. Take him away.”   Kumar then directed the DMHO Dr J Yasmin to suspend Dr Naik and directed Nasaraopet DSP Veera Reddy to arrest him right there.The police took Dr Naik to Narasaraopet DSP office and later released him.The DMHO later said: “No disciplinary action has been taken so far as no instruction has come from the Collector’s office.” Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N Chandrababu Naidu’s son Nara Lokesh, who is an MLC, tweeted the video and wrote: “This is Jagan Mohan Reddy government's atrocity on a tribal officer.”“During a review meeting on corona in Narasaraopet in Guntur district, Nadendla medical officer Somlu Naik, who questioned why officers like him were being blamed for the increase in cases without minimum facilities being provided, was arrested. I condemn his brutal arrest. Somlu Naik should be released immediately!" The Andhra Pradesh Government Doctors' Association has also condemned the incident. The association has warned of a strike if arrest orders were not withdrawn and demanded a departmental inquiry into the alleged lapses pointed out by Dr Naik.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/guntur-collector-orders-arrest-of-doctor-for-pointing-out-shortage-of-covid-beds-139815

11-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi: 2 arrested for duping investors of Rs 42,000 cr in 'Bike Boat' ponzi scheme||Two persons have been arrested on the charge of cheating people of approximately Rs 42,000 crore in different states on the pretext of good returns through a ponzi scheme 'Bike Boat', Delhi Police said on Friday.The Economic Offence Wing arrested CMD Sanjay Bhati and Director Rajesh Bhardwaj of M/S Garvit Innovative Promoters Ltd, who induced their victims to invest Rs 62,000 for a two-wheeler for an assured return of Rs 9,500 per month, including the principal amount and rental income on the bike, for one year.They duped a number of people who invested their hard-earned money in this scheme. In January 2019, the company also launched the e-bike scheme, wherein an investment of Rs 1.24 lakh for a motorcycle would get a return of Rs 17,000 per month for one year.The accused initially paid the assured amount to the investors to win their trust, but later defaulted on payments and absconded.Many cases stand registered in Uttar Pradesh and other states on the basis of complaints by their victims. A number of persons had filed police complaints against Bhati, whose company had a registered office at Plot No. 1, Chiti, Dadri, Gautam Buddh Nagar district, Uttar Pradesh."During the course of investigation, we found that approximately 8,000 complainants from Delhi were cheated out of around Rs 250 crore. The Reserve Bank of India had informed us that the said firm was not registered with the apex bank as a NBFC and thus not authorised to collect money from the public," said OP Mishra, Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW).The EOW said that the number of properties worth hundreds of crores of rupees connected to the case were identified and a verification of the same was on. It further said that the Directorate of Enforcement, Lucknow Zonal office, was investigating this case.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-2-arrested-for-duping-investors-of-rs-42-000-cr-in-bike-boat-ponzi-scheme-139804

Children are worst affected as they live with a looming sense of fear and uncertainty and are often deprived of their right to education”.In the statement, which will be included as an official UN compilation, India emphasised that the UNSC needs to factor in the stark reality that non-state parties to armed conflicts have little regard for upholding their obligations under international law.“This creates asymmetric dynamics in the field vis-a-vis the states or the UN peace operations,” the country said, adding that the Council needs to ensure that those who are engaged in the protection of children on its behalf have the necessary resources, pre-deployment and in-mission training to operate and deliver in extremely challenging situations.The country noted with concern that lack of access to schools and treacherous learning environments make children vulnerable to exploitation and recruitment by terrorists and other non-state actors.“Education facilities are often used as vehicles for radicalisation and indoctrination to violent extremist ideologies. Much of these happen in the absence of opportunity for quality formal education for children,” India said.With schools providing a crucial place of learning as well as a social safety net, India said the absence of safe school environments have a multifold impact on protection challenges.These could include young women and girls becoming vulnerable to various forms of subjugation including sexual and gender-based violence, falling victims of forced and child marriages and human trafficking.India also took note of the prevailing situation in the Sahel region of Africa, where attacks on schools are increasing due to the complex regional conflict.India said the challenges in the region call for a greater attention of the Council.

11-09-2020||---||Delhi HC declines stay on Sudarshan TV's 'UPSC Jihad' telecast||New Delhi, September 11The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to stay, at this stage, the telecast of Sudarshan TV's programme "Bindass Bol" on Muslims clearing the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examination.A single judge Bench of Justice Navin Chawla issued notice to the Centre and Sudarshan News over a petition, filed through advocate Shadan Farasat, challenging the central government's decision to allow Sudarshan TV's broadcast on Muslim "infiltration" in government services.Petitioner Syed Mujtaba Athar and some others stated, in their petition, that the order by the Information and Broadcasting Ministry is a "non-speaking order".The plea further states that despite the mandate of law under Sections 5, 19, and 20 of the Cable TV Act and the direction of the court in its order dated August 29, the impugned order fails to make any assessment regarding violation of the Programme Code or Sections 19 or 20 of the Cable TV Act, either with respect to the proposed show or its promo."The assessment has simply been abandoned on a statement of Respondents No 2 (Sudarshan News) and 3 (Editor-in-Chief Suresh Chavhanke) that there is no violation of the Programme Code. There is no independent application of mind to the facts and circumstances of the case," the plea said."Respondent No 1 (Centre) did not even deem it fit to initiate the exercise of assessing the contents of the proposed show... it, even cursorily, did not apply its mind to the facts of the case," the petitioners said, adding that there is no application of mind as to why the promo of the proposed show does not indicate that the proposed show will be in violation of the Programme Code and Section 19 of the Cable TV Act."In sum and substance, the impugned order is a cryptic and non-speaking order and ought to be set aside, with a direction to Respondent No 1 to re-assess whether the proposed show and its promo violates the Programme Code and Section 19 of the Cable TV Act. Furthermore, till such time this reassessment is completed, the broadcast of the proposed show ought to be stayed," the plea read.The programme is part of the "Bindas Bol" series, hosted by Chavhanke. In an order issued Thursday, the Information & Broadcasting Ministry said it cannot pre-censor a programme, or stop it from being telecast."If only, when the programme is telecast and any violation of law is found, action can be taken," the order states.

11-09-2020||New Delhi||Controversial farmers’ law among 23 Bills to be introduced in Monsoon Session||The central government has listed 23 new Bills, including 11 which seek to replace ordinances, for introduction in Parliament’s Monsoon session beginning Monday.One of the ordinances the government plans to pass as a bill during the 18-day-long session relates to providing preventive measures against violence on heathcare personnel.The ordinance makes acts of violence and harassment against healthcare personnel deployed in combating COVID-19 a non-bailable offence with maximum punishment of seven years imprisonment and Rs 5 lakh fine.It also protects the healthcare fraternity, including doctors, nurses and ASHA workers.Another ordinance to be replaced by a Bill relates to reduction in the salary of MPs by 30 per cent for a period of one year beginning April 1, 2020. The amount will be utilised in the fight against coronavirus.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, seeks to replace an ordinance issued recently.The central government introduced three ordinances---the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, and an amendment in the Essential Commodities Act, 1955---in June. The government claims that the ordinance, and now the Bill, aims at providing for the creation of an ecosystem where the farmers and traders enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale and purchase of farmers’ produce which facilitates remunerative prices through competitive alternative trading channels. The ordinances however have been controversial, drawing protests from farmers who fear it would go against their interest. Farmers see the Bill as an attempt to end the Minimum Support Price regime---a policy that aims at establishing a minimum return on their crops to farmers regardless of market fluctuations.The BJP-ruled state of Haryana saw a massive protest being held at Kurushetra’s Pipli grain market against the ordinances on Friday. The protest led to police lathicharge---a development that opposition parties have condemned since. Similar protests were also held against the Bill in Punjab.Also listedAmong the Bills which the government has listed for introduction is the The Jammu and Kashmir Official Language Bill, 2020. As per the bill, Kashmiri, Dogri and Hindi, apart from the existing Urdu and English, will be the official languages in the union territory. It provides for the languages to be used for the official purposes in the union territory.According to a Lok Sabha bulletin, the lower house will also take up discussion and voting on the First Batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for the year 2020-21.It will also take up discussion and voting on the Excess Demands for Grants for the year 2016-17.According to the document, The Multi State Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Bill, 2020 has also been listed for introduction. The proposed bill seeks to rationalise government role and increase the members’ participation in the working of the multi-state cooperative societies, to increase public faith in these societies and create a conducive environment for their growth and development.The Factoring Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020 seeks to permit non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) other than NBFC Factors (whose principal business is factoring) to undertake factoring business as well. It also seeks to permit Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) entities to act as agents for financiers for filing of registration of charge with the central registry as this will lead to operational efficiency.Another Bill listed for introduction is The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation (Amendment) Bill, 2020.The proposed bill aims at complete mechanisation of sewer cleaning and to provide better protection in work, and compensation in case of accidents.

However, there was a push from a section of local party leaders to contest the by-election. The reason to drop the idea was said to be a strategy of not staking party's prestige in the state just for one constituency. The party is still a fledgling outfit, and it should focus on expanding its base."Contesting one assembly seat at the present juncture will not serve party's larger goal. The election will not be contested on principles and ideologies," a senior party leader said here on Friday. Insiders in AAP, however, say in confidence that the party leadership is wary that the contest in Baroda will finally boil down to BJP-JJP and the Congress, which will be led by former Chief Minister BS Hooda.Hooda is considered to be wielding influence, especially in rural areas and the farming community. He also has hold among the farming community.As far as strategies are concerned, JJP's national spokesperson Dinesh Dagar said the plan for the by-election is ready, and will be executed as soon as poll schedule was announced.Hooda will soon visit Baroda. Congress leader have already made several visits.INLD national vice-president Prakash Bharti said party leader and MLA Abhay Chautala has toured the constituency. Party has already touched base with 45 out of about 60 villages in the constituency."The contest will eventually be between Congress and the INLD," Bharti said.The by-election has been necessitated due to demise of sitting Congress MLA Srikishan Hooda. The BJP had stood second in the last Assembly election in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aap-will-not-contest-baroda-assembly-by-election-139783

It is not due to the fear of coronavirus, but due to fear of BJP! Corona is over, but Didi is unnecessarily imposing lockdown across the state to stop BJP from holding meetings and rallies,” Ghosh said.A complete lockdown is on in the state on Friday.The Trinamool Congress mocked Ghosh for his comments and asked him to visit a doctor.“Every day we are witnessing a spike of 3,000 cases in Bengal and more than 95,000 cases in the country. And BJP state president Dilip Ghosh is making a hilarious statement that COVID-19 is gone. I think he should visit a doctor for his treatment,” TMC MP Kalyan Bandopadhyay said.The total number of COVID-19 cases in Bengal now stands at 1,93,175. More than 3700 people have died due to the contagion, including comorbidities.Hooghly district, where Ghosh was addressing the rally, has registered the fifth-highest number of cases in the state.

11-09-2020||New Delhi||87-yr-old running around for 50 years for legitimate dues; HC imposes cost on Defence Department||The Delhi High Court has imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on the Directorate General of Defence Estates (DGDE) which failed to compensate an 87-year-old man whose land in Pathankot was taken by the authorities five decades ago.The High Court said the DGDE certainly cannot take the property of a citizen without paying the due compensation on the “specious ground” of some sanction to be obtained from within the Department.“The petitioner (Mohinder Lal) has clearly been wronged and in fact, needs to be compensated for the same,” Justice Navin Chawla said in the September 7 order.The court also said that Lal had been forced to file this petition and pursue it due to complete apathy shown by the authorities and their inaction.“The petitioner is aged 87 years and even at this age he is being made to run around for his legal and legitimate dues,” it said.The man, represented through advocate Tarun Rana, said that his agricultural land in Punjab's Pathankot area was requisitioned by the DGDE for defence purposes under the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952 through a March 1970 notification.The advocate said the first order to pay compensation was passed by a trial court in Punjab in 1987, then by the Punjab and Haryana High Court and also the Supreme Court. However, no amount was paid to Lal till date.Rana said Lal, a social worker, even at this age was regularly helping needy patients coming to hospitals here. He also helps them financially for their treatment.The man approached the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the authorities to comply with the 2011 order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court and make payment of the compensation due to him along with interest.The amount of compensation to be paid to the man is not yet clear.The DGDE submitted before the High Court that the matter was pending before the Delhi Cantonment office for grant of sanction to make payment of the awarded amount to Lal.It said in the status report that all efforts were being made for making payment to the man and it would be made as and when the sanction was received from the Union Ministry of Defence.The DGDE also raised objection over jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court to hear the matter, which was rejected by the court.“As far as the objection on the jurisdiction is concerned, the same is only stated to be rejected inasmuch as the respondent no. 2 (DGDE) itself admits that the compensation amount has not been paid to the petitioner only because of the want of sanction from the Authorities in Delhi to whom the proposal has been forwarded way back on December 21, 2017 followed with various reminders of the Principal Director, Defence Estates, Western Command, Chandigarh. Therefore, the cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of this court,” said Justice Chawla.Regarding the authorities' submission that the payment shall be made as and when sanction is received from the Defence Ministry, the court said it was “a totally unacceptable justification” of the DGDE as the Supreme Court by its October 2010 order had enhanced the compensation amount to be paid to Lal and the decision of the apex court should have been complied with.“The land of the petitioner was acquired in 1970 and the Supreme Court judgment deciding the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner was passed on October 26, 2010. The petitioner has been forced to file the present petition and pursue the same due to complete apathy shown by the respondents and their inaction...“The respondent no. 2 shall also pay costs of Rs 1(one) lakh to the petitioner for the present petition,” the court said.It also directed the DGDE to pay compensation to the man in accordance with the apex court's verdict within four weeks.

11-09-2020||New Delhi||States obligated to implement Centre’s procedures on Covid: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday said the states were obligated to implement the Centre’s standard operating procedure (SOP) on various aspects of COVID-19 including transporting a suspected or confirmed case.The top court, hearing a PIL filed by organisation ‘Earth’ alleging that exorbitant rates are being charged for ambulances from suspected and confirmed coronavirus patients, however, made clear that states should fix this charge.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan took note of the submissions of Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has already issued the SOP in this regard and all states “will have to implement it”.“It is obligatory for all states to follow the SOP and take appropriate measures with regard to augmenting the capacity of ambulances,” said the bench, also comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah, in the proceedings conducted through video conferencing.The petitioner organisation said the SOP does not cover the pricing aspect of ambulances and this should be fixed as hospitals are charging exorbitantly and arbitrarily.“The state governments will fix reasonable charge and all ambulances will be provided on that charge,” the bench said and disposed of the PIL.The bench, during the hearing, noted that some states were not implementing the SOP and the patients were at the mercy of others and are being charged Rs 7,000 and sometimes up to Rs 50,000 for ambulance services.Earlier, the Central Government on March 29 had laid down the SOP on various issues including for medical staff attending to or transporting a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.The SOP was also meant to guide and train ambulance drivers and technicians in transporting COVID-19 patients.“Ideally, there should be ambulances identified specifically for transporting COVID suspect patients or those who have developed complications, to the health facilities,” the SOP had said.“Currently, there are two types of ambulances — ALS (with ventilators) and BLS (without ventilators). States may empanel other ambulances having basic equipment like that of BLS and use it for COVID patients,” the Health Ministry had said.It had warned against the use of the “102 ambulances” for coronavirus patients and said they should only be used to transport pregnant women and sick infants.The emergency medical technician (EMT), driver of an ambulance must wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling, managing and transporting identified and suspected cases of COVID-19.The patient and the attendant should be provided with triple-layer mask and gloves, the SOP said.

11-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Ram Vilas Paswan backs son Chirag in LJP’s political decisions related to Bihar||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 11Seasoned politician and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, whose son Chirag Paswan is currently engaged in a bitter battle for political space with NDA partner JD-U in the poll-bound Bihar, on Friday said he was strongly backing Chirag’s any decision related to the party in the state.In a set of rather sentimental tweets, Paswan, who also holds the important Ministry of Food and Consumer Affairs in the Narendra Modi government, revealed that despite being ill during the COVID crisis, he refused to be hospitalised because of his responsibilities.Confirming media reports of his ill health, Paswan said his health started to deteriorate but to ensure that the work does not suffer, he did not get hospitalised. “I continuously served the country and made every effort to ensure food reaches on time everywhere,” he said.Paswan said he finally got admitted at a hospital upon Chirag’s insistence. “I am happy that my son Chirag is with me at this time and is doing everything possible to take care of me along with also fulfilling his responsibilities towards the party,” Paswan said.कोरोना संकट के समय खाद्य मंत्री के रूप में निरंतर अपनी सेवा देश को दी और हर सम्भव प्रयास किया कि सभी जगह खाद्य सामग्री समय पर पहुंच सके। इसी दौरान तबियत ख़राब होने लगी लेकिन काम में कोई ढिलाई ना हो इस वजह से अस्पताल नहीं गया। 1/3  मेरी ख़राब तबियत का एहसास जब चिराग को हुआ तो उसके कहने पर मैं अस्पताल गया और अपना इलाज करवाने लगा। मुझे ख़ुशी है कि इस समय मेरा बेटा चिराग मेरे साथ है और मेरी हर सम्भव सेवा कर रहा है। मेरा ख़याल रखने के साथ साथ पार्टी के प्रति भी अपनी ज़िम्मेदारियों को बखूबी निभा रहा है 2/3  मुझे विश्वास है कि अपनी युवा सोच से चिराग पार्टी व बिहार को नयी ऊँचाईयों तक ले जाएगा।चिराग के हर फ़ैसले के साथ मैं मज़बूती से खड़ा हूं। मुझे आशा है कि मैं पूर्ण स्वस्थ होकर जल्द ही अपनों के बीच आऊँगा। 3/3  Backing his son on any call he decides to take for the betterment of the party, Paswan, who is also called the ‘mausam visheshagya’ as far as politics go, said: “I stand firmly with every decision of his. I am confident that with his youthful thinking Chirag will take the party and Bihar to new heights.”Notably, it was at Chirag’s insistence that the LJP had joined hands with the BJP ahead of the 2014 elections and Paswan has said this several times in the past. However, the LJP is now threatening to walk out of Bihar NDA due to Chirag’s differences with Chief Minister and JD-U leader Nitish Kumar, who has also been projected as the face of the alliance by the BJP.A recent meeting of LJP’s Parliamentary Board saw many members expressing resentment against Nitish Kumar’s leadership. Another meeting of the party’s leaders is scheduled for September 15, where a decision on the alliance is expected.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ram-vilas-paswan-backs-son-chirag-in-ljps-political-decisions-related-to-bihar-139767

In a letter written to the states and Union Territories, the Union Health Secretary has emphasised that the availability of adequate and uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen is an important pre-requisite for managing moderate and severe cases of COVID-19,” Centre said as recoveries touched 35,42,663 with 70,880 new recoveries in the past 24 hours.The Health Secretary has urged the states and Union Territories to ensure that no restriction was imposed on the movement of medical oxygen between them. It has been strongly reinforced that it was every state’s responsibility to ensure that every hospitalised COVID patient receives oxygen.Also read: 96,551 fresh cases take coronavirus tally beyond 45 lakhIt has been again brought to their notice that medical oxygen constitutes an Essential Public Health Commodity and any impediment in the supplies of medical oxygen in the country may critically impact the management of patients suffering from COVID-19 disease in other parts of the country. Moreover, some of the major oxygen manufacturers and suppliers already have existing supply agreements with hospitals in various states with a legal obligation to fulfil such agreements.An adequate supply of oxygen throughout the country has enabled effective clinical care of the hospitalised moderate and severe cases, in conjunction with other measures.“The adopted host of strategies have actively resulted in the rising recovery rate and steadily declining case fatality rate (1.67 per cent currently). As on date, less than 3.7 per cent of active patients are on oxygen support,” the Ministry said.Meanwhile, of the 70,880 recoveries reported in the past 24 hours, Maharashtra has alone contributed more than 14,000 and Andhra Pradesh has contributed more than 10,000.With this, the total number of recoveries has touched 35,42,663, taking the recovery rate to 77.65 per cent.Almost 60 per cent of the new recovered cases are being reported from five states —Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.Of the new OVID-19 cases recorded in the past 24 hours, Maharashtra has more than 23,000 and Andhra Pradesh has more than 10,000.Nearly 57 per cent of the new cases are reported from only five states. These are the same states that are also contributing 60 per cent of the new recovered cases.The total number of active cases in the country stands at 9,43,480 as on date. Maharashtra is leading this tally with more than 2,60,000 cases followed by Karnataka with more than 1,00,000 cases.Nearly 74 per cent of the total active cases are in nine most-affected states. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh contribute more than 48 per cent of the total active cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-restrict-supply-of-medical-oxygen-centre-to-states-as-daily-covid-cases-surge-139765
11-09-2020||Bengaluru||Border tension: Former ISRO chief pitches for ramping up India's space assets||Amid tension on the border with China, veteran space scientist G Madhavan Nair on Friday said India should ramp up its space assets and enhance coverage of the region to keep pace with the changing times.In an interview to PTI, he said in almost all areas of security-related activities, the space - earth observation, communication and electronic intelligence, among other things - plays a very major role."The Chinese side, as far as I understand, have multiplied the number of radar imaging satellites, earth observation satellites and communication satellites several fold so that they can have continuous coverage of the globe. So, they will get all kinds of information from their constellation (of satellites),” Nair said."Leave alone the global coverage, at least across the border, India should have a plan to have continuous coverage,” the former chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said.He noted that India had demonstrated its capability by launching satellites in various fields."Now, there has to be a deployment plan for providing continuous coverage. That is very much needed by the country.Certainly there is a need for multiplying the number of satellites, earth stations and so on. So this needs to be attended to," the acclaimed scientist said.Speaking in general terms, Nair, who had also served as secretary in the Department of Space and Chairman of Space Commission, said space would play a significant role in future wars."Whether it's earth observation, electronic intelligence, communications, and also coordinating with various resources like ships, aircraft, drones and all those things, the space will play a very major role,” he observed.Protecting space assets is going to be a big challenge in future.Space technology-wise, India is on par with China, except in the area of human space-flight, he said, but referring to the 'Gaganyaan' venture noted that work on undertaking such manned missions is already on in the country."But Chinese pump in a lot of resources (in the area of space). Their budget is nearly five times more than India's annual space budget,” Nair said."They (China) take an integrated view of civilian and defence requirements," added Nair, during whose tenure of six years (2003-2009) as Chairman, ISRO/Secretary, DOS, 25 successful missions were accomplished.

11-09-2020||Mumbai||Court denies bail to Rhea, Showik, 4 others in drug case linked to Sushant’s death||A special court here on Friday rejected the bail pleas of Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik, arrested by the NCB in connection with a drug-related case pertaining to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, advocate Satish Maneshinde said.The court also rejected the bail pleas of four other accused in the case — Abdul Basit, Zaid Vilatra, Dipesh Sawant and Samuel Miranda.All six accused were likely to move the Bombay High Court for bail, Maneshinde added shortly after the ruling.Special Judge GB Gurao, presiding over cases under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, rejected their bail applications.All accused are currently in judicial custody.Until she gets further relief, Rhea (28), who was arrested on September 8 and sent to judicial custody till September 22, will remain in the Byculla Jail.The other accused, Miranda, home manager of the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, house help Sawant, and two drug peddlers are also in judicial custody.Special public prosecutor Atul Sarpande, appearing for the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), welcomed the decision and said the court, while rejecting the bail pleas, had accepted the contentions of the prosecution that the investigation was at a crucial stage.Rhea’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde said they would decide further course of action after perusing the court order.“Once we get a copy of the order passed by the special NDPS court, we will decide next week on the further course of action and about approaching the Bombay High Court,” Maneshinde told media persons.In the bail plea, Maneshinde forcefully argued that there was nothing on record to suggest that Rhea was in any way involved with the financing of illicit drug traffic or harbouring offenders in relations to any narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.He pointed out to Special Judge GB Gurao that the NCB was silent on the quantum of drugs, the type of drugs allegedly procured and financed by her, the quantum of the narcotics.“The case against her is that she coordinated the delivery of drugs for her boyfriend (Sushant) and occasionally even made the payment for it…These allegations make for an offence that is bailable,” Maneshinde contended.In her bail plea, Rhea had claimed that she was falsely implicated in the case.Rhea had also retracted the confessional statement recorded by the NCB when she was questioned for three days.She had claimed that the NCB officials had coerced her into making self-incriminating statements.Retracting her “self-incriminating confessions”, she termed her arrest as “unwarranted, without any justification,” “arbitrarily curtailed her liberty”, she faced death and rape threats and there were no female officers present during her interrogation, which took place from September 6 to 8, with her arrest coming on the final day.The NCB had strongly opposed the bail pleas and said that Rhea was conscious of the fact that Rajput was consuming drugs but despite that, she continued procuring and making payments for drugs.The NCB had said although the quantity of banned drugs seized in the case was small, it was still a commercial quantity and worth Rs 1,85,200.“Rhea Chakraborty and Showik Chakraborty financed and arranged drugs for Sushant Singh Rajput and at his instructions,” the NCB had said in its affidavit responding to the bail pleas.“It added that as per the statement given by co-accused and Rajput’s domestic help Dipesh Sawant, he used to procure drugs from other accused in the case on the instructions of Rajput and Rhea. The financial transactions were handled by Rhea and sometimes Rajput. Dipesh Sawant used to procure drugs along with co-accused Samuel Miranda (former house manager of Rajput) for Sushant Singh Rajput’s consumption,” the affidavit said.The NCB had further said if the accused are released on bail, they may tamper with evidence and try to intimidate key witnesses in the case.Rejecting the defendants’ plea, Special Judge Gurao rejected their bail applications and all the accused will continue to remain in custody till any relief is granted by the Bombay High Court.The NCB began its investigation after the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which was probing money laundering charges linked to the case, shared the social media chats retrieved from Rhea’s mobile phone, hinting at the use of banned drugs.Rajput was found hanging in his residence in suburban Bandra on June 14.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is separately probing a case against Rhea and others for allegedly abetting the 34-year-old actor’s suicide.

They also reiterated that Pakistan must take “immediate, sustained, and irreversible action” to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist attacks.A joint statement after the seventeenth meeting of the US-India Counter Terrorism Joint Working Group and Designations Dialogue spoke of a “far-reaching conversation” on counterterrorism cooperation but no specifics were available.Concurrently, at the third session of the US-India Designations Dialogue, both sides shared information about their priorities and procedures for pursuing sanctions and designations against terrorist groups and individuals, particularly in light of recent legislative changes in India.Section 15 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) has been considerably amended to widen the definition of a “terrorist act”. It now includes designating individuals who have committed or intend to threaten the country’s integrity, security, economic security or intend to strike terror in the people in India or in any foreign country.The joint statement of the last Counter Terrorism JWG meeting held over a year back had asked Pakistan to take “immediate, sustained, and irreversible action” to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist attacks.The Indian side was led by MEA’s Joint Secretary for Counter Terrorism Mahaveer Singhvi and Nathan Sales from the State Department led their delegation.Both sides also denounced use of terrorist proxies and strongly condemned cross-border terrorism and exchanged views on threats posed by UN-sanctioned terrorist entities and emphasised the need for concerted action against all terrorist networks, including al-Qa’ida, ISIS/Daesh, Lashkar e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, and Hizb-ul Mujahideen. Of them, three are Pakistan-quartered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-ask-pakistan-to-book-pathankot-mumbai-attacks-accused-139752

11-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||NEP will sow seeds for starting a new era, give new direction to 21st-century India: Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 11Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said when India would complete 75 years of Independence in 2022, students should be learning as per the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020.“This is our collective responsibility,” he said, addressing a conclave on ‘School Education in 21st Century’ under the NEP-2020.While seeking to allay reservations regarding the National Education Policy 2020, including on the issue of language, the Prime Minister stated that with the NEP 2020, students would learn under a curricular that is forward-looking and scientifically oriented in order to make the country ready for challenges in the 21st century.“It is a curriculum that focuses on critical thinking, creativity, collaboration and curiosity,” the PM said, adding that students also needed to be aware about coding, artificial intelligence, data science and robotics.While the earlier system was limited, the new policy offers many opportunities.“Students who feel that they want to change their subject at a later stage will have the freedom to do so. Limitations in the current system is the main reason for a large number of drop-outs but under the new system, students will have freedom,” he said.Education was much more than marks and mark-sheets, he said.“‘Marks kitney aye?’ Everything stops at that. But can one test or mark sheets and judge the potential of a student? Marksheets has become ‘pressure sheet’ for students and ‘prestige sheet’ for families,” he said, adding; “There should be many parameters to assessment, including self-assessment and peer-assessment.”“It has to be a holistic report card instead of marks sheet with an assessment of unique potential, attitude, skills, talent, competency and possibilities of a student,” the Prime Minister added.The Prime Minister also said while schools were free to teach any language, the main medium of education till Class V has to be the mother tongue or the local language.“We need to understand that language is a medium of education, language is not education. A student can learn better in a language he or she speaks at home. Till Class V, the medium of education should be local and mother tongue. Any other language can be taught alongside there is no restriction but we have to promote all languages in the country.”The Prime Minister also gave several suggestions on methods, especially practical aspects that can be employed in the new learning process.“The aim is read to learn rather than learn to read, which was being followed till now. Till Class III, all children should have foundational literacy and numeracy,” he said at the two-day conclave on the September 10 and 11 as a part of the Shiksha Parv.Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered the inaugural address at the ‘Conclave on Transformational Reforms in Higher Education under NEP-2020’ on August 7 and also addressed the Governors’ Conference on the NEP-2020 on September 7.The NEP 2020 is the first education policy of the 21st century which was announced after 34 years of the previous National Policy on Education, 1986. It is directed towards major reforms in both school and higher education level.The new National Education Policy aims at making India into an equitable and vibrant knowledge society. It envisions an India-centred education system that contributes directly to transforming India into a Global Superpower, according to officials.The Shikshak Parv is being celebrated from September 8 to 25 to felicitate teachers and to take the National Education Policy 2020 forward. Various webinars, virtual conferences and conclaves on various aspects of National Education Policy 2020 are being organised across the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nep-will-sow-seeds-for-starting-a-new-era-give-new-direction-to-21st-century-india-modi-139749

I told her our party (RPI-A) will be with her, Athawale said after meeting the actress.Athawale said he respects Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and added the latter, who also heads the Sena, could have asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to refrain from undertaking the demolition drive at Ranaut's bungalow.But it did not happen. We think the government, too, is behind it. The Pali Hill office action was taken on the orders of Uddhav Thackeray, he alleged.The minister said Ranaut feels she was insulted by the BMC.She said the BMC could have razed two-three inches of additional construction if it felt there was any. But the BMC demolished furniture inside the office too. She thinks she should get compensation, Athawale added.The minister further said a case should be filed against Shiv Senas mouthpiece Saamana and its executive editor Sanjay Raut for allegedly carrying a story linking Kangana with drugs.Does Saamana have any proof? A case should be filed against 'Saamana' and Raut if they file a story without proof, he added.To a question, Athawale said he will welcome the actress into his partys fold if she wished to join it.Kangana said she is not interested in politics...but if she joins the RPI, I will welcome her 100 per cent. If she joins the BJP, we will welcome the decision 50 per cent, he said.Athawales party had come out in support of the actress and offered her security at the Mumbai airport when she returned to the city on Wednesday amid sloganeering by Shiv Sena workers.

Kadam said the local tehsildars have been instructed to carry out inspection of the villages.These two tehsils have been experiencing low-intensity earthquakes over the last few days. During the intervening night of Friday and Saturday last week, four such quakes had been recorded. One of them was of 4.0 magnitude, officials said.Mittal said that in view of the series of tremors experience of late, big tents have been set up on open grounds in the villages of these two tehsils so that local residents can move in there if they feel unsafe in their houses.Following the last week's tremors, walls of some houses in Dahanu and Talasari had collapsed, while several other houses had developed cracks.According to Mittal, disaster coordination committees have been formed at the village level and the civil defence staff has been asked to remain prepared for assistance."Mock drills will be carried out in the villages to make people aware of the dos and don'ts," she said.Meanwhile, the district authorities released an audio message, asking the villagers in Dahanu region to remain alert as they reside in "earthquake prone" area.Palghar's Dahanu area has been experiencing such tremors since November 2018, with most of them centered around Dundalwadi village.

11-09-2020||New Delhi||India had estimated 6.4 million COVID-19 infections by early May: National serosurvey||The much-awaited findings of the first national serosurvey conducted by the ICMR, published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, indicate that 0.73 per cent adults in India were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 amounting to a total of 6.4 million infections by early May.The survey was conducted from May 11 to June 4 and covered 28,000 individuals whose blood samples were tested for IgG antibodies using COVID Kavach ELISA kit.Also, seropositivity was the highest in the age group of 18-45 years (43.3 per cent), followed by those between 46-60 years (39.5 per cent) and it was the lowest among those aged above 60 (17.2 per cent).It's estimated that there were a total of 64,68,388 adult infections in India by early May, the survey report said."The findings of our survey indicated that the overall seroprevalence in India was low, with less than one per cent of the adult population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by mid-May 2020."The low prevalence observed in most districts indicates that India is in early phase of the epidemic and the majority of the Indian population is still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection," the survey report stressed.It highlighted the need to continue to implement context-specific containment measures including testing of all symptomatics, isolating positive cases and tracing high-risk contacts to slow down transmission and prevent overburdening of the health system.Males living in urban slums and with occupations involving high risk of exposure to potentially infected persons were associated with seropositivity.According to the survey report, seroprevalence ranged between 0.62 and 1.03 per cent across the four strata of districts.The stratification of districts as zero cases (15 districts), low (22 districts), medium (16) and high (17) was done on the basis of the reported number of COVID-19 cases as on April 25.Based on the overall adjusted seroprevalence of 0.73 per cent and reported number of COVID-19 cases, it was estimated that for every RT-PCR confirmed case of COVID-19 there were 82-130 infections in India.As part of the survey, a total of 30,283 households were visited from 700 clusters in 70 districts across the four strata. About one-fourth (25.9 per cent) of the surveyed clusters were from urban areas. A total of 28,000 individuals consented to participate, the report stated.Nearly half (48.5 per cent) of the participants were aged between 18 and 45 and 51.5 per cent (14,390) were females. In all, 18.7 per cent of the participants had an occupation with a high risk of exposure to potentially infected persons.The survey noted that there could be under-detection of COVID-19 cases in the zero stratum districts on account of low testing as well as poor access to testing laboratories.In four of the 15 districts in this stratum, COVID-19 testing laboratories were not available in the district headquarters and the samples were transported to the state headquarters hospitals for diagnosis.The present findings of seropositivity in the strata of districts with zero to low incidence of COVID-19 cases underscores the need to strengthen surveillance and augment the testing of suspected cases in these areas, the survey report said.

Before making absurd allegations against India, where equal rights of people of all faiths are guaranteed by the Constitution, the delegation of Pakistan must do itself a favour of looking at their own system and records of protecting minorities,” Tripathi said.The Indian diplomat emphasised that a culture of peace did not merely signify absence of war but embodied a predisposition towards resolving differences through dialogue and understanding.

11-09-2020||New Delhi||Govt issues revised SOP for conducting exams amid Covid||The government has issued a revised SOP for conducting examinations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, removing the provision that allowed symptomatic candidates who insist on taking an exam to do so in isolation.According to the revised document by the Health Ministry, in regular course, a symptomatic candidate should be referred to the nearest health centre and given an opportunity to undertake the examination through other means, or the university or educational institution shall arrange for taking the exam at a later date when the student is declared physically fit.“However, if a student is found to be symptomatic, the permission or denial thereof, in such cases shall be granted as per the policy already enunciated on the issue by the Examination Conducting Authorities," the revised Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) said.The Ministry had on September 2 issued guidelines as per which staff and examinees from containment zones shall not be permitted to be physically present at exam centres and there will be alternative arrangements for such students.Such students shall be given an opportunity to undertake the examination through other means, or universities and educational institutions shall arrange for taking the exam at a later date for them.According to the SOP, appropriate arrangements for personal protection gears such as face covers or masks, and other logistics such as hand sanitisers, soap, sodium hypochlorite solution etc shall be made available by universities, educational institutions, the examination conducting authorities or examination centres to the staff as well as students as per requirements.“Exam functionary and examinees may also submit self-declaration about health status at the time of entrance to the examination centre. Such self-declaration form may be circulated at the time of issue of admit tickets,” the guidelines said.If any examination functionary or examinee fails to meet the self-declaration criteria, they shall not be allowed entry, the SOP underlined.Also, only asymptomatic staff and students shall be allowed inside the examination hall, the SOP stated, adding wearing face cover or mask is mandatory.The face cover or mask has to be worn at all times inside the examination centre by all, it underlined.Authorities concerned should plan out the examination schedule in a staggered manner so as to avoid overcrowding at any examination centre on any day, the SOP stated.Examination centres in containment zones shall not be allowed to function, it said.For pen and paper-based tests, the SOP outlines that the invigilator will sanitise his or her hands prior to the distribution of question papers or answer sheets and the examinees will also sanitise their hands before receiving or handing back these materials.The collection and packing of the answer sheets at every stage will involve sanitisation of hands. The answer sheets will preferably be opened up after 72 hours have elapsed post collection of papers, the guidelines recommended.“Use of spit/saliva for counting and distributing sheets shall not be allowed,” the SOP stated.The examination centre should have a designated isolation room for isolating any person who is found symptomatic at the time of screening or during the examination, till such time medical advice may be sought.A clear policy on allowing or disallowing symptomatic candidates to undertake examinations shall be delineated by the examination conducting authorities in advance, the SOP stated.

11-09-2020||New Delhi||Rajnath Singh holds high-level meeting on situation in eastern Ladakh||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and top military brass on Friday deliberated on the five-point agreement reached between India and China on de-escalating tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, government sources said.The deliberation was attended by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria and Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh among others, they said.The meeting also carried out a comprehensive review of the security scenario in eastern Ladakh in view of fresh confrontation by two sides in the southern bank of Pangong lake earlier this week, the sources said.“The meeting discussed the agreement reached between the two countries,” said a source.In the meeting, Gen Naravane briefed about the combat readiness of the Army to deal with any eventualities besides elaborating on plans to keep the forces in the high-altitude region during harsh winter months.India and China agreed on a five-point approach that entails further talks to end tensions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) following talks between their Foreign Ministers that saw both of them touch on the linkages between bilateral ties and the border problem.Sources here said the meeting saw the Indian side seeking disengagement in all the friction areas with the military commanders to work out the phasing of final deployment to permanent posts. The Chinese side was also told that its large amassing of troops had created several flash points along the LAC. A joint statement at the end of the two-and-a-half-hour discussion in Moscow between Foreign Ministers S Jaishankar and Wang Yi saw concurrence on the path to resolving the tensions but their narratives diverged on whether the border issue is linked to the overall trajectory of bilateral relations.The Chinese embassy e-mailed a version of the meeting that quoted Wang as saying that India-China ties were once again at a “crossroads”. Wang outlined China’s “stern” position on the situation at the border and called on the Indian side to “move back all men and equipment that have trespassed”. The Chinese side said it was willing to hold “enhanced dialogue” at the field commander level to facilitate the process.It quoted Jaishankar as saying that India “does not consider the development of bilateral relations as dependent on the boundary question and India does not want to go backwards”.  Sources here did not contest this Chinese assertion about Jaishankar. But they contradicted the Chinese quote about Jaishankar indirectly by saying that the recent incidents in eastern Ladakh “have” impacted the development of bilateral relationship. Sources underlined that while India recognised that a final solution would take time, peace on the border was essential for further developing bilateral ties in other spheres.While agreeing on a five-point agenda to improve the current situation on the LAC which “is not in the interest of either side”, Jaishankar and Wang said both sides would continue dialogue at three levels - through the Special Representative mechanism, Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination and field commanders level.The ministers agreed that as the situation eases, the two sides should expedite work to conclude new Confidence Building Measures to maintain and enhance peace and tranquillity in the border areas.The interaction held on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting agreed not to allow differences to become disputes by following all the existing agreements and protocol on China-India boundary affairs, maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas and avoid any action that could escalate matters. Jaishankar’s interaction followed another one held last week between Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his Chinese counterpart, also in Moscow, where both ministers set out their respective positions on restoring normalcy on the LAC.Earlier on Thursday, Jaishankar and Wang participated in two multilateral interactions in which bilateral disputes were not discussed. The main show for which Jaishankar had gone to Moscow—the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation—was held in the morning.The Foreign Ministers held in-person talks after three rounds of virtual meetings of the working mechanism on the border and several army commander-level meetings failed to stem a series of aggressive actions that culminated in shots being fired at the LAC for the first time in 45 years.

They have appealed against the decision highlighting what they call as unjust testing parameters and sought some relaxations to bring them at par with their younger counterparts.In due course, this selection board, called SB-5 in military parlance, and its associated physical parameters include those who completed 10 years of service. However, since there was no provision for grant of permanent commission to women SSC officers, they were never made part of such a selection process.Recruitment Process raises new questionsThe physical parameters for the women SSC officers, who have completed 14 years of service and those with 10-year service, are same.

11-09-2020||New Delhi||Consider waiving interest on interest: SC||The Supreme Court today gave two weeks to the Centre, RBI and banks to put their heads together and chalk out sector-specific schemes with regard to loan restructuring, charging of interest on interest and related issues.A Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, which had earlier directed that accounts not declared NPA till August 31 shall not to be declared NPA till further orders, wanted the Centre to consider not charging interest on interest on deferred EMIs during the moratorium. “On the interest issue, we are yet to take a decision. But on the aspect of interest on interest, we are inclined to pass an order that it may not be debited,” the Bench said, but chose not to issue such a direction.For relief during moratoriumThe Bench, however, made it clear that its interim order with regard to NPAs shall continue. It also wanted the Centre and the RBI to place on record all decisions taken by them on this.The top court posted the matter for further hearing on September 28 after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said an expert committee had been set up to take decisions on the issue of moratorium extension, interest on interest during moratorium and other related issues. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/consider-waiving-interest-on-interest-sc-139199
