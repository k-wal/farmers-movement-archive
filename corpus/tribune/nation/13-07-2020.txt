13-07-2020||London||Indian newspapers from 1966 recovered from melting French glacier||Indian newspaper copies with headlines such as “India’s First Woman Prime Minister”, referring to Indira Gandhi’s election win in 1966, have been recovered from the melting French glacier of Bossons on the Mont Blanc mountain range in western Europe, 54 years after an Air India plane crashed there.The newspapers belong to the residue of an Air India plane that crashed into Europe’s highest mountain on January 24, 1966, and were discovered by Timothée Mottin, who runs the cafe-restaurant La Cabane du Cerro at an altitude of 1,350 metres above the French resort of Chamonix.“They are drying now but they are in very good condition. You can read them,” Mottin, 33, told the local French daily ‘Le Daupine Libere’, quoted by The Guardian newspaper and other agencies in the UK.“It’s not unusual. Every time we walk on the glacier with friends, we find remains of the crash. With experience, you know where they are. They are being carried along by the glacier according to their size,” he said.The Air India Boeing 707 had crashed into the range after a verbal flight control miscommunication, leading to the loss of all 177 passengers and crew.Copies of the “National Herald” and “Economic Times” are among a dozen newspapers discovered by Mottin, whose cafe is about 45 minutes by foot from the Bossons glacier, where the plane named after the Himalayan peak of Kangchenjunga mysteriously crashed over 54 years ago.Mottin said he was lucky to discover the papers when he did because the ice in which they had been encased for nearly six decades had probably only just melted. Once the papers have dried out, they will join a growing collection of items from the crash that Mottin has put on display at his cafe to share it with visitors.Since 2012, there have been a number of finds relating to the 1966 Air India crash emerging from the melting ice caps.In 2012, a bag of diplomatic mail, stamped “On Indian Government Service, Diplomatic Mail, Ministry of External Affairs”, was recovered, while a year later a French climber found a metal box containing the Air India logo containing emeralds, sapphires and rubies worth between GBP 117,000 and GBP 230,000.Human remains found in the area in 2017 are also believed to come from the 1966 crash or that of another Indian plane, the Malabar Princess, that came down in the area in 1950.

13-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt allows restro-bars, clubs to sell beer stock expiring by July 31 to liquor shops||The Delhi Government has allowed the restro-bars, hotels and clubs in the city to sell their stock of beer expiring by July 31 to liquor shops, according to an official.This is the third time the government has given relief to the owners of these establishments.Bars in hotels, clubs and restaurants have not been allowed to open since March 25, when the nationwide lockdown was announced.The official said that it is aimed at minimising financial losses of such establishments.The shelf life of beer in Delhi is around six months.In an order issued last week, the excise department said hotels, restro-bars and clubs are allowed to sell the stock of beer expiring by July 31 to liquor shops.Hotels, clubs and restaurants licensees will prepare an inventory of all beer stock with barcode, which is to be transferred at licensed vendors, the excise department said.“The licensee from hotels, clubs and restaurants shall then submit the barcode list of beer stock and consent letter obtained from licensed vend to excise department with the request for allowing transfer of beer stock,” it added.The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) has welcomed the government’s move.“We welcome the decision of the Delhi government to allow bars to sell beer that is getting old. This is what we had recommended to the government in May. Hospitality sector is under great stress and this may help recover some investment stuck in stock,” CIABC director general Vinod Giri said.He said the government should allow the same for liquor also and added that a large amount of investment is sitting idle in liquor stock and in the current situation the hospitality sector needs relief to survive.On June 11, the Delhi Government had issued an order allowing such establishments to sell their stock of beer expiring by June 30 to liquor shops in a bid to minimise their losses due to the lockdown.In an order dated June 26, it had allowed them to sell beer stock expiring by July 15.

13-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Suspended AAP councillor used rioters as ‘human weapons’, says court||Suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain allegedly used rioters as “human weapons”, who on his instigation could have killed anybody, a Delhi court said on Monday while dismissing his bail plea in the murder case of IB official Ankit Sharma during the communal violence in north east Delhi.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said a “powerful person” like Hussain can threaten witnesses in the case if enlarged on bail.“At this stage, I find that there is enough material on record to presume that the applicant was very well present at the spot of crime and was exhorting the rioters of a particular community and as such, he did not use his hands and fists, but rioters as ‘human weapons’, who on his instigation could have killed anybody.“In this case, it is apparent that witnesses, whose statements have been recorded are residents of the same locality and they can easily be threatened by a powerful person like the applicant (Hussain),” the judge said in his order.The judge, however, clarified that anything stated in the order was based upon “prima analysis of material available on record at this stage which is yet to be tested on the touchstone of trial”.The Delhi Police had, in its charge sheet filed in the case, alleged there was a deep rooted conspiracy behind Sharma’s murder as he was specifically targeted by a mob led by Hussain.The charge sheet said autopsy had revealed that there were 51 sharp injuries on his body and the way Sharma was killed by the cold blooded rioters has shaken the social fabric of the society and instilled a fear in the minds of the residents of the area.The court, in its Monday’s order, said it was a matter of record that the investigation in the matter was still under progress as some other persons have to be apprehended.It further noted that two persons have stated in their statements to the Crime Branch, about the conspiracy of communal riots allegedly being hatched at the residence of Hussain on February 24.The court said that even if there was no video footage or CCTV footage showing Hussain’s presence at the spot, there was enough ocular evidence available on record which prima facie established he was present at the place of the incident.“I find that the riots in the area of north-east Delhi were carried out in an organised manner and as part of deep-rooted conspiracy and the involvement of applicant is being investigated upon with regard to his connection with members of PFI (Popular Front of India), Pinjratod, Jamia Co-ordination Committee, United Against Hate Group and anti-CAA protesters. That is, however, subject matter of another FIR as well as the proceedings being conducted by Enforcement Directorate (ED),” the judge said.During the hearing held through video conferencing, senior advocate K K Manan and advocate Uditi Bali, appearing for Hussain, claimed there was no cogent evidence which is admissible in the eyes of law, to connect him in the killing of Sharma.“There was delay in recording the statements of the witnesses. There is no evidence by way of video footage or CCTV footage to prove that Hussain was present at the scene of crime at the time of incident,” the counsel said.They further alleged that on February 25, he was not present at or around the scene of crime and his alleged presence stated by the witnesses was false.He was rescued on the intervening night of February 24/25, by the police force itself and was taken to his parental house at Mustafabad and he did not return at the scene of crime.Special Public Prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary, appearing for the state, opposed the bail application saying that witnesses in the case have alleged that on Hussain’s instigation the rioters had killed Sharma.The riots in the area of north-east Delhi were part of large scale conspiracy hatched at various levels all over Delhi in the aftermath of enactment of Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 on December 11, last year, the counsel said.He further claimed that the police had recorded statements of at least 13 witnesses, who have clearly identified Hussain at the scene of crime, allegedly instigating the rioters of a particular community and exhorting them to kill the people of other community.Hussain had allegedly provided logistic support like lathis, dandas, stones, acid bottles, knives, swords, fire arms to the rioters at the roof of his house itself, the public prosecutor claimed.“In my considered opinion, the statements of witnesses can be said to be delayed when the witnesses are known to the police and yet police do not record their statements; whereas, in a case of rioting, police hardly have any idea as to who the witnesses were. Further, people normally do not come forward and it is an admitted position on record that on the date of incident nearly 10,000 PCR calls were recorded in the area of Police Station Dayalpur.“Thereafter, on the basis of these calls, police reverted back and traced out some of the witnesses. Therefore, at this stage, it cannot be said that there is delay in recording of statements of witnesses by the investigating agency,” the judge said.The dead body was fished out the next day in the morning. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-suspended-aap-councillor-used-rioters-as-human-weapons-says-court-112431
13-07-2020||Hyderabad||Doctor drives a tractor to carry COVID-19 victim’s body for burial||Humanity has no limits, and the extraordinary action by Dr Pendyala Srinivasa Sriram from the Peddapalli Government Hospital in Telangana showed just that. When no one was willing to touch the body of a COVID-19 victim, the doctor volunteered to ride a tractor and ferried the dead body loaded in the trolley to the graveyard.This action at a time when officials are being accused of disrespecting the dead and dumping bodies in mass graves has been widely acclaimed across the state after the pictures of the doctor riding the tractor went viral.Dr Sriram who works with TB hospital, Sultanabad, was appointed as District Surveillance Officer for Covid-19 and was on duty when he found that the relatives of the 45-year-old patient who had succumbed to the virus were begging ambulance drivers to take the body to the burial ground. But fearing infection, none was willing to oblige. It is then that the doctor adorned a Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kit and offered to help.After repeated requests, the Peddapalli municipal staff arranged a tractor, but the driver of the tractor refused to go to drive the tractor to the burial fearing COVID-19 transmission. Even relatives of the family reportedly stayed away from assisting in the funeral. When Dr Sriram took to the wheels four family members accompanied him.With the doctor turning driver, the family of the deceased was finally able to complete the last rites in line with COVID-19 standard operating procedures (SOP) in proper safety gear.Talking to the media Dr Sriram said, “There are fears and lack of knowledge about the disease and its spread. Even the tractor driver was scared. I just wanted to set an example and show that there is nothing to fear. But when handled with proper Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), the virus spread can be arrested. The body was also disinfected before it was packed in the body bag. I drove the body to the burial ground so that our staff will also take it up without fear if such a situation arises even in my absence.”He said that there was an urgent need to spread awareness that the dead body of the COVID-19 victim is disinfected and packed eliminating the chances of infection unless someone fiddles with the packing. The doctor said his action was being circulated on social media he would like to appeal to the people saying, “Doctors and other frontline workers are fighting the virus relentlessly. Please don’t come out unnecessarily, if you do go out don’t touch anything that is not yours.”Dr Pramod Kumar, Peddapalli District Health and Medical Officer (DMHO) while appreciating the gesture of Dr Sriram said “As it was the first case of death in the district headquarters, there was a little delay in designating an ambulance to transport the body. We have engaged ambulances in the district to ferry and discharge patients.”Meanwhile, another leader of the opposition Congress party in Telangana died of Coronavirus today. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) secretary G. Narendra Yadav succumbed to the virus at a private hospital in Hyderabad, where he was admitted a few days ago. Yadav had recently participated in various programmes to distribute aid among poor hit hard by the lockdown."It is shocking and saddening that one of our active senior leaders Narendra Yadav died due to COVID-19. May his soul rest in peace and condolences to his family and friends... His death is a great loss to the party," tweeted party spokesman Dr Sravan Dasoju. Yadav is the second party leader to die of COVID-19 in a week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doctor-drives-a-tractor-to-carry-covid-19-victims-body-for-burial-112430

13-07-2020||Kanpur||Kanpur ambush: UP police to request court to release wife of Vikas Dubey’s aide||The Uttar Pradesh Police will request the court to release wife of slain criminal Amar Dubey, an associate of gangster Vikas Dubey, in the absence of sufficient evidence against her in connection with the death of eight policemen in Bikru village, a police spokesperson said on Monday.  The investigation officer (IO) has been asked to file a closure report before the concerned court here at the earliest and ensure her early release, he said. The IO has also been asked to take help of senior prosecution officers for filing the closure report against Khushi Dubey, wife of Amar Dubey, the spokesperson said.Khushi was arrested after her husband was killed in an encounter with the police in Hamirpur district on July 8 over his alleged involvement in the ambush in Bikru village.  The couple reportedly got married just a week before the infamous ambush. Meanwhile, Bithoor Station Officer (SO), Kaushalendra Pratap Singh, who had sustained two bullet injuries during the ambush, appeared before the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on Monday and recorded his statement. The SIT is headed by Additional Chief Secretary Sanjay Bhoosreddy. He told the SIT that he got a call from the then SO Chaubeypur Police Station, Vinay Tiwari on the intervening night of July 2 and 3 following which he along with his sub-inspectors and around 10 constables went to Bikru village to arrest the dreaded history-sheeter, Vikas Dubey. According to an official pleading anonymity, Singh told the SIT that the police team, which had gone to arrest Vikas Dubey, was headed by Circle Officer (Billahur) and comprised about three dozen police personnel.The Bithoor station officer also informed the SIT that police vehicles were left about one kilometre away from the ambush site and the policemen walked on foot.   The SO elaborated that as soon as they crossed the earthmover which was deliberately parked to block the path of the policemen, they fell to a shower of bullets (around 20 to 25 rounds), the official said.Singh said the policemen who were without weapons tried to hide, while he and others who had weapons took their position.He told the SIT that he sat against a wall with two other policemen and fired four to five rounds, but the assailants had stationed themselves at a height and were far away from his range of vision. The criminals were firing from the rooftops, he said.Singh said he struggled after being hit by two bullet shots, adding that constable Ajay Sengar informed him that he was shot in his stomach, while another constable was shot in the hand.He said he somehow managed to take his colleagues away from the spot through a dilapidated house which had a broken door, the official said.Singh also apprised the SIT that when they reached Bikru village, it was not dark. Street lights were on which proved to be a drawback as the assailants on the rooftops took their positions. There was a power outage later, he said.The Bithoor station officer also noted that SO (Chaubeypur) Vinay Tiwari, who has been sent to jail on charges of criminal conspiracy, was with his team when the police party reached Bikru village. He said Tiwari, however, lagged behind after other policemen crossed the earthmover parked to block their path.The SIT team visited the Shivli Police Station in Kanpur Dehat late Sunday evening to collect details about the murder of minister of state Santosh Shukla. Shukla was killed inside the police station in 2001 and Vikas Dubey was an accused in the case. Additional DG Hariram Sharma and Deputy IG J Ravindra Gour, who are part of the SIT, examined the action taken by the police in this case. They also tried to explore how Vikas Dubey or someone from his family headed the Bikru panchayat for the past 25 years.The SIT team was also curious to know how despite being in jail on murder charges, Vikas Dubey won the zila panchayat election from Ghimau, under which Bikru village falls, in 2000 after serving as the village head for two terms, officials said. The three-member SIT has been constituted by the state government to probe the Kanpur incident, including the alleged laxity and involvement of local police with slain gangster Vikas Dubey. It will submit its report by July 31.On July 3, eight police personnel, including a DSP, were gunned down in Bikru village by the henchmen of Vikas Dubey.Seven others, including a civilian, were injured in the attack from a rooftop after the police team entered the village past July 2 midnight to arrest the gangster.          Vikas Dubey was killed in an encounter on July 10 after police claimed that he tried to escape from the spot in Bhauti area where the vehicle carrying him from Ujjain to Kanpur met with an accident.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kanpur-ambush-up-police-to-request-court-to-release-wife-of-vikas-dubeys-aide-112423
13-07-2020||Sumedha Sharma||Gurugram catches fancy of Covid drug black marketeers||Tribune news serviceGurugram, July 13Owing to the shortage of Covid treatment drugs like Remdesivir in Delhi and other cities of NCR, Gurugram has caught attention of black marketeers.Gurugram so far is only city in NCR that has ensuredconsistent supply of drugs to critical Covid patients at MRP. Taking an advantage of the same many fraudulent agents after procuring the drugs from city are out selling them at ten times the price in Delhi and NCR areas like Noida.Priced at Rs 5,400 a vial, Remdesivir is being sold at as high as Rs 30,000 at vial by black marketeers who are reportedly sourcing the same from Gurugram.Already on high alert, the local drug department has barred dispensing of drugs to any non-IPD patient by city hospitals.“From day one we ensured that the drug is procured on direct company-to-hospital basis and it cannot be sold or bought over the counter from chemists. We have stringently ensured compliance of capped price. Every evening the hospitals submit the available stock and injections used and report to us so that we can keep tabs on the consumption. Gurugram, as of now,has no shortage, but following reports of people and agents trying to procure the same from hospitals through fraudulent prescriptions we have stepped up vigilance. The Covid hospitals have been restricted onprescriptions and dispensing of the drugs only to the IPD patients admitted to their facilities. The drugs are then procured by the hospital and not patient,” said Drug Controller Amandeep Chauhan.According to Chauhan, the drug is used in critical Covid patient management and thus is required by IPD patients only and as per protocol is directly procured by hospital.“There is seamless procurement in the city so far with no reported shortage or waiting period. To keep things going we need to keep a check on any black marketeering attempt,” he said.Though the city has enough stock, the alarm has been sounded on active black marketeers trying to procure Remdesivir, Favipiravir and Tocilizumab. The social media groups are full of requests of people seeking drugs and agents advertising the provision of same in not just NCR but across the country.Such social media posts have put cyber crime branch of police also on alert. The crisis, according to doctors, has risen owing to massive demand and supply gap.The demand for Remdesivir soared as it managed to cut the duration of Covid symptoms from 15 days down to 11 in clinical trial at hospitals around the world. Though there is no corroboration to prove its absolute effectiveness, in the absence ofany proven drug doctors are increasingly prescribing it in India creating huge demand.US-based Gilead Sciences, which originally developed Remdesivir to treat Ebola, has allowed four Indian companies -- Cipla, Jubilant Life, Hetero Drugs and Mylon -- to produce it. However, only Hetero has produced the drug so far.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gurugram-catches-fancy-of-covid-drug-black-marketeers-112422
13-07-2020||K V Prasad||The political tug-of-war in Rajasthan||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 13For the time being, the political storm building up in the desert state of Rajasthan blew away. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot held his fort with the legislature party backing the veteran Congress leader in this time of crisis.Gehlot, known as ‘Jadugar’ for having learnt the art of magic, demonstrated that majority of the legislators remained on his side, with three Central Observers, including Rahul Gandhi’s confidant K C Venugopal, pointsman on tricky missions Ajay Maken and Chief Spokespersons Randeep Surejwala, watching over the proceedings.The political tug-of-war between the Chief Minister and his young deputy Sachin Pilot was the worst kept secret in the Congress. Eager to be at the helm, the young Pilot kept making moves to push the envelope since the assembly results were out two years ago.Flapping his wing in order to create space for himself in the landscape dotted by Gehlot and his loyalists, the ambitious Sachin Pilot remained in a unique position of being the Deputy Chief Minister and Pradesh Congress chief, a post he holds for six years.While his hard work in the field did play a role in re-building the fortunes of the party in Rajasthan where it lost power in 2013, the veteran Gehlot demonstrated he was no pushover when the results were out in 2018 bringing the party back to power.It is easy to characterise the tussle as old guard versus the young leaders and will resurface sooner than later. One on hand Pilot holds a grouse that Gehlot has pushed him to the margins and virtually ignoring him and on the other, the young politician feels that it is time he steers the state.The underlying reason for what is playing out in Rajasthan, earlier in Madhya Pradesh or recently in Manipur, is the weak presence of the party central leadership.Ever since Rahul Gandhi walked away from presidentship after the 2019 Lok Sabha debacle, Sonia Gandhi remains an interim president. Decision appear ad-hoc or taken on the need basis.The writ of what was euphemistically described in the Congress as ‘High Command’  does not run and given the domineering presence of the BJP as a national political party, the Grand Old Party looks but a pale shadow of an organisation to tackle any internal and external challenge.As Chief Minister Gehlot demonstrates his hold, the young Pilot would require more dexterous walk on the political minefield for after this attempt to destablise the government, he renders himself vulnerable and open to greater suspicion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/the-political-tug-of-war-in-rajasthan-112418
13-07-2020||New Delhi||NIA arrests two persons from Pune in ISKP case||The anti-terror probe agency NIA said on Monday that the agency’s teams carried out searches in Pune and arrested two accused persons in connection with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) Case, for their alleged involvement in “propagating ISIS ideology and spreading its activities” in India.Officials in the agency said, 27-year-old Nabeel S Khatri, a resident of Khondwa in Pune and 22-year-old Sadiya Anwar Sheikh, a resident of Phulenagar area of the city were arrested following raids conducted by the NIA sleuths.

They were also found to be in touch with Abdullah Basith, who is already lodged in Tihar jail in another NIA case (ISIS Abu Dabhi module), the officials said.Further investigations into the case revealed that accused Sadiya Sheikh was continuously in touch with Sami, Beigh and Basith on various secure messaging applications and deliberating on “as to how to propagate the ideology of ISIS and further its activities in India”, the NIA officials said, while alleging that that they were trying “to build up a cadre of ISIS in India by recruiting gullible youth for terrorist activities”.“It has also come to light that along with Sami and Basith, accused Khatri was also actively involved in the planning to carry out violent terrorist attacks in India by arranging logistic support such as procurement of weapons, fake SIM cards, assembling of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) etc. to further the activities of ISIS in India,” the agency said.“It has also been revealed that Sadiya Sheikh was in contact with ISIS recruiters through social media since 2015. She was planning to execute a terrorist attack in Jammu & Kashmir and was detained by J&K Police in 2018,” the NIA said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-arrests-two-persons-from-pune-in-iskp-case-112415

The mountain spurs in the area are referred to as Fingers.The formal process of disengagement of troops began last Monday after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi the previous day.On Friday, India and China held another round of diplomatic talks during which both sides resolved to push ahead with “complete disengagement” of troops in eastern Ladakh in a timely manner for “full restoration” of peace and tranquility.At the meeting, it was decided that senior commanders of the two armies will meet “soon” to discuss further steps to “ensure complete disengagement and de-escalation”.The two countries have already held three rounds of Lt General-level talks and the last one took place on June 30 during which both sides agreed on an “expeditious, phased and step wise” de-escalation as a “priority” to end the standoff.The first round of the Lt General talks was held on June 6 during which both sides finalised an agreement to disengage gradually from all the standoff points beginning with Galwan Valley. However, the situation deteriorated following the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the LAC.The second round of talks took place on June 22.The Indian and Chinese armies were locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for over eight weeks since May 5.The tension escalated manifold after the violent clashes in Galwan Valley in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed.The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.Tensions had escalated in eastern Ladakh around two months back after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.

13-07-2020||New Delhi||2016 Mathura clash: Wife of slain police officer moves SC for investigation||The wife of a police officer who was killed in a clash with the squatters at Jawahar Bagh in Mathura in 2016 has moved the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Central Bureau of Investigation to constitute a team to investigate the incident within two months.More than 20 people, including two police officials, were killed during a drive to evict squatters at Jawahar Bagh.The plea filed by Archana Dwivedi, wife of Superintendent Police (city) Mukul Dwivedi, who was killed during clashes in Mathura on June 2, 2016, said that on March 2, 2017, the Allahabad High Court directed CBI to constitute two teams to complete the investigation within two months but 40 months have passed and yet the “powerful politicians and top officials of the state” have not been interrogated.The Uttar Pradesh government had, in January 2014, granted permission to Ram Vriksha Yadav’s organisation Azad Bharat Vidhik Vaicharik to hold a demonstration at the ground for two days.However, members of the organisation, which claims allegiance to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, went on to occupy the sprawling public park for more than two years.Following a high court order, the squatters were evicted from the park amid large-scale violence.The plea, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, has sought directions to CBI to constitute a team comprising of adequate number of officers to investigate the incident dated June 2, 2016, within two months, in which Dwivedi along with SHO Farah, Santosh Yadav and others were killed.“No punitive action has been taken against the then DM and SSP Mathura who intentionally asked petitioner’s husband to take action to vacate the park with unarmed policemen.”“Petitioner finds a larger conspiracy and believes that truth will remain buried unless the Court passes appropriate orders in this matter. There appears to be a huge pressure on CBI to protect delinquent politicians and top officers,” the plea said.It has also sought directions to the UP government to give access to all relevant records available in order to enable the CBI to undertake an in-depth investigation and identify persons responsible for dereliction of duty and stalling action by the Mathura district administration.The petition alleged that Yadav and his associates had political and bureaucratic patronage and there is bleak chance of a fair and complete investigation.“Petitioner’s husband was under tremendous pressure due to political-cult nexus and higher authorities. He was not eating properly in the last few days before he was brutally killed. On one hand, he was given the responsibility of vacating Jawahar Bagh and on the other, senior officers prevented him from taking strict action.”“Under mysterious circumstances, he was ordered to get the boundary wall of Jawahar Bagh broken a day prior to the scheduled operation. He was accompanied by only a few newly-recruited policemen, armed with only lathis. The senior officers did not permit firearms due to which his armed gunmen, escort party, and even his service revolver was not with him. This is very suggestive of a larger criminal conspiracy,” the plea said.The wife of slain officer alleged that no punitive action or suspension has been taken against the higher authorities accountable for this gigantic violence and even after 40 months, CBI has not examined the call details of  Yadav and his associates till date.“It appears that forensic investigations, such as DNA tests, were not conducted, so it is unclear whether the main accused Ram Briksh Yadav is dead or alive. Neither his nor his close associate’s phone call details were examined.         “There are more than two dozen cases against Ram Briksh Yadav in Mathura only and many other cases are pending in other districts throughout the State. There were more than 80 intelligence reports against the criminals but police was not permitted to take appropriate steps to vacate the park,” it said.

The man was also given a rose stem, a memento, and a COVID-19 free certificate as he boarded an ambulance for home, the official said.He has been advised another seven days of home isolation.A total of 147 patients have been admitted to the COVID centre till now, the official said.It has two segments—a COVID Care Centre (CCC), where asymptomatic positive coronavirus cases will be treated, and a Dedicated COVID Health Care (DCHC), which will treat symptomatic cases and have an oxygen support system.  As per the scheme, the CCC will have 90 per cent beds while the DCHC will have the rest 10 per cent beds.The border guarding force had taken over the centre after being directed by the Union Home Ministry to act as the nodal agency.A team of over 1,000 doctors, nurses and paramedic staff of the ITBP and other paramilitary forces have been earmarked to work at the facility.One thousand more ancillary and security staff have been deployed in shifts at the facility. The centre also has about 75 ambulances.The total bed capacity at this centre can be ramped up to 10,200. The centre is 1,700 feet long and 700 feet wide—roughly the size of 20 football fields—and has 200 enclosures with 50 beds each.Officials have said this is the largest COVID-19 care centre in the national capital as well as in the country.The south Delhi district administration is providing administrative support to the centre apart from the volunteers of the Radha Soami Beas.The ITBP was the first organisation in the country to have created a 1,000-bed quarantine centre for coronavirus affected people.The centre in Chhawla area of south-west Delhi has treated about 1,200 people, including 42 foreigners who were brought to India on special evacuation flights from Wuhan in China and Italy, after the COVID-19 outbreak a few months back.It also created the first standard operating procedures for management of the pandemic among the various CAPFs and central and state police organisations.The about 90,000 personnel-strong force is primarily tasked to guard the 3,488 km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.

They had objected since the “land levelled” was “public” in nature pending a civil dispute.Eventually, arguments led to a clash causing some injuries to people from both groups and a bystander, identified later as G Srinivasan.Police had said three cases were registered under various sections of the IPC and the Arms Act.One was based on a complaint by R Lakshmipathi, father of the MLA against Kumar and another following a plaint by the realtor against Idhayavarman and 12 others.One more case was filed based on a plea by Srinivasan, who allegedly sustained an injury when the legislator opened fire.Senior AIADMK leader and Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar, reacting to the MLA’s arrest had alleged that the incident showed that the DMK has gone towards gun culture.Also, the minister had alleged that the unruly behaviour has become the practice of DMK men and that the party “is synonymous with a culture of violence”.

13-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi HC may hear plea against ban on social media use by soldiers||The Delhi High Court may on Tuesday hear a top army officer’s plea against the order banning use of social networking platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, by the army personnel.The petition, filed by Lieutenant Colonel PK Choudhary through advocates Shivank Pratap Singh and Sanandika Pratap Singh, has sought the court’s direction to the Director General of Military Intelligence (DGMI) for withdrawal of the order.The DGMI ordered the army personnel to delete their accounts from social networking platforms and had banned use of 89 apps and websites by all army personnel.“The soldiers rely on social networking platforms, like Facebook, to address issues arising in their families while posted in remote locations. They often use the virtual connect to compensate for the physical distance between them and their families,” the plea said.Soldiers serve in remote areas, extreme weather conditions and difficult terrain with the lingering threat of an enemy attack all the time. All that take a toll on soldiers’ physical and mental health, it added.“With the advent of internet, particularly high-speed internet connectivity over mobile networks, soldiers found an effective way to come closer to their friends, family and loved ones in the virtual world. This greatly eased the stress suffered on a daily basis due to the harsh service conditions,” the plea said.The petitioner said the provisions pertaining to ban on use of social networking platforms and the direction to delete accounts violated Fundamental Rights under the Constitution, including the right to freedom of speech and expression and the right to privacy.Websites and apps, like Facebook and Instagram, had become more popular modes of communication, and India accounted for the largest number of Facebook users in the world, it said.“The policy to the extent that it bans use of various social networking platforms by soldiers and directs soldiers to delete their accounts on Facebook, is illegal, arbitrary, disproportionate and violates the Fundamental Rights of soldiers,” the petitioner said.The DGMI, it said, had cited security concerns and risks of data breach as the basis of imposing restrictions regarding usage of social media platforms.“The purported concerns and risks highlighted in the policy are not limited to being applicable to only soldiers. There are several members of the civil administration and political class, who possess information of a much higher level of sensitivity than a regular soldier and no restrictions apply them,” the petition said.Therefore, the act of banning usage and directing deletion of accounts of soldiers from social networking platforms was a clear violation of Article 14 of the Constitution, it added.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hc-may-hear-plea-against-ban-on-social-media-use-by-soldiers-112406

The family has alleged that the girl was murdered and raped. The matter was taken up immediately. Police contacted the school management and gathered information from the spot,” Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Ranvijay Singh said.“It came to light that the girl killed herself on July 3 and left behind a suicide note. She clearly wrote in it that nobody, including the school, is responsible for her suicide. She also wrote about her family and some problems they faced,” Singh said.He added that the police have reached out to the girl’s kin and shared the information with them. If they still have any grievance, they can approach police, he said.“If there is any evidence of foul play, the family can give it to the police. The matter will be probed and strict action will be taken against the guilty,” the additional DCP said.The family has claimed that their three children studied in the school. Two girls on the same campus in Sector 115 of Noida while a boy in another branch run by the school.The children had returned home due to the COVID-induced lockdown and went back to their schools on June 18.On July 3, the girl’s parents got a call from the school, asking them to immediately reach there because it had “something” to do with their eldest child.The girl’s mother said when she and her husband reached the school, their phones were forcibly taken away by institute officials and they were shown the body of their daughter hanging from a ceiling fan of a classroom.The mother alleged the school forcibly got them to sign some papers regarding the cremation of the body.“They forcibly cremated the body despite our resistance,” she alleged.She claimed that her daughter’s body had turned blue and the clothes were torn and the “salwaar was loose” as the body hung from the ceiling fan.“My daughter has been killed in the school and I suspect something terrible happened there with her. The people there raped her. She was killed and her body hanged from the fan,” the mother claimed in a video.“I urge you all (public), please help us! We do not have enough money for lawyers. Please help us get justice. This might happen with any other child,” she said.“We have been threatened by them that why have we put out an application alleging foul play... My family, two children and we husband and wife, could be harmed now, we need security,” the woman claimed.

13-07-2020||New Delhi||Anti CAA protests: HC asks police to file replies on all pleas related to Jamia violence||The Delhi High Court on Monday directed the Delhi Police to file response on various pleas related to the violence during Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) university protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act last December.The court’s order came after it was informed by the counsel for some of the petitioners that Delhi Police had filed its response only in a few petitions and not all.“Respondents (Delhi Police) have filed consolidated replies in a few matters. We direct the respondents to file replies in all the matters within two days. Rejoinder, if any, be filed in four days thereafter,” said a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan.Advocate Rajat Nair, appearing for Delhi Police, said they have filed a consolidated reply in all the petitions.To this, the bench said the agency has to file replies in all the matters and added “don’t take an easy recourse”.The court added that the copies of counter-affidavit and rejoinder be supplied to all the parties before the next date of hearing on June 21, so that it can hear arguments on that day.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for some of the petitioners, said the police have not filed the reply in three petitions seeking compensation for grave injuries caused to the students due to alleged police beating and action against the erring officials.The consolidated affidavit of the police was filed in six of the nine petitioners in the Jamia violence matter.Meanwhile, the petitioners filed the list of issues to be adjudicated in the matter.Nair submitted they had received the list late last night and sought time to analyse the issues and respond.On June 6, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing Delhi Police, had taken strong exception to the language used in certain paragraphs of the rejoinder filed by one of the petitioners in the matter and said “you cannot malign constitutional authorities like this” and they are “more of a political statement made at a protest site”.Mehta had contended that “irresponsible” pleadings have been filed in the rejoinder of one of the petitioners Nabila Hasan who has sought action against the police for allegedly brutally attacking the petitioners, students and residents of JMI.Hasan’s plea has also sought action against the alleged ruthless, and excessive use of force and aggression unleashed by the police and paramilitary forces on students within the university.Gonsalves, who was also representing Hasan, had submitted that he will delete the particular lines and file the rejoinder again.Opposing a batch of PILs seeking setting up of a judicial commission to look into the violence, the police have said the claim of police brutality is utter falsehood.The police have filed the affidavit in response to various petitions, moved by lawyers, students of JMI, residents of Okhla in south Delhi, where university is located and the Imam of Jama Masjid mosque opposite Parliament House, in which they had also sought medical treatment, compensation and interim protection from arrest for the students.The pleas have also sought registration of FIRs against the erring police officers.Delhi Police, in its affidavit filed through advocates Amit Mahajan and Rajat Nair in response to the petitions, has sought dismissal of pleas seeking quashing of FIRs and directions against alleged police brutality in the university during the anti-CAA protests.It said the petitions were an utter abuse of PIL jurisdiction as the incidents of violence in and around the campus were well-planned and orchestrated attempts by some persons with local support.The affidavit filed by Rajesh Deo, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, said exercising fundamental right to dissent should be respected, but “no person can be allowed to commit breach of law, indulge in violence, arson and riotous activity causing danger to life, limb and property of innocent citizens under the garb of exercise of fundamental right of free speech and assembly”.Such fundamental rights are not absolute and are liable to reasonable restrictions under the Constitution, it has said.

13-07-2020||Vibha Sharma||Rajasthan imbroglio: BJP plays ‘wait and watch’ in what appears to be a ‘win-win situation' either way||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 13While the Congress battles to keep its house in order in Rajasthan, the BJP which tackled a similar situation in Madhya Pradesh in March and earlier in Karnataka is keeping a close watch. Though it would like nothing better than to displace the Congress government in Jaipur, sources say the saffron party is closely watching as a “seasoned politician”, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, and his young challenger, Deputy CM Sachin Pilot, play out their moves.While their claims of “having no hand” in the Rajasthan imbroglio appear far-fetched amid reports of Pilot “being in touch” with Union ministers, senior leaders say in either case (whether Gehlot manages to save his government or not) “it will be a win-win situation” for the saffron party. The acrimony between the factions in Rajasthan Congress is not expected to be over soon, they say. Also read: Doors open for Sachin Pilot, says Cong; legislature party meeting begins in JaipurRajasthan crisis: Rahul’s envy causing Congress’ destruction, says ex-MP CMLike Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP would like to have Pilot on board in Rajasthan but his benefits will depend on how the current impasse ends. “One thing is for sure, only if Pilot has sufficient numbers to ensure the fall of the Gehlot government or have his say (in Congress) he will be in any position to bargain in future. His political career depends upon the result of current situation,” say political observers.Meanwhile, the BJP is playing wait and watch. On whether or not Pilot will join them, BJP leaders are concentrating on berating the Congress on its “internal mess”. Scindia, who yesterday took a swipe at his old party and expressed “sadness” over the way his “erstwhile colleague” (Pilot) was being “sidelined and persecuted” by Gehlot appears to the BJP’s lead baiter. “Shows that talent and capability find little credence in the Congress,” added Scindia whose exit from the grand old party in March resulted in the fall of the Kamal Nath government and return of the BJP in Madhya Pradesh. Unlike Madhya Pradesh the gap between the Congress and the BJP is bigger in Rajasthan. The saffron party has 72 members in the 200-member Assembly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-imbroglio-bjp-plays-wait-and-watch-in-what-appears-to-be-a-win-win-situation-either-way-112392
13-07-2020||Sehore (MP)||Rajasthan crisis: Rahul’s envy causing Congress’ destruction, says ex-MP CM||Amid the crisis in the Congress government in neighbouring Rajasthan, senior BJP leader and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti, on Monday, accused Rahul Gandhi of not allowing young leaders to flourish in his party due to envy.She said Gandhi created rifts between Congress leaders and then blamed the BJP when he was unable to control the resultant internal strife.“The envy of Rahul Gandhi is causing the destruction of the Congress. Rahul Gandhi does not allow young leaders to flourish. He creates an environment which creates rifts among party leaders, which he is then unable to control. And then he blames us for the crisis,” Bharti said.“Rahul Gandhi feels he will be left behind if young and qualified leaders such as Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sachin Pilot (who has revolted against CM Ashok Gehlot in Rajasthan) get important posts,” she claimed.However, when such capable leaders came to the BJP, the party welcomed them as everybody had a place in it, Bharti said.The BJP national vice president said Gandhi was also responsible for the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh falling in March after 22 Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalist MLAs quit the Assembly and joined the BJP.

13-07-2020||New Delhi||COVID biomedical waste poses environmental challenge||Already fighting pollution created by single-use plastics and other non-biodegradable material, the world is facing a new challenge in disposing masks, gloves and personal protective equipment amid the COVID-19 crisis.Environmentalists say PPEs, masks and gloves are mainly made of plastic and are neither biodegradable nor recyclable. Amid the ongoing health crises, they are creating an unexpected impact on the environment resulting in “a silent, invisible health hazard for a large number of people”“The government needs to act now to ensure a green recovery that incentivises sustainability.  Our health care governance and industry must also quickly respond, install toxic gas absorbing filters and take all necessary steps for safe disposal of the huge amounts of biomedical waste being generated,” says Soumya Dutta, an environmental expert.Dutta says while health workers and frontline workers must be protected, in many places these are openly disposed of, threatening the spread of diseases to larger populations. Even in the case of “systematic disposal” most of these are being burned in incinerators, leading to the creation of two very toxic carcinogenic gases—Dioxin and Furan.“Most of our hospital Incinerators do not lave specialised filters to eliminate them. This is creating a silent, invisible health hazard for a large number of people living around these incinerators and might end up having cancer and other diseases in the years to come,” adds Dutta.Meanwhile, according to Ramnath Vaidyanathan, General Manager (Sustainability) at Godrej Industries Limited, carelessly discarded PPEs can end up polluting land, rivers and oceans, adding to the glut of plastic waste already threatening the ecosystem. “It is imperative for the country to step up efforts to sensitise regarding proper handling of biomedical waste to protect the environment and reduce the threat of Covid-19,” he says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-biomedical-waste-poses-environmental-challenge-112389
13-07-2020||New Delhi||CA’s May examination cancelled, to be merged with Nov cycle: ICAI tells SC||The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) Monday informed the Supreme Court that the May cycle of CA examination, scheduled between July 29 and August 16, has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The counsel appearing for the ICAI told a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar that now the May cycle examination would be merged with the November 2020 cycle of the CA exam.The Apex Court was hearing through video-conferencing a plea which had challenged the ‘opt-out’ option provided by the ICAI alleging that it “arbitrarily” discriminated between the aspirants in May cycle of CA examination.The plea had also sought more exam centres across the country.The bench, after hearing the submissions advanced by ICAI's counsel, disposed of the matter.Advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, appearing for the petitioner, pointed out to certain aspects related to the CA examinations.The top court told the advocate to make a representation before the ICAI in this regard.On June 29, the Apex Court had said that the ICAI should be flexible in conducting exams amid the pandemic and take care of concern of candidates.It had suggested that the option for change in examination centre should be made available to the aspirants till the last week before the scheduled exams.It had observed that the situation was not static and continuously changing and the ICAI should be flexible on the issues of ‘opt-out’ and change of examination centre.The ICAI’s counsel had earlier told the court that out of around 3,46,000 registered aspirants, nearly 53,000 have taken the ‘opt-out’ option.The plea filed in the Apex Court had alleged that the ICAI had made an important announcement on June 15 by which it “arbitrarily decided to discriminate” between the aspirants by providing an option of ‘opt-out’.The ICAI’s counsel had told the court that it has ensured that no prejudice is caused to anybody by a notification issued regarding the examination.The petitioner, president of the India Wide Parents Association, had claimed in the plea that the ICAI had stated that students, who had already submitted the online examination application for May examination cycle, would be allowed to ‘opt-out’ and carry forward their candidature to November 2020 examination cycle.“It is respectfully submitted that Respondent No.1 ICAI has notified that for the students who choose the opt-out option, this attempt (May 2020) will be treated as cancelled/not counted. Thus, such student will be deprived of the May 2020, attempt, as compared to another group of students, who choose the opt-in option,” the plea had said, while seeking quashing of the announcement made in this regard on June 15.“The said ‘opt-out’ option discriminates between those underprivileged group of CA students/ aspirants, who are living in remote areas of the country or living in the containment zones and thus are slated to lose one precious ‘examination attempt’ by choosing ‘opt-out’ option amidst ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to that privileged group of students/ aspirants, who are living in big cities/ green zones and thus they have no problem in appearing in the said examination,” it had said.It had said that free transportation and accommodation should be provided to the aspirants near their respective examination centres.It had further sought directions to the authorities to conduct mandatory free COVID-19 test of all aspirants and teachers and staffs deployed at the examination centres.

13-07-2020||Lucknow||BJP leader Kalyan Singh appears before Babri mosque trial court||Senior BJP leader Kalyan Singh on Monday appeared before the special CBI court here in connection with the 1992 Babri mosque demolition case.The 88-year-old former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and former Rajasthan Governor arrived at the court to record his statement before the CBI special judge.              The CBI court is currently recording the statements of 32 accused under CrPC section 313 (court’s power to examine the accused), a stage in the trial that follows the examination of accused. Other alleged accused, including former deputy prime minister L K Advani and senior BJP leaders M M Joshi, are yet to be examined at this stage.Their lawyers have indicated to the CBI court that they prefer to appear through video conferencing. Another accused, Ram Chandra Khatri, is presently lodged in a Sonipat jail in Haryana in connection with another case.            The special court had last week reiterated that a reminder should be sent to the National Informatics Centre (NIC) for making arrangements to record his statement through video conferencing.                With regard to another accused Om Prakash Pandey, the CBI had furnished a report saying he was untraceable after his family claimed that he had renounced the world and became a seer and had not come home for years.His brother Mahendra Pandey had said that he would try to find out the whereabouts of his brother and inform the CBI. The court had then directed the agency to remain in contact with Mahendra Pandey and furnish further report.The court has already issued a non-bailable warrant against Om Prakash Pandey.'Innocent'Singh, who was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the mosque was razed down told reporters that he was “innocent” and that he had been framed in the case.“I am innocent. I was falsely implicated. The then Congress-led Union govt filed case against me due to political animosity,” he told reports after the hearing. "As a UP chief minister, I and my government ensured adequate three-tier security of the disputed structure in Ayodhya.”He blamed the then central government under the Congress for levelling  what he claimed were "false and baseless allegations".Singh, during whose tenure the demolition took place, was assisted by two persons as he walked out of the court."I was falsely implicated, I am innocent," he asserted as he left the court premises. IThe mosque in Ayodhya was demolished in December 1992 by ‘kar sevaks’ who claimed that an ancient Ram temple had stood on the same site.The CBI court is conducting day-to-day hearings to complete the trial by August 31, as directed by the Supreme Court. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leader-kalyan-singh-appears-before-babri-mosque-trial-court-112382
13-07-2020||Mumbai||'Pati, Patni aur Woh' spat spills on to Mumbai road||A public brawl between a woman and her husband on a busy south Mumbai road that disrupted traffic, leaving Mumbaikars both amused and irritated is doing the rounds on social media.Around 5 pm on Saturday, a woman in a white vehicle intercepted a black SUV, got down, started screaming and shouting at the man, apparently her husband in the driver's seat, banged the windshield, climbed on the bonnet even as traffic halted to view the "tamasha" (fiasco) on the Pedder Road.Even as traffic police rushed to control her and the vehicular movement on one land was blocked, she screamed at her husband and he stepped out and tried to run away from there, but the woman caught him and virtually dragged him to her car, even kicking him a couple of times.The police directed him to halt near the footpath when the woman again stepped out, ran to her husband's black SUV parked a few metres away, opened the driver-side door and lunged at the woman occupant in the next seat before she was stopped by the onlookers who had gathered there.Though she refused to lodge a police complaint in the matter, the police later slapped a fine for the offence of abandoning her vehicle on the road."There was no physical violence, this falls in the category of non-cognisable offence so we can do nothing about it... However, the lady was fined for traffic rule violations and let off," Gamdevi Police Station Senior Police Inspector Rajendra Mohite told IANS.Meanwhile, videos of the incident shot by some local eyewitnesses went viral with some demanding arrest and exemplary action against the couple -- whose identities were not clear.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pati-patni-aur-woh-spat-spills-on-to-mumbai-road-112381

I also emailed Aaditya Thackeray and tweeted about the chartered flight and he cooperated,” Ranjan said.“I submitted the proposal to him on July 7 and the students are back home now,” he said.Ranjan said his company also facilitated a chartered flight from Russia to Cochin on July 8.

Thackeray immediately responded to our request,” Mistry said.Another student Sneha Singh said it was a difficult three-month period for them and they were trying to go back home but no flights were available. She thanked Thackeray and the ticketing company for the help.Sainath Durge, member of the Yuva Sena’s core committee said Nixtour emailed Aaditya Thackeray for help in getting permission for the private chartered flight, and the latter pursued the matter with the MEA and the state government.

13-07-2020||New Delhi||Centre pushes for people’s participation in Jal Jeevan Mission in Jammu and Kashmir||The Centre has pushed for the democratisation of implementation of its flagship project of providing piped water to every rural household under Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), especially in the border states and UTs, including Jammu and Kashmir.The democratisation would be through peoples’ participation in the implementation of the project.The JJM—a centrally sponsored project—aims to provide Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) to every rural household by 2024.It was announced on Independence Day last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The border states and UTs, especially Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Punjab and Arunachal Pradesh have asked the Centre to complete the project under JJM by 2022, ahead of the national deadline of 2024.The Centre, however, has laid thrust on peoples’ participation in JJM, and in the efforts to boost the country’s water resource capacity and its management.Sources said that Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor GC Murmu informed Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat during a discussion with him, through video conference on last Friday, on the UT’s focus on JJM implementation through “village plans”.  Out of 6,877 villages, action plans for 1,800 villages have been prepared.Shekhawat, who initiated the discussion, laid focus on the preparation of “Village Action Plans” as well as constituting “Village Water and Sanitation Committee” (VWSC) of Gram Panchayat” with minimum 50 per cent women members.Besides the VWSC having stipulated strength of women members, the JJM guidelines lay down the condition of 10–15 members comprising of elected members of Panchayat up to 25% of the composition.The remaining 25 per cent of the members may consist of representatives of weaker sections of the village proportional to their population.The committee will be tasked with planning, designing, implementing and operating, and maintaining of in water supply infrastructure within the village concerned.All villages have to prepare Village VAP which essentially will comprise of development and augmentation of drinking water sources, water supply, grey-water management and operation and maintenance component.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-pushes-for-peoples-participation-in-jal-jeevan-mission-in-jammu-and-kashmir-112367
13-07-2020||Washington||Pompeo, Jaishankar, Nirmala Sitharaman to address virtual India Ideas summit||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will address a star-studded virtual summit next week on building a better future for both the countries and the world, amidst the COVID-19 and China's aggressive actions.The two-day virtual India Ideas Summit of the powerful US India Business Council (USIBC) would be held on July 21 and 22."The theme for this year's summit is building a better future,” USIBC president Nisha Desai Biswal told PTI in an interview.“We are firmly committed to the US-India corridor that builds a better future,” she said.India, the US and their industries working together can not only build a better future for both the countries and its people, but they can actually be instrumental in building a better future for the world, she said.“And that's what we're looking for this year in the India Ideas Summit,” she said.The virtual summit will start on July 21, with inaugural keynote conversation on ‘Global Supply Chains & Combating COVID-19’ between Indian-American Congressman Ami Bera and Piyush Goyal, Union Minister of Commerce and Industry and Minister of Railways.Union Finance Minister Sitharaman will join the USIBC members to share her vision for India's economic recovery and the path to future economic growth in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her remarks would be followed by conversation on India's Economic Recovery by Tarun Bajaj, Secretary of Economic Affairs.On July 22, after a welcome address by Thomas J Donohue, CEO, US Chamber of Commerce, External Affairs Minister Jaishankar along with Senator Mark Warner would participate in a discussion on ‘How the US and India Can Lead the Global Response Post-Pandemic’ in a session moderated by former National Security Advisor Stephen Headley.Soon thereafter Pompeo would deliver a keynote address, followed by a panel discussion on ‘The Future of US-India Relations in a Post-Pandemic World’ between US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster and his Indian counterpart Taranjit Singh Sandhu.Pompeo has already lashed out at China saying Indians have done their best to respond to Beijing's incredibly aggressive actions.The top American diplomat said last Wednesday that China has a pattern of instigating territorial disputes and the world shouldn't allow this bullying to take place in the region.The Indian and Chinese armies have been locked in a bitter standoff at multiple locations in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The tension escalated manifold after a violent clash in the Galwan Valley in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed last month. Currently, both sides are engaged in talks to de-escalate the situation.The prestigious annual USIBC Global Leadership Awards would be presented to Jim Taiclet, CEO, Lockheed Martin & Co-Chair of the US-India CEO Forum, and Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman, Tata Group and Co-Chair of the US-India CEO Forum.“I think that the US-India partnership can become the engine for rebirth of a global economy post (coronavirus) pandemic,” Biswal told PTI in response to a question.Noting the US and India already have a deep collaboration in terms of the services trade, Biswal, who was earlier the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, said it is well known that a large cross-section of the American economy has some operations in India.The COVID-19 pandemic showed India's strength and resilience in the service economy, and despite a national lockdown the US companies were able to maintain business continuity across the board on the vast majority of these services, whether it's hospital administration, financial sector or processing of insurance claims. Across the board, the service economy in India has been able to operate, she said.

13-07-2020||New Delhi||Come back, let’s talk: Congress reaches out to Sachin Pilot amid Rajasthan crisis||With the bitter factional war casting a shadow on its government in Rajasthan, the Congress on Monday made a last ditch effort to reach out to rebel Deputy CM Sachin Pilot asking him to come and talk about his concerns and differences at the CLP meeting, which will now be held around 1 pm.Pilot, Rajasthan Congress chief and Deputy CM, last night openly revolted against CM Ashok Gehlot led state government claiming the support of 30 MLAs, including independents and declaring that the state government was in minority.With the CLP meeting in Jaipur postponed to enable more lawmakers to reach, the Congress today issued a statement appealing to all MLAs including Pilot to attend the meeting and strengthen the state government.“We appeal to all MLAs and to Deputy CM Sachin Pilot to attend the CLP meeting and discuss their differences in party fora. Personal ambitions are not larger than the interest of the state and the Congress government has been elected to serve the state for its full term,” said Randeep Surjewala, one of the two observers Congress has sent to Jaipur to meet MLAs and gather the party flock amid a rebellion by Pilot.Even as Surjewala extended and olive branch to Pilot some Congress workers were seen pulling Pilot posters down from the state party office.Surjewala said the doors of Congress President Sonia Gandhi were open to everyone to discuss anything or concern.“Family members do squabble at times but then they don’t weaken the house. They sit with elders and resolve the differences. Our affections for Sachin Pilot and other MLAs are intact. We appeal to them to return and engage the party,” Surjewala said.Ahead of the CLP meet the Congress claimed 97 MLAs had reached Gehlot’s house.Pilot meanwhile appears to have gone too far to script a return having had a bitter power tussle with Gehlot in the state where he lost the CM race to the old warhorse in 2018.Now Pilot is also nearing the end of his term as party president in Rajasthan.Pilot did not take the state police summons to him on the probe into allegations of toppling the Rajasthan government lightly and decided to chart his own course this time.The state deputy CM’s next moves are still in the realm of speculation with the CLP meet outcomes yet to surface even though the Congress claimed last night that 109 legislators had signed support letters for Gehlot.Pilot is in Delhi and yesterday met Rajasthan BJP veteran Om Mathur.BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia is said to have accompanied him to meet Mathur.Pilot is now keeping cards close to the chest with two possibilities likely — he could join the BJP if he musters enough MLA support to topple the Gehlot government or he could form his independent outfit.For now all eyes are on the outcome of the CLP meet which will commence at Gehlot’s house later around 1 pm.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/come-back-lets-talk-congress-reaches-out-to-sachin-pilot-amid-rajasthan-crisis-112364

This speaks of the Gunda Raj & failure of law and order in the Mamta govt. People will not forgive such a govt in the future. We strongly condemn this.”The suspected heinous killing of Debendra Nath Ray, BJP MLA from Hemtabad in West Bengal, is extremely shocking and deplorable.

13-07-2020||Kanpur||Innumerable stories about Vikas Dubey emerge||The Vikas Dubey episode, with its thrills, twists and turns, has paved the way for innumerable ‘stories’ — some of them fables — from people known and unknown.Anyone, who has even remotely known Vikas Dubey, is now ready to put out a story about him, his habits and his adventures.“He loved ‘bati-chokha’ and would often hold impromptu parties where this would be served. He would call people from the village to and cook this for about 20 or more people. Even on the night of the encounter, he had got ‘bati-chokha’ made for about 30 people but they could not enjoy the dinner because the news of the police raid came in. Later, the police opened fire and all was over,” said a villager from Bikru village, who was a part of the cooking team.People are wary of disclosing their names due to the fear of police action but are more than willing to disclose details about the don.Though Vikas visited the village at regular intervals, he stayed mostly in Kanpur and Lucknow.He had won the village head elections in 1996 and then got a second term too. His family wielded considerable influence in the village.“As he grew in stature, Vikas developed a major temper management problem. If he lost his cool, he would thrash the one who had erred. But he was also helpful to villagers. He gave money for girls’ weddings and helped in the treatment of those who did not have the money,” said another villager.Vikas, 52, was known as ‘Pandit ji’ in the village and a few have started referring to him as ‘Gabbar’ after his death.When he was alive, no one dared to refer to him as ‘Gabbar’ even in his absence.The youth in the village called him ‘Chacha ji’ and for them, he was a hero.“He may have earned a lot of money but he never forgot his roots. He would help us. He gave me money to complete my graduation and did a lot of development in the village. Except for his temper, he was a good man for us,” said a young man from the Bikru village.Vikas also held his court whenever he was in Bikru. People would come forward with disputes and Vikas would resolve them. No one ever dared to question his decision, whether it was related to a marital dispute or a land dispute.Another fact on which the villagers swear is the gangster’s ‘character’.He never disrespected women and never allowed his men to misbehave with girls or women. In fact, we knew that the women were safe because of ‘Pandit ji’, a young man added.The local people also claimed that Vikas was fond of good clothes and good shoes.“Each time, he came to the village, he would be well dressed. If we appreciated his shirt, at times, he would even take it off and give it away,” said another young man.At times, when he was angry, he would thrash those who came to him wearing new clothes.When asked about the multiple properties and investments of the slain gangster, the local people said: “Bhabhi ji knows it all. We are not aware of any such issues.”His acquaintances said Vikas was fond of watching films but often rued the fact that he did not get time to indulge in his pastime. “Arjun Pandit” was his all-time favourite film.Some reports are also now coming in that Bollywood is already gearing up to make a film on the life of Vikas Dubey.The ‘don’, however, will not be around to watch it.Villagers in Bikru villages also claimed that Vikas Dubey was planning to contest the 2022 Assembly elections.

13-07-2020||Kolkata||BJP MLA found hanging in market in West Bengal; family alleges murder||Senior BJP leader Debendra Nath Ray, was found hanging near his home in Hemtabad area of North Dinajpur district on Monday morning, police sources said. Ray had contested and won the Hemtabad assembly segment -- a reserved seat for Scheduled Castes -- on a CPI(M) ticket but had switched over to the BJP last year after the Lok Sabha polls. He, however, did not resign as CPI(M) legislator in the state assembly. "Ray was found hanging near a shop in Hemtabad area this (Monday) morning. We have started investigation. A forensic team has reached the spot and his body has been sent for the post-mortem," a senior district police officer said.The BJP leader's family has demanded a CBI inquiry into the incident as they suspected that he was murdered.Also read: ‘Suspected heinous killing’ of Ray speaks of ‘gunda raj’ in West Bengal: BJP"We think he was murdered. There should be a CBI inquiry into the killing," a family member said. The state BJP leadership termed Ray's death, as "cold-blooded murder" by the ruling Trinamool Congress party."This is a cold-blooded murder by the goons of the TMC. The TMC was wary of Ray's popularity in the area. We want an independent inquiry to bring out the truth. You can very well understand the state's law and order situation when even an MLA is not safe," BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said.BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said the killing of BJP leaders allegedly by TMC goons had become the order of the day in Bengal."It is a condemnable and cowardly act. During the rule of Mamata Banerjee, the killings of BJP leaders have become the order of the day. Hemtabad MLA Debendra Nath Ray was assassinated. His body was found hanging. Was joining BJP his only crime?" Vijayvargiya tweeted.Refuting the allegations, senior TMC leader and district president Kanailal Agarwal, said it was for the police to investigate the cause of Ray's death."It is for the police to decide the cause of his (Ray) death. Whether he committed suicide or there is something else... is for the law to decide.

13-07-2020||New Delhi||SC upholds Shebait rights of Travancore royal family in administration of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple||The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the Shebait rights of the Travancore royal family in the administration of Shree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Kerala.Shebait is a person who serves a Hindu deity and manages the temple.As an interim arrangement, a Bench of Justice UU Lalit and Justice Indu Malhotra approved the continuation of a committee headed by Thiruvananthapuram District Judge to oversee the administration of one of the richest Hindu temples in India where Lord Vishnu (Shree Padmanabhaswamy) is worshipped in ‘Anantha Shayana’ posture.All members of the committee shall be Hindus which shall take a call on whether mysterious Vault-B of the temple will be opened or not.The issue has evoked immense curiosity among people due to the widely held belief that it doesn’t augur well for those who dare open it.The royal family of Travancore has a role as Shebait of the temple, it said. The death of the Travancore ruler who signed the Covenant didn’t affect Shebayatship if the Travancore royal family, it added.The Bench said as per custom, Shebaiship survived on the death of the ruler and his death didn’t result in escheat in favour of state government despite the 26th amendment to the Constitution that abolished privy purse paid to former rulers of princely states which were incorporated into the Indian Republic after Independence.Monday’s order came on a petition filed by the erstwhile royal family of Travancore— trustee of the temple—against the Kerala High Court’s January 31, 2011 verdict directing the state government to set up a trust to take control of the temple management and its assets.Allowing the appeal filed by the Travancore Royal Family Maharaja, the top court accepted Shebaitship of the royal family over one of the richest Hindu temples in India.The Supreme Court’s verdict effectively means the “Ruler” under Instrument of Accession signed by Princely state ruler with the Government of India at the time of independence is “Ruler” by succession and will not end with the death of the ruler who signed the instrument of accession.Shree Padmanabhaswamy Temple has been hitting international headlines since 2011 when an SC-appointed panel found jewellery, idols, weapons, utensils and coins worth Rs one lakh crore in its five other vaults. But Vault-B—believed to be protected by cobras—wasn’t opened.However, former Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai— who audited the temple’s wealth on the top court’s order—had in 2014 contradicted the popular belief.In his report, Rai had told the court that Vault-B was opened at least seven times since 1990.Senior advocate and amicus curiae Gopal Subramanium had also supported Rai’s view that there should be verification of the inventory of Vault-B.Subramanium had alleged that the temple’s wealth was being stolen in an organised manner. He wanted the court to ensure that the royal family of Travancore should be kept away from its management.He had alleged that the royal family treated a public temple as a private fiefdom. The royal family had denied the allegation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-upholds-shebait-rights-of-travancore-royal-family-in-administration-of-sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-112338

13-07-2020||Surat||Gujarat woman constable transferred for arresting minister's son, friends over curfew violations||Woman constable Sunita Yadav was transferred hours after the son of a Gujarat minister and his two friends were arrested for allegedly violating the lockdown and the night curfew orders in Surat.Sunita has been sent to police headquarters and a probe has been initiated into the matter.   The arrests came a day after audio clips of a heated exchange of Prakash Kanani, son of Varachha Road MLA and Minister of State for Health Kumar Kanani, and his friends with Sunita Yadav, who tried to stop them, surfaced on social media.Prakash Kanani and two of his friends were arrested under IPC Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269, 270 (negligent and malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), and 144 (abettor present when offence committed), Assistant Commissioner of Police, A-Division, C K Patel said.They were later released on bail, he added.Surat Commissioner of Police R B Brahmbhatt on Saturday ordered an inquiry into the incident, after the constable alleged that she was threatened by some men when she stopped them during the night curfew.Yadav stopped Prakash Kanani's friends around 10.30 pm on Wednesday during night curfew for allegedly violating the lockdown orders in force to contain the spread of coronavirus.The friends then called Prakash Kanani, who arrived in his father's car and allegedly picked up an argument with Yadav, the audio clips of which went viral on Saturday.In the audio clips, the men are heard telling the constable that they had the power to "make you stand at the same place for 365 days".The constable shouts back that she is not their slave or a servant of their fathers that they can make her stand there for 365 days.Patel said Yadav has gone on sick leave and an inquiry is under way into the incident.

13-07-2020||Washington||Chinese actions on India border, in SCS and Hong Kong ‘provocative, destabilising’: Rich Verma||The recent Chinese actions along the border with India and those in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait and in Hong Kong have been “provocative and destabilising”, a former top American diplomat has said.The Indian and Chinese armies have been locked in a bitter standoff at multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for over eight weeks since May 5. The tension escalated manifold after a violent clash in Galwan Valley in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed.The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. Both sides have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks in the last few weeks to ease tension in the region.Tensions had escalated in eastern Ladakh around two months back after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.“Chinese actions, not only on the border with India, but in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait and in Hong Kong, have been provocative and destabilising,” former US Ambassador to India Rich Verma told PTI.China claims nearly all of the disputed South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam all claim parts of it. Beijing has built artificial islands and military installations in the South China Sea.“A central pillar of our partnership now rests on a free and open Indo-Pacific, a commitment to the rule of law, to international norms, the peaceful resolution of disputes and the rules-based order in Asia,” Verma said, adding that any country that acts contrary to those principles puts that order at risk.The US has been pushing for a broader role by India in the strategically important Indo-Pacific region.India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China’s rising military maneuvering in the region.“In 1959, then Senator Kennedy said in a stirring speech on the Senate floor that ‘the hinge of fate in Asia’ rests with India, and that India had a ‘special importance’…. symbolising for all of Asia the testing ground for democracy,” said Verma who was US ambassador to India from 2014 to 2017.Kennedy was right in 1959 in pronouncing his strong support for India, and American leaders would be right to be unequivocal in their support for India again today, he said.“The US-India relationship over the last two decades has received bipartisan support in Washington, and it thankfully remains so to this day,” he said.It is thanks to the hardworking professionals of the State Department, Defense Department, and other US government agencies, as well as Congress, that America’s partnership with India remains on track, he said.But this is a relationship that requires special attention, and support in particular for the people-to-people ties. After all, it is the people who make up the foundation for any progress that the two governments make, said Verma, who served as the top American diplomat in India during the second term of the Obama Administration.“On this score, I am concerned about increasing restrictions on the movement of Indian nationals, including students, to the US. And as an Indian American, I’m also particularly concerned about growing intolerance, racism and bigotry directed at Asian Americans, fuelled by leaders who think it’s smart politics to divide the country,” Verma said.The first-ever Indian-American ambassador to India also described the Trump administration’s decision to expel foreign students pursuing only online classes as “senseless and closed-minded”.“Foreign students contribute to US prosperity and innovation, and forcing them home during a global pandemic is heartless. Harvard and MIT, joined by hundreds of other colleges and universities, have filed suit to block the order, which I am hopeful will reverse this foolish policy,” Verma said.He asserted that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was a great friend of India and has been an advocate of this partnership for decades.“I don’t speak for the Biden campaign, but I can say that I have known and worked with Joe Biden for nearly 20 years, first in the Senate when he was Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and then later in the Obama Administration when he was Vice President,” he said.“There would have been no US-India civil nuclear deal but for the leadership of then Senator Biden. I recall when I worked in the Senate he gave an important speech talking about how if in 2020 the US and India are the closest friends and partners, then the world will be a safer place,” he said.“He was right then when he first made those comments in the early 2000s, and there is no question he will be a steady, trusted partner who will elevate US-India ties to new heights. I’m convinced of that,” Verma said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-actions-on-india-border-in-scs-and-hong-kong-provocative-destabilising-rich-verma-112331

13-07-2020||New Delhi||CID has been following me, my supporter, it’s humiliating, says Sachin Pilot||Amid the raging political crisis in Rajasthan and a catalogue of speculation, sources aware about the developments revealed that the Rajasthan's Deputy Chief Minister and state Congress President Sachin Pilot will not join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Upset and angry over the sedition charges being levelled against him by the state special operations group (SOG), as one of his supporters said it was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, Pilot decided that enough was enough and made his move.While in Delhi, Pilot reportedly had a telephonic conversation with former colleague turned BJP MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, on Sunday, said sources close to Scindia.Pilot is reportedly furious that he and his supporters have been humiliated time and again by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, moreover many of his supporting MLAs have been followed by CID and daily reports are filed by them with the CM's office on who they have met and spoken with. The SOG summons for questioning over allegations of destabilising the government has got Pilot's goat.A clearer picture is likely to emerge over the next two days when Pilot comes out from his self-styled incommunicado status. Sources added that Pilot wants a middle ground needs to be found in Rajasthan by the Congress leadership, some sort of balancing act between the CM and his deputy. In the recent past, Congress sources averred that Pilot spoke to Ahmed Patel and K C Venugopal and mentioned how he is been humiliated virtually daily by the CM.Meanwhile, sources who could not confirm what the two leaders - Pilot and Scindia - spoke about, added, "The two have worked together for years. But ever since Scindia joined the BJP along with his supporters, both Pilot and Scindia have been in regular telephonic contact."On Sunday, Scindia came out in support of Pilot, alleging the Rajasthan Chief Minister had "persecuted" his deputy.In a tweet that further intensified speculations about Sachin Pilot's future in the Congress, Scindia said, "Sad to see my erstwhile colleague, Sachin Pilot too, being sidelined and persecuted by Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot. Shows that talent and capability find little credence in the Congress." On Sunday late evening, after they spoke over phone, Pilot asserted that he will not attend the legislative party meeting scheduled to be held on Monday morning and has openly announced that the Ashok Gehlot-led government in the state is in minority after over 30 Congress and some Independent MLAs pledged support to him.Pilot, upset at being summoned by the police of his own government, came to Delhi to meet interim Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. However, he received no communication from the party leadership.Meanwhile, Gehlot, sources said, has apprised Sonia Gandhi, Rajasthan party affairs incharge Avinash Pandey, and Congress General Secretary (Organisation) K.C. Venugopal of the developments in the state.But Pilot's brazen defiance of Gehlot and a telephone conversation with BJP Leader Jyotiraditya Scindia has left the Congress wary.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cid-has-been-following-me-my-supporter-its-humiliating-says-sachin-pilot-112327

The BJP however dared Gehlot to prove majority in the assembly.Read also: Rajasthan imbroglio: BJP plays ‘wait and watch’ in what appears to be a ‘win-win situation' either wayThe political tug-of-war in RajasthanRajasthan crisis: Rahul’s envy causing Congress’ destruction, says ex-MP CMThe CLP resolution categorically demanded action against CLP members and leaders found undermining congress interests in an overt or covert manner, in clear but unstated reference to Pilot and his camp.The top Congress leadership has meanwhile decided to keep doors for Pilot open with party media chief Randeep Surjewala inviting him to come back and talk to the high command about his concerns.The Congress is willing to go an extra mile to pacify Pilot even though the Rajasthan CLP resolution takes a contradictory stand by seeking action against leaders who rebelled and harmed the party which is a reference to Pilot.Pilot meanwhile is still silent and hasn’t spoken after Gehlot claimed 106 MLAs were with him.Pilot has been in touch with BJP but with his MLA support dwindling it is unclear what bargaining power he might have with the saffron party.Congress leaders believe Pilot overestimated his strength and may need to eat a humble pie.Pilot’s camp is yet to reveal its plan though and is playing hard ball with Congress even after the CLP resolution signed by majority MLAs.Gehlot has meanwhile herded his MLAs to a resort.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-cm-gehlot-claims-majority-clp-seeks-action-against-anti-party-elements-112325

Changes are also expected in the Parliamentary Board — the BJP’s highest decision-making body — where there are vacancies due to the passing away of senior leaders Ananth Kumar, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley and the election of veteran leader M Venkaiah Naidu to the post of the Vice-President of the country.Nadda, who officially assumed the charge in January, has been operating with the old team. The sources say it is customary for the new president to have a new team. Though Nadda’s team is ready, the announcement has been delayed due to the Covid outbreak. “The team will be a mix of new and existing to ensure the continuity,” the sources added.Given that Swaraj was the only woman member in the Parliamentary Board, speculation is rife over who will replace her in the prestigious body. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is believed to be the front-runner as the probable replacement, but that also means she will have to give up her position in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Council of Ministers.So far, there is no word on who are on board at various levels of the organisational machinery. However, if Sitharaman is moved to the organisation, it would mean a reshuffle in the PM’s Cabinet. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fresh-faces-likely-in-team-nadda-112294

They are capable to protect the borders against any kind of enemy with all their might and efficiency.”Sources in the security establishment said the Chinese military has gradually been thinning down its presence at the ridgeline of Finger Four and also removed some boats from the Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh ahead of another round of Lt General-level talks between India and China aimed at finalising modalities for a complete disengagement along the LAC.Noting that there is nothing unusual about troop movements along borders, Deswal said it was being done as per the requirement. “The morale of the troops of the Army and the border guarding forces is very high. Since Independence, the security forces have made numerous sacrifices to protect the country’s borders,” he said.On repeated use of drones by enemies across the borders on the western frontier, Deswal said, “Technology is at play and we are fully equipped to deal with them. Our personnel are keeping a close watch on movements of such objects.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/countrys-every-inch-in-our-possession-says-itbp-dg-112108
