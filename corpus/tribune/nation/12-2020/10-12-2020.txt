Globally, 85 species are known from Ischaemum, of which 61 species are exclusively found in India.The Western Ghats have 40 species with the highest concentration of the genus. The Agharkar Research Institute (ARI), Pune, an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), has been exploring the biodiversity of the Western Ghats for the last few decades. A team led by Mandar Datar and Ritesh Kumar Choudhary from ARI has been working on relationships among different groups of plants and their evolutionary development (plant taxonomy and phylogeny) of Indian Muraingrasses (Genus Ischaemum) to document the diversity and report novel species, the study said.The team discovered a novel species named Ischaemumjanarthanamii from plateaus of Western Ghats of Goa, and a research paper describing this species was published recently in Annales BotaniciFennici, a Finland based journal, it said.During their explorations on lateritic outcrops (habitats where portions of freely exposed bedrocks protrude above the soil level due to natural reasons) of Goa, the ARI team collected an interesting specimen of the species, it said.Careful observations and critical morphological studies identified the species as a novel one.The species was named Ischaemumjanarthanamiiin in honour of Prof M K Janarthanam, Professor of Botany, Goa University, for his contribution to the Indian grass taxonomy and documentation of the floristic diversity of Goa state, it said. The first collection of this new species was made in the 2017 monsoon, it said.The population was kept under observation for the next two years to confirm the consistency of its characters. Morphological and molecular data of the species were used to confirm the novelty of the species.Ischaemumjanarthanamii grows on low altitude lateritic plateaus on the outskirts of Bhagwan Mahavir National Park, Goa.The vegetation is exposed to extreme climatic conditions like desiccation in drier months and soils with low nutrient availability. However, withstanding these, the species has adapted to survive harsh conditions and blossom every monsoon, the study said.

The fatality rate is 1.45 per cent, well below the global average of 2.29 per cent.”Vardhan informed the audience about the vaccine distribution expertise, production and storage capacity of the country, along with the presence of an experienced and vast network of professionals to streamline COVID vaccination.“India’s world-class research institutes have spearheaded the campaign against COVID-19 and are currently working towards facilitating capacity building for producing, distributing and administering the vaccine. A total of 260 vaccine candidates are in different stages of development globally.“Of these, eight are scheduled to be manufactured in India, including three indigenous ones. We have enthusiastically leveraged the support of international partners like the Oxford University, UK, and the Thomas Jefferson University, USA for vaccine research with Indian entities, both public and private,” he said.The minister concluded his speech by honouring the courage and sacrifice of numerous corona warriors across the globe, who have been at the forefront in the fight against COVID-19. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ensuring-no-compromise-on-scientific-regulatory-norms-of-covid-19-vaccine-vardhan-182462

This is then often reused by an Indian news agency and hundreds of domains, some of which were identified as Sierra Leone Times and TajikistanNews.net. One Indian business magazine had reportedly published at least eight clips from the Indian agency that were lifted from “EU Chronicle”.The website’s main target audience is not Europe but is a feeder for mainstream Indian publications. Some of the MEPs also denied having written op-eds published in their name on the website. These were published by unwary Indian publications as feed from the Indian news agency. But some MEPs said they stood by their “op-eds” on the website. Three of them had travelled to Kashmir and appreciated the situation there.The Srivastava Group had once played a similar role in highlighting India’s leadership of the non-aligned group in the 80s and the 90s. It still brings out an e-paper that highlights news from the developing world. Its founder Govind Narain Srivastava died young at 49.“What we learned in this investigation is that it is possible to turn EU Institutions into unwitting actors of a 15-year influence operation. With lobbying and fake media,” said the EU NGO’s MD Gary Machado.In addition, the Srivastava Group coordinates with groups such as Women’s Economic and Social Think Tank (WESTT), the South Asia Democracy Forum and Friends of Gilgit-Baltistan, alleges the report.Interestingly, WEST T is led by Madi Sharma who runs the outfit with two apparent full-timers with no specialists on South Asia. Her website sports a prominent “Om” at the top and she has been photographed with PM Modi and some EU Parliamentarians who made the Kashmir trip.Machado explained how the website works to distort content. A pro-Indian comment spoken in a personal capacity by a single MEP is modified to sound like the official voice of the whole Parliament. As a result dozens of Indian media outlets wrote that “EU backs India’s surgical strikes” though this was the position of just one MP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-think-tank-led-disinformation-drive-in-eu-ngo-182459
10-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt looking into suggestions of conducting JEE-Main 4 times from 2021: Education minister||The government is examining suggestions about conducting the Joint Entrance Examination-Main four times from next year to ensure that the candidates do not miss out on opportunities due to clash of examinations or the COVID-19 situation, Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal said on Thursday.In a live interaction with students, teachers and parents, Pokhriyal ruled out any reduction in syllabus for engineering entrance exam JEE-Main or medical entrance exam NEET.“The suggestion of Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Main 2021 to be held four times in a year will be examined positively, beginning in the end of February, thereafter in March, April and May-2021, for three to four days during each time.“The syllabus for JEE (Main 2021) will remain same as the previous year and a proposal is under examination where students will be given choice to answer 75 questions (25 questions each in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics) out of 90 questions (30 questions each in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics),” the minister said.He mentioned that for JEE (Main) 2020, there were 75 questions which had to be answered by the candidates (25 questions each in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics).Answering a question relating to syllabus and dates of NEET, Pokhriyal asserted that the schedule for NEET (UG) 2021 is being finalized in consultation with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the National Medical Commission (NMC).“The same would be declared in near future. The syllabus will remain the same as the previous year. In terms of mode of conduct of examination, online and offline, the Health Ministry and NMC are being consulted in this regard,” he said.Regarding the class 10 and 12 board exams, the minister said the consultations with stakeholders are in progress for deciding the dates of board examinations and it will be announced soon based on the feedback from the stakeholders.“The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is yet to take a decision on the dates of conducting board examinations including practical. In case students are not able to do practical in classes before the examinations, alternatives to practical examinations will be explored,” he said.While clarifying the doubts among the students and teachers about the deleted portion of class 12, the minister said CBSE has already uploaded the revised syllabus on its website.“Details of deleted portion have been given in a summary form,” he said.The CBSE had last week announced that board exams in 2021 will be in written mode only and not online.“No final decision has been taken regarding the dates for conduct of board exams, and consultations with stakeholders are still in process. The exams, as and when they are conducted, will be in written mode and not in an online mode. The exams will be conducted following all COVID protocols. In case students are not able to do practicals in classes before the exams, alternatives to practical exams will have to be explored,” a senior board official had said.Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of COVID-19 and partially reopened in some states from October 15. However, a few states decided to keep them closed in view of a spike in the infections.The board exams that were being conducted in March had to be postponed mid-way. The exams were later cancelled, and the results were announced on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme.Competitive exams like JEE and NEET were also postponed twice this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.There have been demands for postponement of board exams to May in view of the continued closure of schools and teaching-learning activities being completely online. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-looking-into-suggestions-of-conducting-jee-main-4-times-from-2021-education-minister-182458

There will be no such programme”, Devvarma told reporters here.Over 24 BJP legislators, including all six ministers of the party, visited CM Deb at his official residence late Wednesday evening and held a marathon meeting for nearly two hours in course of which all of them reposed faith in his leadership.After they came out, Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs Manoj Kanti Deb said, “Though we met chief minister in a courtesy call, all party MLAs and ministers have clearly said they want Biplab Deb to continue as Chief Minister.”BJP has 36 MLAs in the 60-member Assembly in Tripura, while its ally Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT) has 8 legislators and the rest 16 are with opposition CPI-M.A group of BJP supporters had shouted slogans ‘Biplab Hatao, BJP Bachao’ (Remove Biplab, Save BJP) last Sunday during BJP’s state observer Vinod Sonkar’s visit in Tripura.Irked by it, Deb had announced on Tuesday that he will seek people’s mandate in an open field on December 13.He also announced that he would resign from his post and leave if people wanted.A group of disgruntled BJP MLAs had met Nadda in October and expressed their grievances about the alleged bad governance in the state.Legislator Sudip Roy Barman, who had criticised Deb on several occasions before being axed as the health minister in June, was considered the leader of the dissident group.BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya said the party high command is investigating as who raised slogans against Deb.A gym instructor-turned-politician, Deb (51) had become chief minister of the northeastern state in March 2018 ending the Left Front’s 25-year-rule in Tripura.

We need more supply of blood as pending operations and surgeries (delayed due to COVID-19) are now taking place across the state," said Tope.As the state is offering blood supply at its hospitals free of cost, the financial burden will be borne by the National Health Mission, he said.The state's Blood Transfusion Council has cautioned about limited availability of blood across Maharashtra. I appeal to people to come forward to donate blood and save lives, said the minister.A special blood donation drive is going to be organised in the state from December 13 to 20 to celebrate NCP leader Sharad Pawar’s 80th birthday which falls on December 12.

Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government come out with an explanation on mysterious Eluru disease to remove all fears from the minds of the people. Naidu demanded that Chief Minister Reddy must disclose the results of tests held till date to uncover the reasons behind the illness in West Godavari district headquarters. “There were rising fears over the presence of heavy metals like lead and nickel in the drinking water. The government should immediately address these concerns and ensure proper drinking water supply through mobile mineral water plants and such measures,” Naidu said in a statement. The former chief minister said the presence of heavy metals, if present in the water and soil would cause serious impact on the health of pregnant women, children and aged people. “Hence, every resident in the town should be given electronic health cards. Every patient should be monitored on a long-term basis. The best medical care should be provided with the help of national and international medical experts,” he said. “Clean drinking water was every citizen’s right and it was the duty of the government.

I have been taken through his complaint, and upon a perusal of the endorsement made on the complaint, it appears that the name of this witness has been kept deliberately in this case, as there was no other independent witness,” the judge said in his order passed on December 9.“I am of the considered opinion that applicant (Alam) is also entitled for grant of bail in the matter on the ground of parity. He cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that he is younger brother of principal accused Tahir Hussain or that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” the order said.The court granted bail to Alam on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety of like amount in the case related to rioting in Dayalpur area.It directed him not to tamper with evidence and to install the “Aarogya Setu” app on his mobile phone.During the hearing, Alam’s counsel said the accused has been falsely implicated in the matter and no recovery has been affected from him in the matter.Special Public Prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea saying Alam was allegedly actively involved in the riots and many persons who were part of the “riotous mob” needed to be identified and arrested.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-man-says-cannot-be-jailed-for-merely-being-tahirs-brother-182439

This funding will begin to roll out from the next grant round in 2021.The AISRF is Australia’s largest fund dedicated to bilateral science collaboration. It helps build links between Australia and India’s top universities, research institutions and the end users of scientific innovation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-australia-to-expand-study-on-covid-after-effects-182438
10-12-2020||London||Following India protests closely, says UK after Boris Johnson gaffe||The UK Foreign Office is closely following the protests by farmers in India, a government spokesperson said on Thursday as it clarified that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had “clearly misheard” a question in Parliament when he responded with Britain’s stance on the India-Pakistan dispute instead.The gaffe occurred during the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) session in the House of Commons on Wednesday, when Johnson reiterated that any dispute between India and Pakistan was for the two countries to settle bilaterally in response to a question by Opposition Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi about conveying British Sikh “anxieties” over the ongoing protests against agricultural reforms in India.A UK government spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister clearly misheard the question in Parliament. The Foreign Office are following the issue of protests in India closely.”Dhesi, who has been very vocal on the protests by farmers against India’s agricultural reforms, had raised the issue of the footage of “water cannons, teargas and brute force” being used against the peaceful protesters.“So, will the Prime Minister (Johnson) convey to the Indian Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) our heartfelt anxieties, our hopes for a speedy resolution to the current deadlock and does he agree that everyone has a fundamental right to peaceful protest,” he questioned Johnson.The British Prime Minister, in his brief response, seemed to be addressing the Kashmir dispute instead.“Our view is that of course we have serious concerns about what is happening between India and Pakistan but these are pre-eminently matters for those two governments to settle and I know that he appreciates that point,” said Johnson.A perplexed Dhesi took to social media immediately to brand Johnson as “absolutely clueless” and was joined by scores of fellow Labour politicians and others in expressing shock at the gaffe.“The incompetence from this government continues. The foreign secretary Dominic Raab has failed to brief the PM on one of the largest protests the world has seen,” said fellow British Sikh Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill.“It would seem our Prime Minister (and former Foreign Secretary) doesn’t know the difference between Punjab and Kashmir. Why are we not surprised,” added Emily Thornberry, Labour MP and former shadow foreign secretary.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has refused to be drawn into British politicians’ representations seeking UK government intervention in the matter, stating that “the police handling of protests are a matter for the government of India”.Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the government but the logjam continues.

After that we clean up the space here.                “We take the farmers’ phone numbers and the details of their camping location and deliver the washed clothes,” Nishant Singh, a Kabaddi player from Punjab, said.          He added that they started this service simply to make things easier for their farmer brothers. “When we saw that the farmers had to travel back to their homes repeatedly just to get clean clothes, we decided to get the entire cleaning system here. We might be from the field of sports, but all of us come from families of farmers and we know the difficulties that the community has been facing.          “Farming is their bread and butter and these laws are threatening that, and we want to help them in their fight in any way we can,” Nishant said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/group-of-sportspersons-farmers-provide-laundry-services-at-singhu-border-protest-site-182435

It envisions Democracy. It imbibes Constitution. It is Economic-Political-Social Equality. It is Compassion and Camaraderie. It is the aspirations of 130 crore Indians. What would a building built upon trampling of these values represent?” he said on Twitter.Surjewala said in a democracy, power does not mean fulfilling one’s whims and fancies, but serving people and public interest.“Mr Modi, history will also record that when the ‘Annadata’ (food grower) was fighting for his rights for 16 days on the streets, you were building a palace for yourself in the name of Central Vista. In democracy, power is not a means to fulfil your whims, but is a medium for public service and public welfare,” he said in another tweet in Hindi.The Congress has been accusing the Central government of trampling the rights of farmers who have been protesting against the Centre’s new agri-marketing laws.Another Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said the existing Parliament building built by the British “bears a remarkable similarity to the Chausath Yogini Temple in Morena in Madhya Pradesh, while the new ‘atmanirbhar’ Parliament building bears an eerie likeness to the Pentagon in Washington DC”.He also shared pictures of the old and new Parliament buildings and that of the Pentagon and the Morena temple to draw a comparison.Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said, “The foundation for a new Parliament building was laid on the ruins of a liberal democracy.”Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said the decision to build the new building was “heartless”, “senseless” and “shameless”.“At a time when the nation is going through economic recession, the BJP instead of giving any concession is taking out an ‘extravaganza procession,” he said.Meanwhile, Dalit leader Udit Raj organised a protest march near Parliament against laying the foundation stone of the new building. The demonstration took place when the PM was laying the foundation stone of the new Parliament building.“Our demand was to name the new building after BR Ambedkar. The heavy police presence did not allow the marchers to reach the Parliament,” he said.“Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Indian Constitution, deserves this honour. He is the voice of the voiceless people,” the national chairman of the Confederation of SC/ST organisations said in a statement.Indian Parliament’s new building will have a triangular shape to reflect the importance of triangles being a sacred geometry in various religions, while its interiors will have three national symbols as their main themes—Lotus, Peacock and Banyan Tree.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday laid the foundation stone for the new building, which is expected to be completed by the 75th anniversary of India’s independence and is estimated to cost Rs 971 crore.The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project.The Congress has been opposing the redevelopment project and the new Parliament building. It has maintained that the need of the hour is not to go ahead with the ambitious project, but to spend the resources in rebuilding India and giving a boost to the country’s economy which has been hit by COVID-19 pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-would-a-building-represent-when-it-is-built-after-trampling-democracy-cong-on-new-parliament-building-182431
10-12-2020||New Delhi||Protesting farmers threaten to block railway tracks if demands not met||The farmers who have been agitating for the past two weeks against the new agriculture laws on Thursday announced that they will block railway tracks if their demands are not met by the government.The farmer unions, which held a meeting on Thursday, said they will soon announce a date for blocking tracks across the country.Addressing reporters at the Delhi's Singhu border where they have been protesting for almost two weeks to demand a rollback of the agri laws, the farmer unions also reiterated that they will intensify their agitation and start blocking all highways leading to the national capital.“We will block railway tracks if our demands are not met. We will decide on the date and announce it soon. The blocking of tracks will not be limited to Haryana and Punjab but it will be done across the country," farmer leader Boota Singh said at the press conference.       The announcement by farmers came on the day Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was not proper to announce the next stage of agitation when talks were continuing and urged the unions to return to the discussion table.Tomar also urged farmer union leaders to consider proposals sent to them to break the deadlock over protests against the three new farm laws and said the government was ready for further discussions with them any time."The Centre has admitted that laws have been made for traders. If agriculture is a state subject, the central government does not have right to make laws on it," said Balbir Singh Rajewal, another leader.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at various border points for almost two weeks seeking a repeal of the new agri laws, which they claim were aimed at benefitting corporates by weakening the 'mandi' system and the minimum support price (MSP) regime for procurement of farm produce.The government had on Wednesday proposed to give a "written assurance" that the existing MSP regime for procurement would continue.However, the farmers' unions rejected the proposal and said they would intensify their agitation until the government accepts their demand for a complete repeal of the three laws.The government has also proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues, including one to allay fears about the weakening of the 'mandi' system."Five rounds of talks have already been held with the government, but they remained inconclusive. So far, the government has not sent us any invitation for another round of talks. If government sends us proposal for a meeting, we will decide it in our meeting," said farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka.Asked about solution to ongoing standoff with the government, Kakka said, "Only God knows.""We are facing a lot of difficulties due to cold weather and the COVID-19 pandemic, but despite this, we will continue our protest until our demands are met," Kakka added.

10-12-2020||New Delhi||MeToo: Akbar ‘deliberately’, ‘mischievously’ misread her article, Ramani tells court||Journalist Priya Ramani on Thursday told a Delhi court hearing a criminal defamation complaint filed by former Union minister MJ Akbar against her that there has been “deliberate” and “mischievous” misreading of her article in which she wrote about the alleged sexual harassment incident.Ramani, who had accused Akbar of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago, stated this through senior advocate Rebecca John during the final hearing of the matter.She claimed that she has spoken the truth about the allegations against Akbar, made in the wake of the #MeToo movement in 2018, in good faith, which related to public interest and was not defamatory.Akbar had filed the complaint against Ramani for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct around two decades ago when he was a journalist.The court has put up the matter for further hearing on December 14.John said only the first four paragraphs of the article in the magazine was about Akbar and the rest of it was about other male bosses.“Akbar was creating unnecessary controversy before the court by misreading an article in the way it was not written. There has been deliberate and mischievous misreading of the Vogue article. Ramani has explained the context that only the first four paragraphs relate to Akbar and not the whole article,” John told Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Ravindra Kumar Pandey.The senior advocate further said if Akbar claimed to have “sterling reputation”, then her statement should also be viewed in context of her reputation.“Ramani is a credible witness, a journalist of repute and stature, occupying senior positions in news media and not trying to waste the time of the court in any manner when she forthrightly admitted the publication of her tweet and her article. Her credibility stands established beyond a shadow of doubt.“I also say that not just the truth, Ramani has been able to prove good faith also because there has been no recklessness in the manner in which she has told her story. She is not the only one who has come out with her painful story against Akbar,” John submitted.She further said that Ramani worshipped Akbar’s work while growing up and hence there was no old enmity with him.“She was only 23 years old when the incident happened and hence being of such a young age she did not know how to say no. Ramani’s tweets cannot be read in isolation from all these other tweets and stories made at the same time,” the senior counsel said.John further said Ramani has also been attacked on the ground that there has been delay in reporting the allegations but there was no redressal mechanism in 1993-94, when the incident happened.“Sexual harassment at the work place is a matter of public interest. It has been recognised as a violation of the fundamental rights of women. I have spoken my truth and said it in good faith and my truth relates to public interest. It is not defamatory,” she said.Ramani had earlier said that Akbar did not have a ‘sterling reputation’ as claimed by him.She had claimed before the court that a number of women have accused Akbar of sexual misconduct and, by his own account, he was having a consensual relationship while he was married to someone else, which was not a sterling reputation.“He (Akbar) himself says he was in a consensual relationship (with one of his juniors, who, during the #MeToo movement, accused him of rape) which was hampering his family life. Is this the conduct of the man with a sterling reputation? As a man who is married to someone else, he is having a consensual relationship...“At least 15-16 women tweeted against Akbar. Akbar was, according to himself, in a relationship with a junior who was 20 years younger... this is not sterling reputation,” John said.She had claimed in the court that many women had made allegations against Akbar but he chose to file the case against only Ramani.He knew there were other women... he has admitted before the court about reading an article which carried allegations by several women, she said.Akbar had filed the complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018.He had resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment made against him by the women who came forward during the #MeToo campaign.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations false, fabricated and deeply distressing and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/metoo-akbar-deliberately-mischievously-misread-her-article-ramani-tells-court-182428
10-12-2020||New Delhi||'Kung Fu nuns' deliver aid, health advice in pandemic-hit Himalayas||Trekking for hours in the thin air of the Himalayas, hundreds of maroon-robed Buddhist nuns are carrying vital aid - and health advice - to villagers left destitute and sick by COVID-19.Nicknamed the "Kung Fu nuns" because they train in martial arts, the women come from the Drukpa lineage - the only female order in the Buddhist monastic system where nuns have equal status to monks.Besides hauling sacks of staples from rice and lentils to toiletries and face masks on their backs in the harsh mountain conditions, the nuns have been urging villagers to heed the threat posed by COVID-19."The biggest challenge has been explaining to people how dangerous this virus is," Jigme Konchok Lhamo, 28, said about COVID-19, which has killed about 1.57 million people worldwide."People do not take it seriously nor the precautions seriously," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, via video call.The villages receiving aid from the nuns lie on both sides of the India-Nepal border, and some 2,000 poor families have been supported so far.Without regular access to television or the internet for information, the nuns said locals often dismiss the virus as "just a cold", and shrug off their training sessions on social distancing, hand washing and how to wear masks.In recent days, the nuns have been working round-the-clock to get food and hygiene items to a COVID-19-hit village in the mountainous Indian district of Lahaul, which is home to half of the global network of about 700 Drukpa nuns.All of the village's inhabitants have caught the virus, including some of the nuns' own relatives."We are scared ... But fear can't stop us," said Jigme Yeshe Lhamo, 30."We can't change the whole world by ourselves but even if we manage to help one life, that's a big success. We feel happy about it. We feel encouraged," she said.PASSION TO HELPTraditionally, nuns are expected to cook and clean and are not permitted to exercise. But this changed about a decade ago when the leader of the 1,000-year-old sect, His Holiness The Gyalwang Drukpa, encouraged the nuns to learn Kung Fu."They are a new generation of women who are not afraid to break century old taboos and stereotypes," said Carrie Lee, a volunteer and former president of Live to Love International charity that supports the Drukpa nuns."They took their practice off the meditation cushion and into the world – often times against criticism and threats to their safety."When the pandemic took hold, the nuns started working with their families in Ladakh - a remote Buddhist ex-kingdom in the Indian Himalayas - to sew masks for villagers.They have been enlisting support from others too.Nima Sherpa, a 28-year-old woman from northern Nepal, credits the nuns for her passion to help others. She bought essential items for 100 families when the nuns needed help with their distribution drives.Nima, who like most Sherpa goes by her first name, said working on the ground opened her eyes to the kind of hardships villagers were facing as job losses left many unable to pay for groceries or utility bills.Many of the mountain villagers work in road-building and construction, which came to a standstill due to lockdown curbs - decimating household incomes.With schools shut and online classes now the norm, many children have been forced to miss a year of education without access to laptops or the internet.For women, the pandemic has brought additional challenges."When I spoke to my cousin, she said maintaining menstrual hygiene was very difficult because sanitary pads are not available and even if they are, they don't have enough money to purchase them," Nima said.The nuns said their next campaigns would focus on women's health, including menstrual hygiene and teaching villagers how to do breast self-examinations to help detect signs of cancer."We will not only teach about coronavirus precautions but also provide sanitary pads," Yeshe said."It's a very big issue for women." — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kung-fu-nuns-deliver-aid-health-advice-in-pandemic-hit-himalayas-182427

10-12-2020||Jerusalem||India fulfils $5 mn annual commitment to UN agency working for Palestinian refugees||India on Thursday contributed another USD 2 million to the UN Palestine refugee agency, fulfilling its commitment of USD 5 million in aid annually to support its programmes and services, including education, health care, relief and social services for Palestinian refugees.The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has expressed its appreciation for this “generous contribution” coming at a “critical moment” when the coronavirus pandemic has put a huge strain on its operations.The USD 2 million cheque was presented to UNRWA by Representative of India in Palestine, Sunil Kumar, bringing New Delhi’s total contribution to the agency providing basic services to Palestinian refugees to USD 5 million in 2020.India had provided the agency an aid of USD 2 million in May this year which was followed by another contribution of USD 1 million in October.“On behalf of the Government of India, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the remarkable efforts carried out by UNRWA. India shall continue supporting the agency’s activities in providing vital services and necessary humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees,” Kumar said reiterating New Delhi’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause.During an Extraordinary Virtual Ministerial Pledging Conference for UNRWA held on June 23, 2020, Minister of State for External Affairs, V. Muraleedharan, had announced that India will contribute USD 10 million to UNRWA over the next two years.India increased its annual financial contribution to UNRWA from USD 1.25 million in 2016 to USD 5 million in 2018 and 2019.“This generous contribution in support of Palestine refugees at this critical moment is very much appreciated. On behalf of UNRWA, I would like to thank the Government of India for its continued funding to the Agency and its backing of Palestine refugees across the Middle East,” Tamara Alrifai, Acting Director of Department of External Relations of UNRWA, said.Speaking to PTI about the challenges faced by the agency, Sami Mshasha, Director of Communications at UNRWA, recently said that there is “an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty”.UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. “India has been a solid and consistent supporter of Palestinian refugees for decades. This contribution is even more significant as it comes at a critical time.“India is facing a difficult situation at home due to the pandemic and it has still not forgotten the Palestinian refugees and stepped in to help stabilise basic services, including education, health care, relief and social services for Palestinian refugees. I would like to thank the Government of India for its continued funding to UNRWA and its backing of Palestine refugees across the Middle East,” Mshasha said.“UNRWA has been facing a huge budgetary deficit and with an overwhelming majority of the 5.6 million refugees living under poverty line, the ongoing pandemic has broken the backbone of the basic infrastructure in the area they live. India’s contribution seen in that background is timely and much appreciated,” he added.India has also sent medicines and other supplies to the Palestinian National Authority to help in dealing with the COVID-19 situation. UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly in 1949 and mandated to provide assistance and protection to some 5.6 million Palestine refugees registered with the agency across its five fields of operation.Its mission is to help Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip achieve their full human development potential, pending a just and lasting solution to their plight.UNRWA services encompass education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, protection, and microfinance among Palestinian refugees. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Palestine in February 2018, the first-ever trip by an Indian premier, India increased its annual financial contribution fourfold to the UNRWA core budget, from USD 1.25 million to USD 5 million.India has also made a strong appeal to other traditional donors of UNRWA to consider enhancing their contributions as well as to non-donor member states to consider contributing to the agency in solidarity with the Palestine refugees.As part of India’s ongoing assistance programmes in Palestine to strengthen capacity-building efforts focused on institutions, services and training personnel, New Delhi is providing 150 places for Palestinian professionals every year under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme, in addition to the 100 educational scholarships given at the level of graduate, postgraduate and Ph.D. in the Indian Universities for Palestinian students.

10-12-2020||New Delhi||Amit Shah asks CAPFs to furnish leave data of jawans||Union Home Minister Amit Shah has directed all central armed police forces to compile three-year data and inform his ministry if their jawans and officers are utilising their stipulated leave as part of his ambitious proposal that aims at allowing troops spend at least 100 days with their families in a year, officials said on Thursday.The home ministry has directed these forces to depute a senior officer in the rank of an additional director general (in-charge of human resources) to submit a report in this context by the first week of next month.The Central Armed Police Forces or paramilitary forces include the CRPF, BSF, ITBP, CISF and the SSB. The directive is also valid for the Assam Rifles that functions under the administrative command of the home ministry.As per officials and documents accessed by PTI, Shah gave the latest direction after he recently reviewed the progress of the subject he had mooted last year, of ensuring that each jawan and officer of these forces gets to spend at least 100 days in a year with their families.The move was aimed to reduce stress and enhance the happiness quotient of these personnel who work in harsh climatic conditions and long schedule, even as these forces battle regular cases of suicides and fratricidal killings.The home ministry has now sought a point-wise data of leave being granted to personnel from these forces for the current year, last year and 2018 in order to find out if the comparative situation is improving over the years and also if the home minister’s proposal is being implemented on the ground. “The aim of the exercise is to find out if the forces are able to implement the directive. The data will tell the ministry and the home minister about the actual situation on ground and the reasons behind not accomplishing the desired target,” a senior home ministry officer told PTI.He said the ambitious plan can be achieved by undertaking some smart human resource management steps and this will help in improving the overall health of these forces and also the troops.The forces have now been asked to inform the ministry about their total strength; the number of personnel eligible for availing a total of 75 days leave in a year; personnel who were able to consume all the 75 days leave; those who availed leave between 60-74 days and those who could only utilise 45-59 days leave during a year.An average CAPF jawan or officer gets a total of 75 days leave quota and this limit goes up or down in case of specific operational requirements, hard area deployment and posting in remote areas.Shah had mooted the plan in October last year and had directed the CAPFs to implement it by undertaking a mega manpower planning.Following this, a seven-member panel of officers from these forces was created with a two-point terms of reference: (I) to design a software for digitisation of the deployment of the personnel and (ii) propose changes, if any, in service conditions/standard operating procedures of the force in order to give effect to the above (point no 1) objective.It was being planned that in order to implement the 100-day leave plan, the jawans and officers will be posted at units close to their home town or where their family lives so that they can travel and stay with their families when there are no operational exigencies.It was also envisaged that the CAPFs will create or refurbish their establishments so that the families of the troops can come over and live at the location of their posting for a limited time period.These forces are deployed for rendering a variety of internal security duties, border guarding, undertaking anti-Naxal operations and counter-terrorist combat apart from rendering assistance to various state governments during law and order disturbances.

10-12-2020||New Delhi||New Parliament: Triangular shape reflects sacred geometry in various religions; National symbols theme of interiors||Indian Parliament's new building will have a triangular shape to reflect the importance of triangles being a sacred geometry in various religions, while its interiors will have three national symbols as their main themes—Lotus, Peacock and Banyan Tree.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday laid the foundation stone for the new building, which is expected to be completed by the 75th anniversary of India's independence and is estimated to cost Rs 971 crore.The new building, being constructed by Tata Projects Ltd, will come up in front of the existing Parliament House that was built nearly 100 years ago at a cost of Rs 83 lakh at that time and would eventually be turned into a museum.The new building will house larger Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Halls, with capacities of 888 seats and 384 seats respectively, to accommodate an expanded Parliament after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026. The Lok Sabha Hall will also have additional capacity, up to 1272 seats, to host joint sessions."The new Parliament building is designed in a triangular shape, since it sits on a triangular plot and has three main spaces—Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and a Cental Lounge. Also, triangles are sacred geometries in various religions and cultures of the country," the new building's architecture Bimal Patel told PTI."In the Lok Sabha chamber, we have used the national bird Peacock as its theme, in Rajya Sabha chamber we have used the national flower Lotus as its theme and in Central Lounge courtyard we have used the national tree Banyan as its theme," Patel said.The National Emblem will crown the new Parliament building.He said the architecture of the new building is in harmony with the present building so that both buildings complement each other.The ceiling of the new Parliament building will have fresco paintings like that of Rashtrapati Bhawan and carpets will have traditional designs, instead of the current single colour carpets, Patel said.To retain some of the characteristics of the existing Parliament, the interior walls of the new one will have shlokas inscribed on them.Dholpur stone will be largely used, as is the case with the existing Parliament, and in some interior portions, red granite may be used in place of the red sandstone.This will be a building with most modern facilities but displaying our culture and tradition as well, the eminent architect said.The four-storey building will be built on 64,500 square metres area.The new building has been designed by Ahmedabad-based HCP Design and Management Pvt Limited and the construction would be carried out by Tata Projects Ltd.It will be equipped with all modern audio-visual communication facilities and data network systems. Special care is being taken to ensure all environmental safeguards are followed, including minimal disturbance to Parliament sessions during construction work, officials said.Along with necessary facilities like committee rooms, major offices of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, Lok Sabha Secretariat and Rajya Sabha Secretariat, and appropriate dining facilities, it will also include publicly accessible museum-grade galleries and exhibits.The central Constitution Hall and Gallery will showcase the Indian Constitution and other artefacts of India's heritage, symbolically and physically putting people at the heart of Indian democracy, officials said.Provisions in the furniture will be made for smart displays and biometrics for ease of voting with an intuitive and graphical interface, digital language interpretation and recording infrastructure to produce real-time metadata, programmable microphones that put the control of managing the house with the speaker.The design of interiors will be detailed through virtual sound simulations to set the right levels of reverberation sound and limit the echo will be some of the audio-visual tech-features of the new facility.The new Parliament building's architecture and aesthetics will take reference from the present Parliament building, other buildings of the Central Vista, and the classical, folk and tribal arts and crafts of India.The elevation is designed taking references from the facade of the present building in architectural language as well as materiality.The architectural strategy is to harmonise the two buildings such that they work in conjunction.After the new building is completed, the present building will be appropriately retrofitted and refurbished as per heritage conservation standards, and the two will be used in conjunction.The new Parliament building, along with the present Parliament building, library, annexe and the proposed chambers for Members of Parliament will form the Legislative Enclave.Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha will be served by spacious lobbies, seating arrangements for the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha provide all members with comfortable seating, desks and highly efficient audio-visual equipment for each seat, officials said.There would be adequate space for offices for all key functionaries of Parliament and their administrative staff, cafe and dining facilities, committee meeting rooms, common rooms, ladies' lounge and VIP lounges.A central courtyard will provide for an open meeting space for Members of both houses along with an adjoining cafe.There will be museum grade galleries and exhibits which will be accessible to all. Chambers for all Members of Parliament are proposed in close proximity of both the facilities.It is designed to have VVIP access at the subterranean level, freeing up ground floor entrances for use by the public and official. The proposed Parliament will also be fully accessible for the disabled and the halls have very effective emergency evacuation provisions.The facility is designed to have a high level of security.The entrances would include a ceremonial one for President and Prime Minister, one for Lok Sabha Speaker, Rajya Sabha Chairman and Members of Parliament, and two public entrances.The existing Parliament House Estate presently comprises the Sansad Bhawan (Parliament House), Reception Office Building, Sansadiya Soudha (Parliament House Annexe), Extension to Parliament House Annexe and Sansadiya Gyanpeeth (Parliament Library Building) surrounded by extensive lawns around it.The Parliament House Annexe, the Parliament Library Building and the Extension to Parliament House Annexe were added to the Parliament House Complex in 1975, 2002 and 2017, respectively. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-parliament-triangular-shape-reflects-sacred-geometry-in-various-religions-national-symbols-theme-of-interiors-182413
10-12-2020||New Delhi||Sisodia’s residence attacked by BJP goons: AAP||The AAP on Thursday claimed that the house of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia was “attacked by BJP goons”.The Delhi BJP, however, refuted the allegations, saying their protest was peaceful.The BJP workers earlier staged a protest near Sisodia’s residence over an alleged conspiracy to kill mayors and leaders of the party-ruled municipal corporations staging an indefinite dharna demanding payment of dues from the Kejriwal government.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also condemned the incident and wondered why the BJP was “getting so desperate by the day in Delhi”.“I strongly condemn the systematic, organised and violent attack on Dy CM Manish Sisodia’s home. The goons entered his house in police presence when he was away. Why is BJP getting so desperate by the day in Delhi?” he tweeted.Addressing a press conference, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj alleged that the police did not stop the goons from entering Sisodia’s residence and even removed the barricades around the house.He also played a purported video of the outside area of Sisodia’s residence where a group of people can be seen forcefully entering inside.“BJP goons attacked the house of deputy chief minister while he was not at home. The Delhi Police helped the BJP goons in this act,” Bhardwaj added.No immediate reaction was available from the city police.AAP leader Atishi called it a “black day” in Delhi’s political history.“This is a black day in Delhi’s political history that the Union Home Minister is now using his party goons and Delhi Police to attack the family of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in his absence from his residence,” she said at the press conference.Reacting to the charges, Delhi BJP vice president Ashok Goel Devraha claimed AAP leaders were trying to divert attention from the ‘conspiracy’ to kill BJP mayors and other corporation leaders.“We protested outside Sisodia’s residence to make it clear that the BJP workers are capable of answering any form of challenge,” he said.The Delhi BJP had on Wednesday lodged a police complaint against Sisodia and AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, alleging that they were conspiring to kill leaders of the party-ruled municipal corporations.Pathak had rubbished the allegation, saying the BJP has a habit of mixing random audios with random videos to “defame and malign” the image of people.

Exhorting the cadets to maintain the high ideals reflected in the IMA’s code of conduct and pursue excellence, at all times, he stressed that the Army’s reputation rested firmly on their shoulders.He said that they have earned this honour with hard work and they need to retain it by living up to the Army’s core values of character, competence, commitment and compassion.“Once commissioned, you shall be put in a furnace to test your strength and purity. Remember purity of action results from purity of intention. Hence, be genuine in your concerns for your men. If you show them your competence, your men will respect you, but if you show them your concerns, they will trust you and happily take a bullet for the task you assign. Understanding your men by capitalising on their strengths and weaknesses is a continuous learning process and an important human resource management skill which you need to master from experience,” the commandant said.He also extended his compliments to the 70 foreign cadets, stating that the strong bond of togetherness that they have developed in IMA shall foster into a bond that will keep the diplomatic and military ties between our nations strong and vibrant.He expressed confidence that the spirit of the IMA will guide all of them in their future courses of action and they must always endeavour to achieve greatness in whatever they did.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/commandants-parade-for-autumn-term-%E2%80%93-2020-held-at-indian-military-academy-182408
10-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Have given written proposal to farmers, govt always ready for talks: Tomar||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 10Reaching out to agitating farmers, the BJP-led Centre on Thursday said it has given them written proposals addressing their concerns regarding the three Central Farm Acts and two other laws and is ready to discuss any other issues they might have.While unions hardened their stance, the indication from the government regarding the main demand (repealing the three Acts) is also clear that there is no going back on the three laws.“Whenever you are ready, the government is ready for talks,” Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal said on a day ‘jathebandis’ and unions announced further plans for agitation.Listing the many pro-farmer and agriculture measures taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Tomar said the government’s constant effort has been to empower farmers and make agriculture and villages ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant). “Till the time villages and agriculture are self-reliant the country cannot become self- reliant,” Tomar said. Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Power Minister Piyush Goyal addressing a press conference in new Delhi on Thursday. Tribune photo: Mukesh AggarwalSince farmers were not “forthcoming on their issues and were sticking to the demand (of rolling back the Acts),” the government culled out their concerns from several rounds of talks they had and prepared the proposals, Tomar said. “The government has given them a written assurance. If they are still unconvinced we can hold more discussions. We urge them to leave the path of agitation and come to the discussion table. When the dialogue is on it is not correct to announce further agitation,” the Agriculture Minister said. Regarding their main demand, the ministers said laws had been formulated after “due diligence and consultations with stakeholders” and following proper Parliamentary procedure “to benefit farmers and the agriculture sector”. “No law can be completely wrong, you should read the Acts and see for yourself. The government has no doubt that the three laws are for benefit of farmers. We have taken due care and consideration and only then brought the laws. We are only trying to benefit the farmers,” Tomar said, also adding that the “Central Government is well within its Constitutional Rights while making laws on Agricultural trade”.Meanwhile, according to Goyal, ‘panchayat’ election results from Rajasthan are a “proof of farmers’ complete faith” in PM Modi. “There are many farmers who believe there are benefits from law, Rajasthan elections are living testimony to that,” he said. Regarding the demand for a separate law on MSP, Tomar said the “provision has nothing to do with these Acts”. “Prime Minister and I have repeatedly assured the farmers that MSP will remain. The government has done its part, I will again urge farmers that if they want more discussions we are ready for talks. I am hopeful there will be a way,” Tomar said.“When these laws were brought the aim was that farmers get the freedom to sell their produce outside ‘mandis’ without tax. Who can have any objection to that? We thought farmers will take benefit, make use of new technology, get attracted to new crops. The laws were welcomed throughout the country. However, some farmers and unions voiced objections which we tried to address. But even while dialogue was going on with Punjab farmers, unions announced agitation on November 26 and 27,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/have-given-written-proposal-to-farmers-govt-always-ready-for-talks-tomar-182407
10-12-2020||New Delhi||Third wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi ‘on the wane’: Delhi Health Minister||The third wave of COVID-19 pandemic in the national capital is not over yet but it is "definitely on the wane", Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday.Delhi recorded 2,463 new COVID-19 cases and 50 fatalities on Wednesday, the lowest number of deaths in a single day since November 1.As the positivity rate slipped to 3.42 per cent, Jain had on Wednesday tweeted that it was heartening to see that the national capital was "emerging victorious" in the battle against the coronavirus."Cases are falling, and death count in a day is lowest in the last 40 days. The situation has improved, and we can definitely say the third wave of the pandemic here is on the wane. It is not over, but on the wane," he told reporters on Thursday.On plans of COVID-19 vaccination, he said, healthcare workers and frontline staff would be administered the vaccine first, followed by the elderly and then others."If we have vaccine availability, we can vaccinate the entire population in a week's time, we have the preparations ready," he added.Asked about non-COVID-19 patients needing ICU beds, he said, "We will review the situation. But ICU beds can't be managed overnight, if cases suddenly increase, so we had to see the trend stabilise first."He asserted that over 13,000 beds were available for COVID-19 patients in Delhi, which was "not there in any city of the country", adding that 2,500 ICU beds are also available for them.Asked how many people have registered for the COVID-19 vaccine, he said, about two lakh till Wednesday.He reiterated that the overall positivity rate was less than 5 per cent for the last seven days.Also, the RT-PCR positivity rate is now down to 6 per cent, and since early November, a fall of about 80 per cent in positivity rate, which is a satisfactory trend, said Jain.

10-12-2020||Guwahati||Assam NRC published last year not final, HC told||The historic National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam published in August last year was only a “supplementary list” and the final document is yet to come out, state coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma has told the Gauhati High Court.In the “supplementary list” of the NRC, over 10,000 names were either wrongly included or excluded and necessary orders have been issued to delete nearly 4,800 “ineligible persons” from the document, Sarma said in an affidavit to the high court.The final NRC was released on August 31, 2019 by excluding names of 19,06,657 persons. A total of 3,11,21,004 names were included out of 3,30,27,661 applicants.The affidavit was submitted as per an order by the Gauhati High Court in relation to a writ petition by one Rahima Begam against a Nalbari district Foreigners’ Tribunal order, declaring her a foreigner.“...the Supplementary NRC was already published by the LRCPs on 31st August, 2019, but the final National Register of Citizens is yet to be published by the Registrar General of India as per Clause 7 of the Schedule of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003,” it said.Sarma further stated that after the publication of the “supplementary list” of inclusion and exclusion on August 31 last year, some of the District Registrar of Citizens Registers (DRCR) formally requested the NRC state coordinator to “change results” of NRC with “proper reasons”.“Altogether 10,199 Nos. of formal requests were received from DRCRs to change the results of NRC. Out of 10,199 persons, a total of 5,404 numbers were for changing the result from ‘Reject’ to ‘Accept’ and a total of 4,795 numbers were for changing result from ‘Accept’ to ‘Reject’,” he said.It was found that out of the total wrongfully included persons, 1,032 belonged to Declared Foreigners (DF), Doubtful Voters (DV), Persons having cases pending at Foreigners Tribunals (PFT) and their descendants (DFD, DVD, PFTD), he added.There are another 3,763 persons who were found ineligible for other reasons and they are still included in the NRC, the affidavit stated.As per the rules of the NRC, the names of the persons belonging to the three categories cannot be included in the historical document along with their descendants.Sarma said that instructions have been issued to all DRCRs on October 13 this year to issue “speaking orders” for deletion of “names of ineligible persons”.“...it is found that in most of the cases, names of such persons were wrongly included due to data entry errors,” he said in the affidavit.Also, few districts reported that during the hearing, the Disposing Officers could not properly determine the status of DV, DF and PFT categories and their descendants, might be because various state agencies could not guide for correct identification.“Moreover, the Disposing Officers were allowed to take up cases beyond their jurisdiction,” the NRC state coordinator mentioned.On the other hand, a large number of original inhabitants were left out from the draft NRC and some of them did not even submit their claims petitions in the later stages, he added.Sarma said the matching of ‘Family Tree’, which would have been a full-proof method, was not carried out with due diligence in many cases.Though the final NRC was made public last year, it has not been notified by the Registrar General of India yet. This leaves the historic and controversial document without any official validity.After the publication of the final NRC, almost all stakeholders and political parties criticised it as a faulty document, alleging exclusion of indigenous people and inclusion of illegal migrants.

10-12-2020||New Delhi||Priceless: Farmer's son gives away free winter clothes at Singhu border, earns warmth||Not everything comes with a price tag.Not love, not respect, and not the sweaters and jackets that Shakeel Mohammed Qureshi gives away for free to protect farmers protesting at the Singhu border from the biting cold.Around 8 am every day, Qureshi starts setting up his roadside stall, from where he gives locally manufactured warm clothes to farmers protesting at the Delhi-Haryana border against the Centre's three new contentious farm laws.The 35-year-old man, whose father is a farmer in Uttar Pradesh's Baghpat district, has distributed around 300 jackets and sweaters for free among the peasants.On an average, he used to earn a profit of around Rs 2,500 daily by selling winter wear."My father is a farmer, too, so I know that their life is very tough," says Qureshi, who lives in Narela in north Delhi with his wife and children."Farmers don't ask for much from the government, except a fair price for their produce."Unwilling to talk about the price, Qureshi says: "This is my contribution to a good cause. That's all."Help has been pouring in from different quarters for the protesting farmers at the border. While some individuals and NGOs have been organising langars (community kitchens) and distributing items of daily need, others have set up free medical camps.Many have volunteered to clean utensils, collect garbage, charge mobile phones and wash clothes.The farmers have been protesting at several border points around Delhi for the past two weeks over their demands to repeal the new legislations, which they claim would benefit the corporates and end the traditional wholesale markets and the minimum support price regime.The union leaders had rejected a government proposal on Wednesday to amend the new legislations and announced that they would intensify their agitation.Most of the farmers have come prepared, but a few need support to keep fighting, according to Qureshi, who hopes to have a merchandise store of his own before he turns 40.His head held low, Qureshi smiles when a protesting farmer, who just received a free jacket from his stall, says: "God will give you a fortune in return. You have a small shop, but a large heart."As dusk settles, a group of Nihang Sikhs approaches the Samaritan, but he has run out of stock.Assuring the band of Sikh warriors, Qureshi says: "I will be back with jackets for you tomorrow morning." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priceless-farmers-son-gives-away-free-winter-clothes-at-singhu-border-earns-warmth-182402

Nepalese Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali is likely to visit India in the next three weeks."India and Nepal have decided to open flights under a bilateral bubble arrangement, as we have done with several countries," said a source.The flights between the two countries were suspended following the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic."We had proposed to Nepal some time back and Nepal has cleared it now," said a source. It is not immediately known when the flight service will be started.The sources said Shringla, during his visit to Nepal on November 26 to 27 had highlighted the importance of people-to-people connectivity in sync with the special relationship between the two countries."We are starting the service with Indian and Nepalese nationals and holders of Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) cards of all nationalities, and all valid Indian visa holders except tourist visa," the source said.From the Indian side, the flights will be operated by Air India which, in normal times, had a daily flight between Delhi and Kathmandu, the sources said."Air bubble arrangement will follow medical protocols as is being done with other countries which includes RT PCR test report of 72 hours prior to travel," the source said.India has already started air bubble arrangement with several countries.The ties between India and Nepal came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories. India too had published a new map in November 2019 showing the areas as its territories.After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a "unilateral act" and cautioned Kathmandu that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.In June, Nepal's Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it.Last month, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane too had visited Nepal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-nepal-decide-to-resume-flight-services-under-air-bubble-arrangement-182398
10-12-2020||New Delhi||India's iconic circular Parliament—Where country began its 'tryst with destiny'||India's iconic circular Parliament building may be readying to abdicate its position of preeminence to a brand new complex, but its historical relevance remains immortal and it was from here that the country embarked on its "tryst with destiny".It was this building where Bhagat Singh tried to "wake up the British masters", the Constitution came into being, the transfer of power took place from the British and the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi bowed before entering for the first time as an MP, and all of this cannot be forgotten, former Lok Sabha Secretary General Subhash Kashyap told PTI.Also read: New Parliament will witness making of 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat': ModiAnother former Lok Sabha Secretary General P D T Achary said the historical significance and importance of the current building should be maintained even as a new building was needed going forward. He asserted that any attempt to "hide the building" with other surrounding buildings that would come up, will be "violence to history".Kashyap expressed confidence that the construction of a new building cannot take away the historical importance of the current Parliament building."It is one of the best parliamentary buildings in the world. It should and I believe it will retain its historical importance," he said.The current building has been witness to historic and epoch-changing events -- be it revolutionaries Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt throwing bombs to "wake up" the colonial rulers, the meeting of the Constituent Assembly or the country's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru making his famous "tryst with destiny" speech on the midnight of August 14-15, 1947.The existing building is a British-era building, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi.The foundation stone of the existing Parliament House was laid on February 12, 1921, and the construction took six years and cost Rs 83 lakh at that time. The opening ceremony was performed on January 18, 1927, by the then Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin.The existing building marks a "glorious chapter" in the country's history and it was coming to an end with the new Parliament building set to come up, Achary told PTI.He said the current Parliament House cannot hold all the future MPs as their number would go up when the freeze on the number would be lifted in 2026 and it would not be possible to accommodate the members in the current establishment."Finding a new place is inevitable. For that, the sooner the better. That does not mean the kind of publicity that is being given, which shows that this old Parliament House is of not much significance while the new Parliament will be something much bigger and grander. That projection is not correct," Achary said."Building a new Parliament House is not a bad thing, but I have some reservation about the way it is being projected," he said.Emphasising on the need for a new building, Kashyap said there is only a temporary check on the number of MPs as after 2026 the number of MPs is likely to increase, and then there will be no seating space for them."The needs of Parliament have to be taken care of. In the new technological age, the communication and info techniques call for a new building," he said.Achary also slammed critics who criticize the current building for having colonial baggage, saying if the issue of "imperial stamp" is taken, the first building that will have to be demolished is the Rashtrapati Bhavan because that was the viceroy's house earlier. "I believe that these buildings are some of the grandest buildings in the world and the whole layout of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the South Block and North Block and the Rajpath to India Gate, it's such a grand sight," he said."I have seen many parliaments in the world but this building stands out as a unique kind of building," Achary said.The building has been witness to historic debates, momentous legislations and the growth of India's vibrant democracy. It also braved the 2001 attack by terrorists of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), in which nine people were killed inside the Parliament complex.The current Parliament House building is a massive circular edifice 560 feet in diameter and the open verandah on the first floor is fringed with a colonnade of 144 creamy sandstone columns, each of 27 feet.The focus of the building is the big circular edifice of the Central Hall. On the three axes radiating from this centre are placed the three Chambers for Lok Sabha (House of the People), Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the erstwhile Library Hall (formerly the Chamber of Princes) and between them lie the garden courts.The Supreme Court of India also functioned from the erstwhile Chamber of Princes after it was inaugurated on January 28, 1950, till it moved to the present building in 1958.The Central Hall is a place of great historical significance as the transfer of power on the midnight of August 14-15 from British to Indian hands took place in this hall. The Indian Constitution was also framed in the Central Hall. The Constituent Assembly met there from December 9, 1946, to January 24, 1950.Apart from the fact that the building was built with indigenous material and by Indian labour, the architecture of the building bears a close imprint of the Indian tradition.The new building will have an area of 64,500 square metres and is being built at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore. The construction of the new building is estimated to take 21 months and the government expects it to be ready by the 75th anniversary of India's independence in 2022.

But, on October 6, he divorced after saying, triple talaq three times.     The couple lived at a rented home in Tolichowki, and later at Malakpet in Hyderabad briefly.  Later, Ahmed left for the US and visited Fatima every six months. He last visited his wife in the month of February. The marriage was registered with the Telangana Waqf Board, and the wedding rituals were performed as per Islamic laws. "Ahmed called my father from Boston, and asked where I was, my father answered, that I was sitting next to him. He then issued triple talaq with my father as a witness. I need help from the government, I went to the police station, but didn't get any help. I am appealing to the government to help get me justice," said Fatima.   Fatima also reached out to her mother-in-law in Dubai, and her sister-in-law in London, who were at first sympathetic and willing to help resolve the issue, but later stopped attending her phone calls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hyderabad-woman-alleges-husband-gave-triple-talaq-from-us-over-phone-182396
10-12-2020||Kolkata||Ex-Bengal CM Buddhadeb's health condition improves but critical, says doctor||The health condition of former West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya improved a bit on Thursday but remained "critical", hospital sources said.The 76-year-old politician is "still on ventilator support", they said."His health condition has improved a bit. He is also maintaining a steady PCO2 level and the reading of which is at 42 this morning. This is normal for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patients."He is still on mechanical ventilator support and his condition remains critical," a senior official of the hospital where he is undergoing treatment said.His cardiac condition, pulse rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation level are currently stable, the hospital said in a statement."Preliminary investigation, including blood parameters and imaging, didn't show any significant abnormality. Sedation was stopped in the morning as a trial and the patient's sensorium was assessed and found to have improved," it said.A seven-member team of doctors reviewed the health condition of the veteran CPI(M) leader."He will remain on mechanical ventilation for today and the process of gradual withdrawal from the ventilator support is being planned," the statement said.Bhattacharya was put on the mechanical ventilator support at the critical care unit of the private hospital where he was admitted on Wednesday afternoon as his breathing-related problems aggravated.Talking about his next course of treatment, a senior doctor said that adequate nutrition and other support is being taken care of."As he is still on the ventilator support, the prognosis is guarded and critical. The doctors are keeping a constant vigil on his health condition and taking appropriate measures," he said.Members of Bhattacharya's family were briefed about his health condition and CPI(M) state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra visited the hospital during the day.The veteran CPI(M) leader's oxygen saturation level is at around 90-95 per cent, and he has regained consciousness, the doctor said.Bhattacharya tested negative for COVID-19 but the CT scan of his brain showed old lacunar infarcts.The CPI(M) leader was initially put on non-invasive ventilation (BIPAP) at the hospital after which his oxygen saturation level improved to 95 per cent.However, his condition deteriorated on Wednesday evening and he was put on mechanical ventilator support.Bhattacharya, who was the chief minister of West Bengal from 2000 to 2011, has been suffering from COPD and other old age-related ailments for quite some time. He has been away from public life for the past few years due to his health.He had stepped down from the CPI(M)'s politburo and the central committee in 2015, and gave up membership of the state secretariat in 2018.

Comprehensive and widespread testing on a sustained basis has resulted in bringing down the positivity rate," the ministry said.In a span of  24 hours, 31,521 persons were found to be COVID-19 positive in the country while 37,725 new recoveries were registered in the same duration which has led to a further contraction of the active caseload.India's present COVID-19 active caseload of 3,72,293 consists of just 3.81 per cent of total infections reported so far.The total recovered cases have surpassed 92.5 lakh (92,53,306)."The gap between recoveries and active cases is steadily increasing and presently stands at 8,881,013," the ministry highlighted.It said 77.30 per cent of the new recovered cases is contributed by ten states and UTs.Maharashtra saw 5,051 persons recovering from COVID-19.

10-12-2020||Bengaluru||Amit Ahuja, Jairam Ramesh joint winners of Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay NIF Book Prize 2020||Amit Ahuja, an Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of California-Santa Barbara and Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh were on Thursday declared the joint winners of the Rs. 15 lakh Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay NIF Book Prize for 2020 for their works "Mobilizing the Marginalised: Ethnic Parties without Ethnic Movements" and "A Chequered Brilliance: The Many Lives of VK Krishna Menon".They were selected from a diverse shortlist of six books covering a century of modern Indian history and encompassing several genres.Ahuja's book, the jury said, "is an outstanding first book by a young scholar. Through extensive field research in four states, Ahuja unravels an intriguing puzzle: why is it that Dalit ethnic parties perform poorly in states where their social mobilization has historically been strong, yet perform well in states where such mobilization has historically been weak?"He also shows how the social mobilization of Dalits, dividing their support across parties, results in superior welfare outcomes than when they vote as a bloc for one ethnic party. This is an elegantly written and accessible work of scholarship that richly illuminates the relationship between social movements and political parties in redeeming the promise of Indian democracy for marginalized groups." Ramesh's book, the jury said, "is an engaging biography of an important supporting player in Indian politics, whose career spanned decades of political work, first in Britain and later in India. The book provides fascinating insights into the personal and public life of Krishna Menon: his friendships and animosities, his foibles and strengths, and the multiple facets of his life as editor, publisher, lawyer, councillor, propagandist, diplomat, and cabinet minister."Ramesh chronicles Menon's relentless campaign for India's freedom in Britain and the ups and downs of his close relationship with Jawaharlal Nehru. The opprobrium surrounding his role in the disastrous (from an Indian point of view) conflict with China in 1962 have tended to obscure from public memory his diplomatic achievements, especially his celebrated performance at the United Nations in the 1950s, and this book places on record the evidence on all these issues without partisan judgment. Ramesh has delved deep into new archival materials to produce a compelling portrait of a brilliant, complicated, and controversial man, whose public life came to a rather tragic end."The winners were selected by a six-member jury comprising political scientist and author Niraja Gopal Jayal (Chair), historian and critically acclaimed author Ramachandra Guha; entrepreneur and author Nandan Nilekani; historian and author Srinath Raghavan; historian and author Nayanjot Lahiri; and Manish Sabharwal, Chairman, Teamlease Services.Established in 2018, the Kamaladevi NIF Book Prize builds on the New India Foundation's mission of sponsoring high-quality research and writing on all aspects of Independent India. The Prize celebrates high-quality, non-fiction literature by emerging writers from all nationalities, published in the previous calendar year.The prize was named after Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, the great patriot, and institution-builder who had contributed significantly to the freedom struggle, to the women's movement, to refugee rehabilitation and to the renewal of handicrafts. IANSKamaladevi Chattopadhyay was a social reformer and a freedom fighter.

No immediate comment was available from Surjit Singh.According to the FIR, the constable has also accused Khajan and Surjit of running a "sex scandal" in the force and alleged that they had "many accomplices".Khajan Singh, a DIG-rank officer in the force, who won a silver medal at the 1986 Seoul Asian Games, told PTI: "These allegations are absolutely false. This has been done just to spoil my image."               In the FIR registered at Baba Haridas police station on December 3, the complainant, who joined the force in 2010, alleged that the two sexually harassed women constables and later used them as "their accomplices"."They secretly took my photos while I was taking a bath. I was blackmailed through these photographs and they threatened that if I did not talk to them, they would circulate my photos on the Internet," the constable alleged in the FIR.CRPF spokesperson Moses Dhinakaran said, "FIR of rape charges filed against Khajan Singh, DIG, by a constable woman. CRPF has taken a serious note of the complaint and has constituted an internal complaint committee headed by an Inspector General-level officer to conduct an inquiry." "As far as the FIR is concerned, the department will facilitate the investigation agency in all respects," the spokesperson said.Khajan Singh was bestowed the Arjuna award in 1984. Hugely successful at the national level, Khajan clinched multiple gold medals at the South Asian Games (then known as South Asian Federation Games) in 1984 and 1989.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka), Santosh Kumar Meena, said, "As per the complaint received, we have registered a case and an investigation is under way."             Police said the statement of victim is yet to be taken because she is currently out of station."They threatened me (constable) with making my photos viral on the Internet and used it for raping me continually over three years," it has been alleged in the FIR.It also stated that the two allegedly harassed her through showcause notices.The FIR also stated that in March 2014, the woman constable had filed a formal complaint with the CRPF Inspector General, but she was allegedly forced by the accused to withdraw it.It also stated that she had also written a letter to the National Commission of Women (NCW) chairperson seeking action against the two.In her complaint to the NCW chief, she had sought protection.

10-12-2020||Nagpur||CJI SA Bobde's mother duped of Rs 2.5 crore by family property caretaker; accused held||The mother of all heist happened when Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde's mother was cheated of over two crore. The shocking development came to light when Nagpur Police arrested one of two persons involved in the crime, top officials said.The prime accused Tapas Ghosh, 49, was nabbed while his wife, who is named in the police complaint, is under investigations, said Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar told IANS.He was produced before the court and remanded to police custody till December 16, while further investigations in the matter are underway, said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone II) Vinita Sahu.When queried by IANS, the DCP declined to reveal further details as the probe is still underway by a Special Investigation Team, under her supervision.As per a complaint lodged in August with Sitabuldi Police Station by the CJI's mother Mukta Bobde, she is the owner of a hereditary property, Seadon Lawns, near the Akashwani Square which was hired out for weddings and other functions.As the manager of the property since over 12 years, Ghosh was paid a salary and commission on the rentals which he used to collect on her behalf.Owing to the complainant's advanced age and frail health, the accused couple allegedly forged receipts of the income from the property and did not deposit the entire amounts collected.The goings-on came to light during the pandemic lockdown when many customers cancelled their bookings but failed to get their refunds.When the fraud came to light around four months ago, the Bobde family approached the police which set up a SIT and the subsequent probe unearthed the scam worth around Rs 2.50 crore, sending the police and political circles in a tizzy.Under DCP Sahu's supervision, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) is probing the matter from all angles, including the possible involvement of any more persons besides the couple.

10-12-2020||New Delhi||New Parliament will witness making of 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat': Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building here at an event that was attended by leaders from various political parties, cabinet ministers and ambassadors of different countries.Describing the laying of foundation stone of the new Parliament building as a "milestone in India's democratic history", Prime Minister Narendra Modi said if the old Parliament house gave direction to the country post-independence, the new one would be a witness to the making of a self-reliant India.Also read: India's iconic circular Parliament—Where country began its 'tryst with destiny'Addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone of the new building and performing the ground-breaking ceremony, Modi said many new things were being done in the new Parliament House, which will increase the efficiency of the MPs as modern methods will be incorporated in the work culture."It is a very historic day. Today is a milestone in India's democratic history," he said."We, the people of India, will together build this new building of Parliament. This new building will be an inspiration when India will celebrate its 75 years of independence," Modi said."I can never forget the moment in my life when I had the opportunity to come to Parliament House for the first time in 2014 as an MP. Before stepping in, I bowed and saluted this temple of democracy," he said.If the old Parliament House gave direction to India post-independence, the new building would be a witness to the creation of a self-reliant India, Modi said."If work was done to fulfil the needs of the country in the old Parliament building, then the aspirations of 21st century India will be fulfilled in the new building," the prime minister said.Priests from the Sringeri Math Karnataka did the rituals for the 'bhoomi pujan' at the new Parliament building site and it was followed by a 'sarva dharma prarthana' (inter-faith prayer).Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, Urban Development Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh also offered prayers during the ceremony.The new building will have an area of 64,500 square metres.The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building. Modi also performed the ground-breaking ceremony for the building, which is expected to be completed by 2022.The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while the Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for members. The Lok Sabha chamber will have an option to increase its sitting capacity to 1,224 members during joint sessions.This has been done keeping in mind the future increase in the number of members for the two houses.At present, Lok Sabha has a sanctioned strength of 543 members and Rajya Sabha 245.In September this year, Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new Parliament building. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project.The existing building is a massive circular edifice of 560 feet in diameter. The Parliament House Estate is enclosed by an ornamental red sandstone wall or iron grills with iron gates that can be closed when occasions demand. The building has 12 gates.

The administration has completely failed and goonda raj prevails," he later told a meeting of party workers.Nadda said he was not hurt as he was travelling in a bullet proof car, but others in the convoy were assaulted.When such a thing can happen to senior leaders of the BJP, the plight of common party cadres can be easily imagined, he said."If I have reached here for the meeting it is due to Maa Durga's grace...I can imagine how difficult it is for common party workers in Bengal," he said.Nadda asserted the days of the TMC government are numbered."We have to defeat this goonda raj and we will," he said, adding "the state has reached a new low under the misrule of the TMC government".Without naming Abhishek Banerjee, Nadda referred to him and said it is a matter of shame for democracy that the present MP of Diamond Harbour is not seen in his constituency.Vijayvargiya's car was ransacked and he also received injuries.Vehicles occupied by media,too, were not spared."When we were on our way to Diamond Harbour, TMC supporters blocked the road and pelted Naddaji's vehicle and other cars in the convoy with stones. This only shows the true colour of the TMC," Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh told PTI.Ghosh said his car too was ransacked and security personnel were beaten up.Vehicles of BJP national joint general secretary (organisation) Shiv Prakash and secretary Anupam Hazra were also damaged. Hazra too received injuries in the melee."Does rule of law exist in Bengal at all? The convoy of our national president is being attacked. Our party cadres and leaders are injured. This is unprecedented in democracy," Vijayvargiya said."The party will end this jungle raj in West Bengal. Is this a sign of democracy? The TMC government should be ashamed for letting loose such anarchy," Ghosh said.The situation was brought under control after the police intervened and cleared the road for the convoy to pass.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naddas-convoy-attacked-in-bengal-vijayvargiyas-vehicle-ransacked-watch-video-182376
10-12-2020||United Nations||Our Indo-Pacific approach is based on cooperation and collaboration: India tells UN||India has said its concept of the Indo-Pacific is "inclusive" in nature and is based on cooperation and collaboration, given the need for shared responses to the shared challenges in the strategically important region.India calls for a free, open and inclusive order in the Indo-Pacific, based upon respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations, peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue and adherence to international rules and laws, First Secretary and Legal adviser in India's Permanent Mission to the UN Yedla Umasankar said on Tuesday."India's concept of the Indo-Pacific is inclusive in nature, and supports an approach that respects the right to freedom of navigation and overflight for all in the international seas," he said."India's Indo-Pacific vision is premised upon the principle of ‘ASEAN-Centrality'. India's approach is based on cooperation and collaboration, given the need for shared responses to shared challenges in the region," Umasankar said. Speaking in the UN General Assembly on ‘Oceans and the Law of the Sea', Umasankar said "we cannot allow our seas to turn into zones of contention. Secure and open sea lanes are critical for peace, stability, prosperity and development.” India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military manoeuvring in the region.China claims nearly all of the disputed South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam all claim parts of it. Beijing has built artificial islands and military installations in the South China Sea.India also reiterated the importance of freedom of navigation and overflight on the high seas, unimpeded lawful commerce, as well as resolving maritime disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).“We have seen instances where decisions of international judicial bodies are not being respected or given effect to by countries. This is clearly unacceptable. We call on all member states to respect rule of law at the international level,” Umasankar said, apparently referring to China.In 2016, an arbitration tribunal under the UNCLOS ruled that there was no evidence that China had historic rights to the waters or resources in the South China Sea that fell within its "nine-dash line", and was violating Philippine's sovereign rights with its operations there. Beijing has rejected the ruling by the tribunal.Umasankar also stressed that terrorism and transnational crimes such as drug and weapons smuggling, human trafficking and piracy could also have a similar impact on maritime activities.“Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and natural disasters are other issues that could have a catastrophic impact on all maritime activities and the environment as such. It would be evident that no nation however powerful or rich would have the resources to meet all the above tasks alone,” he said.Emphasising that oceans are a common concern of mankind, Umasankar said cooperation between all stakeholder nations to ensure peace and stability in the seas is essential to safeguard common maritime interests and in furthering human development.“Trust and confidence between nations are essential to ensure cooperative security,” he said.Voicing concern that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the implementation of ocean-related work programmes, Umasankar said the work of international tribunals involved in the settlement of maritime disputes and various capacity-building activities has been affected.“In this context, COVID-19 shows us the importance of preserving ecosystems and biodiversity, and marine biodiversity is no exception,” he said.India, with a vast coastline of more than 7,500 km and over thousand islands whose one-third population lives along the coast, has a longstanding maritime tradition and abiding interest in ocean affairs.A seafaring nation with a large coastal economy, India is acutely aware of the challenges and opportunities that oceans represent and recognises Blue Economy as a driver of inclusive and sustainable economic growth and development, he said.“We must work towards innovative technologies for offshore renewable energy, aquaculture, deep seabed mining and marine biotechnology which provide a new source of jobs. The need for ‘greening' the ocean economy is also gaining importance,” Umasankar said.He noted that India is concerned with the illegal fishing practices and those relating to maritime safety and security, including the acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea.“India is strongly committed to protecting its coastal and marine environment and attaches special importance to prevent and significantly reduce marine debris and litter by 2025, through global action and collective efforts of all stakeholders. We have also undertaken the commitment to eliminate single-use plastic in India by 2022,” he said.The General Assembly postponed action on the omnibus draft resolution ‘Oceans and the law of the sea' to enable its Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) to review its programme budget implications.That text would, among other things, have the world body reaffirm the unified character of the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the vital importance of preserving its integrity.

10-12-2020||New Delhi||Now, threat of indefinite anti-farm law protests in other parts of country||As farmers on Thursday turned down conciliatory proposals offered by the Narendra Modi-led BJP government, they made another significant announcement. According to Kavitha Kuruganti of Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch, one of the 40 unions invited for the talks with Union Ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash, on December 14 there is a call to all north Indian farmers to come to Delhi. Also read: Farmers’ protest: Delhi Traffic Police inform commuters about closed routes"On the same day, farmers in South India and other distant states will protest at district headquarters, and indefinite protest sites will be started," she said. It is an eventuality that could spell more trouble for the Narendra Modi government which is facing a domestic situation quite unlike any it has dealt with in the past six years in power. The only time it was forced to make some sort of a U-turn on an issue was in 2015 when it agreed to drop amendments to the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. The government had also shelved the idea regarding tax concessions to corporates after the famous ‘suit-boot ki sarkar’ jibe by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, will also be witnessing the mother of all protests against corporates. The farmers have also given a call for "boycotting Jio services and Adani/Ambani malls and products."The offer of nine amendments in five laws has been rejected by unions, who also declared to intensify their agitation. While BJP leaders quoted Rajasthan panchayat, Greater Hyderabad municipal and Bihar victories to claim endorsement of new farm laws by rural India, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar called deliberations with farmers “work in progress”.It remains to be seen whether the PM Modi will be the last stop in the government’s strategy after Amit Shah’s surprise intervention but so far there is no clarity over the next round of talks after the cancellation of the scheduled sixth-round on Wednesday. Farmers' leaders indicate a window in case they find "some acceptable offers". While the BJP-led Centre is under pressure to resolve the issue, farmer leaders are also under pressure to not give in. The agitation is now spilling beyond Delhi, which continues to be the main point of farmers’ protest. The government may be working on support from some unions on its middle path proposal but the majority of farmers are not in the mood to listen, calling its proposals an “insult”.Centre's proposals FTPC Act 1. State governments can collect market cess/fees on transactions outside the market yards also if they want.2. State governments can do the registration of traders if they want. 3. Farmers will be able to go to Civil Courts for dispute resolution, in addition to existing mechanisms in the law.*FAPAFS Act (Contract Farming Promotion Act)4.

10-12-2020||New Delhi||Need to avoid actions that may complicate situation: Rajnath||In a veiled reference to China's aggressive military behaviour, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said exercising self-restraint in the conduct of activities and avoiding actions that may further complicate situation will go a long way in bringing sustained peace to the region.He was speaking at the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus), a platform comprising 10-nation ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and its eight dialogue partners including India and China.Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe was among those who attended the virtual meeting, officials said.In his address, Singh talked about "the current regional environment with visible strains", and appreciated the central role of ASEAN-led forums, including ADMM-Plus in promoting dialogue and engagement towards a pluralistic, cooperative security order in Asia. "As we enhance mutual trust and confidence, exercising self-restraint in the conduct of activities and avoiding actions that may further complicate the situation, will go a long way in bringing sustained peace to the region," he said. Singh's comments came amid the seven-month-long military standoff between India and China in eastern Ladakh and Beijing's increasingly expansionist behaviour in the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific.  The defence minister also said that the ability of the grouping to collectively respond to challenges based on the fundamentals of freedom, inclusivity and openness in the region will define its future."Threats to the rules-based order, maritime security, cyber-related crimes and terrorism, just to name a few, remain the challenges that we need to address as a forum," Singh said at the virtual meeting.The defence minister also talked about the outlook on the Indo-Pacific, saying it underscores the impetus to cultivate strategic trust and continuously promote ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture."The concepts of 'vasudhaive kutumbakam' – 'the whole world is one family' and 'sarve bhavantu sukhinah' – 'all be at peace' are the core of the Indian civilisation. Therefore, inclusivity, equality and openness are the principles underlining this concept," he said.The defence minister also called for sustained efforts to address the threats of bio-terrorism, transnational trafficking and pandemics, and emphasised on building capacity to address shared security challenges. "Our composition is another pillar of our strength as it includes defence ministries of 18 key countries that are major stakeholders in the regional security dynamic," he said. In his address, Singh also underlined the need for confronting the challenges emerging from the coronavirus pandemic."Amongst the new challenges that have emerged, COVID-19 has changed the world and left us many hurdles to overcome. Unfortunately, the disruptive effect of the pandemic is still unfolding," the defence minister said."The challenge is, therefore, to make sure that the world economy moves on the path of recovery and when it does gather steam, to ensure that the recovery leaves no one behind," he added.The inaugural ADMM-Plus was convened in Hanoi in 2010. The defence ministers then had agreed on five areas of practical cooperation to pursue under the new mechanism, including maritime security, counter-terrorism, humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations. The ties between India and ASEAN have been on an upswing in the last few years with the focus being on ramping up cooperation in the areas of trade and investment as well as security and defence.Besides 10 ASEAN countries, the ADMM-Plus includes Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States.

10-12-2020||Ghaziabad||Two men held for attacking PTI photojournalist||The Ghaziabad Police has arrested two people in connection with the attack on a Press Trust of India (PTI) photojournalist and his fiancée in the district two days ago.Ravi Choudhary and his fiancée were on a motorcycle passing through the Ganga Canal Road in Muradnagar police station area when some miscreants in an SUV had picked up a fight with the couple on Monday.The local police had initially refused to lodge an FIR in the case but later assured action in the matter, according to Chaudhary, whose photograph of a policeman hitting a protesting farmer with a baton recently got widespread attention. “The accused were arrested on Wednesday on a road leading from the Ganga Canal to Niwari. Those held are being sent to jail while a search is on for the other accused in the case,” Ghaziabad Senior Superintendent of Police Kalanidhi Naithani said. “Those held have been identified as Ankit (21) and Nikki Singh (22), both students and natives of Meerut district in western UP,” Naithani said.The police have also impounded the Bolero used in the incident by the accused. “The vehicle used by them was sold and purchased four or five times earlier and that is why it took the police a little time in confirming its history and tracking it down,” Naithani told PTI. “The vehicle bore a sticker of 'Bharat Sarkar' and hence an additional charge of fraud had been added in the case against the accused,” he added.The FIR has been lodged under Indian Penal Code sections 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace), and section 420 (fraud) added, the police said. “An FIR was lodged in the case on Tuesday itself. In a swift action by the police, two accused have been arrested and the Bolero car used in the incident impounded. Further legal proceedings are underway,” the Ghaziabad police said in a Tweet earlier.According to Choudhary, the incident had taken place on a congested stretch of the Ganga Canal Road.The Bolero's driver had stopped him from riding past his vehicle and hurled abuses at him and his fiancée. When Choudhary objected to this, the driver opened his vehicle's door wide to stop him from moving ahead.Three or four men then got out of the vehicle and started thrashing them while a couple of others remained inside the car, the PTI photojournalist said.Choudhary alleged that he and his fiancee were briefly chased by the Bolero when they managed to ride away from the spot.

10-12-2020||Mumbai||Dance pioneer Astad Deboo dies at 73; artistes say India has lost cultural treasure||Contemporary Indian dancer Astad Deboo, known for amalgamating Indian and western dance techniques, died here on Thursday, his family said. He was 73.Deboo employed his training in Indian classical dance forms of kathak as well as kathakali to create a unique fusion dance form."He left us in the early hours of December 10, at his home in Mumbai, after a brief illness, bravely borne," the family announced on social media."He leaves behind a formidable legacy of unforgettable performances combined with an unswerving dedication to his art, matched only by his huge, loving heart that gained him thousands of friends and a vast number of admirers," it said.According to Padma Alva, a long-time friend of Deboo and a former PTI journalist, his funeral was a private affair due to the Covid restrictions."The funeral was held at Worli here at 11 am. It was a private funeral because of Covid restrictions. So only immediate family members were present," Alva said.Deboo is noted for creating a modern dance vocabulary that was uniquely Indian.He once said there was a time when most Indians saw his style as "too western" while westerners found that it was "not Indian enough".His innovative style of Indian dance may have raised some eyebrows in the 1970s and ’80s, but the 1990s saw people embrace this new idiom.Recalling their bond of over four decades, Alva said she had lost a "friend of a lifetime"."Astad called me a few days ago to say it was goodbye. We were in touch every day till Monday when he went under, never to come up again. Have lost a friend of 45 years, a friend of a lifetime," Alva said.Actor Anupam Kher took to Twitter to pay tributes to the dance icon and wrote Deboo's art would be missed."World of modern dance has lost a pioneer and India has lost a cultural treasure. Dearest #AstadDeboo it was a privilege to know you. Will miss your art, warm persona and your infectious smile! Rest in peace my friend!!#OmShanti," Kher said.Filmmaker Nandita Das said Deboo had a lot of dance still left in him. "Just too sad. Knew him and admired him since I was a child. You still had so much to offer #AstadDeboo I have lost too many loved ones this year," Das wrote.Describing Deboo as a "powerhouse of talent", music composer Ehsaan Noorani tweeted that the dancer was a man "who pushed the dimensions of dance".Casting director Tess Joseph said Deboo was not only a generous person but a "visionary and stunning dancer"."When Astad danced, time did stand still," Joseph said.Born on July 13, 1947 in Navsari town of Gujarat, the dancer, who learnt kathak from Guru Prahlad Das from a young age, and later kathakali from Guru EK Pannicker, described his style as "contemporary in vocabulary and traditional in restraint".With a dance career spanning half a century, he had performed in over 70 countries, including solo, group and collaborative choreography with artistes, at home and abroad.Known for his charitable endeavours, Deboo worked with deaf children, both in India and abroad for two decades.In 2002, he founded the Astad Deboo Dance Foundation which provided creative training to marginalised sections, including the differently-abled."He has created a dance-theatre style which successfully assimilates Indian and Western techniques," said the citation for the Sangeet Natak Akademi award he received in 1995 for his contribution to contemporary creative dance. He was also a recipient of the Padma Shri in 2007.Deboo also forayed into other art disciplines, like films, choreographing for directors such as Mani Ratnam, Vishal Bhardwaj and legendary painter MF Hussain’s ‘Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities’.

10-12-2020||---||Lavrov: Quad a new game, West undermining Indo-Russian ties||New Delhi, December 9 Veteran Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s comments on India and the “Quad” and how the India-Russia partnership is being undermined have stirred the strategic community and South Block here. Speaking at the Russian International Affairs Council, Lavrov said India was currently an object of the western countries’ “persistent, aggressive and devious policy”. “They are trying to engage India in anti-China games by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies, the so-called ‘Quad’. At the same time, the West is attempting to undermine Russia’s close partnership and privileged relations with India,” he added. Lavrov said the West had launched a “new game”, postponing Russia and China for later. “It is trying to draw all others into a unipolar world by any means possible,” he said. Lavrov had begun his address by directing his ire against France and Germany for kowtowing to the US agenda. The attitude of the two big European nations had compelled the European Union (EU) to give up claims to its role as a pole in the multi-polar system that is taking shape for objective reasons, he charged. The Russian Foreign Minister has almost given up on Germany, but has hopes for France. “Germany’s recent policy on many issues convinces us that this is exactly what Berlin wants to do (step back from leadership). France has a somewhat different position... If France wants to claim this role, we will have to wait and see what happens,” he observed. Attacking the “rules-based order”, Lavrov said they were invented on the go, at various get-togethers. The Russian Foreign Minister’s ire was instigated by the EU approving a framework for imposing sanctions on a country for human rights abuse. It had earlier adopted the mechanisms of sanctions for chemical and cyber-hacking violations. All these are interpreted as targeted against Russia at Washington’s bidding. Lavrov said, “While raising unilateral structures, the West is doing everything it can to discredit universal bodies or cow them into submission by privatising their secretariats, as we in the case of Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.” “When this fails, they take these issues outside UN structures and universal conventions and impose on others convenient decisions (sanctions) as the ultimate truth, the only correct version of a multilateral approach,” he said.  Moscow offered a “unifying agenda”, where G20 is the only mechanism outside the UNSC where it is still possible to come to terms based on balance of interests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lavrov-quad-a-new-game-west-undermining-indo-russian-ties-182115

The move aims to incentivise creation of new employment opportunities during the Covid recovery phase under the Centre’s “Aatmanirbhar Bharat Package 3.0”.The move is also seen a detour to economically empower people and increase their purchasing to engine the demand supply to get over the post-Covid which is comparatively bearish.

It proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues.In the proposal, sent by Agriculture Ministry Joint Secretary Vivek Aggarwal, the government said it was ready to consider with an open heart the objections raised on the farm laws.Addressing the media later, farmer leaders, including Jangvir Singh Doaba, Rakesh Tikait, Shiv Kumar Kakka, Darshan Pal Singh and Dr Ashok Dhavle, said there was nothing new in the proposal and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had offered the same to them at earlier meetings.It was “completely rejected” by the ‘Sanyukta Kisan Committee’ (united forum of farmers), a body representing various farmers’ unions, they said. Doaba said the Jaipur-Delhi and the Delhi-Agra highways would be sealed to “choke” the Capital. The nationwide protest on December 14 would be organised at the district level, he said. “The farmers will gherao BJP leaders and the party’s offices,” he said.Kakka said they had informed Shah about their “deadline” to repeal the three “black” laws and for a legal guarantee on the MSP. The unions have also decided to boycott the products of certain corporate houses whom they feared the Centre wanted to benefit through the farm laws.Threaten to block all highways to capitalThe farmers on Wednesday called for a district-level nationwide protest on December 14. The protesters also threatened to choke the national Capital by December 12 by blocking the Jaipur-Delhi and the Delhi-Agra expressways and all other roads leading to Delhi.Changes proposed only in 2 legislationsThe government has proposed seven amendments to the two new laws — The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020.

The minister, however, did not reveal India’s position on disengagement and restoration of the May status quo by limiting himself to mentioning multiple layers of communication with China.“Communication is not the issue. The issue is that we have agreements and those agreements are not being observed,” said Jaishankar when asked how New Delhi is dealing with the LAC stand-off. The minister was speaking at a webinar with Australia-based Lowy Institute, chaired by its Executive Director Michael Fullilove.Jaishankar reiterated his statements such as terming the relationship as at its “most difficult phase” and the violation of bilateral pacts by China as having “significantly damaged” bilateral ties. He did not elaborate on the five “different” explanations from the Chinese side.Asked about some perceptions of India moving in an illiberal direction, Jaishankar questioned their motives and understanding of the new political regime in Delhi, besides terming them elitist. Mentioning London-based The Economist, he said for the past few years their political bias was evident.“Those in the West are not able to come to the terms with the ‘deepening of democracy’ in India. They are getting this type of analysis as they are not ‘those’ (the earlier) people. Their (the current regime) social habits are different.

In recently published data from trials in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, Oxford University said the vaccine was more than 90 per cent effective when administered as half a dose followed by a standard dose after 28 days and 62 per cent effective when administered as two full doses 28 days apart.Covishield’s phase-2 and phase-3 trials are underway in India and the results are awaited.
