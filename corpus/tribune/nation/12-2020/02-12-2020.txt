The exams, as and when they are conducted, will be in written mode and not in an online mode. The exams will be conducted following all COVID protocols,” a senior CBSE official said.“In case students are not able to do practicals in classes before the exams, alternatives to practical exams will have to be explored,” the official added.Union Minister of Education Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ is supposed to hold an interaction with students, teachers and parents on December 10 on the issue of conduct of board examinations and competitive examinations next year.Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of COVID-19 and partially reopened in some states from October 15. However, a few states decided to keep them closed in view of a spike in the infections.The board exams that were being conducted in March had to be postponed mid-way. The exams were later cancelled, and the results were announced on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme. Competitive exams like JEE and NEET were also postponed twice this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.There have been demands for postponement of board exams to May in view of the continued closure of schools and teaching-learning activities being completely online.The Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)-Main for admission to engineering colleges across the country is likely to be held in February instead of January, according to officials.The rising number of COVID-19 cases and engineering admission for this year still being underway are among the reasons behind authorities contemplating the move.The JEE-Main, which is the national-level competitive test for admission to various undergraduate engineering and architecture courses, is conducted twice a year – January and April. However, due to the COVID-19 situation, the April exam was postponed twice and conducted in September.

02-12-2020||---||Felling of trees in name of Lord Krishna can’t be allowed, observes SC||New Delhi, December 2Felling of trees “in the name of Lord Krishna” cannot be allowed, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday, asking asked Uttar Pradesh government to evaluate the plants proposed to be cut for its Krishna-Govardhan road project at Mathura.The evaluation has to be done not in terms of their “timber value” but by taking into account factors like their “oxygen producing capacity,” said the apex court.A Bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian noted in the order that the state government was not in a position to “to make a statement as to how the Forest Department” intended to evaluate the trees in question and granted four week time to the authorities to inform it about the method of evaluation it wanted to adopt.The state government and its authorities including the Public Works Department have filed an application seeking nod for felling of 2,940 trees for the Krishna-Govardhan road project at Mathura.“You can’t fell thousands of trees that too in the name of Lord Krishna,” the Bench observed orally when a lawyer for the state PWD said that the project also included widening of a road leading to the temple at the birthplace of Lord Krishna at Mathura.“Clearly they cannot do so (evaluation) in terms of the timber but must adopt a method of evaluation which takes into account the oxygen producing capacity of a particular tree over its remaining life span, assuming that it may be cut now,” the bench said.It took note of the statement of lawyer ADN Rao,  assisting it as an amicus curiae, that there was a system of evaluation called Net Present Value (NPV) which takes note of the oxygen producing capacity of a plant also “The State of Uttar Pradesh is expected to look at the NPV method of evaluation also. In any case, at the request of Aishwarya Bhati, ASG, we adjourn the matter(s) for a period of four weeks so that the State of Uttar Pradesh may inform the court about the method of evaluation it intends to adopt,” it said in the order.It also said the state government may also consider bringing down the number of trees it proposed to fell for the purposes of building the road.“It is to be kept in mind that the only effect that is likely to arise if the trees are retained would be that the roads may not be straight and therefore, not capable of accommodating high speed traffic. Such an effect may not necessary be deleterious particularly since high speed on the highways is known to cause serious accidents and cause of innumerable deaths on Indian roads,” the order said.At the outset of the hearing of a PIL, filed by environmentalist M C Mehta on protection of Taj Mahal and several applications, the bench asked state government as to how many trees it proposed to cut for its project and on being told that several banyan and neem trees were to be felled, it reacted sharply.“Why can’t the road go around the tree? That will only mean that speed will be slow. If the speed is slow, it will lower accidents and will be safer,” the Bench said. The Bench suggested that instead of cutting trees, roads may be built in a zig-zag manner which will reduce the traffic speed and accidents as well.The bench said that it was not possible for it to accept compensation in merely arithmetical terms “particularly since there is no statement forthcoming from the State of Uttar Pradesh or the PWD as to the nature of the trees that is to say whether they are classified as shrubs or large trees”.“Moreover, there is no information available to us regarding the age of the trees since it is obvious that there cannot be compensatory reforestation if a sampling is planted after one hundred year old tree is cut down,” it noted in the order.It was not prima facie in agreement with the submission that the state authorities would undertake compensatory afforestation by planting the same trees at some other place in and around Mathura, which falls under the Taj trapezium zone.The tree loss will be compensated by afforestation and by payment to the tree fund of the forest department, a lawyer said.“You want to cut 90-year old trees and plant a few week old saplings in lieu of that,” the Bench asked, adding that it was not satisfied with this submission.“Living trees cannot be evaluated simply on the basis of timber value. Living trees give oxygen. That should be considered in valuation. Oxygen producing capacity of the tree must be evaluated over its remaining life span,” it said.The apex court’s nod is needed if any activity, having a repercussion on the flora and fauna of Taz trapezium zone, is proposed by the government authorities and private parties.Meanwhile, the top court granted M.C. Mehta three months’ time to undertake further visits and carry out sampling and analysis of major drains and water bodies and the proposed leather parks and also discuss with the local authorities so that the final report may be submitted before it. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/felling-of-trees-in-name-of-lord-krishna-cant-be-allowed-observes-sc-179002

02-12-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to entertain plea on implementation of guidelines on protection of rape victims’ identity||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain a plea which had sought proper implementation of guidelines regarding protection of identity of rape victims in wake of the publication of a photograph of the Hathras victim by some media groups.A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly gang-raped by four men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment. Her cremation at night by the authorities, allegedly without the consent of her parents, triggered a widespread outrage.A Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana, which said the apex court do not think it proper to give any direction to the government to legislate in this regard, granted liberty to the petitioner to make representation to the ministries of Home Affairs, Law and Justice and Women and Child Development on the issue.“Having heard the petitioners-in-person and perusing the averments made in the petition, we appreciate the efforts made by the petitioners-in-person but do not think it proper to give any direction to the government to legislate,” said the Bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose.While granting liberty to the petitioner to make representation to the authorities regarding the issues raised in the plea, the Bench said, “We hope and trust that the respondents (authorities) shall consider the same and take appropriate action on that.”             During the hearing, the petitioner had also raised the issue of delay in the trial of cases of sexual violence.“These issues have nothing to do with law,” said the Bench, adding, “Right to freedom of expression is there. There is enough law for this. It is unfortunate that such incidents happen.”          The plea had sought direction to the authorities for proper implementation of guidelines issued by the top court with regard to the protection of identity of rape victims along with making people aware about the guidelines by way of advertisements and disclaimers.It had also sought direction for introducing a compulsory subject on gender sensitization, moral and sex education in curriculum of school.The plea had further said that authorities should bring certain reforms and amendments in the law to make it more deterrent in cases of rape with grievous injury, gang-rape and rape or gang-rape with murder by making stringent provisions of bail for accused as are in the case of offences under special enactments like the POCSO, the PMLA and the NDPS.It had said that stringent provisions should be made for punishing police officials for intentionally making lapses in investigation by not following the law in such cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-on-implementation-of-guidelines-on-protection-of-rape-victims-identity-178999

02-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Transporters threaten to halt operations in North India from Dec 8||Coming forward in support of agitating farmers, transporters’ apex body AIMTC on Wednesday threatened to halt operations in northern India from December 8 if the government fails to address concerns of the farming community.The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) is the apex body of transporters, representing about 95 lakh truckers and other entities.“AIMTC has already extended its support to the farmer agitation from day one. We have decided on stopping our operations strategically starting from North India and if the government does not address the issue of the farmers then we may decide to go for shutting down of transport operations nationwide in their support,” AIMTC President Kultaran Singh Atwal said.Atwal said the road transport fraternity of the country has extended its full support to farmers who are ‘ann daata’ (food providers).AIMTC Core Committee Chairman Bal Malkit Singh told PTI, “Starting December 8, we will halt the movement of supplies in entire North India including Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. We will then escalate it to entire country if the government fails to address their issues.” The AIMTC, in a statement, said the farmers are fighting for their legitimate rights and over 70 per cent of the rural households depend on agriculture.Entire North India is affected and thousands of trucks carrying food, vegetables and other perishable and non-perishable items coming from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir are impacted, it said.AIMTC supports the farmers as 65 per cent of the trucks are engaged in carrying farm produce, it added.“At present it is the season of apples, which are getting wasted. Apart from that potatoes, onions and other fruits and vegetables as well as other essential commodities like medicines, milk etc too (are) stuck up as their movement is disrupted, which is leading to their shortage in Delhi and in other northern states,” the statement said.The situation will worsen in the days to come, unless the government take prudent and pragmatic steps to resolve farmers’ concerns, it said.“The government must treat the farmers with dignity and allay their apprehensions on the farm Acts. We wholeheartedly support the cause of the farmers and look forward to a peaceful and amicable resolution of their issues raised by the Government,” it said.AIMTC is the apex body of transporters (both cargo and passenger), representing more than 95 lakh truckers and about 50 lakh bus and taxi operators across the country. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting for seven consecutive days at the borders of the national capital against the Centre’s new farm laws.The farmers have expressed apprehension that the laws would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will provide farmers with better opportunities. It has also accused the opposition parties of misleading farmers.

In addition, the Union of India is also directed to install CCTV cameras and recording equipment in the offices of: CBI, NIA, ED, NCB, DRI, SFIO and any other agency which carries out interrogations and has the power of arrest,” a Bench headed by Justice RF Rohinton said.The CCTV systems “must be equipped with night vision and must necessarily consist of audio as well as video footage”.The SHO of the police station concerned shall be responsible for the working, maintenance and recording of CCTVs, it added.It also ordered constitution of oversight committees at state and district levels for this purpose.In areas without electricity and/or internet, the states/UTs have to provide the same as expeditiously as possible using any mode of providing electricity, including solar/wind power, it said.The order came in a case relating to CCTV installation in police stations and examination of witnesses by police. The CCTV installation was revived by the top court following a case of custodial torture in Punjab.It said CCTV camera footage should be stored in digital video recorders and/or network video recorders. Importantly, the recording system should be such that the data stored therein is preserved for 18 months.“If the recording equipment, available in the market today, does not have the capacity to keep the recording for 18 months but for a lesser period of time, it shall be mandatory for all states, union territories and the Central government to purchase one which allows storage for the maximum period possible,” it noted.The top court said in case of serious injury and/or custodial deaths, the injured persons be free to complain to the State Human Rights Commission as also to Human Rights Courts, which must then be set up in each district of every state/UY under Section 30 of the Human Rights Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-orders-installation-of-cctv-cameras-in-all-police-stations-across-india-178995

Sibal said he would rely on the verdict as law has been laid down in it on bail.“Every case is different…You show us any precedent where an association had moved the court seeking relief…We want to hear the case as per the law and the matter should have been heard in the high court,” a Bench headed by chief Justice of India SA Bobde said, posting it for hearing next week.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Bench that the investigation conducted so far has found some shocking findings. He was a PFI activist who attempted to create caste, communal tension in Hathras, Mehta said on behalf of Uttar Pradesh Government, adding, the newspaper he claimed to represent had already shut down two years ago.The Supreme Court had on November 16 issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government to respond to KUWJ petition challenging Kappan's arrest. The rape and murder case is being probed by the CBI probe.

02-12-2020||Aditi Tandon||Former PM Manmohan Singh, historians Ifran Habib, Guha remember VN Datta||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 2Tributes poured in for late historian Vishwa Nath Datta who breathed his last on Monday with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh laying a wreath in the memory of the departed soul and leading academics mourning the loss.Remembering Amritsar born Datta, eminent historian Ramachandra Guha tweeted, “Professor VN Datta’s books on Bhagat Singh, Maulana Azad, and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre are landmarks of historical scholarship. He was also a wonderfully generous human being. His work and example live on.”In a heartfelt tribute, leading academic and historian Irfan Habib said, “The passing away of Professor VN Datta deprives the Indian community of historians of one of its recognised stalwarts. He had made events and aspects of the national movement his special field and whatever he wrote on it had the quality of definitiveness about it.”“To me he coined in himself all the values one associates with the old Punjab – a composite culture based on Urdu as the common literary language – alongside an uncompromising attachment to modern secular values,” said Habib.He said Datta’s secular outlook reflected in everything he wrote, whether on Sarmad, Jallianwalla Bagh, Azad or Iqbal. “It was a privilege to know him and learn at his feet,” Habib added.Datta’s longtime colleague and historian JS Grewal remembered him fondly. “We have lost an eminent historian, a kind friend, and a generous host. My association with Professor Datta is more than half a century old. Without yet knowing him personally, I was struck by his enthusiastic discussions in the Indian History Congress Sessions. I never saw him in low spirits,” he said.Noted litterateur Ashok Vajpeyi said, “Professor Datta was not only a scholar and teacher with unusual academic rigour and a deep-rooted vision, he was an intellectual who shared a pluralistic legacy with many others including such major writers as KB Vaid and Krishna Sobti. He would be dearly missed.”Datta’s long career included his time as a contributor to The Tribune in which he started writing as a student at Lahore and went on to author “Off the Shelf”, a well-regarded column for years.Among Datta’s most acclaimed works are Maulana Azad; Gandhi and Bhagat Singh; and Sati: A Historical, Social and Philosophical Enquiry into the Hindu Rite of Widow Burning.The late academic's daughter Nonica, an acclaimed scholar herself, told The Tribune of her late father’s unfinished works that include a book on the history of historiography; Ghalib’s Delhi; his Cambridge diaries and a biography of Sarla Devi, the daughter of Rabindranath Tagore’s sister.“My father had the correspondence between Mahatma Gandhi and Sarla Devi and was writing about their relationship. He was also eagerly awaiting the revised edition of Jallianwala Bagh, expected any time now,” Nonica said, recalling how her father gave up a lucrative government job to join the fledgling Kurukshetra University in 1960.Survived by wife Kamala, daughters Nonica, Poonam and Anu and two grandsons, Datta, his peers say, will be remembered as a rare public intellectual with a cosmopolitan outlook, one who advocated a scientific interpretation of historical sources.He was Professor Emeritus, Kurukshetra University, and formerly General President of the Indian History Congress.With VN Datta’s departure, an era has ended, said Mohinder Singh, Professor and Director, The National Institute of Punjab Studies, New Delhi, of which Datta was one of the founder members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-pm-manmohan-singh-historians-ifran-habib-guha-remember-vn-datta-178979

A senior official of the management said the bank has deposited Rs 5.24 crore into their accounts.The imposing monument of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, called as the Statue of Unity (SoU), is located at Kevadia in Narmada district. The statue has been a major tourist attraction since it was inaugurated in October 2018.A Children Nutrition Park and a Cactus Garden are among other attractions, including river rafting, located in the vicinity of the monument.Before the lockdown, people had the option to buy tickets online or over the counter in cash at the spot.In December last year, Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel informed the Legislative Assembly that the statue management earned a revenue of Rs 82.51 crore between November 1, 2018 and November 16, 2019.Data of revenue from November 2019 to March, 2020 was not released by the government.As per the FIR, the bank has been using services of the agency since 2003 for cash collection and deposition.The bank had appointed the same agency to collect cash generated from the sale of tickets at the Statue of Unity and other connected tourist attractions and deposit it into the two bank accounts of the State of Unity authorities, Dudhat said."In a recent audit, the State of Unity officials found a mismatch in the amount mentioned in cash deposit slips, given by the agency staff after collecting the cash, and the actual cash deposited into the bank accounts between November 2018 and March 2020," she said.After it was informed by the statue management about the mismatch, the bank conducted a probe which revealed that some staff members of the agency allegedly did not deposit Rs 5.24 crore, following which the bank authorities lodged the FIR, the dySP said."We need to check several records of the agency to find out who were involved in the cash collection exercise at Kevadia," the officer said, adding that no one has been identified or arrested yet.The monument was shut for tourists for almost seven months since March due to coronavirus-induced lockdown, before it was reopened for visitors from October 17 with staggered timings. Limited tickets are sold online.Offline sale of tickets at the counter has been stopped, an official said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/statue-of-unity-fir-for-not-putting-ticket-sale-money-in-bank-178974

02-12-2020||New Delhi||NGT imposes complete ban on sale, use of firecrackers in NCR, other places of high pollution||In a fresh directive, the National Green Tribunal has directed that there would be a total ban on the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers during COVID-19 pandemic in the NCR and all cities/towns in the country where the ambient air quality falls under the ‘poor’ and above category.The green panel, however, said during Christmas, and New Year, green crackers can be used from 11:55 pm to 12:30 am only at places where air quality is ‘moderate’ or below.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said its direction to restrict the use of firecrackers in cities/towns where air quality is ‘moderate’ or below to green crackers and for the duration of not more than two hours will continue.Other than specified festivals, prior permission of the District Magistrate of the area will be required for use of crackers for limited period which will be given having regard to air quality, the tribunal said.“There will be a total ban on the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers during COVID-19 pandemic in the NCR and all cities/towns in the country where the ambient air quality falls under the ‘poor’ and above category,” the bench said.“Since pandemic is still continuing and aggravated by the addition of pollution by fire crackers, having potential of damage to public health, invoking precautionary principle under section 15 and 20 of the NGT Act, 2010, we are satisfied that there is need to continue directions for prohibition and regulation of use of fire crackers,” the bench said.It directed all District Magistrates to ensure that banned firecrackers are not sold and asked them to recover compensation from violators.Any victim of pollution, apart from other remedies, can approach District Magistrate for compensation, it added.            “Any victims of pollution ,apart from other remedies can approach the District Magistrate for compensation, by showing evidence of individual damage and the person responsible for the damage. Such claim may be dealt with by a reasoned order,” it said.The NGT also directed that at least one air quality monitoring station must be set up at every district headquarter at the earliest.               “Where no such monitoring station exists, atleast a manual monitoring station which is very easy to set up and is not costly must be installed at the earliest, using simpler procedures... This should not exceed three months in any case.                 “This will be the responsibility of the state pollution control boards from available funds under ‘consent mechanism’/‘environmental compensation’. The air quality data may be placed on the website of the District administration and also at prominent locations,” the bench said.The green panel also directed that an amount of Rs 1 lakh and Rs 25,000, respectively, may be paid by the CPCB to senior advocate Raj Panjwani and advocate Shibani Ghosh as a token honorarium for assisting the NGT as Amicus.The tribunal had registered the matter as suo moto (on its own) after a plea sought action against pollution by use of firecrackers in NCR during COVID-19 pandemic.

Non-essential movement of individuals during this period was prohibited. Many government offices had functioned on reduced staff strength and where possible, employees were given the option to work from home through online means.Physically disabled employees and pregnant women employees, who were exempted to attend office and were directed to work from home during exempted period as per instructions issued by Department of Personnel and Training, are also not eligible to draw transport allowance during exemption period as these employees have not incurred any expenditure for commuting.Non-entitled officials who were temporarily provided with the facility of official car for commuting between office and residences throughout the whole calendar month on account of unavailability of public transport facility due to COVID-19 pandemic, are also not eligible to draw transport allowance, the circular adds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-transport-allowance-for-government-staff-who-worked-from-home-during-covid-19-lockdown-178967

02-12-2020||Gandhinagar||Video of crowded family event hosted by Gujarat BJP legislator goes viral||A viral video of a well-attended engagement party thrown by a BJP legislator has drawn the displeasure of the Gujarat High Court.The video shows a large gathering of people gathered at an open ground with no regard for social distancing protocol that has become a rule during the raging coronavirus pandemic. The event is believed to have been hosted by BJP legislator Kanti Gamit for his grandson’s engagement party, IANS said in a report.  During a suo motu hearing on coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent state of lockdown on Wednesday, the Gujarat High Court wanted to know what the state government was doing about the event."This is shocking and unfortunate. What was the police doing when such a large gathering occurred? We are not at all satisfied with the way the government has handled the situation. Incidents like this make all your efforts till now meaningless," a Bench of Chief Justice Vikramnath and Justice JB Pardiwala said.The bench of Chief Justice Vikramnath and Justice JB Pardiwala also told the state government to issue a notification to make those not wearing face masks to perform community services at Covid care centres for five to 15 days apart from fine of Rs 1,000. The high court had last week suggested to the government that as the people were not heeding to the warning of fines, there was need to make them serve at Covid care centres for eight to 10 days in addition to levy of fines so that they understood the gravity of the pandemic. Advocate General Kamal Trivedi, appearing for the Gujarat government on Tuesday, had said that the state was unable to act on the HC suggestion and sought another week's time to decide on the issue. But the HC refused to give more time and gave the order on Wednesday. According to the High Court's suggestion, persons not wearing masks in public shall be asked to perform community services at Covid care centres in the state for 5 to 15 days, at least 4 to 6 hours daily. The community service shall be of non-medical nature like cleaning, housekeeping, help in cooking and serving food, data preparation etc. ---IANS#Breakingकोरोना गाइडलाइन का उलंघन करने की वजह से गुजरात के पूर्व मंत्री कांति गामित को IPC की धारा 308 के तहत गिरफ्तार किया गया कल उनकी पोती की सगाई का ये 👇🏻विडिओ वायरल होने के बाद आज गुजरात हाईकोर्ट ने प्रशासन को लगाईं थी फटकार जिसके बाद लिया गया उनके खिलाफ ऐक्शन @indiatvnews https://t.co/xwblKv0rWI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/video-of-crowded-family-event-hosted-by-gujarat-bjp-legislator-goes-viral-178965

In fact, the idiom about crocodile tears will have to be changed now to ‘Kejriwal tears’,” he said.Stating that the latest betrayal of Kejriwal exposed him as well as the AAP, Badal said the Delhi Chief Minister should withdraw the gazette notification immediately.“Kejriwal should also announce that the Delhi Government will not implement the three agri laws and will ensure assured government marketing at minimum support price,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sukhbir-blasts-delhi-cm-for-shedding-kejriwal-tears-on-farm-acts-178959
02-12-2020||Patna||Sushil Modi files nomination papers for Bihar Rajya Sabha bypoll||Veteran BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Wednesday filed his nomination papers for by-election to a Rajya Sabha seat in Bihar which has been necessitated by the death of Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan.Modi filed his nomination papers at the Patna Commissioner office in presence of a host of leaders of the ruling NDA, most notable being Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whose deputy he had been for more than a decade, sharing an excellent rapport that has been a stuff of legend in the states political circles.“I have come here to congratulate my former colleague.He is currently an MLC and formerly been a member of the Lok Sabha and an MLA before that.“With his election to the Rajya Sabha he will hold the distinction of having been a member of both houses of the Parliament and the state legislature”, Kumar told reporters smilingly.Kumar, who has two BJP legislators Tar Kishor Prasad and Renu Devi as his deputies in his fourth tenure that began last month, remarked wistfully that he would have preferred Modi by his side “but it is a decision of his party (BJP)”.“Our wish is known to everybody. But, now that they want to take him to the Centre, we are hopeful that in his new capacity he will continue to serve Bihar”, said the JD(U) president in a cryptic remark that lends credence to speculations that Modi might be accommodated in the Union council of ministers.Sushil Modi thanked BJP’s Central leadership and also NDA allies for their support.Earlier, Modi whose vigorous efforts in highlighting the fodder scam had made him a household name in Bihar in the 1990s when the BJP was still trying to make a mark in the states politics, visited the party office at the Birchand Patel Marg and received a rousing welcome.At the Vidhan Sabha Secretariat, besides Kumar and senior leaders of the BJP, those present included former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi’s son and minister Santosh Manjhi and state minister Mukesh Sahni who respectively head Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), the NDAs smaller constituents.The leaders flashed a victory sign, confident of Modi sailing through with the NDA enjoying a majority in the 243- member assembly.If the opposition Grand Alliance fails to field a candidate by the last date of filing nominations on Thursday, Modi might end up getting declared elected unopposed on December 07 when withdrawal of nominations come to a close.Voting and counting are scheduled on December 14.The opposition coalition, in particular its largest constituent RJD, which has been at the receiving end of Modis attacks on Lalu Prasad and his family, had reacted with predictable peeve when his candidature was announced by the BJP.The party had thrown a fit over the seat being denied to the Lok Janshakti Party, founded by the late Paswan, out of “khunnas” (spite) against his son Chirag who now heads the party and had dented the NDA in the recently held assembly elections by going solo.The RJD had also offered to support the LJP if it considered fielding Reena Paswan, the late ministers wife.However, Chirag categorically ruled his party out of the race on Tuesday when he told reporters “I appreciate the gesture made by the RJD and the consideration shown by them for us. But my mother is not interested in entering politics as of now”.Paswan reiterated his contention “the seat originally belonged to the BJP. Following my fathers death, it is the partys prerogative to take a decision”.Notably, Paswan had got elected to the Upper House last year from the seat that fell vacant upon the election of his cabinet colleague Ravi Shankar Prasad from Patna Sahib Lok Sabha seat.When asked whether the LJP, which has one member in the assembly, would support Modi in the by-poll, the 37-year-old replied “why not”.The young LJP chief, who has been relentless in his attacks on the JD(U) boss but professed loyalty towards BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is reportedly eyeing a berth in the Union council of ministers in which his party is left with no representation.The party, which has six MPs in the Lok Sabha, is hopeful that it would be accommodated by the BJP-led government since no ally, with the exception of Ramdas Athawale of Maharashtra-based RPI,  is now left in the Union council of ministers.The BJP enjoys a brute majority in the Lok Sabha but is said to be worried over recent exits, from the NDA, by powerful regional allies like Shiv Sena, Akali Dal and Telugu Desam Party sending out wrong signals.

We are very strong".“I don’t think that anybody can play a mischief at sea against India,” he said.He said the Indian Navy is concentrating on further building its capabilities.“Our forces have operational capabilities. We remain strong. We remain prepared,” he said.India and China have held eight rounds of high-level military talks till November during the over six month long tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh which also saw a bloody clash that left 20 Indian soldiers dead, with the Chinese side also reportedly suffering casualties. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/navy-played-crucial-role-in-preventing-misadventure-by-chinese-in-indian-ocean-during-border-standoff-vice-admiral-178956
02-12-2020||New Delhi||China begins import of Indian rice after 2 years amid border tension; places orders for 5k tonnes||China has started importing Indian rice after a gap of two years and placed orders for shipment of about 5,000 tonnes of non-basmati rice due to competitive prices offered by India compared to other nations, according to the All India Rice Exporters Association (AIREA).India is the world’s major exporter of rice, while China is the biggest importer. In 2006, China was given market access for Indian rice but shipments took place only during the 2017-18 fiscal.China buying rice from India comes at a time of heightened border tensions between the two nations.“Although market access was given in 2006, China imported about 974 tonnes of non-basmati rice in 2017-18 fiscal. Now after a gap of two years, we have started receiving enquiries...,” AIREA Executive Director Vinod Kaul told PTI.Less than 150 tonnes of basmati rice has been exported till October of the 2020-21 fiscal. In last two months, China has placed orders for shipment of about 5,000 tonnes of non-basmati rice called broken rice from south India, he said.Broken rice is used for making noodles as well as in the wine industry.China has started showing interest in buying rice from India, Kaul said it is because the neighbouring nation is facing tight supply situation amid likely fall in output and trade curbs in the wake of COVID-19 from its other importing destinations like Thailand and Vietnam, he said.That apart, India is offering competitive prices when compared to other nations in the world at present, he added.As per the AIREA, India has exported 2.8 million tonnes of basmati rice and 6.1 million tonnes of non-basmati rice during the April-October period of the current fiscal.In 2019-20 fiscal, total basmati rice exports were at a record 4 million tonnes and non-basmati rice at 5 million tonnes. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-begins-import-of-indian-rice-after-2-years-amid-border-tension-places-orders-for-5k-tonnes-178955
02-12-2020||Chandigarh/New Delhi||Capt Amarinder crosses swords with Kejriwal, calls him ‘sneaky little fellow’||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh called his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal “this sneaky little fellow” as the two traded charges over the notification of one of the three new Central farm laws in the national capital.A day earlier the Punjab Chief Minister had slammed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader over the November 23 notification in Delhi, accusing the party of just “pretending” to support the farmers’ cause.Also read:Sukhbir blasts Delhi CM for shedding ‘Kejriwal tears’ on farm ActsAt a press briefing in Delhi on Wednesday, Kejriwal hit back, but that triggered the release of another press statement by the Congress veteran in Chandigarh.Kejriwal’s AAP is the main opposition in Congress-run Punjab, farmers from where are now camped outside Delhi in a huge protest against the Centre’s agri-marketing laws.Amarinder Singh trashed Kejriwal’s assertion that states are “helpless” against Central legislation, and said it was clear that the AAP leader did not even want to try to fight the “draconian” laws.He accused Kejriwal of “undermining” the farmers’ fight by notifying one of the laws and reminded that the Punjab Assembly had passed its own Bills in an attempt to “negate” them.“Instead of meekly just notifying the central laws, Kejriwal could have tried to make some effort to counter them and protect the rights of the farmers,” the Punjab Chief Minister said.He alleged it is evident that “this sneaky little fellow, whose double standards have been exposed time and again, is now completely cornered on the issue.”          In his briefing earlier, Kejriwal had accused the Punjab CM of playing “dirty politics”, and suggested that he was under pressure from Central agencies.“I want to ask Captain saheb, are you under the pressure of these very same people because of which you are making these false allegations against me, abusing me. I know that the reason may be that your family is charged with cases and receiving notices from the ED,” he said.The three farm laws were implemented across the country with the signature of the president and no state can stop them, he said.“If the implementation of the laws depended on the states, why would farmers from across the nation reach Delhi to talk to the Centre and put their demands forward? They would have put their demands in front of their chief ministers,” he said.He accused the Punjab CM of not trying to stop the farm bills when he had the chance.“Captain saheb had many chances to stop the farm bills. Why did he not act against these bills being a member of the central government’s committee formulating and deliberating on these bills?” Kejriwal asked.“Is this Captain saheb’s friendship with the BJP or is he under pressure, because of which he is making false allegations against me?” he asked.Kejriwal also said his AAP government had angered the BJP government at the Centre by refusing to give permission for turning city stadiums into temporary jails for protesting farmers.Singh hit back, saying it was apparent that Kejriwal, whose survival depended on the Central government, was more worried about angering it than about the farmers’ plight.He dubbed Kejriwal’s latest comments — including an appeal to the Centre to address the farmers’ concerns — as “mere hogwash” and said the AAP leader’s actions had  “exposed the hollowness” of his remarks.It is evident that Kejriwal is only playing to the sentiments of the farmers now because his party has completely lost the political narrative in Punjab, he charged.The Delhi government notified the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 on November 23.Thousands of farmers, most of them from Punjab, are camping at Delhi’s border demanding a repeal of the central laws.Farmer unions claim that the new laws will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, which the Centre denies.The Narendra Modi government says the laws give more options to farmers to sell their crops, fetching better prices for them.

A fresh auction for Mirchi's properties will be conducted again," D'Souza said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dawood-ibrahims-ratnagiri-properties-fetch-rs-1-10-crore-in-auction-178944

02-12-2020||Mumbai||Yogi allays fears on Film City impacting Mumbai film industry||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said the northern state is not desirous of taking away the film business out of Mumbai.However, it is an open competition and the one who gives the right atmosphere and security in which talent can work will get the investments, he told reporters here.Ahead of his visit to the financial capital, ruling Congress in Maharashtra had alleged a conspiracy to snatch away the city's film city to UP, and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had vowed not to allow anybody to "forcibly" take away businesses."We are not snatching or hindering anyone's investments," Adityanath said."No one can take anything along. It is not like a purse which gets taken away. This is an open competition. One who can give a safe atmosphere, better facilities—and especially social security—in which one can work without discrimination will get investments, he added.Responding to Sena MP Sanjay Raut's assertion that replicating the film city in other city is a tall task, Adityanath said, "we've not come here to take away anything.""We are creating something new. Why are you getting concerned? We are giving a new world-class infrastructure to all. Hence, everybody will have to grow up, widen his thinking and better facilities will have to be given. One who is able to do that will get the people, he added.Adityanath said he met experts from Bollywood, including directors, producers and actors to seek their suggestions for the upcoming film city in Noida which will be spread across 1,000 acres.He added that it is not a 'pick and choose' approach which has been adopted by his government and added that specific sectoral policies have been created with long term view in mind and such meetings help them improvise on the same.Adityanath met Bollywood personalities, including Akshay Kumar, Boney Kapoor, Subhash Ghai, Manmohan Shetty and Anand Pandit over the last two days as part of his visit to the financial capital.The UP CM said the Noida film city will be located six km away from the upcoming international airport at Jewar and added this will be well-connected with Delhi, Agra and Mathura.Earlier in the day, Raut said it is not easy to shift Mumbai's Film City elsewhere even though attempts have been made for it."What is the status of Noida Film City now? Can you create Mumbai's Film City in Lucknow and Patna?" Raut had said while speaking to reporters."Earlier, attempts were made. It is difficult to replicate Mumbai's film industry elsewhere. Mumbai has a glorious film history and past," Raut said.Ahead of his Uttar Pradesh counterpart's visit to the financial capital, Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday warned he will not let anybody "forcibly" take businesses away from the state, adding Maharashtra is not "jealous" about someone's progress if it happens on the back of fair competition.Of the many centres of film production across the country, Mumbai, host to the Hindi and Marathi film industry, is the largest.Bollywood, as the industry is called, delivers a high amount of jobs and revenues and is a key component of Mumbai's soft power. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yogi-allays-fears-on-film-city-impacting-mumbai-film-industry-178940

02-12-2020||New Delhi||Honey sold by major brands in India adulterated with sugar syrup: CSE||The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) investigation on Wednesday has revealed that "nefarious adulteration business of honey designed to bypass purity tests and massive implications for our health during COVID-19 times".The CSE investigations with laboratory studies in India and Germany revealed that "rampant adulteration in honey sold by major brands in India—77 per cent of samples founds adulterated with sugar syrup," a said CSE statement."Only three out of 13 brands pass the internationally accepted Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) test. Indian standards for honey purity cannot detect the adulteration. This is because Chinese companies have designed sugar syrups to bypass these standards," according to the Centre for Science and Environment, which earlier, unearthed pesticides in major soft-drinks."This food fraud severely compromises public health in the troubled times of COVID-19. Indians today are consuming more honey because they believe in its intrinsic goodness – antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties – and to build immunity against the virus"."But if it is adulterated honey, what we are eating is sugar, which will add to the challenge of overweight and obesity, which in turn makes us more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection," said CSE Director General Sunita Narain.According to Narain, nearly all the top brands, including Dabur, Patanjali, Apis-Himalaya Baidyanath, Zandu and Hitkari failed the test.Major findings included as follows:1. 77 per cent of the samples were found to be adulterated with the addition of sugar syrup.2. Out of 22 samples tested, only five passed all the tests.3 Honey samples from leading brands such as Dabur, Patanjali, Baidyanath, Zandu, Hitkari and Apis Himalaya, all failed the NMR test.4 Only 3 out of the 13 brands—Saffola, Markfed Sohna and Nature’s Nectar (one out of two samples)—passed all the tests.As of August 1, 2020, NMR tests have been made mandatory."It is a food fraud more nefarious and more sophisticated than what we found in our 2003 and 2006 investigations into soft drinks; more damaging to our health than perhaps anything that we have found till now – keeping in mind the fact that we are still fighting against a killer COVID-19 pandemic with our backs to the wall. This overuse of sugar in our diet will make it worse", concluded Narain.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/honey-sold-by-major-brands-in-india-adulterated-with-sugar-syrup-cse-178930

However, it said the final hearing would take place after physical hearings commence next year.Vedanta said it needed two months to start the unit and it should be allowed to run it for four weeks to ascertain if it’s polluting or not but Tamil Nadu Government opposed the company’s plea saying the plant had been “polluting consistently”.On behalf of the company, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued that it was a “case of mala fide closure of the plant” and Vedanta was producing 36 per cent of India’s total copper demand.However, on behalf of some villagers residing near the plant, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves contended the unit shouldn’t be allowed to operate as water was getting contaminated and people were suffering from diseases such as cancer.Vedanta had moved the top court challenging the Madras High Court order refusing to allow reopening of the Tuticorin plant. The High Court had upheld the orders of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board directing closure of the unit in May 2018. Thirteen people had died in police firing on May 21 and 22, 2018 during violent protests against the plant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-allow-vedanta-to-restart-its-tn-plant-178922

People are advised to avoid Noida link road for going to Noida and use NH 24 and DND instead,” the traffic police tweeted.While the police have kept the Haryana-Delhi border at Singhu and Tikri closed for traffic, the protest at Ghazipur, the city's border with Uttar Pradesh, has also intensified, an official said.Two more border points connecting the national capital with Gurgaon and Jhajjar-Bahadurgarh were also closed as precautionary measures on Tuesday. With this, five border points, including Singhu and Tikri, have so far been closed due to the protest.The traffic police said the borders at Tikri, Jharoda and Jhatikra are closed for all kinds of “traffic movement”. The Badusarai border is open only for two-wheelers.Available open borders to Haryana are Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera, it said.As traffic spilled over to alternative routes, it led to long jams there as well. The commuters entering or exiting Delhi faced inconvenience as the protesting farmers blocked key entrances to the city.Meanwhile, the Delhi border points remained under heavy police deployment with concrete barriers and multi-layered barricades in place as the farmers continued their agitation against the Centre's new agriculture reform laws.According to the police, checking of vehicles has also been intensified at the border points as a precautionary measure in view of the 'Delhi Chalo' protest march by farmers."Cemented barriers and multi-layered barricades have been put up besides heavy security personnel at Ghazipur border near UP gate where many farmers have been protesting since Saturday," a senior police officer said.The protest against the new farm laws is set to continue as talks between three Union ministers and farmer groups ended in a stalemate on Tuesday after they rejected the government's suggestion of a new committee to look into the issues raised by agitating farmers.The two sides, however, have decided to meet again on Thursday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-heavy-security-cover-at-delhi-borders-traffic-snarls-reported-178920

02-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||All eyes on Dec 3 meeting as farmers harden stance, demand special Parliament session to repeal farm laws||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 2As agitating farmers hardened stance, demanding a special Parliament session and warning of a countrywide protest on December 5, all eyes are on the next round of their meeting with Union ministers on the three contentious farm Acts on Thursday.While Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar again spoke on merits of the three laws and hoped for an early solution through talks, farmers appeared to find support from the RSS, the ruling BJP’s ideological fountainhead.Sangh-affiliate Swadesh Jagran Manch (SJM) said farmers needed “assurance on price”, “an alternate ATM mechanism” if middlemen/arthiyas were to be removed and a "better redressal system" for disputes.Talking to The Tribune Ashwani Mahajan of the SJM said while the three laws were “good” and “intentions of the government cannot be questioned”,  “any good thing also has scope for further improvement”.“Earlier ‘arthiyas’ used to form cartels, now big players can do the same. Farmers need assurance on MSP, either through amendment in the existing Acts or a new law,” he said.Regarding the government’s argument that MSP was never a part of the legal system, Mahajan said even the three Acts were not part of the legal system.“It needs to be made obligatory for buyers to pay the floor price, which can be the cost of production plus more. Farmers are the weaker lot, the government can fix the floor price of crops, make it a legal provision either through amendment or separate law.“Besides, the dispute settlement also needs to be improved. SDM courts may not be in reach of ordinary farmers and there should be farmers’ courts on lines of consumer courts. Farmers should be assured of income right from the time of sowing. Why should they wait for harvesting?” Mahajan asked.“Arthiyas are something like an ATM machine, the new players have to behave like ATMs. There should be a provision for giving money to farmers in installments right from the beginning. What farmers need is assurance of a payment mechanism similar to that in the ‘arthiyas’ system,” he added.Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Tomar who apprised Home Minister Amit Shah of Tuesday's “inconclusive meeting”, said he was hopeful of a breakthrough via talks.During the deliberations, the ministers are believed to have discussed the issues raised by farmers and how the government could dispel the concerns and break the deadlock.Sources indicate the possibility of an official group of ministers/committee, “some middle path” which may be agreeable to farmers Unions, who rejected any middle path and demanded complete roll-back and also accused the government of “trying to divide farmers”.“The BKU (Tikait) and all unions across the country are with us,” said Darshan Pal, president of the Krantikari Kisan Union, as he called for special session of Parliament to repeal the new farm laws and threatened to block major roads of the National Capital if their demands were not met.“If government does not fulfill our demands, we will have to take harder steps, it is 'aar-paar ki ladai' (do or die),” said Gurnam Singh Charuni while announcing December 5 as the day when they will burn effigies of corporates. “The government should think this as warning bell. Other countries like Canada are showing solidarity. The protests have started in other parts of the country and the government should ensure that there is no further ‘badnami’ of the country,” said Shiv Kumar 'Kakkaji' on a day the agitation against the three Central laws entered the seventh day.With vehicular movement already blocked at Singhu and Tikri borders, farmers also gathered at the Chilla border between Delhi and Noida.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal claimed that the BJP-ruled Centre was angry with him for not permitting stadiums to be used as temporary jails for farmers protesting against the farm laws. He also hit out at Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, accusing him of speaking “BJP’s language”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-eyes-on-dec-3-meeting-as-farmers-harden-stance-demand-special-parliament-session-to-repeal-farm-laws-178908

My appeal to farmer leaders is to get its hold back. All kinds of undesirable elements have entered the protests which are genuine farmer protests,” Bittu told The Tribune today.He said people “whose protests have failed in the past – be it those who sat in agitation at Shaheen Bagh or a section of students who protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act and also some Khalistani elements have penetrated the ongoing protests.”Terming the current farmers' agitation “leaderless”, Bittu said he was concerned that the situation “might flare up unless immediately controlled.”“In Punjab where the farmers were on an agitation for long, the state government ensured law and order and did not allow the protests to get diluted. But here around Delhi undesirable elements have come. They have set up platforms independent of farmers whose protests and concerns are genuine. The situation is getting volatile as attempts are being made to exploit farmers’ protests. I urge Home Minister Amit Shah to intervene,” Bittu said.He said long traffic jams all across Delhi’s borders with other states were swelling up with “shades of protesters who have past unresolved issues with the Centre.”“Government of India can take help from the Punjab government if needed but it must take note of the situation brewing on the ground,” Bittu, Congress whip in Lok Sabha, adding that “anyone can spoil this agitation.”He urged the Centre to consider a rollback of farm laws in the interest of farmers' community.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/khalistani-elements-hijacking-farmers-agitation-amit-shah-must-act-fast-ravneet-bittu-178898

02-12-2020||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut has been given undue importance, says Urmila Matondkar after joining Shiv Sena||Actress-turned-politician Urmila Matondkar, who has officially joined Shiv Sena, says she has no interest in engaging in a war of words with actress Kangana Ranaut, adding that Kangana has been given much more importance than she actually deserves.Speaking to IANS, Urmila further said the women's wing of Shiv Sena was strong, and that she would like to work with the wing.Not long ago, Kangana had described Urmila as a "soft porn star", but Urmila says her new political status does not mean she will hit back."I will certainly not engage in any war of words with her. I am not a fan of her and I think we all have talked about her much more than what she actually deserves, so I don't think there is anything to talk about her. We live in a democratic country and all the citizens in our country have the right to freedom of speech, so they should do what they want to do," said Urmila.The controversy arose a few months ago when, speaking to a news channel, Kangana reacted to an interview that Urmila has given. In the interview, Urmila had reportedly questioned Kangana's motive while accusing Bollywood's alleged 'drug-mafia'. Reacting to the interview, Kangana said that Urmila was "making a mockery" of her struggles. She had also dismissed Urmila as a "soft porn star"."I want to make it clear today that I did not give that interview to criticise her. It was just one of the parts of that interview and that is why I talked about her, so I feel that we should not talk about it anymore," said Urmila.Asked which issues she would like to focus on, Urmila replied: "I feel the women's wing of Shiv Sena is really strong, so I would be happy if I am given the opportunity to work with them. There is a lot of work to do but there is one thing I would like to begin my work with, which is the security and empowerment of women and girls in Maharashtra."She added: "Women and girls from all parts of the country and even the world come to Mumbai and Maharashtra to build their careers. I feel these girl's parents send them with a lot of faith in this state because Mumbai is one of safest cities in the world. So, I am really proud of that fact being a Mumbaikar and I will definitely work on that front in future."Urmila had joined Shiv Sena on Tuesday in the presence of party chief and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Uddhav Thackeray's wife Rashmi Thackeray tied a Shiv Bandhan thread on Urmila's wrist.Priyanka Chaturvedi, who left Congress a year ago, was also present at Urmila's induction to Shiv Sena, as was Mayor of Mumbai, Kishori Pednekar.Soon after Urmila joined Shiv Sena, the party nominated her to the Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC). — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kangana-ranaut-has-been-given-undue-importance-says%C2%A0urmila-matondkar-after-joining-shiv-sena-178895
02-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality inches closer to 'severe' zone||Delhi's air quality was in the upper end of the “very poor” category Wednesday morning, while pollution levels have already entered the “severe” zone in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad and Greater Noida.The city's air quality index (AQI) was 381 at 9 am. The 24-hour average was 367 on Tuesday. It was 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday.Ghaziabad and Greater Noida recorded an AQI of 430 and 410, respectively.  An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".The maximum wind speed is expected to be 12 kmph on Wednesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The minimum temperature was 8.2 degrees Celsius on Wednesday and the maximum is expected to settle around 27 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.The minimum temperature this season has remained 2-3 degrees Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.The predominant wind direction remained westerly-north-westerly on most of the days. These winds blow from snowcapped western Himalayas towards the plains.Another reason for the below normal temperatures is La Nina, a phenomenon associated with the cooling of Pacific waters and an antithesis to El Nino.  Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of the "very poor" category due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.There is a possibility of the air quality reaching the "severe" category between December 4 and December 7, it said.The city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was 2,500 m2/s on Tuesday and is likely to be 6,000 m2/s on Wednesday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.The contribution of stubble burning in the neighbouring states to Delhi's PM 2.5 levels was 4 per cent on Tuesday, 7 per cent on Monday and 6 per cent on Sunday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-air-quality-inches-closer-to-severe-zone-178893

02-12-2020||Washington||US House to consider Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act||The US House of Representatives is slated to consider on Thursday the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act which was written by legendary civil rights activists Congressman John Lewis, who died early this year.Cosponsored by Indian-American Congressman Dr Ami Bera, the Bill establishes a US-India public-private development foundation and several bilateral exchange initiatives intended to support the study and promotion of the nonviolent protest philosophies and civil rights legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.Passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee by voice vote, the Bill will be considered under suspension of the rules, with 40 minutes of debate. A two-thirds majority vote is required for its passage.Specifically, the Bill directs the US Agency for International Development (USAID) administrator, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in coordination with appropriate counterparts in the Government of India, to establish a United States-India Gandhi-King Development Foundation to identify development priorities and administer and oversee competitively awarded grants to private nongovernmental entities in India.It also directs the secretary of State to establish, in cooperation with the Indian government, a professional exchange program known as the 'Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative' to provide an annual educational forum for scholars from the US and India that focuses on the social justice and human and civil rights legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.Among other things, the bill requires the president and chief executive officer of the US Institute of Peace to develop a professional development training initiative (to be known as the Gandhi-King Global Academy) on conflict resolution tools based on the principles of nonviolence.    The measure authorises USD1 million a year through fiscal 2025 for the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative. It authorises USD 2 million for just FY 2021 for the Gandhi-King Global Academy, and USD30 million for 2021 for the US-India Gandhi-King Development Foundation.The development foundation would also be authorized at USD15 million per year from 2022 through 025 — but only if India's private sector commits to match U.S. government contributions. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the bill would cost $51 million over five years.Said Bera. “As the world's oldest and largest democracies, the United States and India have long traditions of upholding these shared values championed by figures like Gandhi, King, and Congressman Lewis. But they are increasingly under threat in both countries,” he said.“This legislation will help ensure those values endure and remind us that by holding true to them, we embody and live up to the best of our two nations,” Bera said.

02-12-2020||United Nations||Terrorism threatens to engulf world in carnage similar to one witnessed during two World Wars: India at UN||Terrorism has emerged as one of the means of waging war in the contemporary world and it threatens to engulf the planet in a carnage similar to the one witnessed during the two World Wars, India has said, calling for global action to defeat the scourge."The commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War provides us with an opportunity to reaffirm commitment to the most fundamental principle and purpose of the United Nations that is to ensure that successive generations are saved from the scourge of war," First Secretary in India's Permanent Mission to the UN Ashish Sharma said on Monday.Addressing a special solemn meeting in commemoration of the World War II victims, he said, "Terrorism has emerged as one of the means of waging war in the contemporary world. It threatens to engulf the world in a carnage similar to what we witnessed during the two World Wars. Terrorism is a global phenomenon and can only be defeated by global action."Sharma called on nations to rededicate themselves to fight contemporary forms of waging war and ensure a more peaceful and secure world.He said the World War II remains the greatest military engagement in the history of the Indian subcontinent. Despite being under colonial occupation, India contributed 2.5 million soldiers who fought in every theatre of World War II, from North Africa to Europe and as far east as Hong Kong.The Indian army was also the largest volunteer force ever raised in history, of which 87,000 died or went missing and over a hundred thousand suffered grave injuries.“We also cannot forget the sacrifices of our Asian, African and Arab brothers and sisters who fought and died for the freedom of the Allied powers, although they were under the yoke of colonial rule,” Sharma said.He said there can be no real statistical measurement of the human and material cost of World War II. “No figure can quantify the human loss, deprivation and suffering, the dislocation of peoples and of economic life, or the sheer physical destruction of property that the war witnessed.”Saluting the valiant young men and women and people of all the countries who fought to save the world, Sharma said Indian soldiers had participated in the war effort in the millions and suffered immense casualties. However, it is “disheartening” to note that despite the contributions of thousands of volunteers from the colonial world to the war efforts of the Allied forces, the contributions of these brave men and women have not been given their due recognition.“Although the battlefronts of Europe were romanticised in novels, history books and films, much of the war was fought in and over colonies controlled by the colonial powers, with front lines springing up from North Africa to East Asia,” he said.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan that some states on their own were following this practice to prevent the spread of the virus and the practice has nothing to do with stigmatising Covid-19 patients. However, the Bench said the ground reality is “something different” as once such posters are pasted at their homes, they are treated as untouchables.

Australia was backing a demand being made by the US and some of its allies.The tussle entered cyber space after the Australian military was accused of murdering 39 Afghan civilians.The social media has erupted with western think tanks calling on Joe Biden’s transition team to demonstrate solidarity. Jaishankar’s conversation with Payne should be seen as standing by Australia, an important strategic partner for India in the post-Covid world, said sources.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had called an unscheduled press conference to demand an official apology from China after one of its wolf-warrior diplomats posted a picture of an Australian soldier threatening a young child with a knife.On Monday evening, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying counter-attacked by saying, “The Australian side has reacted so strongly to my colleague’s Twitter does that mean that they think the cold-blooded murder of Afghan innocent civilians is justified while other people’s condemnation of such crimes are not justified?”The Australians seemed to be at the receiving end after the editor-in-chief of The Global Times, Hu Xinjin, also jumped in.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-dials-oz-counterpart-amid-canberra-beijing-tussle-178672
02-12-2020||---||After high-octane campaigning, low voter turnout in Hyderabad||Hyderabad, December 1After hectic campaigning that brought big national leaders to Hyderabad, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polling witnessed a lackluster response. The State Election Commission (SEC) authorities reported fewer than 40 per cent polling in these civic polls that had attracted national attention.The voting turned to be a photo opportunity for people to take pictures with Telugu cine stars and local politicians. The figures released by the SEC at 5 pm were just 35.8 per cent polling.The polling was by and large peaceful barring some skirmishes between the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and All-India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) supporters in the old city area. BJP state president Bandi Sanjay accused the opposition workers of damaging his car and preventing him from going to some polling stations. The SEC has announced re-poll in some wards of the Malakpet segment.By 4 pm, when two hours of polling was still pending, the SEC reported only 30 per cent voting, it went up slightly till the end of the polling, but was still “disappointing” according to some politicians. The Covid-19 pandemic and series of holidays is said to have acted as a spoilsport in terms of lower polling percentage.According to reports tabulated so far, Bagh Amberpet division recorded the highest turnout of 64.82 per cent while the lowest 6.77 per cent polling was seen in Monda Market.The elections were held through paper ballots instead of Electronic Voting Machines. For voters above 80 years of age, physically challenged and those who tested Covid-19 positive after November 1, postal ballot facility was offered.Superstar Chiranjeevi and actor Nagarjuna were among the leading Telugu film personalities who cast their votes.

However, Punjab unions said they rejected the offer of tea during the talks and instead asked the ministers to join them for ‘kheer’ and ‘langar’ at the border. “We just want the black laws to be rolled back,” they told Tomar, who asked farmer leaders to “identify specific issues related to farm reform Acts and share them with the government for consideration”. These issues will be discussed during the fourth round of meeting to be held on December 3. “The Government of India is always committed to protecting the interests of the farmers and is always open for discussions for their welfare,” Tomar said.Following the three-hour meeting, farmer leaders said the agitation at Delhi borders would continue. Representatives from UP and other states are also demanding an equal footing in consultations.Union leaders claimed Tomar told them that “statutes could have deficiencies and that the government is willing to look into objections and deficiencies pointed out by the unions and will consider changing the same”.While farmers are willing to settle for nothing but a complete rollback of five laws (the three “black” laws, the newly enacted ordinance on air quality management in Delhi-NCR and the electricity Bill 2020), the government too is firm on its stance. Farmer leaders say the laws are “more than 90 per cent wrong”. “If the government wants new laws, it will have to first consult farmers. These are like a death sentence for the farmers and we will not allow corporates in Punjab.”Trudeau speaks in support, MEA hits backNew Delhi: The MEA has called “unwarranted” and “ill-informed” the comments by Justin Trudeau, Canadian Prime Minister, on the farmers’ stir made during a virtual interaction to mark Gurpurb. “The situation is concerning and we are all very worried about family and friends and I know that is a reality for many of you. Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the right of peaceful protest,” he said. TNSOpen hearts, not just doors, says CongressNew Delhi: Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the government should either suspend the three farm laws or announce legal guarantee for the MSP regime. “Please talk to all farmer outfits… Opening doors is not sufficient, open your hearts too,” he said. TNSSportspersons to return awardsChandigarh: Several former sportspersons, including Padma Shri wrestler Kartar Singh and Arjuna awardees Sajjan Singh Cheema (basketball) and Rajbir Kaur (hockey), have decided to return their awards to protest the use of “brute force” on farmers en route to Delhi.

02-12-2020||---||Supreme Court rejects Chanda plea against ouster as CEO||New Delhi, December 1The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected Chanda Kochhar’s petition challenging a Bombay High Court order dismissing a plea against her termination as the managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank.“Sorry, we are not inclined to interfere with the High Court order. This falls within the realm of private banks and employees,” said a Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul.Kochhar had challenged the March 5 order of the High Court that dismissed her plea against termination as managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, while noting that the dispute arose from a contract of personal service.The High Court had accepted the bank’s contention that Kochhar’s plea was not maintainable as the dispute was contractual and concerned a private body.“I (Kochhar) was the MD of ICICI bank but the bank recalled my earlier resignation and converted it into termination. This was wrong as it was against the norms,” senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi submitted on behalf of Kochhar. Her resignation was changed into a termination and there was no prior approval, he submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-rejects-chanda-plea-against-ouster-as-ceo-178680
02-12-2020||Aditi Tandon||Never spoke of vaccinating all: Centre||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 1Amid hectic planning for the rollout of a potential Covid-19 vaccine in India, the government today said it had never spoken of inoculating the entire country against the virus. Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan and ICMR chief Balram Bhargava, both members of the National Taskforce on Covid-19 Vaccine Administration, said the purpose of vaccination was to break the chain of virus transmission and the same could be done by inoculating a critical mass of people.“There has never been any talk of inoculating the entire country,” Bhushan said.Adding to the issue, ICMR chief Bhargava noted, “The purpose of vaccination is breaking the chain of Covid transmission. We may not have to vaccinate all the people if we can break that chain by inoculating a critical mass of people. But even after that, masks would have to be worn.”The government also made it clear today that the ongoing vaccine trials in India were safe. Bhushan said an adverse event reported during the Serum Institute’s Covid vaccine trial in October was unrelated to the vaccine and the Drug Controller General of India, after reviewing safety data from trials, did not find any cause to halt trials.“Initial causality analysis of the reported adverse event did not necessitate stoppage of the Serum Institute Covid vaccine trial,” ICMR chief said maintaining that due processes laid down under the clinical trial framework were followed in respect of two adverse events reported so far.“Both trials are in now phase 3,” the Health Secretary said. Asked if those already infected with Covid would get the vaccine, the ICMR said, “The WHO guidance says the vaccine, when ready, can be administered to anyone, including those who have already contracted Covid and have antibodies.”Punjab, HP, Haryana see highest spike in NovemberPunjab, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana are among five states to report the highest spike in active cases between November 1 and December 1, the other two being Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.Lower covid test cost, Centre tells statesThe Centre has written to states to lower the cost of Covid testing citing how the cost of RTPCR kits had declined from nearly Rs1,800 per kit in March to Rs100 currently.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/never-spoke-of-vaccinating-all-centre-178682
02-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers' agitation: Stalemate continues, meeting inconclusive||The much-anticipated third round of talks between farmers’ unions, including 32 Punjab ‘jathebandis’, and Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash ended inconclusively with farmer leaders rejecting the Centre’s proposal to form a five-member committee to look into their objections and study the concerns.The farmers’ unions told the government that “such committees had led to no results and outcomes in the past” and that “the time for committees is over and they now want a concrete decision”.Though according to an official statement, Agriculture Minister Tomar proposed to constitute an expert committee “to put forth the issues of farmers so as to resolve them with mutual consent but representatives of farmer unions suggested that all the representatives will attend further round of discussions with the government to resolve the matter amicably”. Various issues related to “Farm Reform Acts were discussed in cordial atmosphere”, officials said.Though ‘jathebandis’ said they also rejected the offer of tea during the talks and instead asked ministers to join them for ‘kheer’ and ‘langar’ at the border.“We just want the black laws to be rolled back,” they told Tomar who also asked farmer leaders to “identify specific issues related to Farm Reform Acts and share with the government tomorrow for consideration”.These issues will be discussed during the fourth round of meeting to be held on December 3.“The Government of India is always committed to protect the interest of farmers and is always open for discussions for farmers’ welfare,” Tomar said.Following the three-hour meeting, farmer leaders said the agitation at Delhi borders will continue.Representatives from Uttar Pradesh and other states are also demanding an equal footing in consultations.While farmers have managed to get their way by ensuring an “unconditional meeting”, it remains to be seen what course further discussions take.Union leaders claimed the minister told them that “statutes could have deficiencies and that the government is willing to look into objections and deficiencies pointed to by the unions and consider changing the same”.While farmers are willing to settle for nothing but a complete rollback of five laws (the three “black” laws, the newly-enacted ordinance on Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and the Electricity Bill 2020) the government too is firm on its stance.Even if it does become agreeable to some amendments, farmer leaders say that “more than 90 per cent of the laws are wrong. If the government wants new laws, it will have to first consult farmers. These are like a death sentence for the farmers and we will not allow corporate in Punjab. The government believes it can tire us but the agitation will continue. It only has two options, either it takes back the laws or use force”. A leader from Madhya Pradesh, Shiv Kumar Sharma (Kakkaji), said farmers “will not go back empty-handed from Delhi”.Observers believe to carry on protests forever is not tenable for farmers and for the government as they are “bad optics”.Farmers are a huge electorate and these protests cannot be equated with earlier agitations, like anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh.The BJP is in the know of this as the talks had followed a high-level meeting of the BJP top brass, including Home Minister Amit Shah and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-agitation-stalemate-continues-meeting-inconclusive-178458

The November numbers were still one lakh short of the current year’s high of 83 lakh in January.The Union Finance Ministry said the collection was in line with the recent trend of recovery in GST revenue.It opted to compare the revenue in November with the same month last year, which was 1.4 per cent higher.
