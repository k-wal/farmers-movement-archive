19-12-2020||Beijing||Chinese President Xi appoints new General for PLA’s Western Theatre Command amidst Ladakh standoff||Chinese President Xi Jinping has appointed a new General as the Commander of the People’s Liberation Army’s Western Theatre Command which oversees the Sino-Indian border, amidst the military standoff in eastern Ladakh.President Xi, who heads the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall high-command of the two million-strong People’s Liberation Army (PLA), appointed Gen. Zhang Xudong as the Commander of the Western Theatre Command, according to the official media here.Xi has promoted four senior Chinese military and armed police officers. Among them was Gen. Zhang, Commander of the Western Theatre Command of the PLA, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Friday.The other officers who were promoted include Guo Puxiao, Political Commissar of the Logistic Support Department of the CMC; Li Wei, Political Commissar of the PLA Strategic Support Force and Wang Chunning, Commander.The new appointments at the top of the PLA Western Command come in the midst of the standoff between the Chinese and Indian military in eastern Ladakh since May.Not much is known about Gen. Zhang, especially his association with Western Theatre Command, as he reportedly served mostly in other theatre commands of the PLA.He succeeds 65-year-old Gen. Zhao Zongqi who headed the Western Theatre Command during the 2017 Doklam standoff where the Indian Army stood up against the PLA’s plan of laying a road close to the Indian border in an area claimed by Bhutan.The Ladakh standoff also happened under the watch of Gen Zhao. It began in May after China dispatched thousands of troops which were mobilised for military exercises to eastern Ladakh borders, sparking a new round of tensions with India.India and China have held several rounds of talks at the diplomatic and military-level to resolve the prolonged standoff.At the latest round of foreign ministry-level talks on December 18, the two sides said that they have agreed to continue work towards ensuring complete disengagement of troops in all friction points along the LAC. The meeting also decided to hold the next round of military dialogue at an early date. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-president-xi-appoints-new-general-for-plas-western-theatre-command-amidst-ladakh-standoff-186666
19-12-2020||Kolkata||TMC filled with individuals who don't bother about anyone: Suvendu in open letter||In an open letter to grass roots members of the Trinamool Congress, Suvendu Adhikari, a heavyweight TMC leader who joined the BJP on Saturday, said that West Bengal was standing at a critical juncture as people were destined to make a choice in the 2021 Assembly elections that would impact them forever.Adhikari claimed in the letter that "an extremely deep rot and malaise" had set in to the TMC."Neither West Bengal nor the Trinamool Congress is anyone's fiefdom," Adhikari, who resigned his ministership and left the party following differences with its top leadership, wrote.Asserting that the party was not built in one day with the contribution of one person, he wrote that it was a continuous and contiguous effort on a mammoth scale, the culmination of which was the TMC's coming to power in West Bengal in 2011.He alleged that the TMC, which the ordinary people built brick by brick selflessly, was now filled with individuals who do not bother about anyone but themselves.Adhikari, who played a significant role in the Nandigram anti-land acquisition movement that helped Mamata Banerjee win the 2011 Assembly elections bringing down the 34-year-old CPI(M)-led Left Front government, claimed that the problems faced by people a decade ago remained the same and "in some cases, has become worse".Alleging that the TMC has reneged on its pledge to serve the 'Maa, Mati and Manush', he said, "The individuals currently in charge of the party are treating it like their personal fiefdom.""The individuals have now hired external assistance, people with no knowledge of ground realities," Adhikari wrote in an indirect reference to poll strategist Prashant Kishor and his organisation I-PAC engaged by the TMC.Enumerating the sacrifices of the grass roots workers in building the party in the six-page letter, Adhikari claimed that these people were now being sidelined, humiliated and outcast.He alleged that the party was now filled with those working for personal gains.Adhikari alleged that the TMC was now working against the Bengali culture while claiming to defend it.He also wrote about Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar drawing "public attention (on) more than 100 instances of a total breakdown in the law and order situation". Alleging that the people of the state were being fooled by the ruling dispensation, Adhikari said, "Belated attempts such as Duare Sarkar (government at doorsteps) programme which were conceptualised 10 years after being in power, cannot placate our great people."The 'Duare Sarkar' programme was launched by the TMC government on December 1 to help people avail the benefits of welfare schemes, setting up camps in many localities across the state.

19-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers’ agitation: Will decide next course of action in 2-3 days, say protesting unions||Farmer unions protesting against the three agriculture laws on Saturday said they will decide their next course of action in the next two-three days, after the Supreme Court earlier this week pointed out it was thinking of setting up an “impartial and independent” panel of agriculture experts and peasants’ unions to resolve the deadlock.Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said discussions among unions are currently underway to decide their strategy, adding that they are also seeking legal opinion on the matter.“Our meetings are being held for the next course of action. We hope that in the next two-three days, we will have clarity on whether we should be part of a committee as suggested by the court,” Kakka told PTI.Another leader Balbir Singh said farmers will not call off their protests until their demands are met.“We are ready for a long haul. We are here for our rights. We are in the process to decide our stand following the court’s order,” he also said.Thousands of farmers have been staying put at several Delhi border points for the last 23 days, demanding a repeal of the new agri laws.Meanwhile, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) Saturday claimed that 33 farmers participating in the ongoing protests have so far died since November 26 due to accidents, illness and cold weather conditions.According to AIKS, ‘Homage Day’ will be observed in different parts of the country on Sunday to pay tributes to those farmers who lost their lives.Earlier this week, the Supreme Court had acknowledged the right of farmers to non-violent protests and mooted the idea of putting on hold the contentious farm laws to enable negotiations with the agitating farmers, which was opposed by the Centre, which said the agriculturists would not come forward for the talks then.The apex court, which made it clear that the issue of farmers’ protest and the right of others to move freely would be dealt on priority at the moment and not the validity of the laws, also said it was thinking of setting up an “impartial and independent” panel of agriculture experts and farmer unions to resolve the impasse.The top court said it was of the view that the farmers’ right to protest should not infringe the fundamental right of others to move freely and in getting essential food and other supplies as right to protest cannot mean blocking the entire city.The apex court, which said it was worried with the way things are going on, was told by both the Centre and one of the farmers’ unions that the negotiations are not happening at the moment.It also said the farmers cannot keep on protesting without talking to the government. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-agitation-will-decide-next-course-of-action-in-2-3-days-say-protesting-unions-186648

He is holding wooden ‘fatta’ (plank) and brick in his hands. Thus, he is actively participating in the riots.“Thus, the accused was part of the unlawful assembly which in prosecution of common object had committed the offence of rioting and firing gunshot injuries on the public persons and police officials and thus, every member of unlawful assembly is deemed to be guilty of offence committed by every member of that assembly in prosecution of common object of that assembly,” the court said in its order passed on December 18.During the hearing, Singh’s counsel claimed he had been falsely implicated in the matter and was pulling a rickshaw with a passenger during the riots in the Welcome area.Special Public Prosecutor Saleem Ahmed, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea, saying Singh can be clearly seen in a CCTV footage allegedly actively participating in the riots and pelting stones.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between those opposing the amended citizenship law and those supporting it spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

19-12-2020||Satya Prakash||General category not ‘quota’; it’s open to all: SC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 19Maintaining that general category vacancies in government employment were open to all, including those from reserved categories, the Supreme Court has said disallowing meritorious candidates from reserved categories to migrate to general category would amount to communal reservation.“The principle that candidates belonging to any of the vertical reservation categories are entitled to be selected in “Open or General Category” is well settled. It is also well accepted that if such candidates belonging to reserved categories are entitled to be selected on the basis of their own merit, their selection cannot be counted against the quota reserved for the categories for vertical reservation that they belong,” a Bench of Justice UU Lalit, Justice Ravindra Bhat and Justice Hrishikesh Roy said.Justice Bhat – who wrote a separate concurring judgment – said, “The open category is not a ‘quota’, but rather available to all women and men alike.”The court said, “Reservations, both vertical and horizontal, are methods of ensuring representation in public services. These are not to be seen as rigid “slots”, where a candidate’s merit, which otherwise entitles her to be shown in the open general category, is foreclosed, as the consequence would be, if the state’s argument is accepted. Doing so, would result in a communal reservation, where each social category is confined within the extent of their reservation, thus negating merit.“The open category is open to all, and the only condition for a candidate to be shown in it is merit, regardless of whether reservation benefit of either type is available to her or him,” it ruled.The ruling came on petitions raising the issue of the correct method of filling the quota reserved for women candidates (horizontal reservation) for selection of constables in Uttar Pradesh. The petitioners OBC candidates, largely women, complained that the Uttar Pradesh government failed to correctly apply the rule of reservation in selection of constables, and denied them the benefit of “migration” to the general category vacancies as they had secured the marks needed to qualify for the open category.Reserved category candidates having secured more marks than the last ranked general category candidate should be given employment under general category, it said.It said, “Any selection which results in candidates getting selected against open/general category with less merit than the other available candidates will certainly be opposed to principles of equality.”OBC Female Category candidates having more marks than 274.8928, (secured by the last candidate appointed in General Category-Female) must be offered employment as constables in UP Police, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/general-category-not-quota-its-open-to-all-sc-186641

19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Focus on multilateral partnerships to check challenges posed by China, say experts||Pointing out that China believing that its power based on its impressive economic growth gives it a position of pre-eminence in the Asian region and hence it need not adhere to any kind of a multi lateral arrangement, Shyam Saran, former foreign secretary, said that If this is China’s approach, then there is no alternative but to have a strong coalition to push back against such aggressive behavior.Stating that India should have less hesitation in taking this forward while speaking at a session on ‘The QUAD: Emerging Indo-Pacific Naval Alliance’ at the Military Literature Festival here today, he said: "The QUAD is an alliance formed by India, United States Australia and Japan"."The QUAD is emerging because there is a feeling that a very aggressive and assertive China, which has built up considerable naval power, particularly in the South China Sea, poses an increased challenge," he said. "Further, with the security relations among the four countries having become much deeper, the building blocks were already in place, while the major European powers like Germany, France and the UK also have an interest in working with other partners for security of the Indo-Pacific region, he added.Saran said that India’s approach towards maritime security is that the security architecture should be open, transparent and inclusive so that it keeps open the door for China too to join provided that it adheres to various norms and rules that are necessary for sustaining such a maritime security architecture. If we are able to convince China that its interests are better served by being part of this inclusive architecture rather than pursuing unilateral dominance then we would be making some progress," he added.Former Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba said that that there has been a great deal of aggressive behaviour by China."They are signatories to the majority of international agreements but they have been changing the rules and regulations to suit their own interests," he added. Vice-Admiral Pradeep Chauhan, former Chief of Staff, Western Naval Command, said that China considers India as one of its target of military assertion, a challenge which our establishment has so far not been familiar and comfortable dealing with it."We need to have a nimble asymmetric strategy and must maneouver our strengths to best of our capabilities in thwarting China," he added.Pointing out that China has been weaponising its economic prominence to saddle other countries, he added that India need bold steps across the board to counter rising China and it cannot be choosy while entering alliances. He said that India’s decision to stay out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership was incorrect and not in line with keeping the high ambitions to match geo-strategic goals.Stating that India faces growing threats and it needs more partnerships globally than ever before, Prof. C Raja Mohan, Director Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore added that in the changed global scenario India cannot remain neutral anymore and it will have to move fast on multiple fronts while strengthening QUAD and enhancing other regional mechanisms. "The way China threatens India today requires it to dynamically improve national economic capacity along with military capability, in partnerships with intensive international coalitions for which QUAD could be the central fulcrum for the time being," he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/focus-on-multilateral-partnerships-to-check-challenges-posed-by-china-say-experts-186636

The Quad is also discussing joint disaster relief exercises and coordination in the distribution of Covid vaccines.During their virtual meeting on Friday, diplomats from India, the US, Australia and Japan also discussed strengthening supply chain resiliency and coordinating efforts to support countries “vulnerable to malign and coercive economic actions” in the Indo-Pacific region, said a US State Department readout.The NATO recently stepped up its approach to countering disinformation where it has also spoken of China’s ‘Wolf Warrior’ diplomacy and the need to counter its claim of being a responsible global leader with a superior governance model.The Indian readout outlined cooperation in two broad subsets: connectivity and infrastructure development, and security issues (counter-terrorism, cyber security, maritime security, humanitarian and disaster relief).The Australian readout, besides going over the ground covered by the MEA and US State Department, mentioned the “Mekong sub-region”, comprising Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, as well as maritime security, cyber and critical technology and critical minerals.The Japanese Foreign Ministry mentioned six areas of cooperation – quality infrastructure, maritime security, counter-terrorism, cyber security, HADR, and education and human resource development.

Though not many police officers are interested in assignments like this, But Koshy Koshy headed the Haryana Police Academy (HPA) and also worked IG (Training) for long. He believed that police training was very important for inculcating right kind of behaviour practices among cops,” said Manoj Yadava, Director General of Police, Haryana, who has worked with Koshy Koshy for long.Yadava remembers how immaculately Koshy Koshy managed a mega event as DIG of Gurugram range of AICC session at Surajkund when the then PM PV Narasimha Rao and a plethora of dignitaries were to camp there for three days.He loved watching birds and taking their pictures.Koshy Koshy will also be remembered for authoring Punjab Police Rules 1934 with explanations and annotation.The book is referred to by all police officers in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.Hanif Qureshi, a senior IPS officer of Haryana who is now posted as Director General of New and Renewable Energy Department, Haryana, remembers that when happened to visit Lahore (Pakistan) as an advance party for then Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala’s visit, he was surprised to find Koshy Koshy’s book on Punjab Police Rules 1934 lying on the table of DIG, Lahore.“When I asked him do you refer to Koshy Koshy’s book, the officer asked me with pleasant surprise whether I knew the author personally. He told me that all police officers in Pakistan’s Punjab referred to this book only for referring to any police rules,” said Qureshi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/koshy-koshy-whose-book-on-police-rules-guided-cops-across-british-punjab-passes-away-186633

CBI should probe his role in this connection," Shahdeo said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lalu-prasad-health-stable-says-jharkhand-prisons-doctor-gets-show-cause-for-comment-on-his-kidney-ailment-186623
19-12-2020||New Delhi||ED attaches properties of Abdullah, others in JKCA scam case||Enforcement Directorate attached assets worth Rs 11.86 crore belonging to former chief minister Farooq Abdullah and some others in its ongoing investigation into allegations of corruption in the Jammu Kashmir Cricket Association, officials said.Officials said the agency has issued a provisional attachment order under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the attached properties are located in Jammu and Srinagar.Two immovable assets are residential, one is a commercial property while three other plots of land have also been attached by the Enforcement Directorate, they said.While the book value of these attached properties is Rs 11.86 crore, their market value is about Rs 60-70 crore, they added.Abdullah is being investigated over allegations of misappropriating Rs 113 crore that was sent to the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The allegations pertain to a time when he was president of the association.The 83-year-old leader has been questioned by the ED in this case a number of times, the last being in October at Srinagar. People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, an alliance of several regional political parties including Abdullah's National Conference,  accused the BJP-ruling Centre of targeting Abdullah. Abdullah is the chairperson of the alliance.‘Baseless'Omar Abdullah, Farooq Abdullah’s son and another former chief minister of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, called ED’s allegations “baseless" and wondered how an ancestral property could be seen as proceeds of "crime".In a series of tweets, Omar, who is the vice-president of the National Conference, said his father, Farooq Abdullah, "is in touch with his lawyers and will fight all these baseless charges in the one place that matters - a court of law".He said everyone is presumed to be innocent and is entitled to a fair trial "unlike in the court of the media or the court of BJP managed social media".Omar expressed wonder that the properties attached are largely ancestral dating from the 1970s with the most recent one built before 2003."There can be no justification for the seizures because they fail the very basic test of having been acquired as the proceeds of the 'crime' being investigated," he said.He said that his father came to know about the attachment of his properties in the ongoing investigation in to the JKCA matter through media."Not surprisingly the media was tipped off regarding the seizure before he had received any official notice or documentation," he said.--- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-attaches-properties-of-abdullah-others-in-jkca-scam-case-186622

19-12-2020||Anand (Gujarat)||Why Cong allowed contract farming in Punjab, asks Gujarat CM||Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Saturday alleged that corporates are allowed to enter into contract farming in the Congress-ruled Punjab while the party is opposing the new farm laws.Among other things, the new laws enacted by the Union government provide a framework for contracts between private entities and farmers.Addressing a gathering at Karamsad in Anand district as part of the BJP’s campaign to create awareness about the contentious farm sector reforms,Rupani also claimed that the Congress manifesto spoke about allowing the sale of produce outside Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs).“I must ask Congress, why your government in Punjab, your chief minister (Amarinder Singh) granted permission for contract farming to large companies and distributed permission letters from the stage?” Rupani said.“And now they are out to oppose contract farming?” he asked.“Contract farming is the future. In contract farming, farmers are assured of the price they will get for their produce,” he said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had in the past written letters to chief ministers of party-ruled states seeking that farmers be allowed to sell their produce in open markets, and the same promise was made in the party’s 2019 election manifesto, Rupani further claimed.APMCs will continue to function contrary to the fear that they will be abolished, and the Centre as well as the Gujarat government have earmarked crores of rupees for their modernization, Rupani said.His government gave farm loans at zero percent interest, he said.“If the Congress is so much concerned about farmers, then give loans to them at zero per cent interest in (Congress-ruled) Rajasthan,” he said.He also dared the Congress to state how many farmers benefited from loan waiver in Madhya Pradesh during its rule.“Anti-national elements” who do not want to see the country progress and farmers lead a happy life have joined the agitation against the new farm laws, Rupani alleged.“Farmers are not part of it. Farmers across the country did not participate in the Bharat Bandh call given by the opposition,” he claimed.

However, the way that we have developed and provided treatment to our employees, most of them have recovered. However, there have been some unfortunate deaths. Railway has opened COVID care centres and COVID care facilities in every zone and division and we have taken care of each one of our employees.“In the beginning we had dedicated 50 hospitals for COVID care now there are 74 such hospitals,” Yadav had said on Friday.Sources on Saturday said that the death toll is around 700.“Most of the 700 employees who died due to coronavirus were all who were involved in direct interaction with the general public and most susceptible to the disease. They were frontline workers who helped the Railways facilitate the movement  of migrants and run the special trains. They were on platforms and in areas were catching the infection was most probable. They are like railways’ unsung heroes,” the source said.In a reply in Parliament, the Railway Ministry had said no compensation is granted to the families of the railway employees who die during performance of their bona fide duties. The compensation is granted in the form of ex gratia payment as per the guidelines of the Department of Pension and Pensioners Welfare. However, death on account of any disease is not included in these guidelines.While no breakup of the 30,000 infected is currently available, in a reply to a question on the issue in Parliament in September, the ministry had provided details of 336 deaths among railway employees and 14,714 who were infected.According to the reply, a maximum of over 2,200 infections were reported by the South Central Railway, followed by 1,323 cases in the Central Railway, 1,307 in the Northern Railway, 1,145 in the Southern Railway and 1,013 cases in the East Central Railway.India’s COVID-19 caseload surpassed the one-crore mark on Saturday, adding 10 lakh cases in nearly a month, while the total number of recoveries surged to 95.50 lakh, according to the Union Health Ministry data. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/around-30-000-infected-railways-lost-700-frontline-workers-to-covid-in-last-9-months-186617

North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash and South Delhi Mayor Anamika Mithilesh also fell sick and were recommended hospitalisation on Saturday, Kumar said.Puri expressed regret that Kejriwal did not meet the protesters even once during their 13-day dharna.The mayors and a few senior leaders of the three municipal corporations launched the indefinite hunger strike at the protest site on Thursday to demand the release of the Rs 13,000 crore from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government.Speaking in the Assembly on Friday, the chief minister said even courts have said the Delhi government has paid all dues to the civic bodies.The police sent a notice to North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash on Saturday, asking him to end the hunger strike and leave the dharna site near the chief minister’s residence in the Civil Lines area.“It has been more than 11 days since you have been sitting on a dharna near the CM’s residence and you, along with others, have already been read over, explained and given a copy of the order of the Delhi High Court dated August 22, 2017 regarding procession/dharna in the Civil Lines area by the SHO, Civil Lines,” the notice stated.It asked the protesters to vacate the site and move to a designated site if they wanted to continue with the dharna. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/civic-body-mayors-call-off-dharna-near-delhi-cms-residence-after-13-days-186611

The digging will resume after he submits a report," he added.Solanki said the structure could be 1000 years old belonging to the time of the Parmar dynasty, as the red brown basalt found during the excavation was used during that period."Further excavation around the temple may bring up relics from the period of Vikramaditya some 2600 years ago," Solanki added.District Collector Ashish Singh said further excavation at the site will be done under the supervision of experts to ensure everything of historical and archaeological importance is safeguarded. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/remains-of-old-structure-found-mp-temple-digging-work-stopped-186607
19-12-2020||Chandigarh||India’s forgotten victory over China in 1967 surfaces at Military Literature Festival||India’s little known victory over China in 1967, which had a significant impact in the future course of events South Asia on Saturday, took the centre stage with a discussion on a recently published book, ‘Watershed 1967---India’s forgotten Victory Over China’ by Probal Dasgupta at the ongoing Military Literature Festival here.The author spoke about the purpose of writing the book during the Doklam stand-off in 2017, when he realised that much of the ongoing discourse in India’s public domain was fixated around India’s 1962 debacle against China. He said that It struck him as odd that India’s victory of 1967 over its arch rival had been buried and forgotten. Speaking about the China-Pakistan nexus in 1965, which forms the beginning of the book, he also discussed the involvement of the US Central Intelligence Agency and a think tank in Arlington, Virginia, which knew of a Sino-Pakistani plan to capture Kashmir alongside with making inroads into Sikkim that would to force India in to a defensive negotiating position resulting in taking Kashmir in exchange for Sikkim, then a protectorate state.Former GOC-in-C, Western Command, Lt Gen KJ Singh, who had earlier commanded the Corps at Sikkim where the battles of 1967 had taken place, spoke of the nuances around these battles and the area.Elucidating how the Chumbi valley presented a similar vulnerability to the Chinese like the narrow Siliguri corridor posed to India, he spole about Lt Gen Sagat Singh’s leadership and his leadership, including placement of artillery guns, ensured that a difficult situation could be salvaged and turned into India’s favour quickly. The artillery used at Nathu La changed the course of the battle.He also raised senior leadership’s perplexing decision in 1965 to withdraw from Jelep La, which gave Chinese the psychological edge, even though India now occupies the heights around the pass and stressed the need for a deeper analysis of that decision. He added that decision making at the senior level needs to be bolder to turn critical, decisive moments in a battle to our advantage.Lt Gen JS Cheema spoke about the happenings in the aftermath of 1967, wherein various geopolitical events rather than the battles of 1967, ensured that China didn’t interfere with India’s campaign in Bangladesh. He said that the victories of 1967 had swung the psychological advantage in India’s favour and also felt that the book rightly brought out the parallels between India’s actions in 1967 and similar boldness during the Sumdoring Chu standoff with China in 1987. He added that such alacrity and confidence were also witnessed during the 2017 Doklam stand-off.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-forgotten-victory-over-china-in-1967-surfaces-at-military-literature-festival-186604
19-12-2020||New Delhi||There may not be a second peak of COVID-19 in India: Experts||Healthcare experts have said that there may not be a second peak of COVID-19 in the country, and even if it occurs, it is unlikely to be as strong as the first one.The comments come as the country's COVID-19 caseload surpassed the one crore mark, though the number of daily cases and daily fatalities have been continuously coming down.Noted virologist Dr Shahid Jameel said India's curve for daily cases is on a downward slope since a peak in mid-September."At this time, we are getting about 25,500 cases daily compared to over 93,000 cases per day in mid-September. I believe the worst is over. But there will be small peaks in the future just as we witnessed in late November," he said."I don't think there would be a second peak as we have gone through the festive season (Dussehra to Diwali) and a state election without a significant jump. What is the reason for this? If we go by the second national serosurvey, likely cases were 16 times confirmed cases. By that factor, India would have 160 million cases now," he told PTI.It is possible that by now there are over 300-400 million infections in the country, Jameel said."By that token, we are seeing large parts of the population getting protected and breaking transmission of the virus," he said."Unexposed and susceptible people will continue to get infected. If immunity lasts a year or less, then we may have small peaks at regular intervals for the next few years. Good vaccine coverage will control this effectively," he said.When asked about a possible second peak of COVID-19, noted clinical scientist Dr Gagandeep Kang opined the transmission will not be as rapid as was seen the first time and the peak will not be as high."I don't think the exposure is enough to say that we have herd immunity and won't need to worry about it again, but I think it is enough to ensure that we will have some level of protection so that the transmission will not be as rapid as was seen the first time and the peak will also be not as high," she said."The problem has not gone away it will not go away with herd immunity, but I don't think necessarily we will see second higher peaks as has been seen in the West," Kang said.Dr K K Agarwal, an eminent cardiologist, said there is still 30-40 percent population in India which has not been infected by COVID-19.He said India, Argentina and Poland are the three countries among the 15 nations having the highest number of COVID cases that are not showing a second peak."By all probability, India may not have a second peak, and if the second peak comes, it will only come due to the 501 new variant. Two of them have been described, one in south of England and one in South Africa."If you don't get that strain, then there will not be a second peak. If India starts its vaccination programme by the end of this month and vaccinates around 30 crore people, we should be able to control this disease by March 25," Agarwal told PTI.However, if there is a second wave, he said, then it would be a new variant of the virus which will mean more cases but lesser mortality and the second peak will help in building herd immunity.Asked if the worst was over for India, Dr Samiran Panda, the Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said the epidemiological curve has come down for some states, while there is a fluctuation for others."In more states, we have seen effective control while in some of the states we need to be mindful and watchful. The state scenarios are different from each other," Panda told PTI.India on Saturday crossed the somber milestone of one crore COVID-19 cases, adding 10 lakh infections in nearly a month, even as the virus spread slowed and recoveries surged to over 95.50 lakh, according to Union Health Ministry data.The health ministry's data updated at 8 AM on Saturday showed that the total number of cases mounted to 1,00,04,599, and the death toll to 1,45,136 with the virus claiming 347 more lives in a span of 24 hours.(Click here for the latest developments on Covid-19 epidemic)India reported its first COVID-19 case 323 days ago on January 30 in Kerala, while the first death was reported on March 10 in Karnataka. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-may-not-be-a-second-peak-of-covid-19-in-india-experts-186603

19-12-2020||London||Indian banks pursue UK bankruptcy order against Vijay Mallya||A consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) returned to the High Court in London for a bankruptcy application hearing against liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya, as they pursue the recovery of debt from loans paid out to his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.At a virtual hearing before Chief Insolvencies and Companies Court (ICC) Judge Michael Briggs on Friday, both sides deposed retired Indian Supreme Court justices as expert witnesses on Indian law in support of their arguments for and against a bankruptcy order against Mallya in the UK.While the banks argued a right to waive their security over the Indian assets involved in the case in order to recover their debt in the UK, lawyers for the 65-year-old businessman argued that the funds in question involved public money held by state-owned banks in India which precluded them from such a security waiver."As a commercial entity, a bank has a right to exercise its commercial wisdom to decide what it wants to do with its security,” noted barrister Marcia Shekerdemian, arguing on behalf of SBI and others.She cross-examined Retd Justice Deepak Verma, who deposed via video link from India on behalf of Mallya to establish that the banks cannot give up their security on the Indian assets and then pursue a bankruptcy order under English law because public money and public interest is involved in the case in India.Retd Justice Gopala Gowda argued the reverse in his cross-examination by Mallya's barrister Philip Marshall, saying the banks had a right to relinquish their security in pursuit of unpaid dues.The exchange between the lawyers got heated at several points during the course of the virtual hearing, also being followed by Mallya, with Judge Briggs stepping in to urge a focussed question and answer approach to expedite the proceedings.However, the depositions left no time for closing submissions in the case, which has now been adjourned to a yet-to-be-agreed date in the New Year.Meanwhile, Marshall once again raised the issue of access to court-held funds from the sale of a French property for Mallya to be able to cover the legal fees of the next hearing as he no longer has a source of income from his consultancy work.The SBI led consortium of 13 Indian banks, which also includes Bank of Baroda, Corporation Bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd, had initiated the proceedings against Mallya in December 2018.There have been a series of hearings in the case since then as part of their efforts to recoup around1.145 billion pounds in unpaid loans.Mallya, meanwhile, remains on bail as the UK Home Office deals with a “confidential” legal issue before UK Home Secretary Priti Patel can sign off on his extradition sought by the Indian government, on charges of fraud and money laundering related to loans acquired for Kingfisher Airlines. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-banks-pursue-uk-bankruptcy-order-against-vijay-mallya-186596
19-12-2020||Chandigarh/Shimla||Delhi, Chandigarh colder than Shimla||Chandigarh, Amritsar, Karnal and national capital Delhi were colder than 'Queen of Hills' Shimla on Saturday.Likewise, many places in the plains of north India such as Ludhiana, Patiala and Hisar were colder than the popular hill station, the Met office in Shimla said.READ: Cold wave conditions in Punjab, HaryanaChandigarh, located in the Shivalik foothills, recorded a minimum temperature at 4.3 degrees Celsius, while Shimla, located around 7,000 feet above sea level, saw a low of 4.4 degrees Celsius.Amritsar, Ludhiana, Karnal and Hisar recorded a low of 0.6 degrees Celsius, 2.8 degrees Celsius, 2.3 degrees Celsius and 2.8 degrees Celsius, respectively. Delhi's minimum temperature settled at 3.9 degrees Celsius, 0.5 notch lower than in Shimla.Hill stations across Himachal Pradesh have been experiencing long hours of sunny weather for the past few days, while the plains are largely foggy. The maximum temperature in Shimla is hovering around 13 degrees Celsius.Manmohan Singh, director of Shimla's Meteorological Office, told IANS that the Himachal capital is witnessing high night temperatures compared to the plains. "This is a normal phenomenon and occurs mainly due to settling of inversion layer on mountain tops," he said.Generally, the air becomes cooler as elevation increases. The warm air lifted from the plains overlaid the existing cold air in the mountains. Singh said since Shimla is near the plains, the impact of inversion layer is more there. However, the picturesque tourist resort of Manali was in the grip of bone-chilling minus one degree Celsius.At minus 12.1 degrees Celsius, Keylong in Lahaul-Spiti district was the coldest place in Himachal Pradesh.The weather in Himachal's popular destinations like Kasauli, Chail, Kufri, Narkanda and Palampur is expected to be sunny till December 31."It is really pleasant in Shimla owing to long sunny days," Ritika Bhatnagar, a tourist from Delhi, said. Her husband Nakul added: "Even the nights are cosy." The weatherman said this trend would continue in the hills till the western disturbances -- storm systems originating from the Caspian Sea and moving across the Afghanistan-Pakistan region -- become active in the region."There is no chance of rain in the entire region till December 31," Singh added.---IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-chandigarh-colder-than-shimla-186590

19-12-2020||Mumbai||Women become easy targets in politics, says Urmila Matondkar||Actor-politician Urmila Matondkar says women are often easily targeted in the world of politics, but it is important for them to stay focused.During a virtual session of "We The Women" with journalist Barkha Dutt on Friday night, the Shiv Sena leader said politics has become a "poisonous" field for everybody, including women, but she was aware of it when she decided to join the field."I knew it will be tough but so was the film career. Here, it has become a poisonous field, it has become horribly vicious for anybody that nothing should surprise you. Women do become easy targets," Matondkar said.She asserted that sexism exists in politics, but she has learnt to stay focused on the good work that she intends to do for the people."One has to look at it from all dimensions, I do understand where they (detractors) were coming from. We had a glamour-oriented career along with a lot of substantial roles."Even then (being in the film industry) I didn't agree that if you do certain kind of roles then only you are an actor or glamour queen. All these tags beyond a point shouldn't mean anything so I never let it affect me then and even now," she said.  Matondkar said that it was her decision to connect with the people through politics, and she never lets negative remarks affect her."People will keep talking, but you need to keep the focus, do your best and expect the best," she added.The actor started her political career with Congress and contested North Mumbai constituency in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. However, lost to BJP's Gopal Shetty.After quitting the party in September 2019, Matondkar joined Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena earlier this month.Joining her for the session were Khushbu Sundar, a popular Tamil actor, who recently joined BJP, and Trinamool Congress MP Nusrat Jahan, who previously worked in Bengali cinema.Sundar believes the patriarchal attitude is more in political field than in cinema.  "It is difficult for women actors to come into this field. The first reaction of people is you are an actor, you are supposed to dance around the trees and not supposed to speak or show you are intelligent. And that we men are way ahead and we will decide what has to be done."The reason why I have moved from the previous two parties is because they feel intimidated by a woman who is intelligent and has a mind of her own, is confident and can call the shots," she added.Jahan said she too was judged when she entered politics, especially since she came from the field of acting."When men are oppressed they call it tragedy, while women call it tradition. Why don't we look at the brighter side? Times are changing. When I stepped in politics one and a half years back, it wasn't bed of roses for me either."People judged me because I came from acting field. They will judge me if I allow them to, so it is upon oneself to change. It is time to bring about change, we are trying to snap patriarchy on the face," she added.Matondkar and Sundar also opened up about being subjected to trolling on social media.  Sundar said she has become thick-skinned, but it does hurt when her family is targeted on the internet.Matondkar added that she was horrified with the attack on her family and when her husband, who is a Kashmiri Muslim, was called a "terrorist and a Pakistani".  "I don't have any thick skin but my skin is too beautiful to be bothered. I think sensitivity is the strongest point of view of a woman and to be able to have that compassion, empathy is what makes me a woman."I'm in this field which is horrible, venomous, and I will make sure I will change this," she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/women-become-easy-targets-in-politics-says-urmila-matondkar-186587

19-12-2020||Guwahati||Assam Congress MLA Ajanta Neog removed from key post; likely to join BJP||The Assam Pradesh Congress Committee has removed its MLA Ajanta Neog from an important post of the party’s organisation, two days after she met Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and North-East Democratic Alliance convenor Himanta Biswa Sarma.The move came amid speculations that the four-time MLA from Golaghat constituency and former state minister may join the BJP.Neog was removed from the post of District Congress Committee President of Golaghat with immediate effect, according to an order issued by the party’s state unit on Friday night.“This has the approval of All India Congress Committee,” the two-line order said without giving any reason for the action.When contacted, Assam Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary (Organisation) Ranjan Bora said the disciplinary action was taken against the legislator for her “anti-party activities over the past few days”.Sources in the Congress and the BJP told PTI that Neog, a powerful leader in Upper Assam, was likely to join the saffron camp on December 26 or 27 during the visit of Union Home Minister Amit Shah to the state.On Thursday, Neog held a closed-door meeting with Sonowal at his official residence in presence of Sarma.The Congress legislator, however, said she had met the Chief Minister and the senior BJP leader to discuss issues related to her constituency.Speculations are rife that Neog, who was a close confidante of former chief minister Tarun Gogoi and part of his cabinet, may join the saffron party after some irregularities were reported in the departments she had held.“Along with her, around 100 Congress workers, including several block presidents of Golaghat constituency, are also likely to cross over to the BJP,” the sources said.Another Congress legislator Roseline Tirkey, from Sarupathar in Golaghat, had gone to a local office of the ruling party in the district in presence of Irrigation Minister Bhabesh Kalita earlier this week, triggering speculations that the MLA might join the BJP.Lakhipur MLA Rajdeep Goala, who was expelled from the Congress for six years in October this year for his alleged “anti-party activities”, was also expected to join the saffron camp, sources said.Elections to the 126-member Assam Assembly is due in March-April next year.The 2016 Assembly polls gave a fractured mandate and no party has an absolute majority.In the current House, the BJP is the single-largest party with 60 MLAs while its allies Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) have 14 and 12 lawmakers, respectively.The ruling coalition has the support of an Independent MLA.The Congress has 22 MLAs at present while the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) has 14 members in the House.

19-12-2020||Bengaluru/New Delhi||Apple supplier Wistron could not manage scaled up India plant, govt report says||Apple supplier Wistron’s Indian factory in Karnataka state could not cope up with the rapid scaling up of manpower and breached several laws, a government inspection has revealed following violence at the site last weekend.Several thousand contract workers at Wistron angered over alleged non-payment of wages destroyed property, factory gear and iPhones at the plant early on December 12, causing millions of dollars in losses to the Taiwanese contract manufacturer and forcing it to shut the plant.The manpower at this plant, which assembles one iPhone model and became operational earlier this year, rose to 10,500 workers from the permitted 5,000 in a short span of time, according to a Karnataka factories department report, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.“Though 10,500 workers are employed in the factory, the HR department has not been adequately set up with personnel of sound knowledge of labour laws,” said the report of the inspection conducted on December 13.The report said there was a wide gap between practices followed at the factory and the legal requirements.Wistron did not respond to a request for comment.Apple, which is conducting its own audit at the factory, also did not comment.Wistron introduced 12-hour shifts from the earlier eight-hour shifts at the plant in October but failed to properly address “the confusion in the minds of the workers” about their new wages inclusive of overtime, the report noted.The company also did not inform the factories department of the new work shifts, it said.Wistron, which also changed its attendance system in October, did not fix for two months a glitch which caused employees’ presence to be incorrectly registered, the probe found.Some other violations highlighted in the report included underpayment of wages to contract workers and housekeeping staff, and making women staff work overtime without legal authorisation.An earlier government audit of the factory, just hours after the rampage, had also found “several labour law violations”, Reuters previously reported.Karnataka state, home to India’s showpiece software services sector and global firms, such as Bosh and Volvo, has previously tried to soothe investors by condemning the violence and assuring Wistron of its support.“The company has started an internal audit, which should help it improve systems,” said Gaurav Gupta, the top government official at Karnataka’s Industries Department and added: “We expect it will bring up solutions to improve relationships with workers and pave the way for starting operations soon.” Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/apple-supplier-wistron-could-not-manage-scaled-up-india-plant-govt-report-says-186566

19-12-2020||New Delhi||Cong decides to hold more Panchmarhi-like conclaves as Sonia meets some of 'letter writers'||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday met a group of leaders, including some who had written to her seeking complete organisational overhaul, where they discussed ways to strengthen the party at all levels and it was decided to hold conclaves similar to Panchmarhi and Shimla to chalk out the way ahead.The five-hour meeting, which also included some of Sonia Gandhi’s close associates, was significant as it was the first effort by the Congress leadership for a rapprochement with the ‘letter-writers’ who had raised questions over the leadership.Asserting that there was no dissidence in the Congress, party leader Pawan Bansal, a Sonia Gandhi loyalist, said the meeting was held on a positive note and in a congenial atmosphere with all the leaders expressing their views and suggesting ways to make the party stronger.This was also the first time that Gandhi met Congress leaders in person since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were among those who attended the meeting.“Discussions were held on a positive note at the meeting where leaders talked about how to strengthen the party at all levels. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said we all are one big family and we all should work to strengthen the party. Rahul Gandhi also talked about strengthening the party,” Bansal told reporters after the meeting.“There is no dissidence in the Congress party and all are committed to working unitedly to energise the party and fight all those forces which are trying to put upend the idea of India, as enshrined in the Constitution and as articulated by the founding fathers of India’s Constitution,” Bansal said.Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said this was the first meeting to discuss ways to strengthen the party and more such meetings would be held.He said ‘Chintan Shivir’ like those held in the past in Shimla and Panchmarhi would be organised.The Congress had organised both the Pachmarhi and Shimla ‘Chintan Shivirs’ when the party was in the opposition. While the Pachmarhi Shivir was organised in September 1998 when Gandhi had just taken over the party’s reins, the Shimla Shivir was held later in July 2003.Another Congress leader Harish Rawat said that every leader spoke about unitedly working towards strengthening the party.Those attending the meeting from among the letter-writers were Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, deputy leader of the party in the upper House Anand Sharma, former chief ministers Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Prithviraj Chavan, and MPs Manish Tewari, Vivek Tankha and Shashi Tharoor.Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath and senior leader P Chidambaram were also part of the meeting, the sources said.Among Sonia loyalists were A K Antony, Ambika Soni, Ashok Gehlot, Harish Rawat, Ajay Maken, Pawan Bansal and Bhakt Charan Das.Sources said a number of issues were discussed at the meeting, where the ‘letter-writers’ expressed the view that they were neither “dissenters” nor “rebels”. They said they had only raised issues in the party’s interest to strengthen it, the sources said.The Congress has already decided to hold elections for the post of Congress president and that process is underway. This followed a stormy Congress Working Committee meeting in August after the letter’s contents became public.

Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road," the traffic police said."Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK road, NH-44," it tweeted.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at various border of Delhi for almost four weeks now as formal talks between the government and representatives of farmers' unions remained deadlocked with protesting peasants refusing to accept anything less than a repeal of the newly enacted laws.The farmers have been saying these new laws will pave the way for a dismantling of the Minimum Support Price mechanism and the mandi system, leaving them to the "mercy" of big corporates, apprehensions the government insists are misplaced.

19-12-2020||Washington||Extradition case of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana to continue till April 22||The case of extradition of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, a key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, to India will continue till April 22, a federal US judge has determined.Rana has been declared a fugitive by India, where he is facing multiple criminal charges for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed.He was rearrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India.“The Extradition Hearing, in this case, is continued to April 22, 2021, at 1:30 pm,” Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Chooljian, the US District Court of Los Angeles, said in his order dated December 17.Rana is a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, the Pakistani-American LeT terrorist who was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack.Headley, 60, was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.Judge Chooljian said Rana will file an opposition to the request for extradition by not later than February 1.The US government, which is supporting the extradition of Rana to India, has time till March 22 to file its reply motion.Both the parties have agreed that their motion either in support or opposition to the extradition request by India would not be of more than 50 pages.The judge on December 10 had denied Rana his bail application asserting that he is a flight risk.Judge Chooljian, in his order on December 10, said that Rana “presented a robust bail package” and offered conditions that significantly mitigate the risk of flight.But the “Court cannot find that he has negated the risk of flight” and as such granted the request of the US government to the continued detention of Rana.Meanwhile, the US government in the court has supported India’s request that the documents submitted by it in support of extradition of Rana be not made public.The extradition documents presented by India apparently include information about Rana's involvement in the Mumbai terrorist attack that would be shared with him.

19-12-2020||New Delhi||Modi urges people to read e-booklet highlighting how agro-reforms help farmers||Amid the deadlock between the Centre and the protesting farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday urged people to read and share widely an e-booklet issued by the government highlighting how the recent agro-reforms help farmers.The government has issued an e-booklet in English and Hindi highlighting the success stories of farmers who have benefited from the reforms enacted in September.“There is a lot of content, including graphics and booklets that elaborate on how the recent agro-reforms help our farmers. It can be found on the NaMo App Volunteer Module’s Your Voice and Downloads sections. Read and share widely,” the Prime Minister tweeted sharing snapshots of pages from the Hindi version of the booklet.Also read: ‘Why India’ to ‘Why Not India’: Modi on change his reforms have broughtThousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.At least five rounds of formal talks have been held between the three Union Ministers and 40 farmer unions to break the deadlock.The unions, however, are demanding a complete rollback of the Central laws.Last week, the Centre had sent a proposal to these unions, stating that it would give a written assurance that the minimum support price (MSP) system will remain and also redress their other key concerns, but it failed to break the stalemate.

19-12-2020||New Delhi||‘Why India’ to ‘Why Not India’: Modi on change his reforms have brought||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday hard sold his government’s reforms spanning from manufacturing to taxation to labour, saying they have changed the world perception about the country from ‘why India’ to ‘why not India’ and went on to quote record foreign investment during the pandemic as a testimony to that.Speaking at industry association Assocham’s Foundation Week event, Modi also said agriculture reforms brought by his government six months back have started benefiting farmers.“There was a situation in the past when investors would question ‘why India’ (for investing in the country). With reforms (of past six years) and their effects, its proposition has changed to ‘why not India’,” he said.He cited scrapping of 1,500 old and obsolete laws and farming new ones that in tune with the changing investment order as an example of his government’s outlook.Also read: Modi urges people to read e-booklet highlighting how agro-reforms help farmers“Earlier investors cited high tax rates to say Why India but today (corporate) tax rates are so competitive that they say ‘why not India’,” he said.Previously, a web of regulations and rules were cited by investors to ask why to invest in India but easing compliance burden in the new labour laws have made them say ‘why not India’, he said.Red tape previously made investors say Why India but a red carpet is now making them say ‘why not India’, he said.“From a non-existent culture for innovation to a new ecosystem promoting and nurturing start-ups has given the world confidence to say ‘why not India’. Earlier, there was so much government interference that investors said ‘why India’. Today the faith reposed by the government in the private sector and encouragement of foreign investors have made the same people say ‘why not India’,” he said.  He stated that new India is pushing towards Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India).The government’s main focus is on manufacturing and production linked incentives have been given to boost domestic capabilities and capacity, he said.The Prime Minister called on the industry to make all efforts to make India self-reliant.“Reforms have changed global perception from ‘why India’ to ‘why not India’,” he said. “The world trusts the Indian economy. Record FDI and FPI during pandemic testimony of that.”Modi asked the industry to adopt the best corporate governance and profit-sharing practices.He also said investment in research and development (R&D) must be increased and the private sector must scale up investments.“There is a great need to increase investment in R&D. In the US, 70 per cent of investments in R&D is done by the private sector, in India the same is done by the public sector. A big chunk of this is in the IT, pharma and transport sectors. Today the need is of increasing the private sector share of investment in R&D,” he said.More R&D funds should be set aside across sectors such as agriculture, defence, space, energy and construction.“Today, when we are on mission mode to make local-global, we have to react fast to geopolitical developments. A mechanism has to be developed to see how India can meet any sudden spurt in demand in the global supply chain,” he said adding there was a need for better coordination between the Ministry of External Affairs, Commerce and Trade, and industry associations.“I would urge you to give suggestions on how to react fast and respond on global transformation, how better mechanism can be developed,” he told India Inc.As farmer protests against the new farm laws entered the 24th day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said reforms brought by his government six months ago have started benefiting farmers.“Agriculture reforms initiated six months back have started benefitting farmers,” he said without elaborating.Hundreds of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have blocked some of the highways leading to Delhi for more than three weeks now against the new farm laws which they fear will prompt the government to stop making direct crop purchases at minimum state-set prices, called minimum support price (MSP).The government, however, says the three new laws remove restrictions on marketing farm products and allow cultivators to engage with private companies to sell their crops. This, it says, allows farmers an alternate avenue to sell crops, raising their income, and is aimed at making farming more competitive.Also, the new laws do not end MSP-based procurement and mandis would continue to function, the government has stressed several times.

The Quad is also discussing joint disaster relief exercises and coordination in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.During their virtual meeting on Friday, diplomats from India, the US, Australia and Japan —who call themselves the Quad — also talked about strengthening supply chain resiliency and to coordinate efforts to support countries “vulnerable to malign and coercive economic actions” in the Indo-Pacific region, said a US State Department readout of the interaction.Recently, NATO had stepped up its approach to countering disinformation.The headline focus is on disinformation about COVID-19 but the targets are Russia and China.After devoting space to counter Russia, NATO spoke of China’s ‘Wolf Warrior’ diplomacy and the need to counter its positioning as a responsible global leader with a superior governance model.The NATO also aims to counter non-state actors who have recruited followers during the pandemic or carried out attacks with the ISIS newsletter claiming that acts of terror make the jihadis immune to OVID-19.The Indian readout outlined cooperation in two broad subsets: connectivity and infrastructure development, and security issues (counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, maritime security, humanitarian and disaster relief) to promote peace, security, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.The MEA made it a point to underline that Vietnam was the current chair of the ASEAN, with which Quad would like to work in tandem.The Australian readout, like that of the US State Department, also spoke of the Quad considering joint activity in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), and coordinating efforts on COVID-19 response and vaccines and expanding coordination in multilateral forums, including the UN and related organisations.Canberra said strategic pressures in the region were intensifying and the Quad officials shared strategic assessments and “respective visions” for a region in which sovereign states engage each other on the basis of rules, norms and international law.It also spoke of the Quad partners focusing on strengthening the resilience of regional supply chains, countering disinformation, and promoting quality infrastructure investment.One significant addition was the mention of “Mekong sub-region”, an area seen so far as a contest between China and the US-Japan compact.Australia said besides the HADR, the Quad is also coordinating on maritime security, cyber and critical technology, critical minerals and counter-terrorism.The read-out by the Japanese Foreign Ministry mentioned six areas of cooperation — quality infrastructure, maritime security, counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, HADR, and education and human resource development. It also mentioned regional issues such as North Korea and the East China Sea and the South China Sea.The participants were Yamada Shigeo (Deputy Minister for Foreign Policy) and Endo Kazuya (Deputy Director-General, Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs) from Japan; Justin Hayhurst, (Deputy Secretary, Indo-Pacific Group) and Lauren Bain (Assistant Secretary, ASEAN and Regional Architecture) from Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Vani Rao (Joint Secretary, Americas) and Naveen Srivastava (Joint Secretary, East Asia), from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs; and David Stilwell (Assistant Secretary of State, East Asian and Pacific Affairs) and Dean Thompson, (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, South and Central Asian Affairs, form the US Department of State.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-countries-officials-discuss-ways-to-cooperate-on-countering-disinformation-186546

19-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||BJP will form next govt in Punjab; to contest all 117 seats: Tarun Chugh||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 19BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh is confident that the party will form the next government in Punjab. Talking to The Tribune on issues ranging from the ongoing farmer agitation to the BJP’s relationship with the Akalis and its future plans in Punjab, the senior leader says “preparations have started on a war footing to contest all 117 Vidhan Sabha seats in 2022”.Q: As a BJP leader from Punjab, do you think the Centre misjudged the underlying anger among farmers on the three laws?A: Nothing of the sort. Discussions on reforms in agriculture marketing have been going on for the last almost 20 years in political, administrative and academic circles. I wish protesting farmers had seen the bills for themselves instead of getting misled by malicious propaganda of the Opposition parties and people of other vested interests.Even during the Vajpayee government time, the discussions on the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) had started and were carried on during the UPA government times, during which as many as 13 states, including Punjab, implemented the new APMC rules.The new APMC Act was passed in 2003, following which new rules were framed which were implemented by many states.The then union agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar, in 2012 told the Rajya Sabha that “there are some (reforms) which have already been accepted, for instance, recommendation regarding liberalising agri-procurement…We have requested all Cooperation Ministers in the states to make amendment in the APMC Act”.The Dalwai committee formed during the first Modi government recommended the adoption of the new Agricultural Marketing Act of 2017, which was adopted by 16 states.A second Dalwai Committee was set up in 2018 to protect the interests of producers and sponsors of contract farming. This second Dalwai Committee, recommended another Model Act which dealt with contract farming. This Model Contract Framing Act was circulated to all states/UTs in May 2018.Tamil Nadu and Odisha have adopted this Model Contract Farming Act of 2018. So there is nothing like that the Centre had done something out of the blue.Q: Do you think the crisis could have been averted/handled in a better way by the Centre? A: As I told you, the protest seems to have gone in the hands of people with vested interests who wanted to build an opposition to the Modi government and found an emotive issue of farming for the purpose.Q: Are Punjab leaders, from all parties, also not responsible for the escalation of the crisis?A: The Congress government, led by Amarinder Singh, fanned and supported the initial voices of resentment and gave it a shape of state-wide campaign. The SAD, whose leaders were all along aware and part of the process of making three bills, took to the backdoor to run away from the NDA alliance and added fuel to the fire. Leftist parties have been openly building a propagandist narrative to mislead gullible farmers.Q: What about the BJP?A: We have been making all efforts to make farmers understand the true spirit of the bills, which was to empower them and help them double their income.Q:  The amendments being offered by the Centre virtually rewrite the Acts. Then why doesn’t the government simply repeal them, start afresh and end this agitation?A: The proposed amendments are meant to bring peace and to reassure farmers that the Centre will always protect their interests. They do not alter the spirit of the bills. They are just reassuring and there is nothing wrong in that.Q: The BJP is planning to strike alone in Punjab. Do you think the current situation will affect your position in the state?A: The BJP has been contesting elections in Punjab since 1952. In 1992, when it contested alone, it polled 16.7 per cent votes and won six seats. It is a firmly rooted party in Punjab and our base is expanding. We have started preparations on a war footing to contest all 117 Vidhan Sabha seats in the 2022 elections. The organisational structure at 23,000 polling booths is being strengthened by mobilising workers at the grassroot level. We are sure to form the next government in Punjab.Q: Your former ally, Sukhbir Badal, has made some very harsh statements about your partyA: Sukhbir Badal is making divisive and provocative statements that reflect his desperation. He is trying to contain the declining graph of the party after many SAD stalwarts left the party in the wake of his arrogant style of functioning. His remarks against the BJP are at best childish. The BJP has always worked for Hindu-Sikh unity in Punjab and has made sure the brotherhood between the two communities did not suffer even during the worst of times during the militancy days.Q: Do you think after what has happened, what will happen to the BJP tie-up with the AkalisA: The SAD has broken the alliance, not us. Now whether we will re-join hands or not, only time can tell. Moreover, the SAD is all in pieces now. It’s a “tukde tukde” Akali Dal out of which all stalwarts such as Brahampura ji, Dhindsa ji, Ajnala ji have left.Q: What do you think is the future of this agitation henceforth?A: The Centre has addressed all major concerns of farmers. It is ready to hold more talks to dispel any doubts The BJP hopes farmers would soon call off their protest reposing faith in the leadership of PM Modi who has already implemented so many farmers’ welfare schemes including the “fasal bima yojna”.Q: You said 3,000 persons from other political parties have joined the BJP since the agitationA: Many senior leaders from prominent parties are ready to join us. We will contest on the basis of a large number of welfare schemes PM Modi has implemented and highlight how the Amarinder Singh government has become a government of mafias, be it drug mafia, land mafia or liquor mafia, there has been embezzlement in funds of the Central Government schemes, particularly the SC scholarship scam that saw a cabinet minister hand-in-glove with the scamsters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-will-form-next-govt-in-punjab-to-contest-all-117-seats%C2%A0tarun-chugh-186539

19-12-2020||---||Expert points out flawed US policy in Afghanistan for 20 years||Chandigarh, December 18Political and military affairs expert Dr C Christine Fair and former ambassador KC Singh discussed looming situation in Afghanistan after the US troops would move out and its repercussions in the session on 'The Taliban are coming calling: Deep states in Pakistan and India and Role of Media' during Military Literature Festival 2020 here today.Dr Fair said after US troops move out of Afghanistan, the real issue would be of air power. "Afghanistan would need air support. Having said this, the troop withdrawal would happen. The problem is we (the USA) are handing over Afghanistan to Pakistan," added Fair, while pointing out flawed US policy for the last 20 years in the region where no serious effort was made to curtail Pakistan has been made.She also pointed out the issue of funding for Afghanistan. Singh said once the USSR broke down and couldn't fund Afghanistan, the government fell down. "India could play a role here. Earlier, India and Iran had supported the Northern Alliance. Emirates and Saudis are upset with Pakistan. The US has to work with Iran but elections are coming up there. These fractures are working in favour of the Taliban," he said, while highlighting that the Chinese presence in Ladakh would close some options for India.Dr Fair said a civil war could break out in Afghanistan. “America is delegitimising democracy in Afghanistan. They want a puppet democracy. They are pushing Ghani (Ashraf Ghani) to give up the election. The Taliban is getting what they want. Pakistan is playing clever. They think that delegitimising democracy would create chaos in Afghanistan.

We need to act against the strategic squeeze from the LAC to the Indian Ocean Region to ensure successful deterrence to China.”Lt Gen DS Hooda, former GOC-in-C, Northern Command, said it was clear from the level of preparedness that this incident was different from earlier incursions and the level of violence seen was unprecedented. “We were also taken by surprise as to why the PLA was doing it at this time when the entire world was affected by the pandemic and neither was there any breakdown in Sino-Indian ties or any large trigger,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/moving-troops-ahead-must-to-tackle-china-186305
19-12-2020||---||Allow access to war histories: NN Vohra||New Delhi, December 18Former Governor of Jammu and Kashmir NN Vohra on Friday made a strong pitch to make public histories of the wars fought by the Indian armed forces, saying reading these would help the younger generation of soldiers.Vohra, a former Punjab cadre IAS officer who was the Defence Secretary from March 1990 to April 1993, was speaking at the inaugural session of the 4th Military Literature Festival. The annual event was conducted virtually from Chandigarh this year.Narrating an anecdote, Vohra said in the late 1980s when Lt General Harbaksh Singh, the former Western Army Commander, wrote a book on the 1965 war, the first instinct was how to stop his pension. “The opinion was — how dare he write on the war without prior permission!” said Vohra. Certain maps of the western border were used in the book, which meant he should have sought permission.But things have changed, said Vohra as he went on to commend the plethora of writings in newspapers and journals, saying these showed commendable insight of officers of the services.Vohra said, “We had unfortunately not allowed access to documents by being secretive and confidential.” He gave the example of his three-year tenure as Defence Secretary, saying, “We finalised the military histories of the wars fought in 1948, 1962, 1965 and 1971. But when we tried to get these published, there was enormous opposition and the plan had to be abandoned.”The younger generation would not benefit if the experiences of war and combat were not recorded well in time and made available to the cadets in military academies or at places like the National Defence College.The nation, he said, had been guilty of not allowing certain reports like the one by Henderson Brookes on the 1962 India-China war to be made available. These could at least be used in the military for learning. He suggested that after 30 years, a document could be made available in an archival repository and scholars be allowed to go and examine those with prior permission. This could be done in case the document could not be put in public domain.Talking of the future, he said, “We need thinking generals, admirals and air chief marshals as the wars of tomorrow will be different from the wars of yesterday. We have reached a stage where senior military echelons need to understand the situation not just within the country, but across the world.”Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who was also present at the virtual session, commended the forces for the 1971 war victory, saying the country was celebrating its golden jubilee.He lavished praise on the experience of the veterans, asking the young people to learn from retired soldiers instead of playing ‘war linked’ games on mobile phones. “The veterans are like living institutions,” he said.Rajnath asked the organisers to devote the next year’s theme to cyber war and tackling misinformation campaigns. “The enemy can reach our people through mobile phones,” he said.The Governor of Punjab and the Administrator of Chandigarh, VP Singh Badnore, said the festival was unique in its fabric. Chandigarh, he said, was the most appropriate venue to conduct the festival.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allow-access-to-war-histories-nn-vohra-186300

The process is underway. There are no internal issues of dissension of any nature pending in the party.The remarks by Congress media chief Randeep Surjewala assume significance with the process of conducting elections to the post of Congress president under way.Seeking to downplay any meeting between Sonia and rebel leaders, who wrote to her in August, the Congress said “no issues of dissension are pending in the party after Sonia Gandhi announced at the last working committee meeting that elections to party president’s post would soon be held”.Tharoor, Hooda to be present“Addressing issues raised by some of the senior leaders, the Congress president has already decided to hold election to the post of party president. The process is under way. We will inform you of the schedule as we go by,” said Surjewala, insisting all issues stood resolved with the announcement of the party chief election. “There are no internal issues of dissensions of any nature pending in the party,” he said.Asked about the likely candidate, considering Rahul Gandhi had quit the post of party chief in May 2019 and insisted on a non-Gandhi president, Surjewala said, “The president of te Congress will be chosen by the electoral college of the party, leaders, workers and AICC members. The party will choose a person best suited for the post. It is my belief and the belief of an overwhelming majority of 99.9 per cent leaders and workers that Rahul Gandhi is the right person to lead the party and take on the Modi government.” Surjewala said most Congress persons wanted Rahul to lead from the front.The party, meanwhile, said Sonia has decided to resume meetings to discuss various organisational issues, including party elections and farmers agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-gandhi-set-to-meet-rebel-leaders-today-186291

The maximum sentence in the above charges is capital punishment.The 19-year-old had died during treatment at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on September 29. She was cremated in the dead of night near her home on September 30.Her family had alleged they were forced to hurriedly conduct the last rites, a charge denied by the police. The CBI has based its findings on the dying statement of the woman in which she is understood to have named the accused, besides scientific and forensic evidence collected by the agency and statements of witnesses and the victim’s kin recorded by it.The agency findings have left top UP Police officials red-faced as they had claimed that no evidence of rape was found in forensic tests.UP’s Additional Director General (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar had said, “The report of the FSL clearly says that samples did not contain semen. It makes clear that there was no rape or gangrape”. He had also claimed that the woman in her statement to police “did not mention rape, but talked about “‘maar-peet’ (beating) only”.An embarrassed UP Government had to hand over the case to the CBI after the incident triggered massive public outrage.

19-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||PM Modi says ready for talks to dispel doubts||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 18Even as the All-India Kisan Sabha on Friday announced it would join the farmers’ protest on Delhi borders, PM Narendra Modi stoutly defended the new farm laws, saying these had been in the works for decades and those opposing the laws now were once votaries of the same. “How much more will they betray the innocent farmers,” he asked, addressing the Kisan Kalyan Sammelan in MP via the virtual mode.“These laws were not made overnight. Over the past 20-30 years, every government and state discussed these in detail. Farm groups, agricultural experts, economists, scientists and progressive farmers have called for these reforms. Parties opposing these laws today promised these reforms in their manifestos, made statements in their favour,” he said.Urging the parties to “stop telling lies and misguiding farmers,” he said it had been six-seven months since the laws were implemented and a majority of farmers were happy with the reforms. “I request all political parties with folded hands, please keep the credit. I don’t want it, I just want farmers’ progress,” the PM said.Emphasising that the intentions of his government were as pure as the Gangajal, he said those who had lost their political space in the country were misleading the farmers that they would lose their land. As the farmers’ agitation against the new laws at Delhi’s borders entered the 23rd day on Friday, the PM reiterated that his government was willing to hold talks. “Despite the government efforts, if anyone has any doubt over the farm laws, we, with folded hands and heads bowed, are ready for talks,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-says-ready-for-talks-to-dispel-doubts-186288
