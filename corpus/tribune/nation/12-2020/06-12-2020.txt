One drain (drain no. 14) has no flow at all. Due to partially/untreated discharge of sewage and industrial effluent containing phosphorus, many times, foaming also is observed. Taking cognizance of this, the CPCB issued directions to Delhi Jal Board to submit time-bound action plan to ensure compliance to norms by STPs and that no untreated sewage is discharged to these drains, the official statement said. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has been directed to take action against non-complying Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) and industrial units. Similar directions have also been issued to State Pollution Control Boards of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. In view of the importance of the issues, reminders have been issued today to agencies concerned to submit action taken report by December 15.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpcb-raises-concern-over-pollution-frothing-in-yamuna-180815

They seemed to have sorted things out as the duo left the spot.Around 45 minutes later, Sonu came back and called Rajesh to come out of the house. When he stepped out, Sonu fired at him using a country-made pistol and a bullet pierced his stomach.Rajesh was rushed to a private hospital nearby and later referred to another hospital in Delhi where the attending doctors declared him brought dead.An FIR has been lodged by the deceased man’s family members against Sonu, his brother Sachin and Giri. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/55-year-old-man-shot-dead-by-neighbour-in-ups-ghaziabad-180814
06-12-2020||Ayodhya||Ayodhya moves on: No ‘shaurya diwas’ or ‘black day’ on Babri anniversary||The 28th anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition was unlike previous years with both Hindus and Muslims refraining from holding any special event to mark the day on Sunday even as there was a heavy security deployment in the town to ensure peace.However, Hindu Mahasabha, a right wing Hindu outfit, took a “pledge” on the banks of river Saryu for the “liberation of the temples of Kashi and Mathura on the lines of Ayodhya” as it marked the occasion.The administration had also asked residents not to organise any gathering in view of the coronavirus pandemic.Until 2018, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) used to observe the day as ‘Shaurya Diwas’ (day of bravery), while the Muslims in the town marked it as ‘Black Day’.However, this year the VHP had already announced that as the Supreme Court has mandated the disputed site for a temple there was no need for observing the day in any special manner.“We had issued advisories to our ranks not to celebrate the anniversary of Babri Masjid demolition as Shaurya Diwas,” Senior VHP leader Mahant Kamal Nayan Das told PTI.From the Muslim side, Haji Mahboob, who was their main litigant in the Babri Masjid case, said, “We have not held any event on this day. But we mourned the demolition of Babri Masjid in the mosques and offered special prayers.”             A 5-judge Bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi had in a unanimous verdict on November 9, 2019, decreed the entire 2.77 acre disputed land in favour of deity ‘Ram Lalla’ and also directed the Centre to allot a 5-acre plot to Sunni Waqf Board for building a mosque in Ayodhya.Subsequently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 5 this year laid the foundation here of a Ram temple, the culmination of a campaign that fuelled the rise of the BJP and marked the fulfilment of one of its core poll promises.                       The anniversary last year was also a low-key affair with both Hindu and Muslim religious leaders downplaying the occasion amid tight security measures.Ayodhya Deputy Inspector General of Police Deepak Kumar told PTI the anniversary on Sunday passed off peacefully and no event was organised.“The seers and the clerics of Ayodhya joined hands for peace and communal harmony,” he said.Meanwhile, Hindu Mahasabha leader Manish Pandey told PTI, “On this day, we have taken a pledge to liberate the temples of Kashi and Mathura as we have liberated the Ram Mandir.”  Meanwhile, Babri Masjid Action Committee Convener Zafaryab Jilani said a memorandum addressed to the President and the Chief Justice of India has been sent, appealing to them to direct the CBI to file a petition in the high court against the acquittal of the accused in the Babri demolition case.A mosque at the site was demolished on this in 1992 by ‘kar sevaks’ who believed it was built on a temple land, leading to a protracted litigation which ended with the Supreme Court verdict. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ayodhya-moves-on-no-shaurya-diwas-or-black-day-on-babri-anniversary-180813
06-12-2020||New Delhi||Contempt petition filed in SC against comic artist Rachita Taneja for tweets on apex court||Having obtained the consent of Attorney General K K Venugopal, a law student has approached the Supreme Court with a petition for initiating criminal contempt proceedings against comic artist Rachita Taneja for her alleged objectionable tweets against the apex court.The petition was filed on Saturday after the petitioner received earlier this week the written consent of the Attorney General for initiation of proceedings against her for three posts with images which are allegedly outrageous, contemptuous, carry insinuations and deliberately attribute motives to judges of Supreme Court and their judgments.The contempt petition has been filed by law student Aditya Kashyap through advocate Namit Saxena.Taneja’s posts, the petition said, have gone viral and have been widely shared and subscribed by people attacking the institution of judiciary.Taneja, being a social media influencer, has thousands of followers across various platforms, it said.Saxena, who is advocate-on-record (AoR), said the Attorney General in his written consent to initiate criminal contempt proceedings, had stated that these posts are intended to denigrate the Supreme Court and lower its authority in the eyes of the public, and thus the cartoons were in contempt of the top court.The consent of either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General is necessary, under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, for initiating contempt proceedings against a person.Criminal contempt of the Supreme Court is punishable with fine up to Rs 2,000 and imprisonment up to six months.Recently, the Supreme Court had found lawyer-activist Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt of court for posting two tweets and fined him Re 1 for it.Venugopal in his consent letter to Kashyap for initiating criminal contempt proceedings against Taneja, said, “I am satisfied that each one of the tweets with the cartoons attached to them is in contempt of the Supreme Court of India, and hence I give my consent to initiate proceedings under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 in regard to each one of the tweets.”In the petition, details of the three posts and images which are allegedly derogatory and contemptuous have been mentioned.The plea has sought direction that Taneja be restrained from publishing contemptuous posts on social media which scandalise and undermine the authority of the apex court.The petitioner said the plea highlight three particularly outrageous and contemptuous posts that were crafted, posted and shared by Taneja through her social media handles (@sanitarypanels) on various platforms with the malicious intent of scandalising and lowering the authority of the apex court and to prejudice and interfere with the due course of judicial proceedings.Kashyap is pursuing LLB at Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law in Patiala, Punjab. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contempt-petition-filed-in-sc-against-comic-artist-rachita-taneja-for-tweets-on-apex-court-180812

06-12-2020||---||Farmer unions all geared up for Bharat Bandh on December 8||New Delhi, December 6Farmers on the sit-in at Tikri border are geared up to make the call of India Bandh on December 8, successful. Hailing from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, farmers  are committed to mobilise maximum support for the shutdown,  BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Shingara Singh Mann, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Samiti leader Satyavir Singh from Hisar, Rajasthan leader Santvit Singh Mohanpura and member of five-member Kisan Sangharsh Committee Gurbaz Singh have said. “Farmers from three states are united and a massive mobilisation campaign has been launched in villages, towns and cities of these states and that any amendment in the laws passed by the Modi government is not acceptable,” according to a statement.Farmers’ leaders said “accepting the amendments proposed by the ministers mean paving the way to dismantle the whole system of marketing and opening it to the corporate houses. They said acceptance of these laws amounts of surrender of farmers’ and people’s rights which can’t be tolerated.  BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) has divided the protest site in five sites and named them as Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Nagar, Chacha Ajit Singh Nagar, Gadri Gulab Kaur Nagar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar and Shaheed Sadhu Singh Takhtupura Nagar.  All these ‘Nagars’ have a stage from where BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan)’s leader Harinder Kaur Bindu, Parmjit Kaur Pitho, state committee member Jaswinder Singh Longowal, Janak Singh Bhutal and Manjit Singh Niyal addressed the gatherings. Prem Kumar, Rakesh Khasa and Sushila Kumari from Haryana shared their ideas with the gatherings. Leader of five-member Kisan Sangharsh Committee, Hardeep Singh Jaura also spoke.Most of the leaders appreciated the initiative of Punjabi farmers and acknowledged that now the expanse of the movement is much bigger with protesters from Haryana, Rajasthan, UP and MP joining in. They asked people from all walks of life to join the India Bandh call on December 8.Farmers, farm workers, shopkeepers, traders and other businesses should contribute to make the bandh successful, according to the statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-unions-all-geared-up-for-bharat-bandh-on-december-8-180806
06-12-2020||New Delhi||RSS affiliate Bhartiya Kisan Sangh says no to December 8 bandh||While farmers’ ‘jathebandis’ and unions on Sunday outlined details of the December 8 ‘Bharat bandh’, the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh announced its opposition to it saying that “such demonstrations always prove detrimental to the nation and farmers”. The Sangh affiliate, which has been supporting the farmers in their fight against the three central acts, said now that the Narendra Modi government has agreed to amendments, farmers’ unions should take what is being offered to them “gracefully and respectfully”.“What is the ‘aqalmandi’ (sensibility) in rejecting what is being offered in a respectful manner...they should have taken the offer,” BKS general secretary Badri Narayan Chaudhary said. According to BKS leaders, while the demonstration is going on in a peaceful manner, “it is evident that certain anti-social elements, external forces and some political parties are manoeuvring the demonstration towards acrimony”.Stating that they “feared the incidence of Mandsaur of 2017 is not be repeated in which six farmers were shot dead and heavy casualties to property and life was reported”, Choudhary said “leaders of that movement eventually became legislatures and ministers in the government while families of martyrs were ruined and living in vagaries. We asked Punjab ‘jathebandis’ and unions to postpone Bharat bandh but they declined saying our programme is decided. It is obvious that some other forces are calling the shots”. He also questioned “why Punjab farmers are demanding to repeal the central laws when the Punjab government has already nullified the central laws and restored the condition prior to June 5”.Organising secretary Dinesh Kulkarni said the ongoing agitation on Delhi borders “is no longer a farmers movement and various other elements, including political, have crept in it”. “Although fifth round of talks could not bring any breakthrough, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar showed the willingness to bring amendments in the existing laws and further both the parties agreed to continue the dialogue on December 9, still they are holding ‘Bharat bandh’,” he said. “The BKS has been raising objections against the central laws from the day the BJP-led government announced the three ordinances. We are with the farmers on this issue but now the attempt is being made to digress it. However, our aim is not to trouble the nation, the common people”, Kulkarni said.  Pointing to the “lack of consistency and continuity” in unions’ stance, he said, “In 2008, when there was a big difference in the prices of wheat in international and domestic markets, Punjab unions under Sharad Joshi demanded that private players be allowed to purchase from farmers.” Chaudhary said the BKS has already demanded that the three Bills “should not be repealed but implemented with amendments on legal status to MSP (guaranteed payment), separate agriculture courts and central and state registration of traders” and it stands by it.“Farmers growing different agricultural crops will be benefited by these laws, therefore we cannot support the protest against repealing them. Such demonstrations always prove detrimental to the nation and to the farmers,” he said, appealing to its members “to be attentive and alert fellow citizens so that any untoward incidence is avoided”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-affiliate-bhartiya-kisan-sangh-says-no-to-december-8-bandh-180805
06-12-2020||Hyderabad||Owaisi asks people to remember Babri Masjid demolition||As Hyderabad observed the demolition day of the Babri Masjid as a “black day” today, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief and Hyderabad MP, Asaduddin Owaisi, has asked the people of India to “remember the demolition of the Babri Masjid” on December 6, 1992 and tell the future generations about the “injustice” done by the demolition of Babri Masjid at Ayodhya.  Taking to Twitter, Owaisi said, “Remember and teach the next generation to remember: For 400+ years our Babri Masjid stood in Ayodhya. Our ancestors prayed in its hall, broke their fasts together in its courtyard & when they died, they were buried in the adjoining graveyard. Never forget this injustice”. He went on to tweet saying, “On the night of December 22-23, 1949, our Babri Masjid was desecrated and illegally occupied for 42 years. On this date in 1992, our masjid was demolished before the whole world. The men responsible for this did not see even a day’s punishment. Never forget this injustice”. Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana responded to some Muslim organisations and shut their shops and business establishments to “register their democratic protest on the anniversary of demolition of Babri Masjid”.The AIMIM had also appealed that businesses should not be forcibly closed. Tight security arrangements were made by the police to prevent any untoward incident. Additional forces were deployed in Hyderabad, especially in the communally sensitive old city. Police said personnel of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) were deployed near the Charminar and the historic Mecca Masjid.  Five supporters of the Darasgah Jihad-o-Shahadat (DJS) were arrested when they tried to take out a rally in the old city to mark Babri Masjid demolition anniversary.United Muslim Forum in a statement has said that “not just a mosque, but secular and democratic structure of the country was razed on this day”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/owaisi-asks-people-to-remember-babri-masjid-demolition-180802

The official ruled that the CPIO does not have information and does not know where the information can be.The application was also transferred to the Indian Council of Medical Research and the MEA.The ICMR said it does not have information sought by Nayak.On the NEGVAC material shared with it, the MEA cited exemption clause of national security and related issues to deny the records.Nayak said both the CPIO and the first appellate authority not knowing about the physical location of NEGVAC's papers despite the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) servicing this body is "truly perplexing"."How can people's meaningful participation be ensured if the MoHFW does not place in the public domain details of NEGVAC's working. There is a statutory requirement of proactive information disclosure under Sections 4(1)(c) and 4(1)(d) of the RTI Act about NEGVAC's working. MoHFW and other public authorities involved in the vaccination roll-out plan have a statutory duty to make all facts and figures public along with the underlying reasoning for their decisions and actions under these provisions," Nayak said.He said he would approach the Central Information Commission to challenge "the actions and omissions of MoHFW and MEA". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-rti-response-health-ministry-says-not-aware-where-records-related-to-covid-vaccine-expert-group-are-kept-180793

It was not immediately known whether she also changed her religion.According to reports, Moradabad man Rashid had met the woman from Bijnore when he was working in Dehradun where she was studying.Police reached the registrar’s office after being approached by Bajrang Dal activists. The two men were then produced before a magistrate and sent to prison.SHO Kanth said it was now up to the court to decide the case.The recently promulgated Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 nullifies marriages if they are carried out for the sole purpose of religious conversion.The punishment can extend up to 10 years if a minor is involved.In recent cases, police in UP have arrested seven people in Sitapur and stopped an interfaith marriage in Lucknow, citing the new law to check forcible and fraudulent conversions.Though the term doesn’t figure in the ordinance, it was promulgated amid assertions by BJP leaders that a strict law was needed against “love jihad”, a reference to right-wing claims that Hindu women are being lured or forced into marriages performed only for their conversion. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-brothers-arrested-in-ups-moradabad-over-interfaith-marriage-180792

They want the TRS Government to react in the same manner as Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.Telangana has seen small scale protests by farmers across various districts, including Hyderabad, where farmer organisations urged the Telangana government to consider amendments that will negate the three farm laws.In October some farmer organisations had asked the chief minister and Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy to enact amendments to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act.The farmers want legislation that would bring all transactions at unregulated market yards or mandis under the purview of the APMC Act.Kiran Vissa of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, said: “All farmer organisations in the state welcomed the TRS government’s stand of rejecting the three Union farm bills (in Parliament). But they should consider passing a resolution in the Assembly, a symbolic gesture against the laws. The TRS government should consider negating the farm laws as Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh governments had done. The Maharashtra government is also considering negating the bunion farm laws through amendments”.The three farm laws that the farmers are protesting against are the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-cm-calls-for-support-to-farmers-bandh-on-december-8-180789

The Committee sought a fresh medical fitness certificate for the mother from a government hospital and a decision on with whom to keep the toddler is expected in a few days, the official said.Meanwhile, a person claiming to be the toddler’s biological father has approached the authorities, the official said, adding they will match his DNA report. A DNA test last month confirmed the woman is the toddler’s biological mother.The toddler may be placed with the Children’s Aid Society at Mankhurd here as per provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, before the issue is resolved, the official said.As per the Centre’s model guidelines for foster care, a foster family can adopt a child after five years of care, if the child has no biological family claiming her.“We have been informed that the director, who is married and has a son, is not looking to adopt the toddler,” the official said. However, seeing the mother’s condition, he became apprehensive and requested that the child be in foster care for a little longer till she is fine, the official added.The NGO founder has informed the Committee that the woman may develop ‘severe reactive depression’ if kept away from her son for long, the official said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biological-mom-seeks-custody-of-toddler-in-filmmakers-care-180787

One such example in Western Ghats is the Ariankavu corridor between the Periyar-Agasthyamalai landscapes," the report said.It said the protection and management challenges are compounded by high population pressure and the appetite for development as well as the apparent weak integration of the sites management with broader national, state and local development planning.Older than the Himalaya mountains, the mountain chain of the Western Ghats represents geomorphic features of immense importance with unique biophysical and ecological processes.The sites high montane forest eco systems influence the Indian monsoon weather pattern.Moderating the tropical climate of the region, the site presents one of the best examples of the monsoon system on the planet.According to the UNESCO, the forests of the site include some of the best representatives of non-equatorial tropical evergreen forests anywhere and are home to at least 325 globally threatened flora, fauna, bird, amphibian, reptile and fish species.This property was inscribed in 2012 amid some controversy given the difficulty to decide how best to represent the extraordinary biological richness of the Western Ghats.Finally, a network of 39 separately managed sites, groupedin seven contiguous clusters, was inscribed and efforts are under way to draw these sites together into a cohesive whole (including corridors to ensure wildlife connectivity) that tells the story of the outstanding value of the Western Ghats.The report revealed also proposals and good potential to further extend the property to better express its outstanding universal value, which need to be re-examined within the constraints of the world heritage operational guidelines vis-a-vis the state's willingness to include new areas that were previously missed out mainly due to administrative reasons.The IUCN World Heritage Outlook provides a global assessment of natural world heritage based on data from conservation outlook assessments for every natural site on the world heritage list.The new report presents the main findings from the 2020 conservation outlook assessments providing the overall results for all 252 natural sites currently listed, and a comparison of results for the 228 sites for which there are now three sets of assessments available (2014, 2017 and 2020). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/conservation-outlook-of-western-ghats-grim-says-report-180779

The department further cancels leaves of all field officers, and directions have been issued for effective patrolling against illegal activities in protected areas," it says further.The order also added that reports had earlier been received from the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve about animals being caught in traps laid by hunters."Recently, five hunters have also been arrested in Mount Abu for hunting a sambar deer, looking to which red alert has been announced till February 2021," it said.Forest department's senior officer Shruti Sharma gave clear orders that all officers and employees will work seriously in hunting for the hunters during the red alert.Earlier, a total of 26 tigers have also been reported missing from Ranthambore.The tiger T-108 spotted with wire has raised many questions, such as, have these tigers also fallen prey like T-108? What happened to them is yet to be answered by the forest department officials.Rajsamand MP, Diya Kumari, earlier in August had sent a letter to Union Minister of Environment and Forests Prakash Javadekar and raised a demand to issue necessary guidelines to the state government for investigating the causes of the recent tiger deaths so that such incidents do not recur.

06-12-2020||New Delhi||4 of 5 cyclones this year were in severe cyclonic storms category and above||Four of the five cyclones that originated either in the Bay of Bengal or in the Arabian Sea this year were in the category of severe cyclonic storm' or above including Amphan which had escalated into a super cyclone.Formation of cyclones is not uncommon in the Arabian Sea during the pre-monsoon period and in the Bay of Bengal during the post-monsoon months of October to December.India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said since 1990 four cyclones have formed every year in the seas along the eastern and western coasts (Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea) of the country.“It is normal to have five cyclones a year,” he said.'Amphan' was the first cyclone of the year. It formed in the Bay of Bengal and intensified into a 'super cyclonic storm', the first since the super cyclone of Odisha that had ravaged the state in 1999, killing thousands.'Amphan', however, weakened a bit to become an 'extremely severe cyclonic storm' and slammed the coasts of West Bengal and Bangladesh on May 19.Another circulation formed in the Arabian Sea within a fortnight, intensifying into a severe cyclonic storm which was called 'Nisarga'. The storm hit Alibag, near Mumbai, and helped monsoon to arrive in Kerala on its normal date of June 1.Three cyclones—two in the Bay of Bengal and one in the Arabian Sea – have formed in the last one month.Cyclone 'Gati' intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm. It affected the western coast during its intensification stage, bringing rains over Kerala, but it crossed the Somalia coast on November 23.Another cyclone was brewing in the Bay of Bengal at the same time.Cyclone 'Nivar' was initially projected to be a 'severe cyclonic storm'. However, it intensified into a 'very severe cyclonic storm', crossing the Tamil Nadu coast on the night of November 25.Less than a week later, another storm gathered momentum and intensified into a cyclonic storm. Cyclone 'Burevi' crossed the Sri Lanka coast on November 2 but as it crossed the south Tamil Nadu coast, having its intensity reduced to deep depression.Cyclones not only bring violent winds, but rains accompanied by storm surge."A very severe cyclonic storm has a wind speed of 120-160 kilometres per hour and can uproot trees, partially damage communication lines and also damage thatched huts."An extremely severe cyclonic storm can lead to catastrophic damage, uproot power and communication lines and damage houses and other infrastructure," Mohapatra said.An extremely severe cyclonic storm has a wind speed of 160 to 220 kilometres per hour.The IMD chief added the storm surge during Amphan was up to 10 metres when sea waters travelled inland.But will there be more cyclones in the remaining part of the month? "Not in the next seven days at least,” said Mohapatra.“We are monitoring the developments as the period between October-December is known for formation of cyclones,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/4-of-5-cyclones-this-year-were-in-severe-cyclonic-storms-category-and-above-180763

The Christians will lock down our temples, and we will go to have fun in their churches—I condemn such Hindus. They need to be taught a lesson."We declare it today that on next Christmas, no Hindus will be allowed to visit churches. If anyone visits, Bajrang Dal will give its reply," Nath reportedly said.The saffron group's leader was referring to the alleged closure of the Vivekananda Centre, a part of Ramakrishna Mission, in Christian-majority Meghalaya's capital Shillong."Media friends will term us intolerant and 'goonda dal'. It's alright, we accept that. If someone misbehaves with our mother-sister, and we react, then we are goondas. We accept that, but still, we will not allow anything disrespectful towards our mothers and sisters."I know what will be the headline the next day on December 26. It will be intolerant Bajrang Dal, who vandalised the Oriental school," Nath had said.In a sarcastic tone, he appealed to the Bajrang Dal members to act as per the law "because the law is only for the Hindus, and they should not break the law"."You open the temple, we will allow the church. We welcome that. But if you will lock the temple there, then we will not allow the church here," Nath said.People from a cross-section of the society have condemned Nath's reported threat. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/probe-ordered-into-assam-bajrang-dal-leaders-threat-to-beat-up-hindus-visiting-churches-on-christmas-180759

We are going to strengthen our agitation and it has already spread across the nation,” farmer leader Baldev Singh Yadav said at a press conference.“Since the government was not able to deal with us properly, we gave a call for Bharat Bandh,” he said and appealed to everyone to make sure that the bandh remains peaceful.“We won’t let anyone turn it violent and would take strict action against them. We request everyone to be part of the bandh,” he said.Shops, businesses to remain shutDuring the bandh, shops and businesses will remain shut. Ambulances and other emergency services will be exempted, farmer leaders said.The Congress, NCP, Shiv Sena, TRS, DMK, SP and the AAP joined the Trinamool Congress, RJD and the Left parties in supporting the strike call.NCP chief and former union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar warned the Centre that if the deadlock continues, the agitation will not be limited to Delhi and people from across the country will stand by the protesting farmers.Pawar is scheduled to meet President Ram Nath Kovind on December 9 over the ongoing farmers’ protest, his party said.Expressing the Congress’ “wholehearted” support to the strike call, party spokesperson Pawan Khera said it will hold protests that day at all district and state headquarters in solidarity with the demands of the farmers.TRS president and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said the party rank and file would actively participate in the bandh to ensure it was a success, according to an official statement.In their joint statement, Sonia Gandhi and other opposition leaders said they extend “solidarity with the ongoing massive struggle by the Indian farmers” and their call for a Bharat Bandh on December 8 demanding the withdrawal of these “retrograde “ Agri-laws and the Electricity Amendment Bill.Also among the signatories were RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, CPI general secretary D Raja, general secretary of CPI(ML) Dipankar Bhattacharya, AIFB general secretary Debabrata Biswas and Manoj Bhattacharya, the general secretary of RSP.In Tamil Nadu,  Stalin, TNCC chief KS Alagiri, MDMK founder Vaiko and Left leaders, among other DMK allies, said the ongoing protest by farmers was growing every day and drawing global attention.The DMK chief had led a state-wide protest on Saturday against the farm laws.In a statement, Stalin, TNCC chief KS Alagiri, MDMK founder Vaiko and Left leaders, among other DMK allies, said the ongoing protest outside Delhi by farmers was growing every day and drawing global attention.The grouping appealed to farmer unions, traders’ bodies, government employees’ associations, labour unions and others in the state to extend “grand support” to the bandh and make it a success on Tuesday.Actor Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) also extended support to the protest by farmers.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that all AAP workers across the country will join the nationwide strike and appealed to all citizens to support the farmers.“The Aam Aadmi Party fully supports the ‘Bharat Bandh’ call made by farmers on December 8. AAP workers across the country will support it peacefully. There is an appeal to all countrymen that everyone should support the farmers and participate in it,” Kejriwal tweeted.The AIUDF along with other opposition parties in Assam too joined the chorus supporting the strike.Ruling BJP’s ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) extended support to the farmers, but refrained from joining hands for the nationwide shutdown.Pawar, whose NCP is part of the Congress-led UPA, said farmers from Punjab and Haryana contribute the most to the country’s agriculture and food supply.“I hope wisdom dawns on the government and it takes cognisance to resolve the issue. If this stalemate continues, the protest will not be limited to Delhi, but people from nook and corner of the country will stand by the protesting farmers,” he said in Mumbai.In Maharashtra, the ruling Shiv Sena too came out in support like its allies Congress and the NCP.Another former BJP ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal, which had snapped ties with the saffron party over the farm laws, appealed to Punjabis to support the bandh.SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said his party would work assiduously alongside the peasantry to ensure repeal of the new agri-marketing laws.The ruling TMC in West Bengal had on Saturday extended “moral support” to the December 8 nationwide strike and said it would stage sit-ins in various areas for three days.The Left parties—Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), Revolutionary Socialist Party and All India Forward Bloc—had made the announcement in a joint statement.In Patna, opposition parties led by RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav had on Saturday protested against the farmers’ bill.The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, a farmers’ body, said it will join the “non-violent” protest on Tuesday.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for 11 days against the new farm laws.The Centre’s offer to amend the contentious laws failed to cut ice with the farmer groups during the fifth round of talks on Saturday.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, after the talks, renewed his appeal to the farmers to end the stir and assured them that the Modi government remains committed to farmers’ interests.

06-12-2020||New Delhi||1,675 trafficked children rescued from ‘situations of exploitation’ since COVID-19 outbreak: BBA||Over 1,600 trafficked children were rescued from “situations of exploitation” in the past eight months, Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi’s NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan said, noting that there has been a rise in such cases as many parents lost their livelihood due to the COVID-19 pandemic and during the lockdown.The lockdown was imposed by the Central Government across the nation from March 25 to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. However, from June 8, the Centre gradually started easing restrictions under ‘Unlock’.“One of the biggest worries during the lockdown was the fact that the financial crisis of families will lead them to take loans unethically. This eventually increased the vulnerability of children and their families of being lured by traffickers with the promise of a better livelihood opportunity,” Dhananjay Tingal, an executive director at BBA, said.Thirteen-year-old Krishna (name changed) was one of the 1,675 children rescued by the child rights organisation between April and November.Krishna was trafficked from his village in Bihar to work in a garment factory in Gandhinagar in Gujarat, where he toiled for 12 hours a day, and stayed in a tiny room that he shared with six others like him, BBA officials said.Though they were promised payment, they were never given the promised amount. Besides, this he and the others just got half a day to rest every week and were under tremendous pressure to meet production targets, they said.Krishna landed up in Gujarat and became a victim of trafficking after his parents, farm labourers, lost their jobs with the outbreak of the coronavirus, the BBA said.Moreover, his parents had taken a loan of Rs 20,000 before the lockdown to fix the roof of their house, but being unemployed they were unable to pay their lender, the officials said.It was getting difficult for Krishna’s parents to feed a family of 11 and traffickers took advantage of the situation and for Rs 20,000, Krishna was taken to Gujarat to work, they said.For months he endured exploitation at the hands of his employer, before being rescued by the BBA in July.The story of 14 -year-old Saad Khan (name changed) is no different.There were three earning members in his family but the pandemic induced poverty forced Khan to search for work, the BBA officials said.He and his family were lured by a trafficker, who gave them an advance of Rs 5,000 and promised work for Khan.“The advance payment by any trafficker further complicates the issue as it becomes a case of bonded labour,” Tingal said.Khan was rescued along with 15 other children in September while he was being transported in a bus to work at a bangle making factory in Jaipur in Rajasthan. He was rescued by BAA with the help of the anti-human trafficking unit and local police.The child rights NGO said during April to November, 1,675 children rescued from “situations of exploitation” and 107 traffickers were arrested.“During August and September 2020, 80 vehicles, including 51 buses and 29 trains were intercepted based on information received from field activists, exclusively deployed to report suspected cases of child trafficking,” Tingal said, terming children as the biggest victim of the pandemic.“There is a dire need of being more vigilant and active in mapping children and families, who are specially at risk and try to stop trafficking at the source. The immediate measure that we have at hand to prevent this is to rehabilitate rescued bonded labourers, especially by ensuring that they are financially compensated and do not fall back into the cycle of exploitation,” he said.Tingal said bangle making units of Jaipur had been under the scanner for over a decade now due to children being employed.The pandemic momentarily halted production but as soon as restrictions were relaxed, manufacturing resumed, and employers started employing children, he said.Children are employed primarily for two reasons- first due to cheap labour cost and secondly, due to their small hands which helps in efficiently fitting embellishments on bangles, Tingal said.“The advent of the pandemic has seriously damaged the work done in the past two decades by child rights organisations in terms of decreasing child labour. BBA has been adapting to the challenges posed by the pandemic in dealing with the steep rise in trafficking,” he added.

06-12-2020||New Delhi||IISc researchers working on COVID-19 detection using Raman spectroscopy, artificial intelligence||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, are working on rapid identification of COVID-19 biomarkers in blood plasma using Raman spectroscopy and artificial intelligence.Raman Spectroscopy is a non-destructive chemical analysis technique which provides detailed information about chemical structure, phase and polymorphy, crystallinity and molecular interactions. It is based upon the interaction of light with the chemical bonds within a material.According to the team, using artificial intelligence and deep learning, the COVID-19 detection process will be automated and rapid and there will be no requirement of any extraction procedure.“It is of critical importance to develop new technologies that can rapidly detect COVID-19 and perform mass testing, and at the same are cost-effective. In this regard, Raman spectroscopy holds significant promise,” according to Dipankar Nandi, Professor at IISc Bangalore and principal investigator of the project.“Traditionally a chemist’s tool, Raman spectroscopy has found numerous applications in biomedicine, especially in disease diagnosis. This method probes bond vibrations and is very sensitive to the structural changes, giving a molecular fingerprint of the sample. Every disease is associated with a change in biochemistry which can either be a cause for disease manifestation or may be a consequence of the disease itself,” he added.The research is being conducted in collaboration with AIIMS, Bhopal, which will be providing patient samples and healthy controls.“Our proposal is directed at identifying COVID-19 biomarkers in the blood plasma of infected patients. No extraction procedure or reagents are required. The only requirement is a spectrometer and the patient samples. Using artificial intelligence and deep learning, the detection process will be automated and rapid. Spectra collected from infected COVID-19 patients and healthy controls will be used for training and building robust classification models,” according to Nandi.India’s COVID-19 caseload rose to 96.44 lakh while the total number of people who have recuperated from the disease crossed 91 lakh pushing the national recovery rate to 94.37 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Sunday.The COVID-19 active caseload plunged to almost 4 lakh after 138 days.The total coronavirus cases mounted to 96,44,222 with 36,011 new infections being reported in a day, while the death toll crossed to 1.40 lakh with 482 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed.

06-12-2020||New Delhi||Bank unions lend support to farmers’ agitation against farm laws||A number of bank unions have expressed their solidarity with farmers protesting against recently passed agri laws and requested the government to resolve the issue at the earliest.The All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) in a statement said the government should come forward and resolve their demands in the interest of the nation and farmers.Officer unions All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Officers’ Association (AIBOA) and Indian National Bank Officers’ Congress (INBOC) have also requested the government to initiate meaningful dialogue to resolve the impasse by referring the bills to a select committee by a special Presidential Order.The farming community has expressed apprehension that three new laws—Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 -- would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.Enacted in September, the laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.“Our nation needs peace and main stakeholders of the nation should not be made to suffer, as the agriculture sector alone performed positively in the COVID-19 pandemic, which reflects the inherent strength of the sector,” three officers’ unions said in a joint statement.The peasants constitute 80 per cent of the customer base of the public sector banks, regional rural banks, co-operative banks and old generation private banks and thus are major stakeholders of India’s banking system, it said.

06-12-2020||New Delhi||Economy to reach pre-Covid levels by end of FY2022: Niti Aayog||India’s economic growth is likely to reach pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of the 2021-22 fiscal as the GDP contraction in this financial year is expected to be less than 8 per cent, Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Sunday.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also revised its forecast of economic growth for the current fiscal year (2020-21) to (-)7.5 per cent as against its earlier forecast of (-)9.5 per cent.“We should reach pre-COVID-19 levels at the end of fiscal year 2021-22 for sure,” Kumar told PTI when asked about growth projection for the next financial year. He added that the GDP contraction this fiscal is expected at less than 8 per cent.India’s economy recovered faster than expected in the September quarter as a pick-up in manufacturing helped GDP clock a lower contraction of 7.5 per cent and held out hopes for further improvement on better consumer demand.Replying to a question on asset monetisation, he said this is ongoing work and it has received attention at the highest level.“We will continue to pursue this and make sure that the targets of asset monetisation are reached,” Kumar stressed.The government is looking to raise Rs 2.10 lakh crore through disinvestment in the current fiscal. This includes Rs 1.20 lakh crore from Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) stake sale and Rs 90,000 crore from sale of government stake in financial institutions.Talking about banking reforms, he said the sector needs further expansion and an increase in competition because India’s private debt to GDP ratio remains limit to mid 50s.Stating that in case of other emerging economy, private debt to GDP ratio is well beyond 100 per cent, Kumar said that “so we need to increase private debt and this will happen when our banking sector will expand”.On the Indian agriculture sector, he said the Niti Aayog now is very strongly pushing the programmes for chemical free natural farming which has a potential to reduce cost for agriculture production dramatically and also has very positive impact on the environment.Kumar said the expansion of natural farming all over the country will make Indian agriculture more competitive and it also promises to have a significant positive impact on farmers’ income.

China says it will do so before 2060. India’s leadership on solar and the industry transition is reason to believe that we can achieve our climate goals,” she said.She said the European Union and its Member States had a strong history of leadership on climate action, including the commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.“It is essential that the European Union delivers on its promise to adopt a new climate target this year, by coming forward with a baseline of reducing emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030,” she said, adding that it was also crucial for the European Union to accelerate its transition toward renewable energy.Amina stressed that there must be no new coal, and all existing coal in the European Union and in all OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries should be phased out by 2030, and by 2040 elsewhere.“And the financing of fossil fuels internationally must come to an end,” she added.The top UN official underscored that as governments look to restart their economies following the devastation from COVID-19, it was vital that they pursue a recovery that is not only sustainable, resilient and fair, but also job-rich.“The notion that we must choose between climate action and economic strength has been proven wrong. Investments in renewable energy yield three times more jobs than investments in fossil fuels,” she said.A just transition must be a managed transition, she said, urging all governments to work with stakeholders to develop a credible, just transition plans.“Meeting the climate challenge means major shifts in our economies and societies, and these will naturally bring significant impacts on people, families and communities that touch the core of their identities and well-being. A just transition cannot be an afterthought; it an integral part of climate action and a responsibility for all of us,” she said.

The statement lauded the farmers for their resolve to fight until their demands were met.The CPA statement also mentioned that police had proposed to use stadiums as temporary prisons but the idea was turned down by the Delhi Government.The CPA said capitalism had failed Indian farmers and workers in general to the benefit of the multinational corporations. Farming was one of the biggest employers in India with up to 40 per cent of workers dedicated to the production of food, the statement said.  “Indian farmers are loud and clear. The government of Modi Sarkar must listen to farmers. Parliament must withdraw the Agri Laws and the Electricity (Amendment) Bill”, the CPA statement said.The CPA led by its president Vinnie Molina and general secretary Andrew Irving was the third international voice raised to back the ongoing farmers struggle near Delhi.  Earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and British MPs backed the agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/communist-party-of-australia-expresses-solidarity-with-agitating-farmers-180703

The study came after the integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC) located in the district hospital, Unnao, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) witnessed an increased detection of HIV among its attendees in 2017 and 2018.“While there was a sevenfold rise of HIV among ICTC attendees of Hasanganj, the rise in Unnao district hospital was twofold and was tenfold at ICTC-Nawabganj,” experts said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unsterile-injections-led-to-unnao-hiv-outbreak-180513

06-12-2020||New Delhi||Tomar suggests middle path, farmers unmoved||The fifth round of talks between the Centre and farmer’ leaders today failed to break the impasse. The next meeting is scheduled for December 9, a day after the Bharat bandh.Kavitha Kuruganti of the Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch, one of the 40 unions invited for the talks with Union Ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash on the contentious farm Acts, said: “The government sought some more time to present a concrete proposal. The ministers said they needed further consultations within the government and proposed December 9 for the next meeting, to which the union leaders agreed.” Most unions see this as yet another attempt to “stretch matters and buy time”.Jaishankar may skip Canada-led group meetNew Delhi: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar may not attend a meeting of Canada-led 14-nation grouping, apparently in protest against Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s observations on the ongoing farmers’ agitation. TNSAfter the more than four-hour meeting, Tomar reportedly urged the farmers to put forth their suggestions. “The Modi government is committed to the welfare of farmers. Today, we held the fifth round of talks. We said the MSP would continue and if there were any doubts, the government was ready to dispel these. We also assured that the mandi system would be further strengthened,” he said, adding: “We wanted suggestions on some issues, but this did not happen.”For more than 90 minutes, the farmers’ representatives remained mum as the Union Ministers kept pressing for the middle path, suggesting amendments, said Balbir Singh Rajewal of the BKU (Rajewal). They also rejected Tomar’s suggestion to send the elderly and children back home. They insisted that the three “black” laws be rolled back.Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is from Punjab, tried to draw out some leaders by communicating in Punjabi. President of the Krantikari Kisan Union Darshan Pal said the ministers kept insisting on amendments. “They (ministers) said they would send a fresh proposal by Sunday evening. There was complete silence in the room for quite a while. Some union leaders even tried to leave,” a farmers’ representative said.By deciding to hold the next meeting on December 9, sources say the government has ensured that the communication lines remain open till the “Bharat bandh” on December 8. Ahead of their meeting with the farmers, Tomar, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh met the PM.With the agitation now taking the shape of a ‘jan andolan’, the Opposition in Bihar and Tamil Nadu too has begun mounting pressure on the BJP. Farm leaders fear “attempts to malign the movement”. Apparently, Shah has approached several ‘jathebandis’, urging them to end the protest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tomar-suggests-middle-path-farmers-unmoved-180451

Since this is a two dose vaccine. The minister in question has taken only one dose of the vaccine,” a Health Ministry official said.Politicians’ participation allays vaccine fear: ICMROn November 20, he was given a shot of Bharat Biotech’s vaccine Covaxin as a volunteer and the second dose was to be given on December 18..

She stops near a truck. Young protesters, mostly students, are dancing to the tunes of “Teer te taaj” by Manmohan Waris. She asks them to turn off the blaring music. “If the draconian farm laws are rescinded, I will surely dance with you. But today is no occasion for any celebration,” she chides them gently. The youngsters are prompt to comply.A large number of women activists, participating in the farmers’ stir here, are war room managers. Harinder Bindu, president of the women’s wing of the BKU (Ugrahan), is incharge of six stages raised at the protest site. Chief of the women’s wing of the Dakhaunda faction Sukhpal Kaur allots tasks and oversees arrangements. Paramjit Kaur of the Ekta-Ugrahan group delivers motivational speeches.Dramatist Daljinder Kaur from Moga is here to stage “Eh desh kise de baap da nahin”.

From organising langar to supplying sanitary napkins, they are doing it all. “The women and youth have realised that these draconian farm laws will affect their lives too. Hence, they have chosen to be with us here” explains BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan.“Women have time and again shown that they are the best managers during any crisis. Let’s not forget that it was an agitation spearheaded by women that shook the Badal government on the issue of farm suicides not too long ago,” adds a firebrand Jasbir Kaur even as a resolute Sudesh Goyat, the wife of Major (retd) Ajmer Singh, fondly called the ‘Iron Lady’, concludes: “We will not budge till our demands are met.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-tikri-women-activists-take-centre-stage-180454

Indeed, the government has assured the court that a public notice along the lines described is forthcoming,” Judge Garaufis said in his order.There are currently at least 4,300 active South Asian DACA recipients. As of August 2018, there are over 2,550 active Indian DACA recipients. Only 13 per cent of the overall 20,000 DACA eligible Indianshave applied and received DACA, the SAALT said.There are 1,300 active Pakistani DACA recipients, 470 Bangladeshi, 120 Sri Lankan, and 60 Nepali, it said.The Trump administration can now appeal to a federal appeals court or go to the Supreme Court for temporary relief from the enforcement of the judge's order. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-undocumented-migrants-safe-as-court-reinstates-policy-180455

The letter from the parliamentarians urges the minister to set up an urgent meeting with them to discuss the “deteriorating situation in Punjab” and seeks an update on any communication the FCDO has had with the Indian Government on the issue.“This is a joint letter calling for representation to be made by yourself to your Indian counterpart about the impact on British Sikhs and Punjabis, with longstanding links to land and farming in India,” reads the letter. “This is an issue of particular concern to Sikhs in the UK and those linked to Punjab, although it also heavily impacts on other Indian states. Many British Sikhs and Punjabis have taken this matter up with their MPs, as they are directly affected with family members and ancestral land in Punjab,” it reads. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-stir-36-mps-in-uk-seek-ministerial-intervention-180474
