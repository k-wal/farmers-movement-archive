Noida, Faridabad, Ghaziabad have four stations each, while Gurugram has three and Greater Noida two, according to the app. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ghaziabads-air-severe-6th-day-on-trot-very-poor-in-noida-faridabad-182043

09-12-2020||Bengaluru||Anti-cow slaughter Bill passed in Karnataka Assembly amid din||Amid bedlam, the controversial anti-cow slaughter Bill was passed in the Karnataka Assembly on Wednesday, with the Congress members staging a walkout in protest.The Bill known as the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill-2020 seeks a total ban on the slaughter of cows in the state and stringent punishment to those who indulge in smuggling, illegal transportation, atrocities on cows and slaughtering them, BJP sources said.“Yes, the bill has been passed in the Assembly,” Karnataka Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J C Madhuswamy told PTI.Besides cows and calves, the bill also intends to protect buffaloes and their calves less than 12 years of age.There is a provision to set up special courts for the speedy trial of the accused people.It also makes provision for setting up Goshala or cattle-sheds for the protection of livestock.Police have been given powers to conduct checking.The law also gives protection to those who protect these livestock.The bill was passed without any discussion as there was din in the House.The Congress later staged a walkout in protest.Earlier, when Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chavan tabled the bill in the evening, Congress MLAs led by leader of the opposition Siddaramaiah trooped into the well of the House.They alleged the bill was not discussed for tabling in the Business Advisory Committee meeting.“We had discussed yesterday that new bills will not be tabled.We had agreed that only the ordinances will be passed.Now he (Prabhu Chavan) has all-of-a-sudden introduced this anti-cow slaughter bill,” Siddaramaiah said.However, Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri said he had clearly said in the meeting that important bills will be tabled on Wednesday and Thursday.Not convinced with the reply, the Congress MLAs trooped into the well of the House and raised slogans against the BJP government.The Congress has expressed fears that the bill, if passed, may be misused for polarisation on communal lines and target the minorities.On the other hand, the BJP has been saying the bill is to protect the cows which are holy to the Hindus.To make the provisions of the proposed law stringent, Chavan had referred to similar laws in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.A team of officials led by Chavan had recently visited Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, where the law has been enacted, to study its implementation.

09-12-2020||New Delhi||Tomar meets Shah after protesting farmers reject govt’s draft proposal||Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Wednesday met Home Minister Amit Shah to discuss the next course of action after farmer leaders rejected the Centre’s draft proposal to amend the new agri laws, sources said.The government, in its proposal circulated among the leaders on Wednesday, offered to amend seven to eight issues, including providing a written assurance of minimum support price. It also appealed to protesting farmers to end the agitation that’s been going on nearly two weeks now at various border points of the national capital.The sources said the Agriculture Minister was believed to have discussed with the Home Minister a possible way to end the stalemate after the farm unions rejected the government’s draft proposal.Minister of Railways, Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal was also present in the meeting.A select group of farm leaders, after the meeting with Shah on Tuesday night, had made it clear that they would not accept any amendments and would continue to protest unless the government repeals all three farm laws.Speaking to PTI, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) Jagmohan Singh said: “We have rejected the government’s proposal. We are planning to send a rejoinder to the central government.”Singh, however, said farmer leaders were open for dialogue.“We will come for the meeting if the government invites, but our demand should be met. It has become a mass movement. We cannot return to our villages with empty hands,” he added.

09-12-2020||New Delhi||Tatas counters in SC claims of mismanagement, says SP Group valuation rose||The Tatas on Wednesday countered in the Supreme Court, the accusation of mismanagement of Tata Sons, and said even according to the claim of Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) group, valuation of their 18.37 per cent stake in the company rose from 58,000 crore in 2016 to Rs 1.75 lakh crore in 2020.The Tata firms told the top court that unless the losses were so enormous and there was a lack of probity which left no other option but to remove the majority shareholders of the company, the NCLAT could not have reached the conclusion including that of restoring Cyrus Mistry as executive chairman.A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian was told by senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the Tatas that in the cross-appeal which they have filed in the top court, SP Group has claimed that their value of shares as Rs 1.5 lakh crore.He said according to an application filed by them (Mistry side), in which they have sought 18 per cent in all downstream Tata companies, their value of share was Rs 1.75 lakh crore.“So, if we go by their claims, it is a strange management which has mismanaged the company but still took their valuation from Rs 58,000 crore in 2016 to Rs 1.75 lakh crore in 2020,” Salve said.The bench is hearing cross-appeals filed by Tata Sons and Cyrus Investments against appellate tribunal NCLAT’s order which had restored Cyrus Mistry as the executive chairman of the over $100 billion salt-to-software Tata conglomerate.Salve referred to allegations of undue favour to businessman C Sivasankaran, who was granted contracts by Tata Teleservices, and said all transactions were purely commercial and there was no lack of probity in any of them.He said Pallonji Mistry was a businessman of eminence and he was with Tata Group till 2004 and there was no issue with any of the decision taken then.Similarly, Cyrus Mistry joined in 2006 and he did not have any disagreement till 2012, Salve said.The bench told Salve that his argument was that the tribunal (NCLAT) did not look at the probity aspect and therefore it could not have concluded that it was just and equitable to wind up?Salve replied ‘yes’ and said the judgement of tribunal did not justify itself and tells the basis on which the conclusion was arrived at.He said things were going well and the companies are making money but still allegations of mismanagement were being made.Mistry had contended in the NCLAT that he was removed because of his efforts to remedy past acts of mismanagement.The hearing remained inconclusive and would continue on Thursday.On Tuesday, Tatas said the valuation of 18.37 per cent shares owned by the SP Group in Tata Sons is between Rs 70,000 crore and Rs 80,000 crore.The SP Group earlier submitted in the Apex Court a plan for separation with the Tatas and said that its 18.37 per cent stake in Tata Sons, the holding company of Tata group firms, was worth Rs 1.75 lakh crore.The Tatas have said the event which triggered the present proceedings was primarily on October 24, 2016, when Cyrus Mistry was removed as the executive chairman, months before his term was to end in March 2017.The Apex Court had on January 10 granted relief to Tata group by staying the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order of December 18 last year by which Mistry was restored as the executive chairman of the conglomerate.Mistry had succeeded Ratan Tata as chairman of Tata Sons in 2012 but was ousted four years later.The court had also observed there were “lacunae” in the orders passed by the NCALT.On May 29, it had issued notice to TSPL and others on a cross-appeal filed by Cyrus Investments Private Limited.The top court on September 22 restrained SP Group and Cyrus Mistry as also his investment firm from pledging or transferring their shares of Tata Sons Pvt Ltd (TSPL).SP Group, which owns 18.37 per cent in Tata Sons, has said TSPL moved the top court to block its plan to pledge shares for raising funds and that reeked of vindictiveness and oppression of minority shareholder rights.On September 5, Tata Sons moved the top court seeking to restrain the Mistry group from raising capital against their shares. It sought to prevent SP Group from creating any direct or indirect pledge of shares.TSPL had earlier told the top court that it was not a ‘two-group company’ and there was no ‘quasi-partnership’ between it and Cyrus Investments Private Limited.TSPL had made averments in an affidavit filed in the apex court while responding to the cross-appeal filed by Cyrus Investments seeking removal of alleged anomalies in the NCLAT order for getting representation on the TSPL’s board in proportion to the stakes held by his family.Mistry had filed an affidavit to the Apex Court saying the Tata Group had an adjusted net loss of Rs 13,000 crore in 2019 — the worst losses in three decades.In his reply to the Tatas’ petition challenging his reinstatement by the NCLAT last December, Mistry also demanded that group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata should reimburse all the expenses to Tata Sons since his departure in December 2012 in keeping with best global governance standards.Mistry is seeking representation in the company in proportion to the 18.37 per cent stake held by his family, the appeal has said.Reinstating Mistry as the chairman, the NCLAT had also termed the action of the Registrar of Companies to allow conversion of Tata Sons into a private limited company illegal.

09-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||As farmers reject conciliatory proposals, BJP-led Centre in Catch-22 situation||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 9As farmers on Wednesday turned down the conciliatory moves by the BJP-led Centre, the Narendra Modi government is facing an unprecedented domestic situation, which it has not seen or dealt with in the past six years in power.The only time it was forced to make some sort of a U-turn on an issue was in 2015 when it agreed to drop amendments to the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. The offer of nine amendments in five laws was rejected by unions, who also declared to intensify their agitation, adding to the problems of the government, though BJP leaders quoted Rajasthan ‘panchayat’, Greater Hyderabad municipal and Bihar victories to claim endorsement of new farm laws by rural India.Apparently, the matter was discussed in the Cabinet meeting and after farmers struck down the offer of a “middle-path”, indicating a communication breakdown between the two sides as on date, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar called on Home Minister Amit Shah. Though Union Minister Prakash Javadekar called deliberations with farmers “work in progress”. It remains to be seen whether PM Modi will emerge as the last stop in the government’s strategy after Amit Shah’s surprise intervention yesterday. So far there is no clarity over the next round of talks between the government and farmers. The sixth round scheduled today was cancelled after Shah’s meeting with 13 union leaders that clearly failed to resolve anything. The fact is while the BJP-led Centre is under pressure to resolve the issue, farmer leaders are also under pressure to not give in. The BJP is citing the win in Rajasthan local bodies as proof of farmers’ overwhelming support for the “BJP’s stand on farm reforms”. Party president JP Nadda said the victory symbolises the trust the poor, farmers and labourers have in the leadership of PM Modi.However, the agitation is now spilling beyond Delhi, which continues to be the main point of farmers’ protest. While there is a ‘Dilli chalo’ call to north Indian farmers, farmers in South India and other distant states will protest at district headquarters, say farmer leaders. The government may be counting on support from some unions on its middle path proposal but majority of farmers are not in the mood to listen, calling its proposals an “insult”.The government which apparently shelved its decision regarding tax concessions to corporates after the famous ‘suit-boot ki sarkar’ jibe by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, will be witnessing the mother of all protests against corporates. The farmers have also given a call for “boycotting Jio services and similarly Adani/Ambani malls, products, etc”.Centre’s proposals FTPC Act 1.        State governments can collect market cess/fees on transactions outside the market yards also, if they want.2.        State governments can do registration of traders, if they want. 3.        Farmers will be able to go to Civil Courts for dispute resolution, in addition to existing mechanisms in the law.FAPAFS Act (Contract Farming Promotion Act)4.        Registering contracts between farmers and company within 30 days 5.        Farmers land or any structure created on it under the contract cannot be mortgaged, leased, removed etc 6.        Farmers’ land cannot be attached under any circumstances.MSP and procurement:7.        Written assurance that current procurement levels of the government at MSP will be kept in future also.Electricity Act (Amendment) Bill:8.        Electricity (Amendment) Bill is still a draft, no change in the present systemAir Quality Ordinance:9.        Concerns regarding the provisions of the Air Quality Ordinance will be addressed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-farmers-reject-conciliatory-proposals-bjp-led-centre-in-catch-22-situation-182027

09-12-2020||New Delhi||Fatty residues on ancient pottery reveal meat-heavy diets of Indus Civilisation: Study||An analysis of fat residues in ancient ceramic vessels from settlements of the Indus Civilisation in present-day Haryana and Uttar Pradesh suggests that the prehistoric people of the time consumed meat of animals like cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat, and pigs as well as dairy products.The study, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, involved extraction and identification of fats and oils that have been absorbed into ancient ceramic vessels during their use in the past.Based on the analysis, the scientists, including those from the University of Cambridge in the UK, unravelled how these ancient vessels were used and what was being cooked in them."Our study of lipid residues in Indus pottery shows a dominance of animal products in vessels, such as the meat of non-ruminant animals like pigs, ruminant animals like cattle or buffalo, and sheep or goat, as well as dairy products," said study co-author Akshyeta Suryanarayan former PhD student at the Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge.Suryanarayan, who is currently a postdoctoral researcher at CNRS, France, said her team found a predominance of non-ruminant animal fats in the vessels -- even though the remains of animals like pigs were not present in large quantities."It is possible that plant products or mixtures of plant and animal products were also used in vessels, creating ambiguous results," she added.Despite the high percentages of the remains of domestic ruminant animals found at these sites, the archeologists said there is very limited direct evidence of the use of dairy products in the vessels."The products used in vessels across rural and urban Indus sites in northwest India are similar during the Mature Harappan period (c.2600/2500-1900 BC)," said Cameron Petrie, senior author of the study from the University of Cambridge."This suggests that even though urban and rural settlements were distinctive and people living in them used different types of material culture and pottery, they may have shared cooking practices and ways of preparing foodstuffs," Petrie said.The scientists believe the findings highlight the resilience of rural settlements in northwest India during the transformation of the Indus Civilisation, and during a period of increasing aridity."There is also evidence that rural settlements in northwest India exhibited a continuity in the ways they cooked or prepared foodstuff from the urban (Mature Harappan) to post-urban (Late Harappan) periods," Petrie said.He said this was particularly during a phase of climatic instability after 2100 BC, suggesting that daily practices continued at small rural sites over cultural and climatic changes."These results demonstrate that the use of lipid residues, combined with other techniques in bioarchaeology, have the potential to open exciting new avenues for understanding the relationship between the environment, foodstuffs, material culture, and ancient society in protohistoric South Asia," Suryanarayan concluded. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fatty-residues-on-ancient-pottery-reveal-meat-heavy-diets-of-indus-civilisation-study-182019
09-12-2020||---||UK PM in Parliament confuses farmers’ protest with India-Pak dispute||London, December 9British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday seemed to confuse two separate issues when he reiterated the UK government’s stance that any dispute between India and Pakistan was for the two countries to settle bilaterally.British Sikh Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, who has been leading a drive to keep the protests by the Indian farmers against the government’s agricultural reforms in the news in Britain, repeated one of his previous Twitter statements on the issue in the House of Commons during the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) session.“Many constituents, especially those emanating from Punjab and other parts of India, and I were horrified to see footage of water cannons, teargas and brute force being used against peacefully protesting farmers. However, it was heart-warming to see those very farmers feeding those forces who had been ordered to beat or suppress them. What indomitable spirit and it takes a special kind of people to do that,” the Opposition lawmaker said.“So, will the Prime Minister (Johnson) convey to the Indian Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) our heartfelt anxieties, our hopes for a speedy resolution to the current deadlock and does he agree that everyone has a fundamental right to peaceful protest,” he questioned Johnson.Johnson, in his brief response, went on to address a completely unrelated matter instead.“Our view is that of course we have serious concerns about what is happening between India and Pakistan but these are pre-eminently matters for those two governments to settle and I know that he appreciates that point,” said Johnson.Dhesi, who looked visibly perplexed, was quick to take to social media once again as he posted the exchange on Twitter, adding: “But it might help if our PM actually knew what he was talking about!”The UK government has so far refused to be drawn into the ongoing protests in India, with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) saying the matter of handling protests was an internal one.“The police handling of protests is a matter for the government of India,” an FCDO spokesperson said last week, following a letter initiated by Dhesi and signed by 35 other UK MPs over the issue.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26, seeking repeal of the three farm laws enacted in September.Dubbing these laws as “anti-farmer”, these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-pm-in-parliament-confuses-farmers-protest-with-india-pak-dispute-182018
09-12-2020||New Delhi||A person is disqualified to contest polls if conviction not stayed: SC||A person stands disqualified from contesting polls under the election law if his conviction in a criminal case, in which a jail term of two or more years has been awarded, is not stayed, the Supreme Court has said on Wednesday.The top court’s observation came in a judgement by which it dismissed an appeal of Saritha S Nair against the rejection of her nomination papers for contesting Lok Sabha polls from Ernakulam, Kerala, by the returning officers in 2019 on account of her conviction and sentencing in two criminal cases related to the Solar scam in the state.Hibi Eden of Congress party won the seat.Nair had also moved the top court against rejection of her nomination papers on the same grounds for contesting Lok Sabha polls from Wayanad seat against Rahul Gandhi. The plea was dismissed earlier on November 2 on account of non-prosecution.A bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices V Ramasubramanian and AS Bopanna trashed the contention of Nair that the rejection of her nomination papers was incorrect as her sentence of three years was suspended by appellate courts.The bench said the suspension of the execution of the sentence would not “alter or affect” the conviction and that therefore such a person would remain disqualified.The top court was very critical of the Kerala High Court for holding the defects such as lack of proper verification, incomplete prayer and allegations against former Chief Minister as incurable in Nair’s petition.“The High Court committed a grave error in holding the three defects...as incurable. The defects are curable and as rightly contended by the counsel for the petitioner, an opportunity to cure the defects ought to have been given..,” it said.Referring judgements and legal provisions on disqualification, the bench said: “It will be clear that the mere suspension of the execution of the sentence is not sufficient to take the rigour out of Section 8(3) (of the Representation of Peoples Act).”Justice Ramasubramanian, writing the verdict, said an order of the court “suspending the sentence of imprisonment has to be read in the context of Section 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that under the said provision, what is suspended is only the execution of the sentence and not the sentence itself”.The top court upheld the decisions of the Returning Officer saying “in effect, the disqualification under Section 8(3) will continue so long as there is no stay of conviction”, and also rejected her plea that her nomination papers to contest polls from Amethi was not rejected despite the disclosure of same facts.“Merely because the Returning Officer in Amethi Constituency committed an error in overlooking this fact, the petitioner cannot plead estoppel against statutory prescription,” the top court held.Nair had moved the top court against the October 31, 2019, decision of the Kerala High Court by which her election petitions challenging the Lok Sabha polls in Wayanad and Ernakulam also were dismissed.The high court had not allowed Nair’s pleas challenging the polls in both Lok Sabha seats and said her nomination papers were rejected as the conviction in the two criminal cases were not suspended.It had that only the sentences in the cases were suspended by the appellate court.The high court said it was clear from the relief sought in the appeal petition that Nair had only sought suspension of the sentence and not suspension of conviction.Nair’s nomination papers were rejected under the Section 8(3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 which prescribed for disqualification on account of conviction and sentencing in a criminal case.

09-12-2020||Kolkata||Ex-Bengal CM Buddhadeb’s health condition ‘very critical’||The health condition of former West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, who was admitted to a hospital in south Kolkata, deteriorated to “very critical” on Wednesday evening, officials said.Bhattacharya, 76, was put on mechanical ventilator support at the critical care unit of the private hospital, where he was taken to in the afternoon as his breathing-related problems aggravated, they said.“Mr Bhattacharya’s RT-PCR test showed he was COVID- negative and that is positive news. The CT scan of his brain showed old lacunar infarcts. He is undergoing treatment at the CCU,” a senior official of the hospital said.Repeated tests showed an accumulation of carbon dioxide and a lower pH level, following which doctors decided to electively ventilate him after proper consent of family members, he said.“His condition is very critical,” the official added.Bhattacharya’s pulse and blood pressure are stable and the veteran politician is on IV antibiotics, IV steroids and other supportive medications, said a statement released by the hospital.His oxygen saturation deteriorated to 70 per cent in the morning and he became unconscious, following which he was rushed to the hospital.The veteran CPI(M) leader was initially put on non- invasive ventilation (BIPAP) at the hospital after which his oxygen saturation improved to 95 per cent.However, his condition deteriorated and he was put on mechanical ventilation.A five-member team of senior doctors, including a cardiologist and a pulmonologist, was constituted to monitor his health condition.Bhattacharya, who was the chief minister of West Bengal from 2000 to 2011, has been suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and other old age- related ailments for quite some time. He has been away from public life for the past few years due to his health.He had stepped down from the CPI(M)’s politburo and the central committee in 2015, and gave up membership of the state secretariat in 2018.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee visited the hospital and enquired about Bhattacharya’s health condition, praying for his quick recovery.“We are beside his family. We respect him a lot. I thank all the doctors who are treating him, but we have to be ready for any situation. I can feel his daughter’s (Suchetana Bhattacharya) mental condition,” she said after visiting the hopital.Banerjee also assured all kinds of support from the state government for Bhattacharya’s treatment.Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar also visited the hospital and wished for his speedy recovery.CPI(M) state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra urged the people to cooperate with the hospital authorities.“Comrade Buddhadeb Bhattacharya has been admitted for treatment of acute exacerbation of his respiratory problems in Woodland. No visitor is being allowed now. Well-wishers are requested to co-operate with the hospital authority for maintaining strict discipline in this regard,” he tweeted.

The Genome Valley was decorated and foolproof security arrangements were made in the valley that is known to produce the largest number of vaccines in the world in labs of different pharmaceutical companies. Organised by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), this was an attempt to showcase India’s expertise so that a partnerships could be brokered for the manufacture and delivery of vaccines. This is a follow up of the briefing in Delhi where India presented its case to these envoys. The envoys were briefed by the top officials of these two companies that are waiting for the approval of the vaccine from the regulator. At Bharat Biotech, the delegation was briefed about company’s vaccine development programme by Dr Krishna Ella, Chairman and Managing Director, spearheading Covaxin research, development, clinical trials and production teams. The delegates were explained about Bharat Biotech’s research process, manufacturing capabilities, expertise through virtual and physical tours of the facilities. Covaxin is being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – National Institute of Virology (NIV). This indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech’s BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) bio-containment facility. Suchitra Ella, Joint Managing Director of Bharat Biotech told the visiting envoys that the development and clinical evaluation of COVAXIN marks a significant milestone for novel vaccinology in India. Covaxin has garnered interest from several countries worldwide for supplies and introduction. At the same time the Biological E initiated clinical trial of its Covid-19 subunit vaccine candidate in India last month following approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI). The vaccine is being made in India in collaboration with Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Dynavax), a US-based vaccine focused biopharmaceutical company, and Baylor College of Medicine, a health sciences university in Houston. The Telangana Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar addressed the diplomats and showcased the potential of the state. He told the envoys that the combined value of the pharma sector in the state was around $50 billion. Hyderabad is the vaccine hub of not only India but the entire world with 33 per cent of the entire vaccine production being done in Hyderabad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/envoys-from-64-nations-witness-indias-vaccine-production-182008

09-12-2020||Amaravati||Rapid decline in number of people falling sick to mysterious disease in Andhra’s Eluru||The number of people falling sick to a mysterious disease in Eluru city of Andhra Pradesh saw a rapid decline on Wednesday even as medical and scientific experts could not yet exactly pinpoint what caused the outbreak.But after several rounds of tests, they opined that organochlorine and lead could be the primary causative agents that triggered the disease, whose symptoms mainly were fits and nausea.In their preliminary findings presented to the Andhra Pradesh government, the experts noted that it was a point source epidemic and a likely case of acute intoxication of toxins, but not chronic.“There is a likelihood of toxin lead or organochlorine or both causing the sudden convulsions,” the experts observed.The total number of those afflicted by the disease touched 593 on Wednesday, but 523 of them have already been discharged from hospital upon recovery.Another 33 patients were referred to the Government General Hospitals in Vijayawada and Guntur for better treatment.The number of active cases is now only 36.Only about 24 patients reported sick on Wednesday, but all of them were stable.Though a couple of people complained of a relapse, they too got cured after a few hours in hospital.Teams of experts from the National Institution of Nutrition, the National Centre for Disease Control and the AIIMS were now examining the cattle for possible traces of the chemical compounds.As bleaching powder and chlorine were extensively used for sanitation to contain the spread of COVID-19, they could have been a source of contamination, the two-member WHO team felt after visiting the affected areas in the city.Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy interacted with the experts via a videoconference and said the government would come out with an action plan once the final reports on the disease outbreak were received.He asked them to first focus their study on whether or not drinking water caused the mysterious disease and then analyse the other aspects.The experts told the Chief Minister that the number of cases has dwindled significantly and also those afflicted were recovering in three to four hours.Senior specialist A Shariff from AIIMS said detailed examination of all samples has to be done, though the blood samples indicated a high level of lead.Since nickel is largely present in Indians, there was no need to panic, he noted.The lead level too was significantly declining in 24 hours after the patients recovered, he added.Recycled batteries could have been the source of lead contamination, Shariff explained.“The batteries may have got buried in the soil after breakage, which could have led to lead contamination. It could have got into human bodies through rice or vegetables.Or, lead could have been in the air when used batteries were burnt,” he pointed out.The AIIMS expert said they were studying all these aspects.Experts from the NIN, Hyderabad, said they spoke to some of the affected families in Eluru and collected details of the food they had taken.“We collected samples of vegetables, blood and urine from them.We also collected samples from some patients in hospital.We went to the markets where vegetables and other essential commodities are purchased. We are examining all those samples,” the NIN experts said.They informed the Chief Minister that NIN would submit a report based on the examination of water, food, milk, urine and blood samples.The IICT scientists said they were conducting a thorough study on drinking water as lead content was found to be high in the patients.They, however, said a preliminary analysis of water did not reveal any dangerous content as such.“We are conducting a comprehensive analysis for determining the exact cause,” they added.The CCMB team said it was studying whether any virus caused the mysterious disease outbreak in Eluru.“It will take some time for the results to come out and determine the exact cause,” it told the Chief Minister. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rapid-decline-in-number-of-people-falling-sick-to-mysterious-disease-in-andhras-eluru-182001

He had joined the National Defence Academy, Kharakvasla, in November 2016 and after completing the three-year course in 2019, proceeded to the IMA.Two other cadets, Academy Under Officer Majji Giridhar and Battalion Under Officer Ashish Kumar also received three awards each. Of the total of 18 individual medals and trophies awarded for the top positions in various categories at the awards ceremony of Autumn Term – 2020 held today, the three bagged 50 per cent of the awards.Cadets of this term, comprising the 147th Regular Course and 130th Technical Graduate Course, will formally pass out from the academy on December 12. The courses include 325 Indian and 70 foreign cadets.Addressing the cadets, Lt Gen Harinder Singh, Commandant IMA, said the country demands willing, unhesitating, unfaltering obedience and loyalty from each young officer. He said that leadership is composite of a number of qualities, among the most important of which are self-confidence, moral ascendancy, self-sacrifice, fairness, initiative, decision, dignity and courage.The Commandant said it is important for an officer to maintain a competitive streak within the parameters of sportsmanship and fair play at all times. He mentioned that the urge to win and excel as a team should always be there. In the profession of arms, it is always a collective and a team effort that is important as there are no runners up in war.The training imparted at IMA is designed to provide a comprehensive knowledge of military fundamentals and leadership, as well as proficiency in basic military skills. It aims to develop the qualities of character, intellect, fitness and competence needed by future ready officers who at all times in their career must be prepared to lead.While the COVID-19 outbreak disrupted training in most educational institutes in the world, IMA implemented an effective action plan by integrating all preventive guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health, Army Headquarters and the Army Training Command.  A healthy routine was evolved for the cadets and staff and it was ensured that there was no dilution in training standards.Sidhu got the Parachute Regiment Medal for being best in endurance and physical toughness, Maratha Light Infantry Medal for being best in PT and the Rajputana Rifles Medal for being best in tactical ability.Giridhar received the Brigade of The Guards Medal for being best in service subjects, Jat Regiment Silver Medal for being best in officer-like Qualities and the Sikh Light Infantry Silver Medal for being best in turnout and drill.Kumar received the 9 Gorkha Rifles Medal for standing first in military studies, the Corps of Signals for standing first in Science and Warfare and Rajput Regiment Silver Medal for being best in Academics.The Commandant’s Banner for standing overall first in inter-battalion championships went to the Bhagat Battalion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-cadet-among-three-who-bag-top-honours-at-ima-181993

The festival should be observed. People should embrace each other on the occasion of Eid and have fun. But why not show the same consideration for the foundation stone laying ceremony of Ram temple”, the BJP chief said.Importantly, the issue was raised by the BJP back in August also. In reply, the state government had pointed out that while Eid was a religious festival, the Ram temple foundation stone laying ceremony was nothing but the programme of a political party.Undeterred by the cash dole of Rs 50,000 each to community Durga pujas and the monthly allowance for Hindu priests announced by her, the BJP has continued to project Mamata as someone who panders to the sentiments of the Muslim community at the cost of the Hindus.Nadda, however, did not confine himself to only playing up the religious sentiments of members of the Hindu community.With pandemic gradually tapering off in the country and vaccine for COVID-19 not a distant dream any more, BJP has decided that it is time to claim credit for management of the crisis by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Nadda, on Wednesday, lauded Modi for handling the COVID crisis well.He said while many developed countries with advanced health infrastructure suffered great losses owing to COVID-19, timely lockdown announced by Modi had ensured that the situation did not go out of control in India.The whole world appreciated the handling of the challenge by Modi, Nadda said and added that financial packages announced by the central government in this connection had benefitted crores of poor people.Later, Nadda went to Bhawanipore, assembly constituency of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and took part in an interaction programme there.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-pursues-polarisation-game-in-bengal-181991

09-12-2020||New Delhi||NIA charge-sheets 16 people based abroad under anti-terror law for pro-Khalistan activities||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday filed a charge sheet against 16 people based in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada under the anti-terror law, UAPA, for allegedly indulging in seditious activities and promoting enmity on the grounds of region and religion in the country.The NIA charge sheet alleged that the seven accused from the US, six from the UK and three from Canada were involved in an organised conspiracy for launching a concerted secessionist campaign under the banner of ‘Referendum 2020’ for the creation of ‘Khalistan’.The charge sheet was filed under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) before the designated court here.The accused included Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, Hardeep Singh Nijjar and Paramjit Singh who have been designated as terrorists by a home ministry notification under the anti-terror law. Pannun stays in the US, Nijjar is at present in Canada and Singh is in the UK.The others named in the charge sheet are Avtar Singh Pannun, Harpreet Singh, Amardeep Singh Purewal, Harjaap Singh, Sarabjit Singh and S Himmat Singh (all from the US); Gurpreet Singh Baagi, Sarabjit Singh Bannur, Kulwant Singh Mothada, Dupinderjit Singh and Kulwant Singh (from the UK) and J S Dhaliwal and Jatinder Singh Grewal (from Canada).These people, according to the NIA, are members of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), an organisation declared as ‘Unlawful Association’ under the UAPA.According to the NIA spokesperson, the probe in the case showed that Sikhs for Justice, a secessionist outfit floated in the garb of ‘human rights advocacy group’ with its offices in various foreign countries like the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, is a frontal organisation of Khalistan terrorist outfits operating from foreign soils including Pakistan.Under this campaign numerous social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube Channels and a number of websites have been launched, which are being used “to propagate sedition as well as enmity on the grounds of region and religion, to radicalise impressionable youth, to cause disturbance to peace and harmony and to raise funds for terrorist activities”, the NIA said.The SFJ has been attempting to undermine the security of the Indian State by instigating Sikh personnel in the Indian army to rise in mutiny against India besides trying to radicalise youths of Kashmir and openly extending support for the secession of Kashmir from India, it said.The spokesperson said based on the dossiers provided by the NIA and other agencies, the chief patrons of SFJ namely Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, Hardeep Singh Nijjar and Paramjit Singh alias Pamma have already been designated as ‘Terrorist’ under UAPA.During the course of the investigation, the spokesperson said, “the NIA identified immovable properties belonging to terrorist Pannun in Amritsar and terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Jalandhar.“Based on the request of NIA, the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, in exercise of powers conferred under Section 51-A of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967, has ordered attachment of these properties.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-charge-sheets-16-people-based-abroad-under-anti-terror-law-for-pro-khalistan-activities-181985

The counsel for the applicant has undertaken that the applicant shall not seek extension of interim bail on any ground whatsoever and he shall duly surrender before the jail authorities after availing the interim bail.“As such, purely on humanitarian grounds, the applicant is admitted to interim bail in the matter from December 10, 2020, to December 12,2020…” the judge said in his order.During the hearing, Shubham's counsel had sought interim bail for four days on account of his sister's marriage on December 11.Special Public Prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea saying Shubham was an accused in cases involving commission of heinous offences, and he was not entitled to interim bail.The public prosecutor further said the accused be accorded “custody parole” for six hours on the date of the marriage.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-court-grants-interim-bail-to-accused-on-humanitarian-grounds-for-sisters-wedding-181984
09-12-2020||New Delhi||China gives ‘5 differing explanations’ for deploying large forces at LAC: Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday China has given India “five differing explanations” for deploying large forces at the LAC, adding this violation of bilateral pacts has “very significantly damaged” their relationship that is now at its “most difficult phase” in the last 30-40 years.The comments by Jaishankar during an online interactive session organised by Australian think tank Lowy Institute came against the backdrop of the over seven-month-long military standoff between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.“We are today probably at the most difficult phase of our relationship with China, certainly in the last 30 to 40 years or you could argue even more,” Jaishankar said highlighting various aspects of the bilateral ties in the last three decades.“The relationship this year has been very significantly damaged.”“We are very clear that maintaining peace and tranquillity along the LAC is the basis for the rest of the relationship to progress. You can’t have the kind of situation you have on the border and say let’s carry on with life in all other sectors of activity. It’s just unrealistic,” he said.Jaishankar further said, “We have this problem because from 1988, our relationship had its hiccups, we had our issues and differences but the direction of the ties broadly were positive.”The external affairs minister said the relationship progressed in trade, travel and various other domains as both sides inked several pacts to maintain peace and tranquillity along the LAC.“All of this was posited on the fact that while we were trying to solve the boundary question, we would maintain peace and tranquillity along the border areas,” he said, adding there were incidents of arguments between patrols along the border “but you never had a major breach of understanding”.He said multiple agreements between the two sides were inked from 1993 with a commitment that both parties will not bring large forces to the border areas.“Now for some reason, for which the Chinese have to date given us five differing explanations, the Chinese have violated it. The Chinese have literally brought tens of thousands of soldiers in full military preparation mode right to the LAC in Ladakh. Naturally the relationship would be profoundly disturbed by this,” he said.Referring to the Galwan Valley clashes in eastern Ladakh in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, Jaishankar said the incident “completely changed national sentiment”.The external affairs minister also said the “very big issue” is how to get the relationship back on track.He also mentioned various diplomatic and military engagements between the two sides in the last few months including his meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow as well as talks between the two defence ministers.“We have multiple layers of communication. Communication is not the issue, the issue is the fact that we have agreements and those agreements are not being observed.”Asked about his stint in China as India’s ambassador and his views on Chinese President Xi Jinping, Jaishankar referred to his observation made in his book “The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World”.“I think there has been an evolution in China, my book basically makes the case that 2008-09 was the tipping point for that change. And you have today a China whose engagement with the world is very different from the way it used to be conducted 20 years ago,” he said.“Now you could argue that it is natural as (when) a country goes up the power hierarchy that its behavioural pattern would change, I reserve comment on it, but clearly no question that you have a very much more nationalistic China and that is expressed sort of down the line in variety of ways and often in policies as well,” Jaishankar said.Asked how India’s ties with the US will be under Joe Biden’s administration, Jaishankar said the US president-elect has goodwill for India and made positive contributions in growth of the ties between the two countries.  He said the structural and objective part of the relations brought the countries together.

09-12-2020||Mumbai||Lack of adequate cold chain biggest challenge in COVID-19 vaccine distribution: Report||Despite having one of the largest universal immunization programmes (UIPs), lack of cold chain may prove to be one of the biggest challenges for India in COVID-19 vaccine distribution, a foreign brokerage said on Wednesday.The cold chain market with 37 million tonne capacity is very fragmented in India, and the country does not have a single cold chain operator with a capacity of over 5,000 tonne, analysts at Bofa Securities said adding very few of the 3,500 companies are 'pharma-compliant' as per WHO norms."India's struggle with cold chain for COVID-19 vaccine stems from the fact that despite one of the large cold chain capacities in the world, there are not many large participants,” they said.It can be noted that India runs the widely successful polio immunization programme, where the vaccine is transported in temperatures ranging from 2-8 degrees Celsius and there is a dedicated cold chain, which is likely to be repurposed for the COVID-19 vaccine.However, the brokerage said the quantum of work is 16 times more than the 600 million doses under the UIP.The brokerage estimated the cost of transporting a single vaccine at around Rs 600 and assuming that up to 400 million Indians are to be vaccinated, the overall logistics market comes at Rs 21,000 crore.However, the biggest stumbling block for investment activity is the uncertainty over which of the vaccine candidates gets approved.For overall 400 million doses forecast, India may need 30,000 tonne of transportation capacity which is about 11,500 vehicles, it said, adding as of 2018, India had 12,800 such vehicles.Pfizer's and Moderna's mRNA vaccines need extreme cold temperatures for stability whereas the one from AstraZeneca (AZN)/Oxford can be stored, transported and handled at standard refrigerated conditions between 2-8 degrees Celsius, it said, adding India does not have any facilities at all for transporting vaccines at ultra-low temperatures like -80 degrees Celsius required for the Pfizer vaccine.There is also less visibility on future use of capacity which makes private players question return on investment (ROI) on such exercise, the analysts said, adding many private companies are waiting for clear directives from government and pharma companies.Manufacturing is likely to be concentrated in Ahmedabad (Cadila), Pune (Serum), Hyderabad (Bharat Biotech, Biological E, Dr Reddy's) and Telangana (Aurobindo), it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lack-of-adequate-cold-chain-biggest-challenge-in-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-report-181981

The three were subjected to CBI searches in 2007 for their alleged involvement in the Israeli Barak deal (Suresh Nanda and Vipin Khanna), South African company armaments Denel (Vipin Khanna) and the Israeli Soltam gun upgrade deal (Sudhir Chowdhury).In this case, the ED has alleged that Embraer paid commission of $ 5.76 million to a Singapore company which routed some of the amount to a Dubai-based subsidiary KRBL of an Indian company which then transferred this money to the country.Investigation conducted so far has resulted in issuance of a provisional attachment order of proceeds of crime in the form of immovable properties worth Rs 16.29 crore belonging to the KRBL, said the ED.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-for-prosecuting-money-launderers-in-embraer-deal-181979

09-12-2020||Chandigarh||DRDO develops quantum key technology for secure communication||Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed quantum key distribution (QKD) technology, that offers a robust solution of sharing encryption keys over the air or wired links for enabling secure communication.The technology developed jointly by the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) and DRDO Young Scientist Laboratories – Quantum Technology (DYSL), the QKD technology was demonstrated successfully on Wednesday by carrying out secure communication between two DRDO laboratories.CAIR is involved in research in the areas of artificial intelligence, robotics, command and control, networking, information and communication security whereas DYSL is part of five specialised research laboratories located in five different cities focused on artificial intelligence, quantum technology, cognitive technology, asymmetric technology and smart materials.The trails also demonstrated the validation of detection of a third party trying to gain knowledge of the communication. Quantum based security against eavesdropping was validated for the deployed system at a range of over 12 km through fibre optic channel.Secure communications are vital for defence and strategic agencies and distribution of encryption keys from time to time is an important requirement in this context.Sharing of keys over the air or wired links requires encryption, which in turn requires the encryption keys to be pre-shared through a secure medium.Laser-based technology and software have been developed for data acquisition, time synchronization, post-processing, determining quantum bit error rate and extracting other important parameters for the QKD to function.The work being done at DRDO will be used to enable start-ups and SMEs in the domain of quantum information technologies.It will also serve to define standards and crypto policies that can leverage the QKD system in a unified policy framework for more secure and pragmatic key management for current and future military cryptographic systems.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drdo-develops-quantum-key-technology-for-secure-communication-181975
09-12-2020||New Delhi||5 Opposition leaders meet Prez Kovind seeking repeal of farm laws||A delegation of Opposition leaders on Wednesday met President Ram Nath Kovind and sought repeal of the three farm laws against which thousands of farmers have been protesting on various borders of the national capital.The five-member delegation comprised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI general secretary D Raja and DMK leader TKS Elangovan.“We met the President and informed him of our view regarding the three farm laws. We have asked for their repeal. We informed the President that it is critical that they are taken back,” Gandhi told reporters after the meeting.He said the way the farm laws were passed in Parliament, “we feel it was an insult to farmers and that is why they are protesting in the cold weather against them”.The three bills were passed without any discussion or conversation with the Opposition parties or with farmers, he said.“The kisan (farmer) has lost faith in the government. The kisan does not believe that the government is acting in their interest and that is why lakhs of them are on the streets, non-violently, compassionately on the streets,” Gandhi said, adding: “The farmers will not relent and will continue their protests till the laws and taken back.”Later, Gandhi tweeted: “The farmers of the country have realised that they have been cheated by the Modi government and they are not going to relent because they know that if they compromise today they will have no future. The farmers are India. We are all with farmers. Stay put.”The Opposition leaders submitted a memorandum to the President that said: “We urge upon you, as the custodian of the Indian Constitution, to persuade your government not to be obdurate and accept the demands raised by India’s ‘annadatas’.”“The new agri-laws, passed in Parliament in an anti-democratic manner preventing a structured discussion and voting, threaten India’s food security, destroy Indian agriculture and our farmers, lay the basis for the abolishment of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and mortgage Indian agriculture and our markets to the caprices of multi-national agri-business corporates and domestic corporates,” it said.The memorandum to the President further said more than 20 different political parties, including many parties governing states, have extended their solidarity with the ongoing struggle of the Indian peasantry and extended wholehearted support to their call for a Bharat Bandh on December 8, demanding the repeal of the “retrograde” agri laws and the Electricity Amendment Bill.Gandhi said the new laws appeared to be aimed at handing over the farming sector to the “friends of the Prime Minister” but the farmers were fearless and would not back off and would continue with their peaceful agitation.He said the government should have no “misconception” and the “farmers will not compromise” on the issue because if they do that, they will have no future.“I want to tell the farmers that if they don’t stand up now, they won’t be able to stand up anytime in future,” he added.NCP leader Pawar said various political parties had requested the President that these farm laws should be repealed as they were not discussed with either stakeholders or in the Select Committee of Parliament.The former agriculture minister said not a single suggestion of Opposition leaders raised in Parliament were accepted by the government and all these bills were passed in haste.He said the MSP had not been mentioned in the new farm laws and that was why the farmers were disturbed.CPI(M) leader Yechury said: “We told the President that the three farm laws were passed undemocratically in Parliament and have sought the repeal of these laws.”He said the government should repeal the acts in view of the widespread protests by farmers.Raja said these three laws would place the farmers and agricultural workers at the “mercy of corporates” and big agri-businesses.“This is not in the interest of the country as a whole. It is not affecting only the farmers, who have been protesting for last two weeks, it will subject the agriculture workers to horrific living conditions,” Raja said, adding as political parties, “they cannot remain mute spectators”.Elangovan said the government promised Parliament that they would implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission on Minimum Support Price. “But this bill has negated that promise,” he added.The Opposition leaders said the Prime Minister had been saying that these laws were in the interest of farmers but the question was that if these laws were in their favour then why the farmers were protesting out in the cold.The opposition delegation was limited to five because of the COVID-19 situation.The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

09-12-2020||---||Quad a new game with India; undermining ties with Russia: Lavrov||New Delhi, December 9Veteran Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Levrov’s comments on India and the “Quad” and how the India-Russia partnership is being undermined have stirred the strategic community and South Block here.Speaking at the Russian International Affairs Council, Lavrov said India was currently an object of the Western countries’ “persistent, aggressive and devious policy”.They are trying to engage India in anti-China games by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies, the so-called “Quad”. At the same time, the West is attempting to undermine Russia’s close partnership and privileged relations with India.Lavrov said the West has launched a “new game”, postponing Russia and China for later. It is trying to draw all others into a unipolar world by any means possible.Lavrov had begun his address by directing his ire against France and Germany for kow-towing to the US agenda. The attitude of the two big European nations had compelled the European Union (EU) to give up claims to its role as a pole in the multipolar system that is taking shape for objective reasons, he charged.The Russian Foreign Minister has almost given up on Germany but had hopes for France. “Germany’s recent policy on many issues convinces us that this is exactly what Berlin wants to do [step back from leadership]…. France has a somewhat different position... If France wants to claim this role, we will have to wait and see what happens,” he observed.Attacking the “rules-based order”, Lavrov said they were invented on the go, at various get-togethers.The Russian Foreign Minister’s ire was instigated by the EU approving a framework for imposing sanctions on a country for human rights abuse. It had earlier adopted the mechanisms of sanctions for chemical and cyber-hacking violations. All these are interpreted as targeted against Russia at Washington’s bidding.Lavrov said while raising unilateral structures, the West is doing everything it can to discredit universal bodies or cow them into submission by privatising their secretariats, as we in the case of OPCW.“When this fails, they take these issues outside UN structures and universal conventions and impose on others convenient decisions [sanctions] as the ultimate truth, the only correct version of a multilateral approach.’’Moscow offered a “unifying agenda’’ where G20 is the only mechanism outside the UNSC where it is still possible to come to terms based on a balance of interests.Lavrov pointed out that it represented the G7, the BRICS countries and the states that share the philosophy of BRICS than that of the G7 (Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Argentina, Indonesia and Egypt).“Poles” like Russia and China are unlikely to be subordinate to it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-a-new-game-with-india-undermining-ties-with-russia-lavrov-181970
09-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt approves setting up of public Wi-Fi networks through PM-WANI to push broadband proliferation||In a bid to fuel broadband internet proliferation across the country, the government on Wednesday approved setting up of public Wi-Fi networks and access points by local Kirana and neighbourhood shops through public data offices that will not involve any licence, fee or registration.The public Wi-Fi Access Network Interface will be known as PM-WANI, and it promises to unleash a massive Wi-Fi revolution in the country.The Cabinet approved setting up of these public Wi-Fi Networks with an architecture involving multiple players—Public Data Office (PDO), Public Data Office Aggregators and app providers."No licence, no registration, and no fee would be applicable for the PDOs, which could be small shops or even Common Service Centres," Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters after the meeting of the Cabinet.Public Data Office (PDO) will establish, maintain and operate Wi-Fi access points and deliver broadband services to subscribers, while Public Data Office Aggregator (PDOA) will act as an aggregator of PDOs and perform the functions relating to authorisation and accounting.App provider will be responsible for developing application to register users and discover WANI compliant Wi-Fi hotspots in the nearby area and display the same within the app for accessing the internet service.A Central Registry will maintain the details of app providers, PDOAs, and PDOs."To begin with, the Central Registry will be maintained by C-DoT," an official release said.No registration would be required for PDOs, while PDOAs and app providers will get themselves registered with the telecom department through the online registration portal without paying any fee. The registration will be granted within seven days of applying."This is expected to be more business-friendly and in line with efforts for ease of doing business. COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated delivery of stable and high-speed Broadband Internet (data) services to an increasingly large number of subscribers in the country, including areas which do not have 4G mobile coverage. This can be achieved by deployment of Public Wi-Fi," the release said.Further, the proliferation of public Wi-Fi will not only create employment but enhance disposable income in the hands of small and medium entrepreneurs and boost GDP (gross domestic product) of the country, it added.Former Trai Chairman R S Sharma tweeted that the WANI project—which was recommended by the telecom regulator—would create millions of inter-operable Wi-Fi hotspots in the country, and democratise the content distribution and broadband access to millions at affordable rates."This will be the UPI of connectivity services," Sharma tweeted.Industry thinktank Broadband India Forum said it has consistently supported this "vital measure" for enabling unlicensed entities to deliver Wi-Fi services at the grassroots level. It would help boost broadband proliferation across the nation significantly, converting the people into digital citizens, BIF said."At the same time, this will also lead to explosive growth in business and employment opportunities for small local or village-level entrepreneurs, the Kirana stores, tea-shops, etc, especially in rural areas; thereby propelling socio-economic development and inclusion, as well as rural digital connectivity," TV Ramachandran, President of Broadband India Forum, said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-approves-setting-up-of-public-wi-fi-networks-through-pm-wani-to-push-broadband-proliferation-181969

09-12-2020||---||Haryana among 9 states eligible to borrow more||New Delhi, December 9The government has given permission to nine states, including Haryana, to borrow Rs 23,523 crore from the market as they had fulfilled one condition set by the Centre to become eligible to take loans.Nine states—Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, Tripura and UP – had completed reforms in the Public Distribution System. The states undertook three major initiatives in this regard: they seeded the Aadhaar numbers with all ration cards, biometrically authenticated beneficiaries and automated all Fair Price Shops (FPS).Haryana has been allowed to borrow Rs 2,146 crore while UP will borrow the maximum of Rs 4,851 crore.It all began when the pandemic-induced lockdown led to a sharp fall in states’ incomes. The Centre allowed them to take debt up to 2 per cent of their respective Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in 2020-21. Of this 2 per cent, 0.25 per cent of the borrowing by states was linked to their implementing some major components of the “One Nation One Ration Card” system.The Centre said it linked a part of the additional borrowing to states carrying out reforms in those sectors that are critical for service delivery to citizens. This linkage will ensure long-term debt sustainability and prevent any adverse impact on future, it argues.Work on this project began over two years back with the Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS) and a nation-wide roll-out was announced in May this year by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.An official news release said this step has enabled states to mobilise additional financial resources to fight the pandemic and improve the standards of service delivery to the public. After all states implement this system, migrant workers and their families as well as beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and other welfare schemes will be able to get ration from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) in the country.The intended reform will also better target beneficiaries, and eliminate duplicate or ineligible ration cards and thus enhance welfare and reduce leakage, said an official news release.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/haryana-among-9-states-eligible-to-borrow-more-181961

09-12-2020||New Delhi||Ready to give written assurance on continuing MSP: Govt's proposal to agitating farmers||As thousands of farmers continue to protest at various borders of the national capital demanding the repeal of three new farm laws, the government on Wednesday proposed to give a “written assurance” that the existing Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime for procurement would continue.However, the farmers’ unions rejected the proposal and said they would intensify their agitation until the government accepts their demand for a complete repeal of the three laws.The government also proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues, including one to allay fears about the weakening of the mandi system.Also read: Farmers’ unions reject Centre’s proposal, stir to continue5 Opposition leaders meet Prez Kovind seeking repeal of farm lawsAs farmers reject conciliatory proposals, BJP-led Centre in Catch-22 situationTomar meets Shah after protesting farmers reject govt’s draft proposalIn a draft proposal sent to 13 agitating farmer unions, the government also said it is ready to provide all necessary clarifications on their concerns about the new farm laws enacted in September, but it did not mention anything about the main demand of protesting farmers for the repeal of the laws.Separately, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said at a post-Cabinet media briefing that the government was sensitive to the concerns of farmers as he expressed hope that ongoing deliberations with them, which he termed a “work in progress”, over the three agriculture-related laws will yield some results soon.He said the government had held several rounds of talks with the farmers agitating against the three legislations and was keen to resolve their issues.Home Minister Amit Shah in Tuesday night’s meeting with 13 union leaders had said the government would send a draft proposal on key issues raised by the farmers regarding the three farm laws, even though the meeting had failed to break the ice with farm union leaders who are insisting for repealing these laws.The sixth round of talks between the government and farm union leaders, which was scheduled for Wednesday morning, has also been cancelled.In the proposal, sent by Agriculture Ministry Joint Secretary Vivek Aggarwal, the government said is ready to consider with an open heart the objections which farmers have on the new farm laws.“The government has tried to address the concerns of farmers with an open heart and with respect for the farming community of the country. The government appeals the Kisan unions to end their agitation,” it said.On farmers’ fears that mandis would weaken after the new laws, the government said an amendment could be made wherein state governments could register the traders operating outside mandis. States can also impose tax and cess as they used in the APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) mandis on them.On concerns that farmers may be duped as anyone having just a pan card is allowed to trade outside APMC mandis, the government said to rule out such apprehensions, the state governments could be given the power to register such traders and make rules keeping in mind the local situation of farmers.On the issue of farmers not getting the right to appeal in civil courts for dispute resolution, the government said it is open to making an amendment to provide for an appeal in civil courts. Currently, the dispute resolution is at SDM level.On fears that big corporates will take over farmlands, the government said it had already been made clear in the laws, but still, for clarity’s sake, it can be written that no buyer can take loans against farmland nor any such condition will be made to farmers.On attaching farmland under contract farming, the government said the existing provision was clear but still it can be clarified further if required.On fear about the scrapping of the MSP regime and shifting of trade to private players, the government said it is ready to give a written assurance that the existing MSP will continue.On demands to scrap the proposed Electricity Amendment bill 2020, the government said there won’t be any change in the existing system of electricity bill payment for farmers.On farmers’ demand to scrap the Air Quality Management of NCR Ordinance 2020, under which there is the provision of penalty for stubble burning, the government said it is ready to find an appropriate solution.The draft proposal has been sent to 13 farm union leaders including Joginder Singh Urgrahan of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), one of the biggest among nearly 40 agitating unions.“Farmer unions have received the draft proposal from the government,” Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait told PTI. He is one of the many union leaders participating in the ongoing negotiations with the government.The government has proposed seven amendments in the two new laws -- The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020.However, it has not touched The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 at all.The government said India can achieve food security only with the hard work of farmers.“During the Green Revolution, farmers of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh had played a big role. To ensure food security, buying grains at MSP is the government’s priority,” it noted.The government further said the new laws were enacted to give more options for farmers to sell their produce along with the existing mandis so that farmers are able to get a better price and are able to grow high-end crops for that market. The idea was to give farmers the freedom to sell their produce like other producers.On farmers’ demand to provide registration of farming contracts, the government said till state governments make an arrangement for registration, an appropriate facility will be provided at the SDM office wherein a copy of the contract can be submitted 30 days after its signing.On Constitutional validity of farm laws, the Centre said it has the power under Entry 33 of the Concurrent List to pass laws on contract farming and intra- and inter-state trade, and prohibit states from imposing fees/cess outside APMC areas. It had followed legal provisions while enacting the laws and earlier for bringing ordinances, it added.

09-12-2020||New Delhi||AAP claims Kejriwal's movement still 'restricted', Delhi Police deny claim||The AAP on Wednesday alleged that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s movement was still “restricted” and the main gate of his residence remains closed by the Delhi Police, which denied the charge.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which had on Tuesday alleged that the Delhi Police put Kejriwal under house arrest after he met farmers protesting against the Centre’s agriculture reform laws at the city’s Singhu border, again claimed that it was being done at the behest of Union Minister Amit Shah.The Delhi Police had rejected AAP’s charge against it as “totally baseless”.Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said there was an atmosphere of “undeclared emergency” around the Chief Minister’s residence.“I am telling you with full responsibility that the movement of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is still restricted at the behest of the (Union) Home Minister. The main gate of the chief minister’s residence is still closed,” Chadha alleged.“In a way, there is an atmosphere of undeclared emergency. All this, just because we did not allow the stadiums to be converted into prisons for farmers,” he alleged.A senior police officer said there was no restriction on any kind of movement of the Chief Minister.“The police deployment outside the Chief Minister’s residence is part of security protocol,” he said.According to police sources, Kejriwal left his residence around 11 am to attend a programme.Chadha claimed that Kejriwal’s residence was still not fully opened and one door continued to remain closed because of Delhi police.“The entrance that everyone uses to enter the CM’s residence and meet him, remains closed even now. Access to that entrance has been blocked as four to five members of the BJP are camping outside the CM’s residence, with active assistance from Delhi police,” he alleged.“The CM’s right to free movement, which is a fundamental right, has been curtailed,” Chadha said.The BJP had on Tuesday accused Kejriwal of indulging in politics of “lies and deceit” after the Delhi police denied the AAP’s allegations.Chadha alleged: “This act of putting him under house arrest is purely an act of revenge because Arvind Kejriwal supported the farmers, because he made arrangements for toilets, water, warm clothes, food for them.”On Tuesday, Kejriwal came out of his residence after hours of drama outside.Addressing party workers, he said the Centre tried its best to ensure that he did not step out.The CM said if he was not stopped, he would have gone and supported farmers in their Bharat Bandh.Kejriwal claimed the Centre was “very angry” as his government did not allow Delhi stadiums to be used as prisons for farmers.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws.The Centre’s offer to amend the contentious laws has failed to cut ice with the protesting farmers who have stuck to their demand for a repeal of the legislation.Meanwhile, mayors and leaders of the BJP-ruled municipal corporations continued their sit-in outside Kejriwal’s residence for the third day on Wednesday, with party MPs Manoj Tiwari and Gautam Gambhir joining the protest.They are demanding payment of “unpaid” dues of Rs 13,000 crore from the Delhi government.Mayors of North, South and East Delhi Municipal Corporations, Jai Prakash, Anamika Mithilesh and Nirmal Jain, accompanied by many women councillors, have been sitting outside Kejriwal’s Flagstaff Road residence since Monday.

09-12-2020||New Delhi||SC seeks reply from Centre, states on Covid guidelines, fire safety in hospitals||The Supreme Court Wednesday sought "detailed" response from the Centre as well as states on issues ranging from adhering to COVID-19 guidelines on wearing of face masks and social distancing norms to implementation of fire safety guidelines in hospitals and nursing homes across India.Also read: SC takes note of Centre's guidelines, says posters not to be affixed outside homes of COVID patientsThe top court was hearing a suo motu case registered by it to ensure proper treatment of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and dignified handling of dead bodies there.Recently, it also took cognisance of the fire incident in a designated COVID-19 hospital in Gujarat's Rajkot in which several patients had died, raising the issue of lack of proper fire safety measures in hospitals across the country.  A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and the Gujarat government, to file detailed affidavits within three days on the issues such as enforcing of COVID-19 guidelines and fire safety measures in hospitals and nursing homes.  The bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, directed the states as well to file affidavits by Friday on steps taken on these issues and fixed the suo motu case for hearing on December 14.  The bench directed that the Justice (Retd.) DA Mehta committee will probe the Ahmedabad fire incident, besides the fire tragedy at a COVID-19 hospital at Rajkot which is already being inquired into by the panel.At the outset, the law officer said he would request the Gujarat government to appoint a judge to probe the fire incidents in hospitals if the apex court suggests any name to head such an inquiry.  "It is upon the discretion of this court," Mehta said.Mehta said the Centre has asked all the states and Union Territories (UTs) to send a status report on the implementation of fire safety guidelines to prevent recurrence of fire incidents in hospitals and nursing homes.A detailed report on fire safety would be prepared after getting the inputs from states, he said.The bench then asked about the fire safety audit of Gujarat and hospitals there and said as to how many nodal officers have been appointed.  It then enquired about the steps taken to enforce the COVID-19 guidelines on wearing of face masks in public and adhering to the social distancing norms.  "You file a detailed affidavit giving all steps taken," it said.  Earlier, the apex court had said that people are violating “with impunity” the COVID-19 guidelines on wearing of face masks at public places and are not adhering to social distancing norms.It had pulled up the authorities for not ensuring strict compliance of these measures to contain coronavirus and had asked the Centre and states to give suggestions so that appropriate directions can be issued to implement these guidelines.The top court had however stayed the Gujarat High Court direction to send people caught without wearing masks to do community service at the COVID-19 patient care facilities.It had taken note of the submissions of the Gujarat government that the order was harsh, having serious repercussions on the health of the violators.The top court had asked the Gujarat government to strictly enforce the COVID-19 guidelines.  The apex court had also expressed concern over the spurt in the number COVID-19 cases across the country.

09-12-2020||United Nations||Let's pay homage to 3 million killed, 2 lakh women raped by Pak Army in 1971: India's Ambassador to UN||As the UN marks International Day of Victims of Genocide on Wednesday, India called for paying homage to the three million people killed and hundreds of thousands of women raped by the Pakistan Army and religious militias in the 1971 Liberation War, describing it the "most horrific episode in human history".The war in 1971 began after the sudden crackdown at midnight on March 25 that year in erstwhile East Pakistan by Pakistani troops and ended on December 16 as Pakistan conceded defeat and unconditionally surrendered in Dhaka to the allied forces comprising Bengali freedom fighters and the Indian Army.Officially, three million people were killed during the nine-month-long war."UN International Day of Victims of Genocide on 9 Dec. Let's pay homage to 3 million killed & 200,000 or more women raped in erstwhile East Pakistan by the Pakistan army & religious militias in 1971 in most horrific episode in human history. Never again,” India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti tweeted, with the hashtag #PreventGenocide.The International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the Prevention of this Crime is observed on December 9.In his message, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said genocide was the most heinous of crimes, encompassing all it touches in a tsunami of hate and destruction."It is an assault on our most fundamental shared values," he said.The Genocide Convention, adopted in December 1948 in the aftermath of the Holocaust and World War II, was the first human rights treaty adopted by the General Assembly, he said, adding that it remains as relevant as ever."We work to prevent genocide and other atrocity crimes — crimes which are sadly still being perpetrated with impunity and no regard for the sanctity of human life," Guterres said.During her address to the UN General Assembly in September 2017, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Pakistan's Army had launched a "heinous" military operation in 1971 which triggered a "genocide" during the liberation war, killing three million innocent people."In the 1971 war of liberation, we endured an extreme form of genocide. In the nine-month-long war of liberation against Pakistan, three million innocent people were killed and more than 2,00,000 women were violated," Hasina said."The Pakistan military launched the heinous 'Operation Searchlight' on 25 March, which was the beginning of the 1971 genocide. The 1971 genocide included targeted elimination of individuals on the grounds of religion, race and political belief. The intellectuals were killed brutally," Hasina had said.

09-12-2020||---||India escapes US watch list, Pak sanctions on religious freedom issues||New Delhi, December 9US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s intervention led to Pakistan escaping sanctions for lack of religious freedom and India stopped from being listed on a Special Watch List, said US Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, Samuel Brownback.“There were several recommendations that the Secretary [Pomoeo] did not follow, and this was one of them,” he said about keeping India away from the Countries of Particular Concern (CPC) list.The US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) had recommended that India be put in the CPC list because of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).Brownback said the US had privately discussed these issues with the Indian government at a high level, and will continue to get raised. Pompeo is “well aware” of the statute (CAA) and the issues associated with the Modi government. And as I said, he’s raised it at the highest levels, but just decided at this point in time not to place them on a CPC or a Special Watch List,” he said during a briefing on rollout of US action against religious freedom violators.Though Brownback was critical of India, he did not get baited by a question posed by a Pakistani-origin journalist who wanted to know why Pakistan was on CPC and India was not.Brownback conceded that in India, some of the violence was carried out by the government but a lot of the actions are by the government in Pakistan.  Also, Pakistan has half of the world’s people that are locked up for apostasy or blasphemy. “And we just had a really difficult webinar this morning on forced brides into China, and one of the source places is Pakistan religious minorities. Christians and Hindu women being marketed as concubines or forced brides into China because there’s not effective support, and then there’s discrimination against the religious minorities that make them more vulnerable,” he said.And that doesn’t mean that India doesn’t have problems.  The CAA is a problem and so is the violence. “We’ll continue to raise those issues, but those are some of the basis as to why Pakistan continues to be on the CPC list and India is not.”The CPC list besides Pakistan includes China, Myanmar, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Nigeria. The Special Watch List has Russia, Comoros, Cuba and Nicaragua.Sudan and Uzbekistan have been taken out of the lists.Waiver from sanctions has been given to Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan because “there were important national interests of the US requiring the exercise of the waiver authority”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-escapes-us-watch-list-pak-sanctions-on-religious-freedom-issues-181928
09-12-2020||New Delhi||SC takes note of Centre's guidelines, says posters not to be affixed outside homes of COVID patients||The Supreme Court on Wednesday took note of the Centre's guidelines and said posters and signages should not be affixed by authorities outside homes of COVID-19 patients in the country.The apex court, however, added that such posters can be affixed only in specific cases when the competent authority issues specific directions under the Disaster Management Act.Also read: SC seeks reply from Centre, states on Covid guidelines, fire safety in hospitalsA bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said this in its verdict on a plea seeking directions to do away with the practice of pasting posters outside homes of those infected by  coronavirus.The bench, also comprising justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, disposed of the plea, saying the Centre has already issued guidelines, and therefore, states and union territories should not affix such posters.The Centre had earlier told the top court that its guidelines do not contain any instructions regarding affixing posters and signages outside homes of COVID-19 patients, and there cannot be any stigma attached to it.The bench had reserved its judgement on the plea on December 3. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had on December 3 referred to the affidavit filed in the apex court by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and told the bench that guidelines do not require any such affixation of posters.The counsel appearing for petitioner Kush Kalra had told the apex court that there are no such instructions in the guidelines to affix posters outside the home of those found COVID positive but the “reality is very different”.While hearing the matter on December 1, the top court had observed that once posters or signages are pasted outside the homes of COVID patients, the people affected are treated as "untouchables", reflecting a different "ground reality".In its affidavit, the ministry had said that “its guidelines do not contain any instructions or guidance regarding affixing of posters or other signage outside the residences of those found COVID positive”. Mehta had told the bench that the Centre has not prescribed this practice and some states might be pursuing it on their own to prevent the spread of the virus. The apex court had earlier asked the Centre to consider issuing guidelines to do away with practice of pasting posters outside the homes of COVID-19 patients.It had directed so without issuing any formal notice to the Centre on Kalra's plea seeking framing of guidelines in this regard.In its affidavit, the ministry has said that all states have been intimated to this effect that the MoHFW has not issued any such guideline to identify COVID-19 patients.“The Central government, through MoHFW has already communicated to the Additional Chief Secretaries ...secretaries (Health) of all the states and UTs pointing it out that the MoHFW guidelines do not contain any instructions or guidance regarding affixing of posters or other signage outside the residences of those found COVID-19 positive,” the affidavit said.On November 3, the Delhi government had told the high court that it has instructed all its officials not to paste posters outside homes of COVID-19 positive persons or those in home isolation; and the ones pasted have been ordered to be removed.Kalra, in his plea before the high court, had contended that names of persons who tested positive for COVID-19 were being freely circulated to the Resident Welfare Associations and on WhatsApp groups and this was "leading to stigmatisation and drawing of unnecessary attention".

09-12-2020||Washington||Unsurprising that India's farmers are worried about agricultural reforms: US lawmaker||In the midst of a global pandemic, it is unsurprising that India's farmers are worried about the impact of the recent agricultural reforms, a top American lawmaker has said, coming out in support of the agitating farmers who have been protesting against the new farm laws.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September.Dubbing these laws as "anti-farmer", these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislation would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture."In the midst of a global pandemic, it's unsurprising that India's farmers are worried about the impact of recent agricultural reforms. As we know from our own experience in the US, citizens have every right to protest peaceably, be accommodated and their concerns listened to," Congressman Brad Sherman, Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, said on Tuesday."As chair of the Caucus on India & Indian Americans, I've proudly championed the close partnership between the world's largest and oldest democracies. It's a partnership built on both interests and values, including a shared dedication to human rights and freedom of speech," he said in a series of tweets.India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and politicians on protests by farmers as "ill-informed" and "unwarranted", asserting that the matter pertains to the internal affairs of a democratic country."The farmers yearning to be heard are another powerful example of how peaceful protest is just one of the many cherished democratic traditions binding our countries together," Sharman said.Congressman-elect David G Valadao also supported Indian farmers."As farmers peacefully make their voices heard, the Government of India has a responsibility to allow their citizens to exercise this right to assemble," Valadao said.Farmer leaders have been firm on their demand for the repeal of three new farm laws. They have claimed that the laws will benefit corporates and end the mandi system and the minimum support price (MSP) regime.The government has maintained that it is committed to the welfare of farmers and have presented these laws as major reforms for their benefits.A late-night meeting called by Home Minister Amit Shah ended in failure on Tuesday as farmer leaders rejected the government's offer to amend new farm laws, saying they would settle for nothing less than the scrapping of the legislations, while many of them threatened to boycott Wednesday's scheduled talks with ministers.

This was driven by the July potential sale of USD 23.11 billion worth of F-35 aircraft to Japan, which was the second largest single FMS notification ever authorised by the Department of State,” Cooper said.The Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), which is the Department of State-authorised commercial export licenses, totalled USD 124.3 billion in fiscal year 2020, and this was up from USD 114.7 billion in fiscal year 2019, he said. "This represented an 8.4 per cent increase. This total value covers authorisations of hardware, defense services, and technical data. The total number of licences issued decreased by 20-per cent from 36,111 in Fiscal Year 2019 to 28,800 in Fiscal Year 2020," Cooper said.The top commercial DCS notified to Congress in Fiscal Year 2020 included a USD 8.39 billion sale to Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom for F-35 components.This also included a USD 3.2 billion sale to Australia for P-8 aircraft parts, and a USD 2.48 billion sale to United Kingdom and Australia for E-7 airborne early warning and control aircraft, Cooper said.

09-12-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Defence Ministry stops ‘illegal’ pay cut of troops||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 8The Ministry of Defence has stopped the practice of deducting one-third salary of the jawans and junior commissioned officers in case there was “no reporting” about any “occurrence” about the career or life of troops within 10 months.The Defence Ministry has told the accounts wing, which is known as Controller General Defence Accounts (CGDA), that these deductions were being done “without any government sanction or order”.The CGDA has issued instructions in November to its various offices to comply with the instructions.Thousands of troops in the 13 lakh Army faced this every year and it took months to be rectified and the salary to be restored.The Department of Military Affairs (DMA), which was created in January this year and headed by Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, had taken up the matter and asked the CGDA to show any letter authorising such a deduction.The deduction was being done by the CGDA in case the Commanding Officer of unit (Colonel-level officer) did not report any “occurrence” for 10 months.Sources told The Tribune that the “occurrence” includes promotions, illness, leave, official movement, postings, leave for marriage, birth of child, missing in action, battle casualty and absent without leave.In case there was none of listed “occurrences” in the career or the life of a jawan, the Commanding Officer need not initiate the report which is called “Part-II” report is Army parlance. “Part-I” report pertains to daily work order of the jawan. There would be several instances for the unit where several jawans were just deployed and did not do anything or face anything which merited an “occurrence” to be reported.Why the CGDA started deducting salaries when the ‘Part-II’ report was not made is still unclear. The MoD makes it clear that the Commanding Officer or his superiors will face action in case they fail to initiate a report of battle casualties or for those missing in action or those absent with leave.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defence-ministry-stops-illegal-pay-cut-of-troops-181829

09-12-2020||---||Laws don’t reflect reforms: Hooda||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 8Former Haryana Chief Minister and Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda today said there was a need for agricultural reforms, but the current farm laws did not reflect any reform and needed to be scrapped.He said the farm laws were passed in Parliament this September without any consultations with the stakeholders and therefore the Centre must call a parliament session, repeal these laws and start the reform process afresh.“We are not against reforms, but the current laws must be repealed and fresh reform process initiated after consultations with stakeholders,” the former Haryana Chief Minister today said, addressing reporters at the AICC headquarters here.On the issue of 2019 Congress manifesto promising to abolish the APMC Act, a matter flagged by minister Ravi Shankar Prasad yesterday, Hooda said the BJP was “misrepresenting facts”.“We promised to improve logistics and then initiate reform. We said we will take the mandis near the farmers and in Haryana we did that. In my own village we have set up purchase centres at every 10 km,” he said.The senior leader said there was a need for farm reforms, but “there is no reflection of reforms in the current agriculture laws”.He said the government must call the Parliament session to bring reforms and discuss future reforms with farmers. He questioned the government on why it didn’t agree to the opposition demand to bring a fourth law providing to punish anyone who buys below MSP.Hooda also said the Haryana Government had lost the trust of the people and the Assembly due to “mishandling” of the farmers’ agitation and should face a vote of no-confidence.Insisting that the Bharat bandh was successful and peaceful today, Hooda urged the Haryana Governor to call an emergency session of the state Assembly and allow a floor test.“Seven of the 10 MLAs of BJP ally JJP have dissociated from the government on the farmers’ issue and three independents have also done so. The government is in minority and we will move a no-confidence vote on it the day a session is called,” he said.On Bharat bandh, Hooda said no political party was leading the agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/laws-dont-reflect-reforms-hooda-181831

We urge people to trust our institutions when they say a certain vaccine is safe. There should be no doubt after that,” VK Paul, chairman, National Expert Group on Covid Vaccine Administration said today with Congress veteran Anand Sharma asking how the regulator accepted applications from Pfizer (which has not conducted any trial for their vaccine in India) and Bharat Biotech (which hasn’t shared any phase 3 trial data so far).Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, however, cited New Clinical Trial Rules-2019 to say these allow “relaxations, omissions, abbreviation, deferment of data, including local clinical trials” in emergencies like a pandemic.The government, meanwhile, said preparations for vaccine rollout were in final stages and “everyone who needs a vaccine will get one, but three categories will be inoculated first.”The expert group has recommended inclusion of one crore health workers, two crore frontline workers (personnel of police, armed forces, home guard, disaster management volunteers and municipal workers) and 27 crore people who are above 50 years of age or those with comorbid conditions even if they are below 50 years of age.The government will take a final call on priority groups for inoculation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/licence-for-some-vaccines-in-a-few-weeks-181764
