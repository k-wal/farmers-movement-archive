Bhadauria on Tuesday said Pakistan is becoming a pawn in Chinese policy and Beijing could use it to enter Afghanistan after the exit of US forces.In his remarks during a webinar explaining the objectives behind China's aggression in Ladakh, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said: "Pakistan is increasingly becoming a pawn in Chinese policy. Under the increased CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) debt trap, we are going to further witness (its) military dependency."About China using Pakistan to gain entry into the war-torn Afghanistan after the exit of US forces, he said: "US exit from Afghanistan has opened options for China in the region, both direct and through Pakistan, allowing it entry into Central Asia, a region they have been eyeing for long."On the Chinese aggression this year in Ladakh, he said China is trying to dominate the region.India and China are engaged in nine month standoff in Ladakh."China's aspirations are on the global front and regional domination is a part of the route. Any serious China-India conflict is not good for China at the global front and does not suit their goal," he said.The IAF chief also explained about the possible objectives for China to engage in a military standoff and change the status quo in Ladakh, saying that it could be military signalling or domination efforts with adequate escalation control."Was it deployment and training of their western theatre forces in a war like scenario where Galwan was an overreach or was it to fine tune and enhance their military technologies and fill the gaps or it could be planned to start border talks for new positions or was it just a misadventure that got escalated," he asked.He also said India need to maintain effective capabilities to counter any misadventure, if a situation so arises."Our western border is active since the establishment of Pakistan, now new fronts, areas are also active," he said.

29-12-2020||London||UK court extends Nirav Modi’s remand till January 7||Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, wanted in connection with the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, was on Tuesday further remanded in custody until January 7 by a UK court hearing his extradition case.The 49-year-old businessman, who has been behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest last year following India’s extradition request for him, appeared via videolink for a routine 28-day remand hearing on Tuesday before Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London.The final hearings in the extradition case are scheduled over two days, on January 7 and 8 next year, when District Judge Samuel Goozee is scheduled to hear closing arguments from both sides before he hands down his judgment a few weeks later.At the last full hearing in the case in November, Judge Goozee heard the arguments for and against the admissibility of certain witness statements provided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) and ruled that the evidence to establish a prima facie case of fraud and money laundering against the fugitive diamantaire is broadly admissible.He concluded that he considered himself “bound” by the previous UK court rulings in the extradition case of former Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, had stressed that the evidence, including witness statements under Section 161 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), meets the required threshold for the UK court to determine whether Modi has a case to answer before the Indian judicial system.“The argument that this is a very specific case, distinguishable from Mallya is frankly nonsense,” said CPS barrister Helen Malcolm.That Mallya has a case to answer in India in his fraud and money laundering case has cleared various levels of the UK judicial system and is currently undergoing a “confidential” legal issue before UK Home Secretary Priti Patel can consider signing off on his extradition.Modi’s barrister, Clare Montgomery, who was also the defence counsel in Mallya’s case, however, disputed that the Section 161 witness statements qualify as similar.“The government of India case is not as strong as it was in Mallya,” said Montgomery, as she also raised a specific issue over a witness who was said to speak no English in his testimony for the CBI but signed a statement in English for the ED.Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of “Letters of Understanding” (LoUs or loan agreements), and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.He also faces two additional charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” added to the CBI case.The jeweller has been in prison since he was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard and his attempts at seeking bail have been repeatedly turned down.The charges against him centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by PNB or LoUs.The CPS, on behalf of India, have told the court during the course of two separate set of hearings in May and September that a number of PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure the LoUs were issued to his companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions.Modi’s defence team has sought to counter allegations of fraud by deposing witnesses to establish the volatility of the gems and jewellery trade and that the LoUs were standard practice. His severe depression has also been raised as part of the arguments against extradition. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-court-extends-nirav-modis-remand-till-january-7-191082

29-12-2020||Mathura (UP)||Hema Malini pitches for farm laws||Actor-politician Hema Malini on Tuesday pitched for the three new agri-marketing laws, saying the Narendra Modi government has now given farmers more options to sell their crops.“Ever since the BJP-led government came to power, it is making every effort to increase the farmer's income,” Mathura's BJP MP told reporters through a video link. Earlier, she also talked to officials here through video conferencing.Chanting the “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” slogan, Hema Malini praised both soldiers and farmers.She appealed to farmers and their unions to give up their protest over the new farm laws and sit across the table with the government to remove their apprehensions.She asked them to have faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him their well-wisher.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are camping at Delhi's borders over the agri-marketing laws enacted at the Centre.Farmer unions claim the laws will end up eroding the minimum support price (MSP) system. But the government says the MSP will stay and the laws give farmer more options to sell their produce.“I am proud of the farmers of Brijbhumi for joining hands with the farmers of the country who are lauding reforms by the Union government,” she said, implying that the farmers in her constituency were not against the controversial laws.She condemned the “politics” played over the new laws by the opposition. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hema-malini-pitches-for-farm-laws-191075
29-12-2020||New Delhi||Green jalebi, marriage procession: Farmers look at unique ways to grab eyeballs||Serving 'green jalebis' to taking out a 'baraat' (wedding procession), farmers protesting at Singhu border here are using innovative ways to communicate their grievances and demands to the central government.A group of farmers from Mohali in Punjab have been serving special green jalebis (sweet), saying it symbolised the colour of their crops and the prosperity associated with it."We have been distributing green jalebis from the last few days. Nearly five quintals of the sweet are distributed everyday," Jasvir Chand, a protesting farmer, said."The green colour of the sweet symbolises Green Revolution as well as peace and tranquillity," Chand's companion Baldev Singh (65) said at the protest site."We have been peacefully protesting against the three new farm laws of the central government for over a month. Although the government has not accepted our demand, we are determined to continue the protest peacefully," he said.Notably, many curious people queued up to taste the 'green jalebi' which is usually available in golden colour.Meanwhile, some youths from Karnal in Haryana took out a marriage procession at the protest venue to draw attention towards their agitation."We thought a marriage procession will be an interesting way to communicate to the people and the government our demands and issues with the farm laws," said 22-year-old Jagdip Singh from Dabri village in Karnal.The procession with a protester wearing the full attire of a groom and sitting on a tractor passed through the crowded highway attracting lot of merriment from the protesting farmers camping there for over a month.Farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been camping at different border points of Delhi for over a month to demand repeal of the three agriculture laws, which were voted through in Parliament in September amid strong protests by opposition parties."We are requesting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government to give legal status to minimum support price (MSP) to empower the farmers. The government should also address our genuine concerns over the three farm laws," Chand said."If anyone is employed by the government, his salary is regularly revised, similarly there should be legally guaranteed purchase of crops since farmers invest not only their hard work, but also whatever scarce resources are there at their disposal," he said.The new farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.--- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/green-jalebi-marriage-procession-farmers-look-at-unique-ways-to-grab-eyeballs-191074
29-12-2020||Hyderabad||Ordinances against religious conversions in BJP ruled states violate Constitution: Owaisi||AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday hit out at BJP governments for bringing ordinances against religious conversion through fraudulent means, including those for the sake of marriage, claiming these violated the fundamental rights under the Constitution.He also described the Centre's agri-marketing acts as 'draconian' and dared the Narendra Modi government to come out with laws on providing minimum support price (MSP) to the farmers, employment and unemployment dole.Owaisi said an adult could marry anyone they want and alleged the intention of the BJP in bringing such laws against religious conversions was to make a mockery of the Constitution.He was referring to recent promulgation of an ordinance by the Uttar Pradesh Government against forcible or 'dishonest' religious conversions and the Madhya Pradesh cabinet giving its nod for a similar measure on Tuesday."These laws and ordinances issued and given nod by some BJP ruled states are against the Constitution and the BJP is creating an atmosphere of hate for the Muslim community," the Hyderabad MP told reporters here.He claimed that such laws were a blatant violation of Article 14, 21 and 25 of the Constitution related to right to equality, right to life and personal liberty and right to freedom of religion respectively."I challenge the BJP that why you don’t make a law on providing MSP to the farmers that is the need of the hour.“For so many weeks thousands of farmers are protesting on the outskirts of Delhi against the draconian laws passed by the Modi government,” he said.Instead of doing it, they (the BJP) were bringing these ordinances against religious conversions, claimed Owaisi.He welcomed the Allahabad High Court order quashing an FIR against a Muslim man over a marriage with a Hindu woman and ruling that she had a right to live her life on her own terms.The court has clearly reiterated that no government has any role to play in the personal life of an Indian citizen, he said, adding the Supreme Court had also given a similar ruling.Replying to a question, Owaisi said his party would fight elections be it local body polls in Madhya Pradesh or in Gujarat or other places.

29-12-2020||Chandigarh||Yamuna pollution: NGT’s monitoring committee pulls up Haryana over not paying environmental compensation||The National Green Tribunal (NGT)’s Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) has passed strictures against Haryana government over not naming erring officers for the delay in setting up new Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and operational deficiencies in the existing ones, and not paying environmental compensation.In its fifth report, submitted to the NGT, the YMC has pointed out that Haryana government has not complied to the directions of the NGT dated September 11, 2019.The order had called for Rs 5 lakh per month per STP compensation to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for not able to fix operational deficiency within three months. Regarding the STPs under construction, it was ordered to deposit Rs 10 lakh per month per an incomplete STP after July 1 of this year along with Rs 10 lakh per month for discharging untreated effluent.Also, with regard to the situation where works with regard to STP, sewerage network and its connectivity had not started, Haryana government was ordered to pay compensation at the rate of Rs 10 lakh per month per STP, sewerage network and its connectivity after December 31 of this year.“It will be open to Govt. of Haryana to recover the said amount from erring officers/contractors,” the NGT had said.The Chief Secretary was ordered to identify officials.“We have held meetings and collected details from all stakeholder departments and have submitted comments to the Chief Secretary for final consideration. After that, a reply will be submitted on the report,” said S. Narayanan, Member Secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB).Now, in its fifth report, where a chapter is dedicated to lapses on the part of Haryana, the YMC says that 24 STPs, having 763.5 MLD capacity, in Yamunanagar, Panipat, Sonipat, Rohtak, Bahadurgarh, Gurugram, Faridabad and Palwal were randomly checked where 16 STPs, having 452.5 MLD capacity, were found not complying the standards; thus the complying status given by the government departments were incorrect.It adds that “the officers of HSPCB being the regulatory authority are not performing their duty assigned under the Provision of Water Act, 1974/Environment Protection Act (EPA) 1986”.On the same lines, 12 Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) were randomly checked and all were found non-complying.“The Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) is constructing the CETPs without considering the effluent characteristics of the industries operating in the Industrial Estate. This is the only reason for poor efficacy of the existing CETPs,” said the YMC.It has been pointed out that 66 MLD untreated industrial and domestic effluent is being discharged from Jagadhri-Yamunanagar township to ditch drain for which neither the Municipal Corporation, Yamunanagar nor the Public Health Engineering Department is taking responsibility.In Sonipat, none of four CETPs and three STPs is functioning properly. In Faridabad, there is no functional STP in the town; 210 MLD of untreated domestic effluent is being discharged to the Yamuna through Budia Nalaha and Gounchi Drain.The construction work of seven CETPs at Faridabad, Gurugram and Yamunanagar have not yet started. Septage management in all major townships is not being followed; adding a significant amount of pollutants to the Yamuna through 11 major drains. The online monitoring devices for checking discharge of effluents are not calibrated regularly, thus do not reflect the actual status of treatment and HSPCB does not have any mechanism to verify the authenticity of data generated, says YMC.The next date in NGT is on January 27.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yamuna-pollution-ngts-monitoring-committee-pulls-up-haryana-over-not-paying-environmental-compensation-191068

My wife had taken a loan from a friend 10 years ago to purchase a house. Details have been given to the Income-tax (department) and also mentioned in my Raya Sabha affidavit. The ED woke up to this deal after ten years," he told the conference.Sanjay Raut had alleged that central agencies were being used to "destabilise" the Uddhav Thackeray-led government in Maharashtra.The ED had filed a PMLA case to probe the alleged loan fraud in the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank in October last year against Housing Development Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL), its promoters Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan, his son Sarang Wadhawan, its former chairman Waryam Singh and ex-managing director Joy Thomas.It took cognisance of a Mumbai Police economic offences wing FIR against them that charged them for causing "wrongful loss, prima facie to the tune of Rs 4,355 crore to PMC Bank, and corresponding gains to themselves".The Shiv Sena, which is ruling Maharashtra as part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government along with the NCP and Congress, had earlier alleged that the central probe agencies have been targeting them unfairly.Former BJP leader Eknath Khadse who has recently joined Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), has also been summoned by the ED for questioning on Wednesday in Mumbai in connection with a money laundering case linked to a land deal in Pune's Bhosri area. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shiv-sena-leader-sanjay-rauts-wife-again-skips-ed-questioning-in-pmc-bank-money-laundering-case-191053

29-12-2020||Mumbai||Dilip Chhabria’s firm suspected to have cheated several car finance firms: Cops||Car designer Dilip Chhabria’s firm is suspected to have cheated several finance companies by obtaining loans fraudulently, the city police said on Tuesday.The Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai crime branch arrested Chhabria on Monday evening.The alleged scam came to light when the police seized a DC Avanti, a sports-car manufactured by Dilip Chhabria Design Pvt Ltd, in south Mumbai on a tip-off that its registration number was bogus.The car’s owner produced documents which were found to be genuine and showed that it was registered at Chennai.However, another car with same engine and chassis number was found to be registered in Haryana, police said in a release.Probe revealed that loans averaging Rs 42 lakh per car were availed by Dilip Chhabria Design Pvt Ltd for DC Avanti’s manufactured by it in the name of bogus customers, it said.As many as 120 DC Avanti cars have been sold in India and abroad, and at least 90 of them were allegedly used for obtaining loans fraudulently.The cars were on paper hypothecated to the finance firm but were already sold off to customers, the investigators claimed.Various Non-Banking Finance Companies, including BMW Financial Services were duped in this way, police said.The crime branch is now ascertaining the quantum of the loan fraud as well as the loss suffered by the government due to evasion of taxes, officials said.Chhabria, known for selling cars with customised design, has been booked for cheating and forgery, among other charges.

29-12-2020||Justice Madan B Lokur||Judiciary is getting ‘executivised’: Justice Madan B Lokur||How do you see the role of the judiciary in India? What would you expect the constitutional courts to do? Have they performed the role you expect them to?The judiciary is obviously a very important institution in a democracy. I believe the days of an ivory tower judiciary are now over. The judiciary must appreciate this and be proactive in taking forward the constitutional vision of justice – social, economic and political. I expect every judge, not only constitutional courts, to be proactive, without fear or favour, affection or ill will. By and large the judges have performed their role as expected, but I think some of them have been a bit tentative over the last few years.In the recent past, you have been critical of the judiciary in general and the Supreme Court in particular. Why? Please elaborate.I am sorry that by expressing my views, I seem to have conveyed this impression. I have and will continue to have great regard and respect for an independent judiciary. Certain events have transpired over the last few years that have dismayed me. For example, some of us felt that the then Chief Justice of India (CJI) was misusing his authority as Master of the Roster despite being cautioned. Four senior judges of the Supreme Court (including myself) spoke out against it. Matters did improve, but only temporarily. The next CJI went a few steps further down the slope in an unbelievable manner when he dealt with allegations of sexual harassment against himself.Many (including myself) spoke out against what had happened. The Supreme Court then declined to give appropriate importance to some cases, such as those concerning electoral bonds, Citizenship (Amendment) Act, habeas corpus petitions, cases of alleged violations of fundamental rights and liberties such as free speech and freedom of the Press and so on, including the terrible hardships faced by migrants as a result of the lockdown.A few months ago, about 20 senior lawyers of the Supreme Court addressed a letter to the CJI and all other judges articulating the Supreme Court’s “failure to protect the rights of the hapless millions of migrant workers in March and its failure to scrutinize the executive actions …. that severely and excessively impaired the fundamental rights of the poorest sections of our citizens”.Even today, some lawyers are expressing their distress and dismay at some other developments.The problem is that the High Courts and District Courts then begin to think that if the Supreme Court adopts a particular attitude or takes a particular stance, why should we take a different line. So, the judicial process down the line gets vitiated. That is troubling and in the overall context, it engenders the feeling that the Supreme Court and the judiciary is getting executivised.There were questions raised over the manner in which the Supreme Court handled the situation arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown during which thousands of migrant workers were seen walking back home on foot? Did it fail in its constitutional duty of protecting citizens’ right to life enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution?The letter sent by the Supreme Court lawyers says it all.The Legislature and the Executive often accuse constitutional courts of judicial overreach while activists feel the judiciary is not active enough to keep the other two organs of the State under check. What do you think?It’s a mixture of both. Judicial overreach is when the Judiciary passes orders in areas which are beyond its jurisdiction. Legislative overreach is when the Legislature passes laws that are outside its jurisdiction. These laws are then declared unconstitutional by the judiciary, which is then accused of overreach. Executive overreach is when the Executive passes orders or gives directions that are beyond its jurisdiction. These are then struck down by the judiciary. This is a constitutional obligation of the judiciary and cannot be characterised as judicial overreach.There have been instances when the Speaker of the House has not taken action under the anti-defection law for months or when there is what the Supreme Court described as horse trading of MLAs. In such situations, when a citizen approaches the Court, there are two options before the Court -- one is to tell the litigant that it’s for the Legislature and the MLAs to sort out their problems. The other is to intervene in accordance with the Constitution and pass appropriate orders. If the Court keeps a hands-off attitude, it is accused of not being active enough. If the Court intervenes, it is accused of judicial overreach. This is an unfortunate dilemma.Yet another problem is when the Legislature or the Executive is inactive. Why is it that no law was provided to protect women from sexual harassment at the workplace? Due to the silence of the Legislature, the Supreme Court was compelled to issue the Vishaka guidelines in 1998. Was it a case of judicial overreach? If yes, what was the alternative – to let women continue getting sexually harassed?Even thereafter, the Legislature was silent for almost 15 years and ultimately enacted a law in 2013. Similarly, existing laws for the protection of children are not being faithfully implemented by the Executive. If the Supreme Court passes orders for the effective implementation of these laws, is that judicial overreach? In such situations, citizens and the Courts ask the question – to act or not to act. My view is that the Courts must act – the Constitution of India mandates it.How do you see the relationship between the Government and the judiciary today?If you read the full text of the letter sent by the Supreme Court lawyers, you will get the answer to your question.More than five years have passed since the Supreme Court declared NJAC as unconstitutional. The Collegium system is under attack for being opaque and ignoring talent in elevation to the Bench. What kind of changes would you suggest in the judicial appointment system?Recently, I participated in a webinar on judicial integrity and the appointment of judges came up for consideration. A judge from a court in Europe said that in Europe there were 50 different ways in which judges are appointed. Another European judge on the panel did not contradict him. So, there are ways and ways in which judges can be selected for appointment. No system is perfect, including our collegium system. At one time, I suggested five different changes in the functioning of the collegium to reduce opacity. These were immediately accepted by the CJI and other judges in the collegium.Later, I gave another set of suggested changes to the concerned Registrar in the Supreme Court. I believe he handed over the suggestions to the CJI or brought them to his notice but they were not discussed. Changes are needed and should be made. Pinpointing them will need a separate discussion altogether. Yes, some outstanding lawyers have been side-lined for appointment and some outstanding judges have not been fairly treated.In the recent past, the Supreme Court has initiated contempt proceedings against several persons, including advocate Prashant Bhushan and comedian Kunal Kamra. Do you think the Supreme Court is becoming averse to criticism or it’s being unfairly targeted by certain people? Should India do away with criminal contempt of court, particularly scandalising the court as defined under Section 2 © (i) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971?I think the Supreme Court is being unnecessarily defensive. It has been criticised by senior politicians who have pejoratively used expressions like judicial activism and judicial overreach. The Supreme Court has not reacted to this criticism. Why take action against non-political individuals? It is not possible for every criticism to be fair, not is it possible for every judgment to be right. Listen, correct (if necessary) and move on.A former Law Minister used rather intemperate language about the Supreme Court to the effect that “Antisocial elements i.e., FERA violators, bride burners and a whole horde of reactionaries have found their heaven in the Supreme Court.” The Supreme Court said that if it is true, it is a criticism of the laws. “If antisocial elements and criminals have benefited by decisions of the Supreme Court, the fault rests with the laws and the loopholes in the legislation. The Courts are not deterred by such criticisms.”You were a part of the group of four senior-most judges who held a press-conference in January 2018 on the issue of the master of roster controversy. Do you think the system needs to be streamlined? How can it be fixed?The Chief Justice of a High Court is also the Master of the Roster, but I have seldom heard of any misuse of power by any of them. Recently, Justice Rajinder Sachar of the Delhi High Court did mention, in his worth reading autobiography, of one case of such misuse by the Chief Justice in a case pertaining to the 1984 riots/pogrom in Delhi. He protested against it by going on leave. There might possibly be other stray instances, but nothing systematic, as far as I know. Obviously, these stray instances would have been sorted out one way or the other, with or without protest.However, if the Chief Justice misuses the system and is adamant, unyielding and not willing to listen to reason, despite being advised by four senior judges, he or she is inviting a protest in some form or the other. Most judges in the Supreme Court have been Chief Justices in one or more High Court. The CJI can always consult them and streamline the system.Pandemic has forced courts to function virtually and made it heavily dependent on information technology. What are the pros and cons of this switch over to technology? Has it affected the quality of justice delivery?There are several pros and cons in embracing information and communication technology in justice delivery. I am certain that without the use of technology our justice delivery system will collapse. But there is a need to brainstorm so that communication is secure, robust and effective and lawyers don’t attend court in a vest. Under no circumstances should the use of technology leave out the poor and indigent litigant or those having little or no access to ICT – that would be disastrous. As yet, there is no study or evidence to suggest that online justice delivery has affected the “quality of justice”. It’s a little premature to comment.Over the years, the pendency of cases has been one of the biggest problems faced by the judiciary? How can it be tackled? What ails the Indian judiciary?These two questions require a long and detailed discussion. But let me quote Lord Devlin: “If our business methods were as antiquated as our legal system, we would have become a bankrupt nation long back.” He added, with reference to some deficiencies, that they are indeed “a subtle threat to the independence of the judicial system.” Reforms are certainly needed and they are needed now. Let us start with case management and process reengineering.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judiciary-is-getting-executivised-justice-madan-b-lokur-191046
29-12-2020||New Delhi||Scientists quell concerns on new COVID-19 variant, say staying cautious sufficient||Standard defense mechanisms such as masks, sanitisation and physical distancing will work to contain the coronavirus strain detected in six people who came from the UK, scientists said on Tuesday, giving assurance that the mutant is not clinically more severe and there is no need to worry.The Union Health Ministry on Tuesday said six people who returned to India from the UK recently have tested positive for the new mutated variant called VUI-202012/01, sparking worries that India's fight against the disease has gotten more complex just as its daily COVID-19 count was falling.According to the Health Ministry, the SARS-CoV-2's UK variant genome was detected in three samples in the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences Hospital (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, two in the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, and one in the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.Several scientists stepped in to assuage concerns and said there is no evidence yet that the variant is more deadly.Anurag Agrawal, director of New Delhi's CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) was one of them.  “Staying cautious and following good practices should be sufficient (to tackle the variant),” Agrawal told PTI, adding that the UK, where the variant was identified first, has not reported any clinical indication of the variant being more severe.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has said preliminary modelling results communicated by the UK on December 19 suggest the variant is 70 per cent more transmissible than previously circulating variants. However, it also said there is no indication of increased infection severity observed related to the variant with multiple mutations in the spike protein.The spike protein comes in contact with human cells to enter the body and infect.Virologist Upasana Ray agreed with the assessment that there is no cause for alarm because there is nothing so far to back concerns that the variant is more deadly. The senior scientist at CSIR-IICB, Kolkata, went a step further and said, "It has been said the transmission rate is more. However, for that also there is no laboratory based evidence." Ray also noted that a check on travel has already been suggested and said tests have been recommended for anyone entering the country from the UK."The most important step required is implementing the basic precautions like using masks (that many people have stopped using) social distancing etc. A watch on the variant is also important to monitor its transmission and pathogenicity," Ray told PTI.There should be no concerns on the vaccine front as well.Asserting that it has so far not been found that the new variant increases the severity of the disease, the government's Principal Scientific Advisor K Vijay Raghavan said at a press conference, "There is no evidence that current vaccines will fail to protect against COVID 19 variants reported from UK or SA.” “Most vaccines do target the spike protein in which there are changes in the variants but vaccines stimulate our immune system to produce a wide range of protective antibodies," he said.Rakesh Mishra, director of Hyderabad's CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Microbiology added that there is no surprise to find the new variant of the virus in some of the samples tested in India.According to him, large-scale testing is required, and people need not worry too much about the new strain."It  (new strain of COVID-19) is just fresh, otherwise, it is the same virus and not much of an issue. Same symptoms, mortality, everything is the same… we just have to take precautions," Mishra told PTI.Though the new variant is more transmissible, it has not shown to cause more severe infection compared to other mutants, agreed Divya Tej Sowpati, a scientist at CSIR-CCMB.  “Please note that though more transmissible, this strain is not shown to be clinically more severe. Also, the same defences work to contain the UK strain too - masks, sanitization, and social distancing,” Sowpati tweeted on Tuesday.  Immunologist Satyajit Rath said the variant is likely to be a cause for concern in terms of policy responses to COVID-19, but not in terms of individual risk of serious illness.“However, the basis for this concern remains somewhat circumstantial at this point, since it is based on the correlation between the increasing prominence of this variant with growing case numbers in southern England over the past few weeks.“More direct evidence, if any, is still awaited,” Rath from New Delhi's National Institute of Immunology (NII) said.He also expressed doubts about whether the new variant will have any impact on the accuracy of the standard RT PCR diagnostic tests for COVID-19 being conducted in India.“It is true that some tests are based on detection of regions that are a bit different in this variant, but those differences are not large enough, I think, for the tests to be affected to any substantial extent,” he explained.Agrawal concurred with Rath, saying “no sweeping changes were needed” in RT-PCR diagnosis due to the new variant.A total of 16,432 new infections were reported in a span of 24 hours, the lowest in little over six months, while the death toll increased to 1,48,153 with 252 new fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry on Tuesday.The number of people who have recuperated from the disease surged to 98,07,569 pushing the national recovery rate to 95.92 per cent, while the COVID-19 case fatality rate is 1.45 per cent. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scientists-quell-concerns-on-new-covid-19-variant-say-staying-cautious-sufficient-191043
29-12-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Couple who accidentally immolated themselves to stop eviction die; Govt takes over responsibility of children||The death of a poor couple, who succumbed to burns after accidentally immolating themselves to stop an eviction drive here, has triggered a widespread row in Kerala, with opposition parties blaming police for the incident, following which the state government extended a helping hand to their orphaned children on Tuesday.The couple-Rajan (47) and his wife Ambili (40), natives of Nellimoodu at nearby Neyyattinkara- succumbed to burns at the government medical college hospital here after they sustained multiple organ failure on Monday.The video of their two teenaged children-Rahul and Renjith-wailing outside the hospital for help to cremate their father at the disputed land as per his last wish went viral on the social media, following which many have offered them help to construct an own house.As the opposition Congress took up the matter and criticised police for the unfortunate incident, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced that his government would take over the protection of the children."The government will take over their protection and other responsibilities.We will meet their educational expenses and construct a house for them," he said in Thrissur when he came there as part of his state-wide tour to meet dignitaries in various fields ahead of the assembly election, due next year.The Youth Congress has already announced that they were ready to construct a house for the hapless children while the Democratic Youth Federation of India, the youth arm of the ruling CPI(M), said they would meet their educational expenses.According to police, the immolation incident occurred on December 22 when police and an advocate commission appointed by a local court had gone to Rajan's house to implement a judicial order to evict him and his family from a three cent poramboke land based on the complaint of a neighbour.Last June also, there was an attempt to evict the family from the disputed land.When the police personnel approached them, Rajan had doused himself and his wife with kerosene and warned them not to come closer.They had caught fire accidentally when a police officer tried to snatch a lighter from him.Their children later alleged that the haste shown by the police had caused the mishap.The law enforces had tried to evict them even after knowing that there would be a stay order, which came soon after the tragic incident, they told the media.Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on Tuesday demanded a probe into the alleged lapses from police during the eviction drive.Based on the complaint of human rights activist Ashwathy Jwala, the state Human Rights Commission directed the Thiruvananthapuram district police chief (Rural) to probe alleged lapses of police into the incident and submit a report within four weeks.In the wake of the widespread complaints, DGP Loknath Behera directed Thiruvananthapuram Rural SP, B Ashok Kumar to probe the immolation incident and the death of the couple."The DGP directed to submit the report at the earliest," his office here said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/couple-who-accidentally-immolated-themselves-to-stop-eviction-die-govt-takes-over-responsibility-of-children-191042
29-12-2020||New Delhi||Centre, farmers to resume talks on Wednesday; unions stick to demand for repeal of farm laws||The Centre and the protesting farmer unions will resume stalled talks on Wednesday with the latter sticking to their hardline position that the parleys will only be on the modalities of repealing the three new agri laws and giving a legal guarantee on the MSP among other issues.Ahead of the crucial sixth round of talks after a three-week hiatus, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal on Tuesday met senior BJP leader and Home Minister Amit Shah. Sources said they discussed and finalised the government's position for the meeting.Tomar, the minister for Agriculture, and Goyal, the minister for Food and Consumer Affairs, and MoS Commerce and Industry Som Parkash have been representing the Centre at the talks with the farmers. Tomar on Monday said he hopes for a breakthrough soon.Also read: Anti-farm law demonstration lathicharged in Patna, several injuredThe Centre on Monday invited the 40 protesting farmer unions for the next round of talks on December 30 on all relevant issues to find a "logical solution" with "open mind" to the prolonged impasse over the three new agri laws that was enacted in September.But in its letter on Tuesday, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella organisation which represents the farmer unions, said the modalities for repealing the three contentious laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) must be part of the agenda.The Morcha further said the agenda should also include amendments to be made and notified in the Commission for the Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020 to exclude farmers from its penal provisions.Through the letter, the Morcha also formally accepted the government's invitation for the dialogue.Also read: Hema Malini pitches for farm lawsThe letter also stated that withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 to protect the interests of farmers should also be part of the agenda.The fifth round of talks was held on December 5, while the sixth round originally scheduled for December 9 was called off after an informal meeting of Home Minister Shah with some union leaders failed to reach any breakthrough.The government had, however, followed up Shah's meeting with a draft proposal sent to the unions in which it had suggested 7-8 amendments to the new laws and written assurance on the MSP procurement system. It has ruled out a repeal of the three agri laws.In a letter to the farmer unions, Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Aggarwal on Monday invited them for the talks at 2 pm on Wednesday at Vigyan Bhavan in the national capital.The farmers had also written to the government on December 26 listing the agenda.In the latest letter, the Morcha pointed out that in its December 26 communication to the government, it had mentioned "changes" by mistake instead of "withdrawal" in the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020.Also read: Farmer bodies against any act causing damage to mobile towers: BKU Ekta Ugrahan leaderFarmer unions also deferred to Thursday their proposed tractor march against the contentious agriculture laws, so that the rally does not clash with their talks with the government.Thousands of protesting farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at three Delhi border points---Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri---for the past 31 days, demanding a repeal of the three farm laws and legal guarantee for MSP.The Congress demanded legal sanctity to the demands of farmers including that on ensuring the MSP.Addressing a joint press conference, Congress leaders Rajeev Shukla and Govind Dotasra said the government must immediately repeal the three farm laws and bring fresh ones after incorporating the demands of farmers and then get them passed by Parliament.Shukla also said it was wrong on the part of the government to dub the farmers agitation as political as it is an attempt to defame farmers.NCP supremo and former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, meanwhile, accused the Centre of bulldozing the farm laws without consulting states and asserted that agriculture cannot be run "sitting in Delhi" as it involves farmers toiling in distant villages.Pawar also raised questions about the composition of the three-member ministerial group negotiating with the unions, saying the ruling party should have put forward leaders with "in-depth" understanding of agriculture and farmers' issues.In an interview with PTI, the former union minister said the government needs to take the protests seriously and it was "unfair" on the part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to blame opposition parties for the agitation by farmers.He said the opposition parties will take a call on their future course of action on Wednesday if the government fails to resolve the impasse.The three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.Here is the translated text of the letter originally written in Hindi:‘Your letter dated 28 December 2020 (No. 105/2020) was received. Thank you for accepting the proposal we sent for the meeting. We accept the invitation to speak at 2:00 pm on 30 December.We remind you that we are coming to this dialogue to discuss the following agenda mentioned in our previous letter and in the order given below:1. Modalities to be adopted to repeal / repeal the three Central Agricultural Laws;2. Procedure and provision for legal guarantee for procurement on profitable MSP suggested by National Farmers Commission for all farmers and agricultural commodities;3. Amendments to the ‘Commission Ordinance for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Territory and adjoining areas, 2020’ which are necessary to exclude farmers from the penal provisions of the ordinance;4. Procedure for withdrawal of draft ‘Electricity Amendment Bill 2020’ (amendment: previous letter mistakenly written “necessary changes”) to protect the interests of farmers.Our dialogue must follow this agenda in order for a "rational solution to the relevant issues".Yours faithfully,Samyukt Kisan Morcha--- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-farmers-to-resume-talks-on-wednesday-unions-stick-to-demand-for-repeal-of-farm-laws-191037
29-12-2020||Patna||Anti-farm law demonstration lathicharged in Patna, several injured||Several people were injured here on Tuesday in a lathi charge at a busy crossing in the heart of the city when police personnel tried to stop a procession, taken out in protest against the farm laws, from heading towards the Raj Bhavan.Traffic was thrown out of gear as thousands of protestors, comprising members of various farmers’ organisations and pro-Left outfits, marched through Frazer Road before they were stopped at the Dak Bungalow crossing.According to police, the crackdown at Dak Bungalow crossing was preceded by skirmishes between the demonstrators and police and administrative officials at Gandhi Maidan, the starting point of the rally, where agitators took exception to their entry being allowed inside the sprawling public ground only through one of the many gates.Police sources said the restriction was put in place to avoid a stamped-like situation.The demonstrators alleged that it was an attempt to suppress their voice.Later, when they reached the Dak Bungalow crossing, about a kilometre and a half away, officials deployed there told the demonstrators that their march could not be allowed beyond that point.As the demonstrators insisted on walking right up to the Raj Bhavan, some three km away, the police used force to prevent their march towards the restricted VIP area.An unspecified number of injured protestors were taken to hospitals for treatment while a few were rounded up, the police said.There was heavy deployment of force at Dak Bungalow crossing, where some of the demonstrators sought to stand their ground raising slogans, the police added.

29-12-2020||Islamabad||Basmati not registered as local product, but Pak challenges India claim at EU||While Pakistan is fighting a case in the European Union against the Indian move to get Basmati rice registered as its product, the commodity is still not registered as a local product in the country, according to a media report.Laws require that before applying for registration of any product in the international market it has to be protected under the geographical indication (GI) laws of that country.The Dawn reported that there are no rules of the Geographical Indications (Registration and Protection) Act, 2020 enacted in March this year and as a result, Basmati is not yet a protected product in Pakistan.A rice exporter told the Dawn that exporters, particularly the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan, had been urging the government since early 2000 to formulate the GI laws.“The laws were finally made in March this year, but the authorities have not yet framed the rules of GI law. As a result many local exportable products cannot be registered anywhere in the world with Pakistani GI tagging,” the exporter said.“Even now the pressure of the case at the EU is driving the authorities to finalise the rules for GI law at the earliest,” he added.The issue of protecting Basmati rice as a product of Pakistan came to the forefront after India submitted an application to the European Union claiming sole ownership of the commodity in September this year.In its application India has claimed that ‘Basmati’ is special long grain aromatic rice grown and produced in a particular geographical region of the subcontinent.After highlighting the brief history of Basmati rice, India also claimed that the region is a part of northern India, below the foothills of the Himalayas forming part of the Indo-Gangetic plain.Incidentally, the issue was pointed out to the ministry of commerce and its attached department, the Intellectual Property Organisation (IPO) of Pakistan by the rice exporters after observing the details of fresh applications at the EU website.Since the case was placed for public hearing and invitation of objections, the matter was taken up by the authorities and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood held a meeting in October.Eventually, the Indian claim to the EU was challenged earlier this month and the main argument by Pakistan was that basmati rice was a joint product of India and Pakistan.Pakistan exported 500,000-700,000 tonnes of basmati rice annually to different parts of the world out of which 200,000 tonnes to 250,000 tonnes is being shipped to EU countries.Meanwhile, responding to a query IPO Spokesman Meesak Arif said that the rules of GI law were at the final stages and were likely to be notified soon.“The rules are in the printing process and will be notified by the commerce ministry soon,” Arif said, adding that the government had authorised the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) as the lead agency regarding Basmati rice.Soon after the notification of rules, the TDAP would file for the GI protection of basmati rice in the country, which would eventually make the case of Pakistan at the EU and elsewhere strong, he added.

29-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi court sets aside order awarding 7-day jail term to ex-AAP MLA||A Delhi court has set aside an order awarding 7-day jail term to former Aam Aadmi Party MLA Manoj Kumar for  allegedly assaulting a woman in 2014.Special Judge Geetanjli Goel on December 22 set aside an order of a magisterial court while deciding an appeal filed by the lawmaker against the judgement.“The present appeal is allowed and the judgement dated August 13, 2019 by which the appellant Manoj Kumar was convicted for the offence under Section 352 IPC and the order on sentence dated August 17, 2019 are set aside." “The appellant is acquitted for the offence under Section 352 (punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation) IPC,” the judge said.According to the prosecution, the woman had gone to the lawmaker, seeking redressal of water logging related problems. The convict, however, asked her not to disturb him and pushed the woman inappropriately.The magisterial court had awarded punishment to Kumar last year. The court said the lawmaker was "a public servant and therefore it was his duty to behave fairly and courteously to those who approach him with their problems".At request of Kumar that he wished to file an appeal against his conviction,  the court had granted him bail.While convicting Kumar for assault, the magisterial court had, however, acquitted him of the charge of 354 (assaulting woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of IPC. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-court-sets-aside-order-awarding-7-day-jail-term-to-ex-aap-mla-191030

29-12-2020||New Delhi||CAPFs asked to prepare for providing assistance in waste disposal during COVID-19 immunisation||The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) have been asked to be prepared in providing assistance in the safe disposal of medical waste that will be generated during the COVID-19 vaccination drive, expected to be rolled out soon, official sources have said.The forces that render a variety of internal security duties in the country, apart from border guarding, would also play a “vital role” in assisting the medical system in organising camps and creating awareness about the availability and safety of getting a vaccine shot, they said.Broad contours on the role of the police forces, especially the central ones, in the coronavirus vaccination drive was discussed during the recently concluded annual conference of police chiefs that was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.“The central police organisations and the CAPFs have been asked to prepare their manpower in case they are required to assist the healthcare system of the country in the safe disposal of the huge medical waste that will be generated during the country-wide coronavirus vaccination drive expected in 2021,” an officer told PTI.“These forces have also been asked to identify their medical staff and other personnel who can help the healthcare system in the process of creating awareness about the safety of the vaccine and also in organising logistics for the drive,” the officer added.The medical waste that will be generated during this drive includes syringes, vials, cotton swabs, wrappers, gloves, sanitiser bottles and some other medical equipment.As the healthcare workers were burdened with various COVID-19 duties since the outbreak of the pandemic, they could be helped by these forces in rendering auxiliary tasks, the officer said.“The CAPFs will ensure that the waste generated in their campuses or in their surroundings is properly disposed of. They will be prepared to act as and when required,” he said, adding “the forces have also been directed to prepare a database of their personnel who will be among the first to get the vaccine.”Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) Director General SS Deswal had told PTI in an interview last month that the CAPFs would play a major role in the anti-coronavirus vaccination programme in the country and their healthcare facilities would also be part of this drive.These forces, with an estimated strength of about 10 lakh personnel, include the BSF, the CRPF, the CISF and the SSB apart from two other central forces — the NDRF and the NSG.A mock drill for administering the COVID-19 vaccine was carried out by the government on Monday in some select districts of four states to test the systems deployed and find out pitfalls before the commencement of the actual drive.Another official said apart from COVID-19 measures, at the annual national conference of Directors General and Inspectors General of Police, action plans had been formulated for preparing a robust cybersecurity plan for their organisations and personnel.It was also decided during the meeting, held virtually between December 2 to 5, that police organisations should prepare a record on how various challenges they faced were tackled and what solutions were deployed.“This would help in better planning to tackle future challenges in the internal security, terrorism, left-wing extremism, criminal investigations and border security domain. Every police organisation has been asked to prepare their record-sheet as per the task they render and expertise,” the second officer said.

29-12-2020||New Delhi||UK flight suspension likely to be extended, says Aviation Minister||India is likely to extend the suspension of passenger flights to and from the United Kingdom to check the spread of the new strain of coronavirus, Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Tuesday.The ministry had last week suspended all flights between the two countries from December 23 to December 31 over the mutated variant of the virus which is more contagious.“I foresee a slight extension of temporary suspension of India-UK flights,” the minister told a press conference here on Tuesday.“In a day or two, we will find out if any additional steps need to be taken, or when we can start easing the current temporary suspension,” he said.Earlier in the day, the Union Health Ministry said six persons who returned to India from the United Kingdom have tested positive for the new strain of the virus.The presence of the new UK variant has already been reported by Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, and other countries.Meanwhile, Airports Authority of India (AAI) Chairman Arvind Singh told the press conference the government is planning to hold the next round of privatisation of airports in the first half of 2021.“As far as the next round of airports’ privatisation is concerned, we are at the final stages of obtaining government approvals. Once the approvals are received, I think we will start the process of bidding in the first quarter of 2021,” he said.The AAI had in September recommended the Centre now privatise airports at Amritsar, Varanasi, Bhubaneswar, Indore, Raipur and Trichy.In the first round of airports’ privatisation under the Narendra Modi government, the Adani Group in February bagged contracts for six airports—Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, and Guwahati—winning the bids by huge margins.After signing the concession agreements for three airports—Lucknow, Ahmedabad and Mangaluru—the AAI handed them over to the Adani group earlier this year.The concession agreements for the remaining three airports would be signed in the first half of next month, Singh said.The AAI, which works under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, owns and manages more than 100 airports across the country.

29-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt school students to get dry ration for 6 months: Kejriwal||The Delhi government will provide dry ration to the students of its schools for a six-month period under the mid-day meal scheme, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Tuesday.The move comes in view of the continued closure of schools since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic."When the schools were closed, we decided to send the money for mid-day meals to the parents' accounts, but now, it has been decided that we will give dry ration for six months," Kejriwal said at a dry ration distribution event at a government school in the Mandawali area.Under the scheme, dry ration kits containing wheat, rice, pulses and oil will be provided to all eligible students of Classes 1-8 in the Delhi government schools."All this while we tried to provide the corresponding amount of the mid-day meal provided to the students in the bank accounts of their parents. But today, we are starting ration distribution at the request of the parents. Each student will be provided with an adequate ration for a period of six months -- July to December, 2020 -- so that there is no lack in providing nutrition to children," the chief minister said."We tried our best to provide food to everyone during the lockdown. The Delhi government provided food to 10 lakh people every day and the arrangements for the same were made in all the schools across Delhi, including the central government and MCD schools. Around 10 lakh people were provided lunch and dinner every day and we used to serve them as if we were serving at langars since we had our religious sentiments. We continued with the distribution till people stopped coming for food," the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader added.Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of COVID-19. They were partially reopened in some states on October 15.However, the Delhi government has announced that schools will not reopen in the national capital till a vaccine for the coronavirus is available."The last nine months have been extremely difficult and we cannot see an end to this difficulty. The vaccine has been made and I hope it will reach our country soon. I pray to god for the vaccine to bring an end to our misery so that our lives can get back on track. But till the time the vaccine does not come, we have to find solutions."The most distressed in the last nine months were children. They cannot remain locked up in a room. They have energy and want to play and go to school, but we had never thought that our children will have to study in front of phones and computers because schools will be closed. The whole system has changed," Kejriwal said.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the non-availability of mid-day meals due to the closure of schools posed a challenge."There were many families that were finding it hard to have enough on their plates. Massive unemployment due to COVID-19 has aggravated the issue. We experimented by transferring money directly to the students' accounts. It was the chief minister's idea that it is better to distribute ration rather than transferring money. Hence, we are now providing dry ration to more than eight lakh students in the government and government-aided schools in Delhi," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-govt-school-students-to-get-dry-ration-for-6-months-kejriwal-191012

29-12-2020||New Delhi||Jal Shakti Ministry to focus on water testing||Amid implementation of its Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to provide piped drinking water to every rural household, the Union Jal Shakti Ministry has mounted "Innovation Challenge" to develop portable devices for water testing.The Ministry said the challenge will be in partnership with the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade."The main objective of the exercise is to bring an innovative, modular, and cost-effective solution to develop portable devices that can be used at the household level to test the drinking water quality instantly, easily and accurately," a Ministry official involved with JJM said on Monday.Water quality testing is one of the components of JJM.The innovation challenge aims to ensure that water sources are tested at various locations, at different levels.The Uniform Drinking Water Quality Protocol, 2019 has specified certain parameters to be monitored for assuring portability of drinking water.The data collected through the testings will provide inputs to policy framers to design programs which address the water contamination issues.A study conducted by the National Jal Jeevan Mission of the Ministry suggests that people receiving piped water supply in their homes do not have any means to test the potability of water coming from their taps."This leads to a situation wherein, quite often, people are reluctant to consume tap water directly, the Ministry official said.Since the announcement of the JJM on August 15, last year till December 23, 2020, about three crore households have been provided tap water connections in the country.This is an increase in the tap water supply from about three crores (17 per cent) in August 2019 to 6.13 Crore (32 per cent) rural households.Further, every household in 20 districts, 425 blocks, 34 thousand Gram Panchayats and 64 thousand villages of the country now have access to tap water connection.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jal-shakti-ministry-to-focus-on-water-testing-190998
29-12-2020||Lucknow||Modi targets previous govts for 'delaying work' on railways’ dedicated freight corridor project||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday hit out at previous governments for “delaying the Dedicated Freight Corridor project and ignoring modernisation of railways”, saying his government engaged with stakeholders to speed up works and carried out reforms at all levels.Inaugurating the New Bhaupur-New Khurja section of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC) via video-conferencing, he said the "vibration" and "roar" of Bharat and 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' were clearly heard as the first freight train ran on the Khurja-Bhaupur freight corridor.Attacking the previous government, the Prime Minister said the project was given permission in 2006 but it was only on paper as the then government lacked the seriousness and urgency with which it had to take it up with the states.Till 2014 not a single km track of the project was laid and the funds sanctioned could not be spent properly. After 2014, it was restarted and officials asked to take it forward and by then the budget had gone up by 11 times, the PM said.The 351-km section, which has been built at a cost of Rs 5,750 crore, will open new avenues for local industries in Uttar Pradesh.The EDFC is 1,840-km-long and extends from Ludhiana in Punjab to Kolkata in West Bengal.Modi also inaugurated the EDFC's operation centre at Prayagraj and flagged off the first 1.5-km long goods train.The Prime Minister said that on coming to power, he personally monitored the project and held a dialogue with the stakeholders and got new technology as a result of which about 1,100 km work would be completed in the next few months.Political apathy not just hampered the freight corridor project but also had a bearing on the entire railways system, he said, adding that earlier the focus was on increasing the number of trains for political benefit in elections but not on the tracks on which the trains were run as there was no investment on it.There was no seriousness towards modernisation of the rail network, trains were being run on slow speed and the entire network was full of dangerous unmanned crossings, he said."We changed this work culture and thinking after 2014 and ending the separate railway budget, invested in rail tracks, ended unmanned crossings, focused on broadening and electrification of the network, he said.The Vande Bharat Express, the semi high speed train is now being run, he said, adding that now Indian rails are more secure than before.In the past few years reforms had been carried out at all levels and could be seen, he added.The new freight section will open new vistas of opportunity for local industries such as aluminium industry in Pukhrayan region of Kanpur Dehat, dairy sector of Auraiya, textile production and block printing of Etawah, glassware industry of Firozabad, pottery products of Khurja, asafoetida or 'heeng' production of Hathras, and locks and hardware of Aligarh district, according to officials.The section will also decongest the existing Kanpur-Delhi mainline and will enable the Indian Railways to run faster trains. Noting that a state-of-the-art Operation Control Centre at Prayagraj will act as the command centre for the entire route length of the EDFC, they said this is one of the largest structures of its type globally with modern interiors, ergonomic design and best-in-class acoustics.The building is environment-friendly with a green building rating of GRIHA4 and is built as per norms of the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan', they added.

29-12-2020||Chennai||Rajini does a U-turn; scraps political plunge plans citing health reasons||Making a U-turn, superstar Rajinikanth on Tuesday announced he will not enter politics in view of his frail health, putting an end to his long-nurtured plans and describing his recent hospitalisation as a God's warning."Only I know the pain behind making this announcement," the 70-year-old actor said in a statement, two days before he was to spell out the contours of his party based on spiritual politics aimed at bringing a total change in the Dravidian heartland Tamil Nadu in the 2021 assembly elections.His decision would 'disappoint' members of his Rajini Makkal Mandram, seen as a precursor forum of his political party, and the people, he said, asking them to forgive him. "I inform with great regret I am unable to come to politics by floating a political party. Only I know the pain behind making this announcement," he said. Rajinikanth, however, said he will serve people in whatever ways he can without entering electoral politics.His decision drew varied reactions with some saying it would affect the BJP while others, including fellow actor-politician Kamal Haasan, expressing disappointment.The actor's move might just upset the BJP's plans to make a greater presence in the state with a possible alliance with him as his then proposed spiritual politics was seen as 'soft hindutva,' by many political observers.While the AIADMK made little of the star's announcement, Haasan expressed "slight disappointment" over his 'friend' backing away but insisted his health was of primary concrern.After years of speculation, Rajinikanth had in 2017 said he would enter politics ahead of the 2021 assembly elections and field candidates in all 234 constituencies.Earlier this month, the actor had said he will launch his party in January and disclose the specifics by December 31, after revealtions about his renal transplant in 2016 led to doubts about his fitness to take the political plunge.The top star had then dramatically asserted he was even ready to risk his life for the people's welfare by foraying into politics, pitching for "change all, if not now never" in the state elections, the first after the demise of AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa and DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi.In his statement on Tuesday, Rajinikanth, discharged from a Hyderabad hospital two days ago after being treated for blood pressure fluctuations, expressed fears over those accompanying him facing "mental and economic" problems in due course over his possible health issues.Rajinikanth indicated he did not want to sound chivalrous by saying he will join politics despite severe health concerns and that he did not want to make his supporter "a victim".He recalled four crew members of his current venture 'Annatthe' tested positive for coronavirus despite safety measures put in place and pointed out he had tested negative for the contagion, but suffered blood pressure fluctuations."Clinically, there should not be any fluctuation in my blood pressure as it would severely affect my transplanted kidney and therefore I was under medical observation for three days," he said."I see this as a warning given by God to me," he said and pointed out that the movie's producer, Kalanidhi Maran of Sun Pictures, had postponed the shoot, affecting many.Also, confining his campaign virtually would not give the desired public 'resurgence' which he had mentioned in March this year, Rajinikanth said.In physical meetings, he would have to meet lakhs of people, he said, adding "I had to be hospitalised for three days after being in a group of 120 and now a new strain of coronavirus has also emerged".Though there may be a vaccine, he was, however, consuming "immuno suppressant", the actor said.The actor's major brush with politics was in 1996 when he spoke out against the then AIADMK government led by late J Jayalalithaa with the DMK-TMC combine trumping the ruling party in the assembly elections.Describing the Tamil people as "Gods", he urged them and his fans "who desire truth and honesty" besides being concerned about his health, "to kindly accept my decision". RSS idealogue S Gurumurthy, considered close to the actor, said Rajinikanth "will make a political impact on TN. Like in 1996".AIADMK spokesperson RM Babu Murugavel recalled he had said in 2017 itself that the actor will not enter politics."Irrespective of his presence in the electoral field, the AIADMK will not be affected," he told PTI.VCK leader and Lok Sabha member Thol Thirumavalavan said the actor's decision would only "affect the BJP and Sangh Parivar as they tried to gain mileage out of his fame". "This is not mere speculation but everyone knows this," he said.However, the BJP said it was banking only on "real superstar" Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose work would ensure a 'resounding victory' in the hustings next year. Former state party chief Pon Radhakrishnan dismissed as "a figment of imagination" the speculations that Rajinis decision might affect the BJPs prospects. "The BJP is dependent only on Narendra Modi and not on anyone," he said but added Rajinikanth could have come to politics. Noted political observer 'Tharasu' Shyam opined the actor not starting a party will help the AIADMK-BJP combine in the elections. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajini-does-a-u-turn-scraps-political-plunge-plans-citing-health-reasons-190989

29-12-2020||United Nations||India's economy could prove to be most resilient in sub-region over long term: UN||India's economy could prove to be the "most resilient" in the sub region of South and South-West Asia over the long term, according to a report by the UN, which says a positive but lower economic growth post COVID-19 pandemic and the country's large market will continue to attract investments.The report titled 'Foreign Direct Investment Trends And Outlook In Asia And The Pacific 2020/2021', and compiled by United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), stated that inward FDI flows to South and South-West Asia slightly decreased by 2 per cent in 2019, from USD 67 billion in 2018 to USD 66 billion in 2019.The growth, however, was mainly driven by India, which accounted for 77 per cent of the total inflows to the sub region and received USD 51 billion in 2019, up 20 per cent from the previous year.The report, released last week, said the majority of these flows were destined for the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and the construction of sub-sector.Regarding the ICT sector, the report said the investment to India has evolved from information technology services for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to the thriving local digital ecosystem where many domestic players, especially in e-commerce, have attracted considerable international investment.The report added that FDI outflows from South and South-West Asia increased for the fourth consecutive year, modestly growing from USD 14.8 billion in 2018 to USD 15.1 billion in 2019.The geographical spread of FDI outflows from the sub region remained uneven, with just two countries (India and Turkey) accounting for the vast majority of outflows in 2019, it said.“As such, the slight increase in outward FDI was predominantly due to an increase in outflows from India, which accounted for 80 per cent of total outward investment from the sub region,” the report said, adding that in 2019, India invested USD 12.1 billion abroad, a 10 per cent increase compared with the previous year.The report noted that in the short term, both inflows and outflows from and to the sub region are expected to decline.In the first three quarters of 2020, the value of greenfield FDI inflows declined by 43 per cent compared to the same period last year, signalling a reversal of the growth trend in the sub region.Most of the greenfield flows (87 per cent) were destined for India, although the overall greenfield inflows to the country declined by 29 per cent. Equally, FDI from India is projected to decline in 2020, with the largest MNEs revising their earnings down by 25 per cent in early 2020 due to the impacts of the pandemic.“However, India's economy could prove the most resilient in the sub region over the long term. FDI inflows have been steadily increasing and positive, albeit lower, economic growth after the pandemic and India's large market will continue to attract market-seeking investment,” the report said.India's fast-growing telecom and digital space, in particular, could see a faster rebound as global venture capital firms and technology companies continue to show interest in the country's market through acquisitions, it said.It noted that Facebook and Google's investment in Jio Platforms in 2020 worth USD 5.7 billion and USD 4.5 billion respectively were testaments to this trend.“Estimates suggest that by 2025, core digital sectors such as IT and business process management, digital communication services, and electronics manufacturing could double in size.“In addition, the pandemic has only further increased the tendency of many sectors such as agriculture, education, energy, financial services, logistics to digitalise, as COVID-19 has pushed many individual and companies to adopt digital solutions and processes,” the report said.India has implemented a number of noteworthy investment policies and measures since 2019. Some of them include the relaxation of limits to FDI in the insurance sector, liberalisation of FDI rules which ended equity caps in several sectors including coal and lignite mining, contract manufacturing and single brand retail trading and increase in ceiling for FDI into the defense sector to 74 per cent via automatic approval route, it said.In addition to these measures, and in direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government also introduced intensified FDI screening procedures from neighbouring countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China and Nepal, it said.The report said that as in previous years, inflows of greenfield investments have been unevenly distributed across the Asia-Pacific region. In 2019, Vietnam received the second largest share of inward greenfield investment (11 per cent), followed by India (10 per cent), and Sri Lanka (8 per cent).Looking ahead, in the short-term investment in pharmaceutical manufacturing is forecast to decrease as many European and United States pharmaceutical companies may switch partly to more localised sourcing owing to supply-chain disruptions in the pharmaceuticals sector during COVID-19 pandemic.“This will be important for pharmaceutical manufacturing hubs in the region, particularly in India,” the report said.The report said that Asia-Pacific's share in global FDI inflows dropped from 45 per cent in 2018 to 35 per cent in 2019, and its share in global FDI outflows decelerated from 52 per cent to 41 per cent.

29-12-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Censor Board denies nod for Malayalam movie on JNU agitation||Malayalam film 'Varthamanam', set in the backdrop of students protest held in Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi early this year, has been denied permission for screening by the Censor Board of Film Certification's (CBFC) regional office here.Directed by noted filmmaker Sidhartha Siva with award-winning actress Parvathy Thiruvoth in the lead role, the movie revolves around the journey of a Keralite woman who goes to the JNU campus from the home state for her research studies.Aryadan Shoukath, the film's producer-script-writer, said the CBFC officials here did not point out any reason for denying the certification.He also said the movie would be submitted to the revising committee of the Censor Board in Mumbai for certification this week itself."The CBFC officials here just informed us that the film has to be submitted to the revising committee. We still do not know why the movie is denied the certification," Shoukath, also a Congress leader told PTI.The award-winning script writer said he had carried out several months of research and studies before penning the script and spent several days in Delhi to get the first-hand experience of the culture and lifestyle in JNU campus."We cannot send the movie for any award this time if we do not get the Censor Board clearance before December 31," he said.Shoukath suspected that the nod for screening was denied on political grounds citing a recent tweet of a censor board member, who is also the state vice president ofSC Morcha of the BJP."Adv V Sandeep Kumar, a censor board member, recently tweeted that the permission was denied as Aryadan Shoukath was its scriptwriter and producer.Nowadays Censor Board has several political appointees who have no basic knowledge of cinema," he said.Shoukath, the other day, also uploaded on his Facebook page the screenshot of the controversial tweet of the regional censor Board member.In his tweet, which was found removed later, Sandeep Kumar had said that he, as a member of the Board, as opposed to giving nod for the movie."As a member of the Censor Board, I saw the movie Varthamanam. The theme was the persecution of Muslims and Dalits in the JNU agitation. I opposed it.Because Arydan Shoukath was its scriptwriter and producer. Of course, the theme of the film was anti-national," the tweet said.Violence broke out at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus early in January this year as masked men armed with sticks and rods attacked students and teachers protesting the fee hike and damaged property on the campus, prompting the administration to call in the police which conducted a flag march.Coming down heavily on him, Shoukath, in his FB post, sought to know how a movie would become anti-national if it speaks about the students' agitation in Delhi campus or the democratic movements in the country."We are still living in India which is a democratic, secular and socialist country.Is it based on the clan and race of the script-writer that a film is given a nod for screening? The undeclared emergency situation in the cultural sector cannot be accepted," the scriptwriter's FB post said.Film sources here told PTI that when two censor board members, who are from the film industry, strongly supported the movie and wanted to give it a nod for screening, two others, who are political nominees, objected to it.When contacted, the censor board officials here were unavailable for comment.

Former Defence Minister AK Antony did the honours of flag-hoisting in the absence of the two top leaders.As Rahul left on a short personal visit abroad yesterday, the Congress rose in his defence, saying he was not the incumbent party president.“Rahul Gandhi is currently not the Congress president. He is discharging the responsibility the party gives him…. Can’t he go to visit an ailing family member? He is on a short personal visit to see a seriously ill family member. He is not on leave. He has also gone to visit his maternal grandmother. I don’t think the BJP should have any objection to this,” Congress media head Randeep Surjewala said, answering queries about the conspicuous absence of Rahul from the party’s most important annual event, especially at a time when some dissenters are active in the party.Surjewala, who attended the ceremony, however, sought to deflect the issue and said the question today was not where Rahul was. “The question is what the Centre is doing to ease the pain of agitating farmers,” asked Surjewala.AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was present at the ceremony, attacked the Centre for calling farmers “anti-national”.

Ten designated laboratories spread across the country will cater to the nearest states which will send 5 per cent of the positive samples to these labs for genome sequencing.The consortium was considered critical after the United Kingdom faced a spike in cases due to a new mutation.The ministry said: “The United Kingdom variant is significantly more transmissible with an estimated potential to increase the reproductive number (R) by 0.4 or greater with an estimated increased transmissibility of up to 70 per cent.”Meanwhile, 20,021 fresh infections and 279 fatalities were reported in the past 24 hours.

29-12-2020||---||Farmers accept govt offer for talks tomorrow; Anna threatens ‘last stir’||New Delhi, December 28Raising fresh hopes of a truce, protesting farmers on Monday accepted the Centre’s invitation for the sixth round of talks on Wednesday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the government would “keep marching on the path of strengthening Indian agriculture”.Farmers responded positively to the Centre’s invitation to 40 unions, which have been leading month-long protests on Delhi borders to seek the repeal of three farm laws. The invitation followed a missive from the unions proposing a December 29 meeting.The farmers, in positive signs, called off their previously planned tractor march from Singhu and Tikri borders to the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Highway.The developments came on a day when activist Anna Hazare threatened a protest, which he called “his last”, for the farmers if the Centre failed to address their concerns by January-end.The Centre’s invitation, sent through Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Aggarwal, remains silent on the principal demand of the protesters — discussion on modalities to repeal the contentious farm legislations. The unions, in their last proposal to the Centre, had mentioned this as their first demand.In its invitation sent to the farmers, the government said it was “committed to finding a logical solution to all relevant issues with a clear intention and an open mind.” Aggarwal said discussions would be held on the farm legislations, MSP, The Electricity Amendment Act and the ordinance to tackle air pollution in and around Delhi and NCR.The Centre’s invitation is for 2 pm talks on December 30. The last time the two sides met was on December 5 with farm unions demanding a “yes” or “no” answer to the demand of rescinding the laws. The meeting had ended inconclusively.Ahead of the fresh talks, the government today signalled its firmness for reforms with PM Narendra Modi, speaking during the launch of a Kisan Rail project, noting, “The participation and support of the rural people, farmers and youth makes government’s efforts successful. Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and cooperative groups get priority in agri-business and agri-infrastructure. Recent reforms will lead to expansion of agri-business and these groups will be the biggest beneficiaries. Private investment in agriculture will support the government’s effort to help these groups. We will keep on marching on the path of strengthening Indian agriculture and ‘kisan’ (farmers) with full dedication.” At another event, Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar said the “wall of lies built against the farm laws among farmers in a planned way would collapse and the agitators will soon see the truth”. The past five rounds of talks yielded no results with the unions stuck on repeal of laws and the Centre adamant on a middle ground through amendments, including a written assurance on the MSP system. The farmers’ unions in their December 26 communication to the Centre offering to talk on December 29 had sought discussions on “modalities for repealing the three farm laws; mechanism to make remunerative MSP a legally guaranteed entitlement; amendments to the air quality ordinance to exclude farmers from penal provisions and changes in the draft power Bill to protect farmers’ interests”.Expressway march offNew Delhi: The farmers’ unions, in a positive signal, have called off their previously planned tractor march from Singhu and Tikri borders to the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway on December 30.FIR against TikaitPalwal: The police have booked Rakesh Tikait, a farmer leader from UP, over his recent statement.
