20-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt writes to farmer unions inviting them for next round of talks, asks them to choose date||The government on Sunday wrote to the protesting farmer unions inviting them for the next round of talks and asked them to choose a convenient date.In a letter to the union leaders, Agriculture Ministry Joint Secretary Vivek Aggarwal said, "I request those previously invited protesting union leaders to provide details of their remaining concerns and doubts and suggest a date as per convenience for next round of talks." Previous five rounds of formal talks between the government and 40 farmer unions have failed to break the deadlock with the farmers insisting on repeal of the Centre's three laws and camping at various border points of Delhi for over three weeks now.The government intends to convene the next meeting at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi for resolving the issue so that the ongoing protests end at the earliest, Aggarwal said.He said the Centre is making all efforts to find appropriate solution to resolve all the issues raised by the farmers with an open mind.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, UP and some other states are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

20-12-2020||Bolpur (WB)||Triumphant Shah marches through Bolpur denouncing Mamata’s ‘fiefdom’ politics||Having dented Mamata Banerjee’s citadel a day before, a triumphant Amit Shah drove through the Bolpur city centre on Sunday like a victor amid showers of marigold petals and chants of “Jai Shri Ram”.The architect of BJP’s resurgence in the state once considered a Left bastion and then Mamata Banerjee’s fiefdom, asserted the saffron party will form the next government with over 200 seats. West Bengal has a 294-member state assembly.He repeatedly attacked the Banerjee government over “corruption, extortion, and Bangladeshi infiltration” patronised by “bhatija”, a reference to TMC MP and Mamata’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee. And the crowds roared in approval.The cavalcade rolled through the streets of Bolpur, the town associated with Bengali literary and cultural giant Rabindranath Tagore, like a victor’s parade.Shah had virtually pulled off a coup a day before when Suvendu Adhikari, by far the biggest mass leader after Mamata Banerjee, led a parade of nine MLAs and a TMC MP into the TMC.“People of West Bengal are yearning for change as they want to get rid of political violence, corruption, extortion and Bangladeshi infiltration,” Shah said addressing the gathering at Bolpur from a truck decorated with marigold flowers and cloth in shades of saffron.BJP flags fluttered atop homes and tree tops, people showered the cavalcade with flower petals, and green and saffron gulal lent an air of festivity to the roadshow.Women in the crowd that lined the streets shot videos of places teeming with people, as Shah’s entourage crawled its way from Hanuman Mandir to Dak Bunglow, a distance of a km and half, that took more than an hour to complete.Speaking to journalists later, Shah referred to the recent attack on BJP president J P Nadda’s convoy in West Bengal and excoriated the Mamata Banerjee government over the law and order situation in the state.Quoting data, Shah claimed the state had fared abysmally on development indices including health care and education.He alleged Banerjee and the ruling TMC were raking up the “outsider-insider” issue to divert public attention from the failures of the state government, and asserted that a “son of the soil” will lead the state if the saffron party was voted to power.“I think Mamata di has forgotten a few things. Did she call Indira Gandhi, Narasimha Rao outsiders when they used to come to West Bengal when she was with the Congress? Does she want a country where people from one state cannot visit another?” he asked.He also attacked the Banerjee government over alleged Bangladeshi infiltration, and asserted only a BJP government can stop it.Shah, in an apparent attempt to trash the outsider tag, visited places linked to Bengali cultural icons.He visited Shantiniketan and the Visva Bharati University founded by Rabindranath Tagore, tapped his fingers on the arm of the chair he was seated on at the home of Basudeb Das, a baul singer, and had lunch with them.Baul singers are minstrels unique to Bengali culture who sing songs that are a mix of Sufi and Sahaja music of Bengal.Shah’s first port of call on Saturday as part of his “Mission Bengal” was Swami Vivekananda’s ancestral home in Kolkata where he lauded the saint-philosopher for taking India’s culture and ethos to the world.His next stop was the ancestral home of the boy martyr of the freedom struggle Khudiram Bose in Midnapore. Bose was executed in 1908 when he was just 18 years old.“I want to tell those who are doing narrow politics in Bengal that Khudiram Bose is as much a pride of India as he is of Bengal,” he asserted, in an apparent allusion to Mamata Banerjee.

20-12-2020||Ruchika M. Khanna||Social media accounts of farmers' forum blocked, restored after uproar||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 20The social media accounts of the joint forum of farmers were blocked on Sunday evening, within a few hours of a live press conference broadcast through their Facebook page. As the issue snowballed into an embarrassing controversy, the pages were unblocked.Farmer union leaders alleged that their Facebook and Instagram handles -- started last week -- were blocked this evening, within a few minutes of their press conference. Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, who has been at the forefront of the farmers’ agitation, was reportedly doing a live session on Facebook when the social media handle -- Kisan Ekta Morcha -- was blocked.“This once again raises serious questions about the online censorship that this BJP government is indulging in. On one hand, we have the entire hi-tech team of the BJP spreading “misinformation” about the farmers' protest, and on the other, our social media handles have been blocked,” alleged Dr Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union.The farmer unions had launched their social media accounts last week, with a team led by Baljit Singh handling the operation. The idea, say farm leaders, was to counter the "negative narrative" spread by the government and to give their side of the story to the masses, explaining why they were protesting.Read also: Centre asking questions over foreign donations: Farmer unionDelhi cold intensifies but protesting farmers undeterredTomar may meet protesting farmers in a day or two: Amit ShahFarmers at Ghazipur border set up ‘Neki ki divar’ for protestersIncome tax raids on Punjab arhtiyasA number of young farmers, and their friends had launched the official social media account for the farmer unions four days back. Together, the two social media platforms have close to seven lakh followers and these are being used by the agitating farmers to broadcast their opinions and announce the next course of action in the ongoing protest.Baljit Singh, who was heading this IT operation, said it was strange that the pages were blocked without any notification being given by the platforms. “Obviously, the government is behind it. They are scared that our narrative telecast on social media will clear all misconceptions the government is trying to create in the minds of public,” he alleged.The move to block the social media handles comes closely after the Income Tax raids on the commission agents of Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/social-media-accounts-of-farmers-forum-blocked-restored-after-uproar-187134
20-12-2020||Patna||Course of river to be diverted to protect 2,500-year-old Bihar archaeological site: Nitish||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday said that the course of the Kosi river will be diverted to protect an area in the state’s Bhagalpur district, which could be a 2,500-year-old archaeological site.Kumar visited Guwaridih village in Bihpur block, from where ancient terracotta objects such as utensils and ornaments, various tools, triangular bricks, copper coins, and fossils were recovered from beneath the earth.Those items could be remains of the Kushan, Maurya and the Gupta era.Bihar Heritage Development Society’s Executive Director Dr Vijay Kumar Choudhary gave details of the items displayed there to the chief minister.“It is really an ancient and historical place. The remains recovered could be more than 2,500 years old. Everyone should know about the place,” an official release quoted the chief minister as saying.It is important to divert the Kosi river to its old course in order to protect the area and the objects which are still below the earth’s surface from flood and erosion, Kumar said adding that it will be done after proper planning.The river is currently flowing around 300-400 metres from the site, while its old course is about two kilometres from the village.“Legislator Shailendra jee (Kumar Shailendra, the MLA from Bihpur) had informed me about the recovery of ancient items which have historical importance. Even a team of experts, in its preliminary report, have confirmed the place to be a historical one,” Kumar told reporters.If it is confirmed after proper excavation that the site is really of archaeological importance, it will be developed so that people of the country and the world are able to know about it, he said.Kumar Shailendra and a host of officials and historians accompanied the chief minister during his visit to Guwaridih, around 260 kilometres from Patna. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/course-of-river-to-be-diverted-to-protect-2-500-year-old-bihar-archaeological-site-nitish-187131
20-12-2020||Chandigarh||In 1996, as VCOAS I was questioned on need of celebrating 25 years of 1971 victory as it would have upset Pakistan: Gen Malik||Experts warned political leadership against bringing communal or ethnic divisions while also cautioning senior officers in military to be alive and sensitive towards such issues during a session on ‘Pluralism, the Armed Forces-and the Question of Who is an Indian’ at Military Literature Festival on Sunday.   Moderator of the session, Lt Gen NS Brar (retd) said that pluralism as against polarisation “is an increasing contentious issue worldwide”.“No country in the world is as diverse as India. The Indian politics couldn’t and possibly cannot be diverse from exploiting this diversity. But the military in a democracy has apolitical ethos and aspire for professionalism. It appears contradictory but it is not.” General VP Malik (retd), who led India to Kargil victory, said, “As an organisation, the armed forces are proud of achieving and maintaining unity in pluralism and diversity.”While commenting on vote bank politics, he said social engineering was being emphasised more than regional or national development and it should be corrected either through courts or Election Commission.  There should be greater emphasis on celebrating national events than religious ones, he said.Citing an anecdote, Gen Malik said in 1996 when he was Vice Chief of Army Staff, they were not getting permission to celebrate silver jubilee of 1971 Indo-Pak war till the last moment.“During a meeting in cabinet secretary’s office, the first question I was asked, ‘why do you want to celebrate it? Where is the need? It will upset Pakistan’. Such was the thinking of the government of that time,” he said, and added that it was the greatest military victories in centuries. “There have been a number of attempts to bring reservation in the Army. Not just during my time but earlier too. All political leaders need to guard against it. When an organisation is working well, why it should be politicised,” he said. Supporting him, Lt Gen Brar said when we had representation from all states based on their recruitable male population, what was the need of reservation in the military.   Adding a word of caution for politicians promoting division, Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal said, “We have studied in principles of science that if you boil water at 100 degree Celsius, it will turn into steam. The statecraft is also like science. If you do A, B and C, the country will progress and if you do X, Y and Z, the country will go down. You need peace to progress.” On military ethos, Maj Gen AP Singh (retd) said that in military the drill of ‘Sarv Dharam Sthals’ gets a solider to celebrate each other’s religious functions. He added that a person could be a staunch follower of his religion before joining the military but after imbibing ethos of his “paltan” such differences become light.  Col Shantanu Pande, who is serving in the Army, said, “When a soldier from Jat regiment stands at the Siachen Glacier, his community, village and entire country is standing behind him.” He added, “We (military) are not a melting pot. We don’t try to fuse. We retain flavour.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-1996-as-vcoas-i-was-questioned-on-need-of-celebrating-25-years-of-1971-victory-as-it-would-have-upset-pakistan-gen-malik-187127

20-12-2020||New Delhi||Health Ministry calls urgent meeting on Monday to discuss new coronavirus strain in UK||Indian health authorities will meet here on Monday to review data from the UK on the new mutated strain of SARS-Cov2 virus which causes COVID.The joint monitoring group constituted within the Health Ministry will meet with a WHO representative in attendance.The group has the mandate to study evolution of the Covid causing virus in India and renew their advice accordingly on the best treatment and management protocols.Experts on the group meanwhile said India had not seen any significant or worrisome mutation of the COVID19 virus so far and this was good news for indigenous vaccines which are under development.Mutation of the virus could spell challenges for the efficacy of COVID vaccines which have already been licensed and marketed such as the Pfizer vaccine in the UK.“New data on the UK mutation will be studied,” a health ministry source said on Sunday.A number of European countries have banned flights from the UK as the British government warned that the potent new strain of the virus was “out of control” and imposed a stringent new stay-at-home lockdown from Sunday.(Click here for the latest developments on Covid-19 epidemic)A surge in the infection rate caused by the new variant of the coronavirus has led to millions entering a stringent new stay-at-home lockdown in the UK from Sunday, with non-essential shops and businesses now closed.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the new rules at a briefing from 10 Downing Street on Saturday evening, which means a planned five-day “Christmas bubble” of relaxed rules has been cancelled in favour of a new Tier 4 level to the current three-tier lockdown system to try and control the surge in infections being caused by the new mutation of the deadly virus.“It seems that the spread is now being driven by the new variant of the virus,” Johnson said.“We have alerted the World Health Organisation and are continuing to analyse the available data to improve our understanding,” said Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer for England.“There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments although urgent work is underway to confirm this,” he said. --- With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/health-ministry-calls-urgent-meeting-on-monday-to-discuss-new-coronavirus-strain-in-uk-187124

20-12-2020||Chandigarh||Centre asking questions over foreign donations: Farmer union||Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), one of Punjab’s largest farmer organisations protesting against the recent farm laws, on Sunday said it has been asked by a central agency to submit its registration details which allow it to receive foreign funds.The BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) president Joginder Ugrahan and its general secretary Sukhdev Singh revealed about the Union government’s demand alleging that the “Centre is using all tactics as their sole purpose is to defeat the ongoing agitation”.The Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) stipulates mandatory registration of any outfit receiving foreign fund.“A department under the Centre has sent an email which we received through our bank’s branch in Punjab. In the e-mail, it was stated that we should give registration details in respect of these donations from abroad otherwise they will be sent back,” Sukhdev Singh said.“The bank manager showed me the email which has been sent by the Forex Department,” he said.Questioning the timing of the Centre’s demand, Singh said, “It is quite clear that the agitation against the farm laws is against the Centre and they will try to create all hurdles they can in that. They are using all tactics as their sole purpose is to defeat the agitation.”Asked how much foreign fund they have received recently, Singh said, “We are yet to calculate the exact amount.”He said his outfit will be consulting a chartered accountant or an advocate to submit their reply.“The IT Department first conducted raids on ‘arhtiyas’ (commission agents) because they are supporting the farmers’ agitation. Now, as our outfit is a big one, the Centre is targeting us,” said Ugrahan.“They are asking details about NRI funds. The NRIs from Punjab help us with donations from their hard-earned money. They are supporting our agitation, what is the problem in that? Back home too, people support us,” the BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) chief asserted.“But the Centre is targeting us because their sole purpose is to defeat the stir,” he alleged.

20-12-2020||New Delhi||India-Bangladesh border talks to be held in Guwahati from Tuesday||The 51st director general-level border coordination conference between the Border Security Force (BSF) and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) will be held in Guwahati from December 22 to 26, an official statement said.This is for the first time in four decades that the biannual conference will be held outside Delhi.The BSF delegation will be led by Director General Rakesh Asthana while the BGB delegation will headed by the force’s chief Major General Md Shafeenul Islam.The conference will focus on addressing and streamlining mechanisms on how to jointly curb various trans-border crimes and timely sharing of information between both the border guarding forces, an official statement said.There will be deliberations on developmental and infrastructure works, joint efforts for effective implementation of Coordinated Border Management Plan (CBMP) and Confidence Building Measures (CBMs), the statement said.The aim of the talks is to discuss border related issues, and to enable better coordination between both the forces, it said.The last BSF–BGB conference was held from September 16 to 19 in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.The joint India-Bangladesh guidelines for border authorities – 1975 envisage that there should be frequent contact between the border authorities of the two concerned countries to discuss matters of immediate administrative concern.                  An Indian delegation under the leadership of Ashwani Kumar, the then Director General of BSF and the Bangladesh delegation under the leadership of Major General Quazi Golam Dastgir, former Director General BDR (now BGB) met in Kolkata on December 2, 1975 for the first time to discuss mutual border problems.Since then, the meetings between DG BSF and DG BGB were held annually alternatively in India and Bangladesh till 1993.                  During discussions between the home secretaries of India and Bangladesh that were held at Dhaka from Oct 7 to 9 in 1993, it was agreed that the director general-level meetings between the BSF and BGB, were to be a biannual event.In the agreed summary of discussions during the said meeting, it was emphasised that problems in the areas of mutual interests and concerns could be progressively resolved through close contacts and continuing meaningful dialogue at various levels.  Accordingly, DG BSF and DG BGB have been holding border coordination meetings twice a year alternatively at Delhi and Dhaka and joint record of discussions of these meetings are forwarded to the Ministry of Home Affairs after each such meeting, the statement said.Assam’s capital city is the base for BSF’s Guwahati frontier headquarters whose troops guard 495 km of the front, out of the total 4,096 km long India-Bangladesh international border, that runs along this state and some parts of West Bengal.A special BSF water wing that keeps vigil along the riverine border areas including Dhubri in Assam are under the command of this frontier of the border force.The current relations between the two countries and the forces are very good and both the sides will take them forward during these talks, officials said. While the Indian side is expected to take up the issue of joint border security management, fencing of unfenced areas and undertaking effective steps to curb cross-border crimes, the Bangaldeshi border force is expected to take up issues related to killing of its people along the front. BSF DG Asthana, during the last meeting in Dhaka, has said that the killing of criminals along the front will be “made to reduce significantly” even as he reiterated that his troops only fire when their lives are endangered by cross-border miscreants.        He had said that death or apprehension of criminals on the border are “irrespective of nationalities”.      “BSF personnel fire with non-lethal weapon only in self-defence when they are surrounded by large number of miscreants armed with dah (cleaver-shaped knife), sticks etc, and their lives are endangered,” he was quoted as saying by a BSF spokesperson.The two sides are also expected to firm up new standard operating procedures (SOPs) in view of crossing of “significant” number of mentally disabled Indian nationals to Bangladesh, a plan mooted by the BSF chief. The two forces, after the Dhaka talks in September, had also decided to “share real-time information” with each other expeditiously through formal or informal channels regarding human trafficking,  smuggling of narcotics, fake Indian currency notes, cattle, arms, ammunition, explosives, information related to anti-social elements, activities of IIGs (Indian Insurgent groups) and breach or damage of the border fence. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-bangladesh-border-talks-to-be-held-in-guwahati-from-tuesday-187098

It will be started by a team of 11 members at protests sites here, including the Singhu border,” Swaraj India Chief Yogendra Yadav said and added that “we appeal to everyone at all protest sites across the nation to participate in the same”.“Protesters are being threatened by the Haryana government. This is against the direction of the Supreme Court. I urge them to stop harassing farmers from tomorrow,” he said at a press conference at the Delhi-Haryana Singhu border.The Supreme Court on Thursday had said that the farmers’ agitation should be allowed to continue “without impediment” and this court will not “interfere” with it as the right to protest is a fundamental right. It had also put a sole caveat that there should not be any breach of peace either by farmers or police. Read also: Centre asking questions over foreign donations: Farmer unionDelhi cold intensifies but protesting farmers undeterredFarmers at Ghazipur border set up ‘Neki ki divar’ for protestersIncome tax raids on Punjab arhtiyasWhile announcing the next move by protesting farmers after their hunger strike, farmer leader Jagjeet Singh Dalewala said farmers will halt toll collection on highways in Haryana from December 25 to 27.“From December 25 to 27 all toll booths in Haryana will not be allowed by us to collect toll, we will halt them from doing so. On December 27, our prime minister will say his ‘Mann ki baat’ and we want to appeal to people to beat ‘thalis’ during his address,” the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader said at the press conference.The ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s monthly radio address to the nation.On Sunday, the agitating farmers paid tribute to the farmers who lost their lives during this agitation, and condolence meets were organised at different places.Farmer leader and senior BKU member Rakesh Tikait, who was also part of the press conference, said that farmers protesting the new agri laws will celebrate Kisan Diwas on December 23 and “we request people to not cook lunch for a day”.Earlier in the day, the protesting agriculturists paid tributes to farmers who died during the agitation and also lit candles in their memory.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) also wrote to various traders’ unions requesting their support to the ongoing farmers’ agitation.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The three farm laws, enacted in September, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.

20-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt plans to measure depth of Himalayan glaciers to assess water availability||As global warming affects the Himalayas, the Ministry of Earth Sciences is planning to measure the depth of glaciers in the region to assess their volume and gauge the water available in them, officials said on Sunday.The project will start next summer, sometime in June-July, said, M Rajeevan, the ministry's secretary.Ravichandran, the Director of the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), which will execute the project, said the country's remote and high-altitude research centre, Himansh, is also studying the Himalayan climate.The centre was established in 2016."The plan is to first study seven glaciers in the Chandra river basin," he said.The Chandra river is a major tributary of the Chenab river which itself is a tributary of the Indus.The Himalayan glaciers are a major source of water for rivers originating from there. The Himalayan rivers are also a lifeline for the Indo-Gangetic plains, home to several million people.The NCPOR director said while the area of the glaciers is already known with the help of satellites, what needs to be known is the volume. "The purpose of studying the depth of the glaciers is to understand the volume. This will also help us understand the availability of water and whether the glaciers are increasing or shrinking," Ravichandran added.He said they will be using a radar technology that uses microwave signals. It can penetrate through the ice and reach the rocks, something which the satellite images cannot do. The signals, after reflecting on the rocks can help understand the depth."The US and the UK have the technology. So, we will be taking help of that technology," Ravichandran added.At first, the plan is to use helicopters that will carry these radars. Once successful, subsequent studies would be carried out in the rest of the Himalayas.Later, an aircraft or drone could be used depending on the radars for studying other glaciers, Ravichandran noted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-plans-to-measure-depth-of-himalayan-glaciers-to-assess-water-availability-187092

India has conveyed its findings and views on these misrepresentations to the Pakistani side, stated Srivastava.Pakistan has alleged that Indian ceasefire violations this year led to 276 casualties, including 92 women and 68 children.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-rejects-pak-charge-of-shelling-un-vehicle-187091

They also threatened the victims with immediate arrest.The salary of the employees ranged from Rs 25,000 at fresher level to Rs 75,000 at the managerial level. Bonus and other incentives were also paid."The call centre employees disclosed that on an average, each call they managed to 'convert' would last four to five hours and they would not let the victim hang up the call midway. Over the last three years, they managed to defraud two to three persons each day," the police official added.The highest amount siphoned off from a single person was nearly $45,000. Most of the employees have been recruited based on the recommendations of the existing employees and after passing a rigorous interview.The referring employee also got referral bonuses.

20-12-2020||New Delhi||Hill station more enchanting than Davos being planned near Zojila: Gadkari||A hill station, more enchanting than the world-famous Davos in Switzerland, is being planned in the picturesque landscape between the 18-km stretch of Zojila tunnel in Ladakh and Z-Morh tunnel in Jammu & Kashmir, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said.A meeting with Lieutenant Governors of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir is scheduled next week in this connection.“We are planning to make a hill city, more attractive than Davos on the picturesque high-altitude 18 km terrain between Zojila tunnel and Z-Morh tunnel...The world-class project will change the dynamics of both Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir territories and create huge employment,” Road Transport, Highways and MSME Minister Gadkari told PTI.Davos, a town in the Swiss Alps is a popular ski resort and hosts the annual World Economic Forum meeting.Gadkari said a meeting is scheduled with the Lieutenant Governors of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir union territories for taking land as equity.“A nominal rupee one lease rent may be there and they will give land as equity,” the minister said adding that a beautiful hill station could easily come up in the area which witnesses high snowfall.Both Leh-Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir governments will be partners and stakeholders in the project, he said.Zojila Pass is situated at an altitude of 11,578 feet on the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh National Highway and remains closed during winters due to heavy snowfall.Gadkari in October this year launched the construction work on Zojila tunnel and exuded confidence that the strategic project which will provide all-year connectivity between Srinagar valley and Leh and will be completed ahead of schedule before the next Lok Sabha elections,” the Road Transport, Highways and MSME minister said.The project has a completion schedule of six years.Once completed, the tunnel, projected as Asia’s longest, would reduce the travel time from 3 hours to 15 minutes with avalanche-free travel on the Srinagar-Leh section of NH1.The minister said his ministry could save exchequer’s Rs 5,000 crore by cutting the cost of the project which had escalated to Rs 11,000 crore.About the hill station project, the minister said: “We will develop world-class infrastructure there including road, transport, water, communication. We develop and sell the plots by making plans of hotels, restaurants, resorts, convention centres, residential accommodation. This in turn could fetch rich dividends.”         He said the hill station could be a huge success story with public-private investment and will create a large number of jobs changing the economy of the place as it has full potential to attract huge number of tourists including the foreigners.“The design and planning of the hill station will be finalised with a Swiss architect,” he said.He exuded confidence that the project would be profitable venture as it would lead to growth in traffic for the tunnel and would fetch more toll.The government in January this year had awarded the Jammu and Kashmir’s crucial Z-Morh Tunnel project, languishing for long after it was abandoned, to APCO Amarnathji Tunnelway, which will be built at a cost of Rs 2,379 crore.The Z-Morh Tunnel along with the Zojila tunnel are designed to provide all-weather road connectivity to Jammu and Kashmir parts which remain closed during the winters due to heavy snowfall. The project is likely to be completed by 2023. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hill-station-more-enchanting-than-davos-being-planned-near-zojila-gadkari-187083

20-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers at Ghazipur border set up ‘Neki ki divar’ for protesters||It was a normal roadside wall of brick and mortar till a day ago, but now it is called the “Neki ki divar” (wall of goodness).From clothes to toiletries to medicines, the protesters who are continuing their sit-in at Delhi’s Ghazipur border against the Centre’s new agri laws can get these things by writing their needs on this wall.“We have set up a ‘neki ki divar’ today. The idea is to ensure all our farmer brothers and sisters are well equipped to be a part of the protest and keep themselves warm in Delhi’s harsh weather,” Survinder Kisan, one of the protesters at Ghazipur border, said.Two kiosks have been attached to the roadside wall at the protest site.      “At one place people can leave what they want to donate and the other side is for protesters who can collect things as per their needs from the existing stock,” he said.“If what they need is not available, they can write it on the wall and it will be provided to them,” Survinder Kisan, one of the protesters at the Ghazipur border said.Space has been left on the wall and chalks have been kept, so that people can leave messages about their needs, he said, adding a register will also be maintained.They are providing masks, sanitisers, medicines, toiletries, beddings, woollen clothes. “We will add more items. Food is already being served at langars,” Survinder said.The protesting farmers also observed ‘Shradhanjali Diwas’ on Sunday to pay homage to those who had “died during the ongoing agitation”.“We are paying homage to the farmers who lost their lives during agitation. It will be a pity if we let go of their sacrifices without getting our demands met,” said Ratan Jhadola, another protester.The Gazipur Border (Delhi-UP border) was closed on Thursday due to the farmers’ protest.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at various borders of the national capital for almost four weeks now as formal talks between the government and representatives of farmers’ unions remained deadlocked with protesting peasants refusing to accept anything less than a repeal of the three newly enacted laws.The Supreme Court on Thursday acknowledged the right of farmers to non-violent protests and mooted the idea of putting on hold the contentious farm laws to enable negotiations with agitating farmers which was opposed by the Centre saying agriculturists would then not come forward for the talks.

The river has strong currents and is as wide as 15 km.“The war was about liberation over occupation. Pakistan had occupied it (Bangladesh) and we have liberated them. We did not stay beyond 90 days,” said General Mehta, who was commanding the 5th Independent squadron of his regiment, the 63 Cavalry.The General, then a Major, did the task of making his squadron tanks cross the river using them in an amphibious role.The proof is that Bangladesh is a faster growing economy. “We captured Dhaka with just 3000 troops and 30,000 Pakistan Army surrendered”.He recollected how his tank squadron was parked in the grounds of the Dhaka University and at its edge stood a 16th century Nanak Shahi Gurdwara which was damaged by Pakistan Army and its ‘granthi’ was killed. The gurdwara was refurbished and troops got in a new granthi too. The first speech of new leaders of Bangladesh in their officiating capacity was made from the gurdwara.Lt GS Sihota was air operations pilot tasked with Gen Sagat Singh the 4 Corps Commander described how the operation was planned and how the general himself visited each spot to select the best possible location to cross the Meghna after several air reconnaissance sorties.“Sagat Singh could not accept defeat,” he said.Group Captain CS Sandhu, who was commanding the 110 Helicopter unit of the IAF, was tasked with ferry troops across the Meghna said the unit had 10 Mi-4 helicopters supplied by then USSR.“In June 1971, I was told that I would be operating with the 4 Crops and asked to go and see General Sagat Singh, who then advised me to train for night flying.”With just a navigation light, a small cockpit light and with no radio transmission permitted, the task was to coordinate the flying speed of the copters with accuracy to prevent any mid-air crashes. The training was done post-monsoons in 1971.From December 9 to December 15, IAF helicopters lifted 6,000 men from the east bank of the Meghna and dropped them at the west bank of the river for the onward march to Dhaka, he said.Maj Chandrakant Singh, who was in the infantry, described the battle of Akhaura as the toughest battle of the eastern sector. Akhaura is further east of Meghna and close to Tripura, India.By December 6, the troops were moving towards the river line of Meghna.“The planning to heli-drop troops was conveyed over night and it helped us push Pakistan further westwards towards Dhaka. Sagat Singh was clear in his mind that he would use helicopters in an offensive role”.The moderator Squadron Leader Chhina, said these individuals on the panel shaped the destiny of three countries and the operation across the Meghna was a  daring plan which led to the fall of Dhaka.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crossing-meghna-led-to-fall-of-dhaka-in-1971-share-four-officers-187074
20-12-2020||Chandigarh||'Issues of Khalistan movement should have been dealt with politically'||Elucidating upon the events in the 1970s and1980s that led up Operation Bluestar in Punjab, former senior police officers opined that all the issues in those days, should have must have been addressed politically not forcefully as there are no military answers to a political problem. Speaking out his recently published book, 'The Khalistan Conspiracy: A Former R&AW Officer Unravels the Path to 1984', at the Military Literature Festival here on Sunday, the author GBS Sidhu, said that in the late seventies when he was sent to Canada to look into the Khalistani problem, he found no evidence of any large scale movement except for a couple of persons peddling the cause.Sidhu, a former Special Secretary in the Research and Analysis Wing, delved upon a series of interconnected events that led to the subsequent rise of the Khalistan movement and its aftermath. He spoke of the functioning of RAW on this issue, the developments and changes that took place within the agency such as creating new divisions and setting up new overseas stations and the political dimension to the whole episode.He said that his book revolved around a two-phased, top-secret operation, initiated and managed by some senior Congress leaders operating from then prime minister Indira Gandhi's residential office at 1 Akbar Road, New Delhi.Labelling it as Operation Bhindranwale-Khalistan, he said that the first phase involved destabilising the then Badal-led government in Punjab by propping up Jarnail Singh Bhindrawale and creating a fear psychosis, which met little success, while the second phase was aimed at winning the state elections. Sidhu also recalled various aspects related to rising of militancy in Punjab and abroad, especially Canada and other European countries, where Sikhs had migrated to during the 1970s. He also highlighted about the efforts of the union government at that time to settle the issues revolving around militancy. Former Director General of Police, Punjab, GS Aujla, said that the issue was not addressed at the political level at that time and history has given a great lesson that political will was lacking to solve the issue during the period.MPS Aulakh, a former Director General of Police, Punjab who has held prominent positions in the Intelligence Bureau, traced the series of events of that period that began with some incidents of violence in the early 1970s and the role of the establishment in dealing with the emerging situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/issues-of-khalistan-movement-should-have-been-dealt-with-politically-187069
20-12-2020||Lucknow||Trust unveils design of mosque, hospital to be built in Ayodhya||The design of a mosque and a hospital to be built on a 5-acre land in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village allocated by the Supreme Court in the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case was unveiled on Saturday at the IICF office here.The Uttar Pradesh State Sunni Central Waqf Board had formed the trust, Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), to construct the mosque and other utilities on the plot.Prof SM Akhtar of Jamia Millia Islamia, who joined the programme through video conferencing, displayed the designs of the mosque and the 200-bed hospital that will come up at the site.  A community kitchen (saarvjanik bhojnalaya) and a modern library will also be set up in the complex.“The design of the mosque has been prepared using modern technology, and it will be egg-shaped without any dome. The two-storeyed mosque will not have any minaret. Solar power will be installed in the mosque, and around 2,000 people will be able to offer ‘namaaz’ at the same time,” he said.The hospital will provide state-of-the-art facilities, much needed in the surrounding population, with a focus on the needs of the children who are suffering from malnourishment and expectant mothers, the IICF said in a statement here.The building structure will also house the trust office and publication house focusing on research and a publication house of Indo Islamic Cultural-Literature Studies.“The construction work of the mosque was scheduled to begin from January 26, but in this period getting the map approved seems to be difficult, hence the construction is likely to begin from August 15,”  Athar Husain, secretary of Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), told reporters.Asked whether the Uttar Pradesh chief minister will be invited for the foundation laying programme, Hussain said as per Islamic traditions, no big function is organised while laying the foundation stone of a mosque.“After the hospital mosque is constructed, prominent people of the country and the state will be invited,” he said.To a question on the name of the proposed mosque, Hussain said, “The mosque will not be named after any king or nawab. Personally, I have suggested that the mosque be named as Dhannipur Masjid.”He also said the work on the mosque will begin soon. “The mosque will be eco-friendly, and plants from across the world will be planted. The hospital will be a different building, which will a ground floor plus four floors,” he said.Prof Pushpesh Pant, a consultant curator for the archives and museum at the site, said there is a need for a good museum to showcase the joint accomplishments and struggles of the Hindu and Muslim communities in India.After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court had on November 9 last year ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.The mosque in Ayodhya was demolished on December 6, 1992 by ‘kar sevaks’ who claimed that an ancient Ram temple stood at the same site.

20-12-2020||New Delhi||ONGC opens 8th hydrocarbon producing basin of India||State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on Sunday opened India's eighth hydrocarbon producing basin when it started oil flow from a well in the Bengal basin.Oil production commenced from the well Asokenagar-1 in 24 Pargana district, the company said in a statement."The well Asokenagar-1 was completed as an oil producer under early-monetisation plan issued by the Government of India," it said.With this ONGC has discovered and put to production seven out of the eight hydrocarbon producing basins of India, covering 83 per cent of established oil and gas reserves.ONGC is India's largest oil and gas producer contributing 72 per cent of the country's hydrocarbon production. The Bengal basin is spread across nearly 1.22 lakh square kilometres, with nearly two-third of it falling under the waters of the Bay of Bengal.Till now, ONGC has invested Rs 3,361 crore to explore hydrocarbon in the Bengal basin, the statement said adding Rs 425 crore will be spent on exploration activities in the basin in the coming two years. Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan dedicated the new basin to the nation at a function at Asokenagar, West Bengal.Speaking on the occasion, Pradhan congratulated ONGC said the discovery would play a role for India's energy security. With this discovery, around seven decades of relentless endeavours by scientists and engineers of India have borne fruits, giving a new hope for robust development of West Bengal, he said.Bengal basin finally looks set to find a place on the oil and gas map of the world, the statement quoted him as saying.He said that the Indian government is committed to fully support ONGC to make this a  turning point in its strive to bring more oil and gas from the subsurface of West Bengal and help to bring a new phase of prosperity for the state and its people along-with local employment.First oil consignment from well Asokenagar-1 was sent to Indian Oil Corporation Ltd's (IOC) Haldi refinery on November 5."Re-energised by this discovery and eager to script more success stories in the newly awarded Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) acreages in the Bengal basin, ONGC has already set aside a sling of fresh geoscientific activities," the statement said.These comprise appraisal programme of Asokenagar discovery for an area of about 739 square kilometers including 3D seismic, low frequency passive seismic (LFPS) survey and drilling of two wells.Besides ONGC will acquire about 1,300 line km of 2D, 2,900 sq km of 3D and drill 13 wells in the next three years in the newly awarded OALP acreages.ONGC chairman and managing director Shashi Shanker was present at the event held at the production site of Asokenagar, around 50 km from state capital Kolkata. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ongc-opens-8th-hydrocarbon-producing-basin-of-india-187063

20-12-2020||New Delhi||Centre bats for special courts to settle disputes related to infra project contracts||The Law Ministry has asked states to set up special courts to settle disputes related to infrastructure project contracts under a law which was amended two years ago, saying it is very important in improving the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ ranking of both India and states.Citing the examples of the high courts of Allahabad, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, it has suggested other high courts to allocate a special day to make already functioning designated special courts for dealing with infrastructure project litigation as dedicated courts.Section 20B of the Specific Relief (Amendment) Act, 2018, provides for designated courts. But the Law Ministry wants a designated court to function as a dedicated court on special days.In a letter to the registrars general of all high courts last week, the secretary (Justice) in the Law Ministry said the Karnataka, Allahabad and Madhya Pradesh high courts had set up Designated Special Courts instead of Dedicated Special Courts under the Specific Relief Act.The high courts have dedicated special days every week to enable exclusive handling of Specific Relief matters pertaining to infrastructure project contracts.“This arrangement could be considered for adoption in your high court as an alternative measure until the Dedicated Special Courts are set up. This could be helpful in the enforceability of contract both from the perspective of time and cost, thereby stimulating investors’ confidence and creating conducive business climate,” the letter said.In October, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had written to all Chief Ministers pressing for special courts under the Specific Relief (Amendment) Act, 2018.He had pointed out that a new section 20A has been included in the Act for infrastructure project contracts which provides that the court shall not grant injunction in any suit where it appears to it that granting injunction would cause hindrance or delay in the continuance or completion of the infrastructure project.“The foreign investors are of the view that presence of special courts will ensure enforceability of contracts both from the perspective of time and cost and provide the much-needed impetus for creating an investor friendly ecosystem. Therefore, establishment of special courts will circumvent unnecessary hindrance or delay in the continuance or completion of the infrastructure projects,” Prasad wrote.“This,” the minister said, “is very important in improving the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ ranking of both India as also states.”According to Section 20B of the amended law, the state government, in consultation with the chief justice of the high court, will designate one or more civil courts as special designated courts, within the local limits of the area to exercise jurisdiction and to try a suit under the Specific Relief (Amendment) Act in respect of contracts relating to infrastructure projects.

20-12-2020||Bengaluru||Need to bring space, aeronautical sectors closer, have long- term vision: Veteran scientist||ISRO needs to draw up a ten-year vision plan, veteran space scientist G Madhavan Nair said on Sunday and batted for bringing space and aeronautical sectors closer like in China for greater success.He said the Bengaluru-headquartered space agency under the Department of Space (DOS) used to have such a document earlier, but he hasn't seen one extending up to the year 2030."Unless we have a long-term vision, we will be doing a piece-meal", Nair, who served as Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Space Commission and DOS Secretary from 2003 to 2009, told PTI."Of course there are ideas. But somebody has to consolidate and come out with a concrete plan of action for the next ten years", he said.Nair said India's private sector players in the field of space would have to go global as catering to the domestic market alone would not sustain their business.ISRO has good space-based earth observation, communication and satellite technologies which private sector players would have to access but just meeting the national requirement alone would not sustain them."They have to capture the international market. Then only there is a meaning. USD 300 billion (addressable global market) is distributed all over the world", he said."So, when a private venture comes in, its job should be to absorb these technologies, mass produce and sell it economically all over the world", Nair said.In June this year, the government decided to open up the space sector and enable the participation of Indian private sector as a "co-traveller".As per the Cabinet approval, the approach towards space activities in the country will shift from a supply-based model to a demand-based model, according to ISRO.With the creation of Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), the reforms would provide a level playing field for private companies and start-ups, the space agency had said.IN-SPACe is the authorisation and regulatory body under DOS for enabling private players to undertake space activities in the country.To enable enhanced participation of Indian industries in taking up high-tech space related activities, the union government has incorporated NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), a wholly owned Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE), under the administrative control of DOS.Nair expressed the view that India's new policy, as envisaged in the reforms push announced in June, virtually takes away that "single point authority and control (from ISRO)" and shakes up its managerial set-up.Citing the example of China and SpaceX's Elon Musk, Nair stressed the need in India for bringing the space and aeronautical sectors together for greater success of the programmes."China continues to work under single leadership not only for space (sector) but also for aeronautics. So that's something that helps them to consolidate their technology and progress much faster", he said.Similarly, Musk "has everything under one roof. This is what has helped him to progress much faster than any other venture in the world", Nair said.US space agency NASA also had a similar unified structure till the year 2000 or so but thereafter it "got into this kind of policy confusion and managerial confusion (like India with new space policy) and they turned out to be more of a contract manager", according to him."So, Elon Musk filled in that gap (vacated by NASA), he saw the opportunity and created an institution which was equivalent to the earlier NASA and succeeded", Nair said.Asked if he feared ISRO going the NASA way, he said: "I don't want to disappoint any of my (ISRO) colleagues. But with the present type of splintered type of management, we (ISRO) will end up like NASA only."Even now... there are three-four entities created (like IN-SPACe and NSIL)... there has to be a single command over these entities. You cannot allow them to function independently. They have to have freedom to work independently but convergence of all these things has to be with single agency", he underlined. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-to-bring-space-aeronautical-sectors-closer-have-long-term-vision-veteran-scientist-187057
20-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt cancelled winter session to avoid questions on its failures: CPI-M||The CPI(M) Sunday hit out at the government for scrapping the winter session of Parliament over the COVID-19 situation, and said the pandemic is being used as an excuse by the Centre to avoid being held accountable on its "all round failures".In a statement issued here after a meeting of its Politburo, the Left party also demanded the cancellation of the Central Vista project and said the money allocated for this purpose be used to provide "free food and cash transfers to our beleaguered people"."The Politburo strongly denounced the unprecedented cancellation of the Winter Session of Parliament using the pretext of the Covid pandemic," it said.The pandemic is not any problem for the BJP to organise its election campaign and rallies but it has chosen to "avoid being answerable to the parliament", it added."It is thus abandoning its constitutional responsibility of being accountable in the parliament." The Centre has said there will be no Winter Session of Parliament this time because of the coronavirus crisis.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi conveyed the government's decision to Congress MP and its Leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury through a letter. Chowdhury had demanded a short winter session to discuss the three new farm laws, which have triggered protests across the country.The CPI(M) statement added, "Clearly, the Modi government is escaping answering questions over its all-round failure in tackling the pandemic effectively and the economic recession while mercilessly attacking the livelihood of the people and destroying the rights of the working people and the peasantry. The people shall make the government answer."The statement also questioned the need for the Central Vista project at a time when the country is battling a raging pandemic and demanded it be scrapped."Instead of using the available resources to feed our people and provide them with some means of livelihood, this central government is squandering our country's resources in constructing new buildings and the Central Vista including a new parliament. In the midst of this pandemic and mounting people's woes, the Prime Minister laid the foundation for the construction of the new parliament."The CPI (M) demands that this project of the Central Vista be scrapped. The money allocated for this must be transferred to provide free food and cash transfers to our beleaguered people," it said.The party also reiterated its demand for the repeal of the three farm laws and hailed the protest of the farmers against them.The Politburo also called on all its units to organise solidarity actions with the ongoing farm struggles demanding repeal of the agri laws.It also asked its units to support the actions of the working class in the ongoing struggles against "large-scale privatisation" and to conduct a rigorous campaign against the "disinformation being unleashed by the central government on the ongoing people's struggles". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-cancelled-winter-session-to-avoid-questions-on-its-failures-cpi-m-187056
20-12-2020||Kolkata||Defections will not have any impact on TMC's poll prospects: Bengal minister||The TMC on Sunday said there was no need to raise a hue and cry over the recent defections from the party, as "traitors and backstabbers have existed since time immemorial".Addressing a press meet here, state panchayat minister and TMC MLA Subrata Mukherjee said his party is neither shocked nor crestfallen, as such desertions "wouldn't have any impact" on assembly polls, likely to be held in April-May.The TMC does not attach much importance to such developments, he said, and pooh-poohed BJP's "absurd claims" of winning 250 of 294 assembly seats.Political heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari, along with one MP and five MLAs of the TMC, joined the BJP on Saturday, during Home Minister Amit Shah's rally in Midnapore.Hinting that Adhikari had been in touch with the saffron party for quite some time, the minister said, "We did have some information, and therefore we were not stunned or crestfallen. There is no reason to raise a hue and cry over the desertion of Mir Jafars. Such betrayals have been taking place for centuries."History suggests that Mir Jafar, a military commander, aided the British and betrayed Nawab of Bengal Siraj ud- Daulah during the Battle of Plasssey. His name had since been synonymous with treachery."Just with one Suvendu in its fold, the BJP hopes to win 250 seats... Thank God they are not saying they will win all the seats," Mukherjee stated.He further accused the saffron party of "belittling" Bengal's icons, as outrage over flex hoardings with Shah's image on top of that of Rabindranath Tagore continued in Santiniketan, the bard's abode.The party's student wing is staging a daylong sit-in at Jorasanko, the birthplace of the bard in the city, to protest "this insult meted out to Tagore", the minister said.Among others, TMC MP Sudip Bandopadhyay and state minister Shashi Panja have joined the sit-in."People coming from outside cannot insult Tagore, who is the pride of our nation. They cannot belittle our luminaries. The poster (flex) has insulted Tagore and scores of people in the country. It shows that the BJP has no respect for our icons," Mukherjee said.Flex hoardings, with photo of Shah on top, image of Tagore in the middle and that of BJP leader Anupam Hazra underneath appeared in parts of Shantiniketan ahead of Shah's visit to Visva-Bharati and a roadshow in Bolpur.The posters have also drawn the ire of Left parties and Tagore's family members.Amid the outrage, the BJP claimed that the posters, which bore the name of a cultural organisation, were put up by the TMC to "defame the saffron camp".Taking a jibe at BJP national president J P Nadda over the attack on his cavalcade earlier in December, Mukherjee said, "A person of his stature should not spread false information. He has been given Z-category security but still broke protocols. Many unauthorised cars were seen joining his convoy during his visit to Diamond Harbour."The senior TMC leader alleged that Shah was dishing out misinformation about construction of a farmer's house in Paschim Medinipur district."After having lunch at a farmer's residence, Shah said that the house was built entirely from the prime minister's housing project for the poor. The fact remains that the state and the Centre share the burden of this project."A total of 33.87 lakh housing units were built in the state since 2011 at a cost of Rs 39.993 crore, a large portion of which was borne by the state. Figures speak for themselves.It is shameful to dish out facts suiting one's own interest," he said.Claiming that the TMC government, with its 'Duare Sarkar' initiative, has already reached out to over 1.9 crore people, he said "it is a historic development"."This move by our government should not be ridiculed by opposition parties. Similar measures should, in fact, be adopted by the Centre and other states," he added.Reacting to TMC's assertions, BJP state vice president Jaiprakash Majumder said his party has great respect for Bengal's cultural icons."The BJP has great respect for our icons like Tagore, we invoke their words, their views, their writings in our actions. It is the TMC which is falsely implicating our party to give it a bad name," Majumder said.Referring to the outsider tag given to the BJP's top leadership by the state's ruling party, he said, "This is a divisive ploy by the Trinamool for cheap political dividends, aimed at dividing the pluralistic society. The TMC won't be able to mislead people." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defections-will-not-have-any-impact-on-tmcs-poll-prospects-bengal-minister-187054
20-12-2020||New Delhi||COVID: With no clarity on board exam dates, schools conduct pre-board exams in online mode||With no clarity yet on dates of board examinations next year, several schools are already conducting pre-board exams in online mode to ensure that students are fully prepared in time.While the Ministry of Education (MoE) is yet to take a call on the dates of board exams for class 10 and 12, it has already clarified that the exams will be in pen and paper mode only. Schools in Delhi are restricting to online exams while those in Gurgaon, Ghaziabad and Noida are also planning exams in a blended mode as per easing of restrictions by respective state governments. "The CBSE conducted the NEET and JEE exams in 2020 during the pandemic in offline mode. This strongly indicates that students of grade 10 and 12 should prepare themselves for an offline examination. We managed to conduct pre-board exams in online mode, keeping in consideration the safety and security of staff and students. "However, that amount of practice is not enough for pupils, we are exploring adopting the offline mode of conducting exams as per the CBSE guidelines," said Priyanka Barara, Principal, MRG School, Rohini.According to Pallavi Upadhyaya, Principal, DPS-RNE Ghaziabad, the school has conducted online exams for pre-boards but is also planning to hold physical exams in January."Amidst the pandemic, we have been able to complete the academic syllabi for board classes and have conducted the first pre-board examination virtually as per the CBSE guidelines issued according to the paper pattern. "We have conducted virtual sessions with students and parents and have ensured a fair exam. Our system has been designed to keep the exam fair for the invigilator and students," she said.Upadhyaya said the question papers in PDF format are shared on MS platform and the students are given 3.5 hours to attempt the paper. "After attempting the paper, the students are directed to scan and email the answer sheets to the respective teachers. However, the school certainly is planning to conduct the second pre-boards physically at school in January," she said. Rashmi Biswal, principal, DAV Public School, Pushpanjali Vihar, said, "Most board exams are of 80 marks so we want to give students the practice of writing the whole exam and to make the experience simpler for them we have decided to divide each paper into two parts, so students can write and submit both parts in one day with an interval in between, or on two separate days." "We were able to successfully conduct our first set of pre-board exams in online mode around the beginning of December. The upcoming pre-board exams are planned in the offline mode along with practical tests. We will be ensuring full safety guidelines related to distancing and hygiene, and would expect the same cooperation from students and teachers as well," said Sangeeta Hajela, Principal, Delhi Public School Indirapuram.The Central Board of Secondary Education had earlier this month announced that board exams in 2021 will be conducted in written mode and not online.Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. They were partially reopened in some states from October 15.However, a few states have decided to keep them closed in view of a spike in the number of infections.Board exams had to be postponed mid-way in March. They were later cancelled, and results announced on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme.Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' had interacted with students live on December 10 and answered questions about various concerns regarding the conduct of upcoming board exams. He will also be interacting with teachers on December 22, following which a decision on exam schedule is expected.

20-12-2020||New Delhi||Finance Ministry permits 5 states to borrow extra Rs 16,728 crore||The Finance Ministry on Sunday said five states, including Tamil Nadu and Telangana, have been permitted to borrow an additional Rs 16,728 crore following completion of stipulated reforms for ‘Ease of Doing Business’.Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh are the other states which have been permitted to borrow the extra amount.The government had in May decided to link grant of additional borrowing permission to states with reforms undertaken by them to facilitate ease of doing business.The reforms stipulated in the category include completion of first assessment of ‘District Level Business Reform Action Plan’.Besides, elimination of requirements of renewal of registration certificates/approvals/licences obtained by businesses for various activities, at least under certain Acts specified by the Centre, was also part of the reforms.“Five states have so far completed the stipulated reforms in the Ease of Doing Business. These states have been granted permission to mobilize additional financial resources to the tune of Rs 16,728 crore through open market borrowings,” the Ministry said in a statement.To meet the extra fund requirements of states on account of COVID-19 pandemic, the Centre had in May decided to raise the borrowing limit of the states by 2 per cent of their Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), over and above the 3 per cent limit set under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act.However, states were required to complete four specific reforms—implementation of ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ system, ease of doing business reforms, urban local body/utility reforms and power sector reforms—by February 15, 2020 to get the benefits.Such states would get the facility of additional borrowing equivalent to 0.25 per cent of their GSDP for completing each reform. Under this facility, additional borrowing of up to Rs 2.14 lakh crore is available to the states on completion of all the four reforms.“So far 10 states have implemented the One Nation, One Ration Card system, 5 states have done Ease of Doing Business reforms, and 2 states have done local body reforms,” the Ministry added.

20-12-2020||Mumbai||Parliament session cancelled to avoid debate on farmers’ stir: Shiv Sena MP Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday claimed the winter session of Parliament was cancelled to avoid a debate on the ongoing farmers’ protest against the Centre’s new farm laws.In his weekly column ‘Rokhthok’ in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, Raut also questioned the need for spending “Rs 1,000 crore” on the Central Vista project when the Narendra Modi government was not interested in holding debates and Parliament session.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi borders since November 26 against the Centre’s new agri laws.They have been demanding a repeal of the legislations.“The winter session of Parliament has been cancelled so that there can be no debate on the ongoing farmers’ protest near Delhi,” Raut said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 10 laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building and described the event as a “milestone in India’s democratic history”.The revamp envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.Criticising the Centre over it, Raut said the existing Parliament building was fine and could have functioned well for another 50 to 75 years.“Nobody thinks that destroying the legacy and memories of earlier leaders and buildingnew structures to build your own image was too much democracy,” Raut said sarcastically.The Supreme Court on December 7 allowed the Centre to go ahead with the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Central Vista project after the government assured it that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court decides the pending pleas on the issue.“It was said that Parliament is supreme and court had no power to interfere in Parliament. But the Supreme Court has given an order directly interfering with the proceedings of the Maharashtra legislature in a breach of privilege case against journalist ArnabGoswami,” Raut said.On November 6, the SC issued a show cause notice to an assistant secretary of Maharashtra Assembly asking him to explain why contempt proceedings not be initiated against him for his letter to Goswami which seems to “intimidate” him for approaching the apex court on the issue of alleged breach of privilege motion.Raut also said former UK prime minister Winston Churchill worked to defeat his political rivals with all his might, but always treated his defeated opponents with dignity.“Modi and his colleagues should keep Churchill’s example in mind,” the Rajya Sabha member said.

20-12-2020||New York||Nirav Modi’s brother Nehal charged with committing $2.6 million fraud in New York||Nehal Modi, the younger brother of fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi, has been indicted here for fraudulently obtaining diamonds worth over $2.6 million from one of the world’s biggest diamond companies in Manhattan.Nehal, 41, is charged in a New York Supreme Court indictment with Grand Larceny in the First Degree, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, Jr said.“While diamonds maybe forever, this flawed scheme was not, and now Modi will face the clarity of a New York Supreme Court indictment. My Office will not allow individuals who have the privilege of soliciting business in Manhattan’s iconic diamond industry to defraud our businesses or consumers,” Vance said in a statement on Friday.According to the indictment, court filings, and statements made on the record in court, between March 2015 and August 2015, Nehal, a former member of Noble Titan Holdings, made false representations to obtain over $2.6 million worth of diamonds from LLD Diamonds USA on favourable credit terms and consignment, and then liquidated the diamonds for his own ends.The statement said that Nehal, “who comes from a well-known family in the diamond industry”, was initially introduced to the president of LLD Diamonds through industry associates.In March 2015, he approached LLD, claimed that he was pursuing a relationship with Costco Wholesale Corporation and asked the New York-based diamond company to provide several diamonds, worth nearly $8,00,000, to present to Costco for a potential sale.“After LLD provided the diamonds, Nehal falsely informed the company that Costco had agreed to purchase them. Subsequently, LLD allowed him to purchase the diamonds on credit, with full payment required within 90 days. He then pawned the diamonds at Modell Collateral Loans to secure a short-term loan,” the Manhattan District Attorney’s office said.Between April and May 2015, Nehal returned to LLD three additional times and took more than $1 million worth of diamonds for purported sales to Costco. He made a series of payments to LLD but used the majority of the proceeds for personal use and other business expenses.To cover his fraud, Nehal falsely claimed that he was encountering payment issues due to a “Costco fulfilment error” and made repeated promises to satisfy the balance, the statement noted.In August 2015, Nehal returned to LLD again and falsely claimed that Costco wanted to purchase additional diamonds. This time, LLD permitted him to take the additional diamonds on consignment, with terms explicitly stating that he did not have the authority to sell the diamonds without authorisation by LLD.LLD also required a partial payment upfront in the event of a sale, as Nehal’s outstanding balance was nearly $1 million at that time.Nehal had already contacted Modell to arrange an additional loan. After picking up the diamonds from LLD, he pawned the majority of the diamonds at Modell to secure two separate loans and sold the remainder of the diamonds to various retailers at a steep discount from the listed consignment price.LLD ultimately uncovered the fraud and demanded that he immediately pay his outstanding balance or return the diamonds. However, he had already sold or pawned all of the diamonds and spent most of those proceeds. LLD subsequently reported the fraud to the Manhattan DA’s Office.Nehal’s brother Nirav, 49, is wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated $2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case. He remains at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London where he has been lodged since his arrest in March last year.The Interpol has issued a Red Corner Notice (RCN) against Nehal on charges of alleged money laundering that is being probed by the Enforcement Directorate.Nehal was born in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1979, and he knows languages such as English, Gujarati and Hindi, according to the RCN issued by Interpol.The New York Post quoted Nehal’s defence lawyer Roger Bernstein as saying: “This is a commercial dispute” and that “Nehal is not guilty”.A video on The Post website shows Nehal walking with Bernstein, who said “we are not discussing anything about the case” when asked about the Interpol notice.

The Jhatikara Border is open only for two-wheelers and pedestrians.However, for those travelling to Haryana, the Delhi Traffic Police said some borders are opened — the Jharoda border (only for single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera.The Ghazipur border is closed for traffic coming from Noida and Ghaziabad due to the ongoing protest.Those travelling to Delhi could take alternative routes via Anand Vihar, DND, Apsara and Bhopra borders, it said.The Chilla border between Noida and Delhi is open for traffic but for just one carriageway. The other carriageway from Noida to Delhi is closed, according to the traffic police.Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Sabholi and Mangesh borders are closed and commuters are suggested to take alternate routes via Lampur, Safiabad and Singhu school toll tax borders, it said.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at various borders of Delhi for almost four weeks now as formal talks between the government and representatives of farmers’ unions remained deadlocked with protesting peasants refusing to accept anything less than a repeal of the three newly enacted laws.

The NATO recently stepped up its approach to countering disinformation where it has also spoken of China's “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy and the need to counter its claim of being a responsible global leader with a superior governance model.The Indian readout outlined cooperation in two broad subsets: connectivity and infrastructure development, and security issues (counter-terrorism, cyber security, maritime security, humanitarian and disaster relief). The Australian readout, besides going over the ground covered by the MEA and US State Department, mentioned the "Mekong sub-region", comprising Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam as well as maritime security, cyber and critical technology and critical minerals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-nations-discuss-vaccine-distribution-186732

Speaking about the China-Pakistan nexus in 1965, which forms the beginning of the book, he discussed the involvement of the US Central Intelligence Agency and a think tank in Arlington, Virginia, that knew of a Sino-Pakistan plan to capture Kashmir alongside making inroads into Sikkim. It forced India into a defensive negotiating position, which resulted in taking Kashmir in exchange for Sikkim, then a protectorate state.Lt Gen KJ Singh, former GOC-in-C, Western Command, who had earlier commanded corps at Sikkim, where the battles of 1967 had taken place, spoke of the nuances around these battles and the area.Elucidating how the Chumbi valley presented a similar vulnerability to the Chinese, just as the narrow Siliguri corridor posed to India, he spoke about Lt Gen Sagat Singh’s leadership and his own, including placement of artillery guns, helped salvage a difficult situation. The artillery used at Nathu La changed the course of the battle.Army’s role in WW-IIBritish historians on Saturday elucidated the role of the Indian Army in Italy during World War-II and discussed the transition it made from a pre-war colonial force to an army that took on the German might on equal terms. tns||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-forgotten-1967-victory-over-china-takes-centrestage-186734

20-12-2020||Bhartesh Singh Thakur||Need to focus on core technologies: Experts||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 19Experts from military, media and industry called for India to focus on 10-15 core military technologies rather than making each and everything during a panel discussion on “Self-Reliance towards Defence Preparedness” on the second day of Military Literature Festival, 2020.Brig Suresh Gangadharan, former EME officer, said 70-80 per cent of defence equipment was being imported. Self-reliance didn’t mean that the country has to make each and everything. “It means to have a source of inventory at your own terms — at your own cost and time,” he said, calling for cutting imports.He pointed out the lack of trust between industry and government, poor manufacturing environment, old technology and poor R&D as challenges.‘Can’t make everything’70-80 per cent of defence equipment is being imported. Self-reliance doesn’t mean that the country has to make each and everything. —Brig Suresh Gangadharan, Ex-eme officerSenior journalist Vishnu Som said the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)’s image projection “is awful” and highlighted successful indigenous defence equipment which came in the last few decades, including LCA and Brahmos.“Domestic weapons don’t come cheap. They can be cheaper only if there is a humongous production,” he said. However, senior journalist Rahul Bedi differed. “There are multiple agencies which are tasked with indigenisation, which is a problem.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-to-focus-on-core-technologies-experts-186737

We will meet more often and will have more conversations,” Sonia told a group of 19 leaders, including her loyalists and seven dissenters who wrote to her this August seeking organisational overhaul.Five-hour meetingWe are all one big family and will together strengthen the party. We will meet more often & have more conversations. —Sonia Gandhi, Cong PrezAt the discussion lasting five hours, Gandhi associates AK Antony, Ashok Gehlot, Pawan Bansal and Ajay Maken urged Rahul Gandhi to lead the Congress from the front, to which the latter said to a round of applause, “I am ready to take over any responsibility the party gives me.” With this utterance, Rahul shed his long-held position about non Gandhi becoming the Congress chief, a position he held since resigning from the post after the Lok Sabha debacle in May last.Rahul, however, added, “This issue should be left to the internal electoral process which is under way.”The meeting, sources said, was cordial and principally shaped as “an ice breaker“ between Sonia and the rebels whom she had denied a physical interface for four months since they wrote to her in August.Today’s was in fact the first physical meeting Sonia held with leaders since the COVID-19 outbreak in India.The dissenters articulated the suggestions they had earlier flagged in their letter to Sonia Gandhi.No dissidence: BansalThere is no dissidence in the party. Everyone gave suggestions on strengthening the party. —Pawan Bansal, AICC TreasurerAll of them spoke, including Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Prithviraj Chavan, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor and Vivek Tankha, and said their intention was to “strengthen the Congress to take on the BJP.”Sonia assured the letter writers of a continuum of dialogue and meetings to resolve their concerns, with Azad later urging for “honesty and integrity in the resolution process.”Speaking to The Tribune on the meeting outcomes, AICC Treasurer Pawan Bansal, later said, “Congress president and Rahul Gandhi spoke of unity and of the Congress being a family. There is no dissidence in the party. Everyone gave suggestions today on strengthening the organisation to fight the BJP which is undermining the idea of India.”Chavan, one of the letter writers, however, said “This was the first of the many meetings that will be held to address issues being raised by leaders. A ‘chintan shivir’ will also be held.”It’s learnt that Sonia told the gathering she would call a conclave like the ones in Shimla and Panchmarhi (held when Congress was in the opposition) soon as COVID abated. The suggestion on the conclave, sources said, came from Manish Tewari.It’s further learnt that Sonia spoke of the organisational election process being underway and agreed to leaders’ advice that the working committee should meet more often.The meeting was crucial as it came in the backdrop of Congress setbacks in Bihar, Telangana and more recently Goa.Prominent absentees from the meeting were Kapil Sibal from the dissenters’ side and KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala from the side of Gandhis.Priyanka Vadra was also in attendance, along with Ambika Soni, P Chidambaram and Kamal Nath.Who said whatSonia Gandhi: Will plan a ‘chintan shivir’ to expose BJP’s governance failures and debate ideological issues. Will hold more such meetings in the future.Ashok Gehlot, Ajay Makan, Pawan Bansal, AK Antony: Rahul Gandhi should take over as Congress presidentRahul Gandhi: Ready for any role the party gives meP Chidambaram: The Congress has become a General Secretary specific party.

The reforms that have now taken place are so visible that people are saying ‘Why not India’? The PM said this was true for India’s start-up infrastructure as well as labour laws and the legal set-up.The PM Modi has been speaking nearly every day at industry conventions and conferences with overseas entrepreneurs as the government seeks to draw $100 billion worth of FDI inflow in the next two years.Unlike at FICCI earlier this week, PM Modi dwelt briefly on the agriculture sector where reforms brought by his government six months back has started benefiting farmers.Besides investment, the Prime Minister also spoke on the need for the private sector to increase investment in research and development (R&D).

Adhikari vowed to oust the Mamata Banerjee regime in the next polls. He was handed over the BJP flag by Union Home Minister Amit Shah at a rally in Paschim Medinipur district.Shah claimed leaders of rival parties were joining the BJP because of TMC’s “politics of appeasement”. He was certain the BJP would win over 200 seats and form the next government in West Bengal.Adhikari accused the TMC of being a party of traitors. “I am being called a traitor by those who themselves are traitors. Had the BJP not been there, the TMC would have never come into existence. Had the TMC not received the blessings of the then PM(Vajpayee), none of the TMC leaders would have dared to step out of their homes for the polls,” he claimed.”Adhikari’s father and brother are TMC MPs. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-tmc-leader-9-mlas-join-bjp-at-amit-shah-rally-186780
20-12-2020||---||General category open to all: Supreme Court||New Delhi, December 19Maintaining that the general category vacancies in government employment were open to all, including those from reserved categories, the Supreme Court (SC) has said disallowing meritorious candidates from reserved categories to migrate to general category would amount to communal reservation.“The principle that candidates belonging to any of the vertical reservation categories are entitled to be selected in the open or general category is well settled. It is also well accepted that if such candidates belonging to reserved categories are entitled to be selected on the basis of their own merit, their selection cannot be counted against the quota reserved for the categories for vertical reservation that they belong,” a Bench of Justices UU Lalit, Ravindra Bhat and Hrishikesh Roy said.Justice Bhat, who wrote a separate concurring judgment, said, “The open category is not a ‘quota’, but is rather available to all women and men alike.”The court said reservations, both vertical and horizontal, were methods of ensuring representation in public services. These were not to be seen as rigid “slots”, where a candidate’s merit, which otherwise entitles her to be shown in the open general category, was foreclosed, as the consequence would be, if the state’s argument was accepted. Doing so would result in a communal reservation, where each social category is confined within the extent of their reservation, thus negating merit. “The open category is open to all, and the only condition for a candidate to be shown in it is merit, regardless of whether reservation benefit of either type is available to her or him,” it ruled.The ruling came on petitions raising the issue of the correct method of filling the quota reserved for women candidates (horizontal reservation) for the selection of constables in Uttar Pradesh. The petitioners, OBC candidates and most of them women, complained that the Uttar Pradesh Government had failed to correctly apply the rule of reservation in selection of constables and denied them the benefit of “migration” to the general category vacancies as they had secured the marks needed to qualify for the open category.Reserved category candidates having secured more marks than the last ranked general category candidate should be given employment under the general category, it said. It said, “Any selection that results in candidates getting selected against open/general category with less merit than the other available candidates will certainly be opposed to principles of equality.”Akin to communal reservationThe apex court said disallowing meritorious candidates belonging to reserved categories to migrate to general category would amount to communal reservation||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/general-category-open-to-all-supreme-court-186782
