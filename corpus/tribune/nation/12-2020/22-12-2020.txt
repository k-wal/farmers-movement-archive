22-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmer unions to address queries on agri laws via webinar||The newly-formed social media cell of the farmers’ collective announced on Tuesday that a web conference would be conducted to address all queries regarding the three new farm laws and the protest against it.The webinar, to be hosted on video conference platform Zoom on Thursday noon, will be open for the first “10,000 people” registering on the link, which they would disclose. Those who cannot make it to the first 10,000 can watch the webinar on social media platforms, it said.“Senior farmer union leaders who are key members of the movement will be answering all sorts of queries during the webinar—be it on the farm laws or the ongoing agitation,” Baljeet Singh Sandhu, social media cell head and Majha Kisan committee vice president, said at a press conference at the Singhu border.Sandhu also invited the likes of actors Kanagana Ranaut, Mukesh Khanna and Payal Rohatgi, who have been actively voicing their opinion against the farmers’ protest, to participate in the webinar and debate the matter.Kisan Ekta Morcha, which is the official social media account, publishes updates on the farmer protests, videos of speeches given by union leaders and also counters what they call is “propaganda” pushed by the Centre.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other states are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.Enacted in September, the three contentious laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that would remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the legislations would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the minimum support price and end the traditional wholesale market system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-unions-to-address-queries-on-agri-laws-via-webinar-188013
22-12-2020||New Delhi||Polls cash case: EC to call top MP officials to seek progress report||The Election Commission would call top officials of the Madhya Pradesh government early next month to apprise it on its orders to lodge “criminal action” against three IPS officers and others whose alleged role in the use of black money during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls came to the fore after the I-T Department raided close aides of former chief minister Kamal Nath.Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora made it clear that the officials would “not be summoned” but called by the Commission.“The Commission would call the chief secretary and the home secretary of Madhya Pradesh before January 10 to discuss what steps have been taken... They would be called to apprise (the Election Commission) about the progress made,” Arora told PTI on Tuesday.On December 16, the poll panel had issued a statement, saying that it has asked the Madhya Pradesh chief electoral officer to lodge “criminal action” against three Indian Police Service officers and others whose alleged role in the use of black money during the 2019 general elections came to the fore after the Income Tax Department raided close aides of Nath.The Commission has also asked the Union Home secretary to initiate “appropriate departmental action” against the IPS officers and also asked the Madhya Pradesh chief secretary to undertake a “similar action” against a state police service officer.The poll body had said it was recommending action after it “deliberated” upon a report sent to it by the CBDT (Central Board of Direct Taxes) intimating it about the Income Tax Department’s “search operations in Madhya Pradesh and its findings of extensive use of unaccounted cash during the 2019 general elections”.The CBDT is the administrative authority for the I-T Department.An EC statement said the CBDT report informed the Commission about certain entities and individuals who were engaged in “unauthorised and unaccounted cash contributions to individuals on behalf of a certain political party, which was reported to be corroborated during searches against persons by the tax department”.While the EC did not name the party, it has been widely reported that the CBDT report referred to the Congress.“The report specifically mentions instances of prima facie involvement/nexus of public or government servants in unauthorised or unaccounted cash transactions,” the statement said.It said the EC has directed to forward the copy of the October 28 CBDT report “to the Chief Electoral Officer, Madhya Pradesh, to lodge criminal action before designated authority, which is the Madhya Pradesh economic offences wing, against concerned for the violation as per extant electoral and other relevant laws”.Election Commission sources identified the three IPS officers as Sushovan Banerjee, Sanjay Mane, V Madhu Kumar and state police service officer as Arun Mishra.The tax department had conducted raids at 52 locations in Madhya Pradesh and Delhi in April last year and those searched included Nath’s former officer on special duty (OSD) Pravin Kakkar, adviser Rajendra Miglani, Ashwani Sharma, executives linked to his brother-in-law’s firm Moser Baer, a company of his nephew Ratul Puri and others.The CBDT, on April 8 last year, had said in a statement that tax sleuths recovered Rs 14.6 crore “unaccounted” cash and seized diaries and computer files of suspect payments after the raids.It said the department detected a trail of Rs 20 crore suspect cash allegedly being moved to the “headquarter of a major political party in Delhi”.“Searches in Madhya Pradesh have detected widespread and well-organised racket of collection of unaccounted cash of about Rs 281 crore through various persons in different walks of life, including business, politics and public service.“A part of the cash was also transferred to the headquarter of a major political party in Delhi, including about Rs 20 crore, which was moved through hawala recently to the headquarter of the political party from the residence of a senior functionary at Tughlak Road, New Delhi,” the CBDT had said.While the CBDT had neither identified the political party nor the senior functionary, Nath had earlier said the action against his aides was politically motivated. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/polls-cash-case-ec-to-call-top-mp-officials-to-seek-progress-report-188008
22-12-2020||New Delhi||Bank fraud: ED says accused who defrauded IOB paid managers’ flight, hotel bills||Probing a Rs 299-crore Indian Overseas Bank loan fraud case, similar to the alleged USD 2 billion worth PNB swindle, the Enforcement Directorate has found that the accused “paid” for the air travel and hotel stay of a senior bank manager and his family as kickbacks.The central probe agency said “lapses” were also detected on the part of at least three managers—Anil Kumar, P C Rana and N Chokalingam—of the IOB branch in Chandigarh, “as well as the concurrent auditors”.       The ED case is related to its criminal money laundering investigation “in a case related to buyers credit fraud of Rs 299.14 crore at the IOB, Chandigarh”.The agency took cognisance of an FIR filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), to file a case under various sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against IOB Assistant Manager Ashu Mehra, proprietor of heights international company Amanpreet Singh Sodhi, owner of vision procon company Dinesh Kumar and directors of a firm saibhakti impex Pvt ltd—Gaurav Kirpal and Aman Kirpal.“A charge sheet was filed by the CBI against the accused revealing wrongful loss to the tune of Rs 299.14 crore to the bank on account of fraudulent unpaid LOUs (letter of undertaking) and that an amount of Rs 11.36 crore commission for 24 LOUs was also not received by the bank,” the ED said.A similar modus operandi of misusing the LOUs has been alleged by probe agencies in the Brady House branch (Mumbai) of the Punjab National Bank (PNB) that led to a fraud estimated to be worth USD 2 billion, which came to light in 2018.Diamond merchants Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi have been alleged as the masterminds of this swindling, identified as one of the biggest case of bank loan fraud in the country.                 About the latest case, the ED said its probe found that the accused Amanpreet Singh Sodhi, Dinesh Kumar and Gaurav Kirpal “conspired” with IOB assistant manager Ashu Mehra “for illegal diversion of funds to the bank accounts of fraudulent buyers on behalf of Indian import firms”.“These amounts were first credited by the overseas funding bank—Bank of Baroda, Bahamas and PNB, Dubai—into the HSBC Account of the Hong Kong-based export company Colour Wave (HK) Ltd though no imports took place.”  “The accumulated amount in the HSBC account was further remitted to India in the accounts of accused companies by showing it as adjustments for exports of third-party payments,” the ED alleged.It was found, the ED said, that the goods were either exported by the accused to different buyers or consignees by resorting “to gross over-valuation or in some cases there was “no export”.“In this manner the accused have generated the proceeds of crime by resorting to trade-based money laundering,” the ED claimed.It was found that “payments for the air travels and hotel stays of the accused Ashu Mehra and his family members was borne by accused Dinesh Kumar and Gaurav Kirpal”, the agency said.The agency has attached properties worth over Rs 91 crore of various accused involved in the case till now, with an attachment of Rs 6.03 crore being done recently. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bank-fraud-ed-says-accused-who-defrauded-iob-paid-managers-flight-hotel-bills-188005

22-12-2020||Satya Prakash||‘Judiciary has put personal liberty, human rights on back-burner’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 22The Supreme Court’s handling of cases relating to personal freedom came in for severe criticism on Tuesday from former Supreme Court Judge Madan B Lokur, former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, former Law Minister Kapil Sibal and activist Medha Patekar who questioned the court’s priorities in handling of issues of human rights and personal liberty.“Yes you are right…unfortunately in the last two years or so I think the idea of social justice has really gone on the backburner. And unfortunately this year because of the pandemic that certain situations had arisen where I think the Supreme Court should have been far more active than it ever was to look after the interest of people…migrants for example persons who were thrown out of jobs variety of people from all walks of life…“But I think the Supreme Court could have definitely done much better that it did this year. So really I would agree with you that over the last couple of years the idea of social justice has gone on the backburner. It’s unfortunate. I suppose we have to live with it,” Justice Lokur – who used to head the social justice bench – said during a panel discussion on ‘Personal Freedom and Judiciary’ moderated by TV journalist Rajdeep Sardesai.The panel discussion was organised on launch of ‘In pursuit of Justice: An autobiography’ by late Justice Rajindar Sachar, a former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court.Sibal was scathing in his criticism of the top court for its handling of issues of detentions in Kashmir, petitions against CAA and handling of the migrant crisis.“The fact of the matter is that the Supreme Court has lost its way. Not just two years ago but several years ago. What’s happening in the Supreme Court today is that issues that are highly political are taken up.  Issues that deal with liberty are brushed under the carpet. There were people in Kashmir who were detained for over a year…the Supreme Court took no notice of it,” Sibal said.Agreeing with Justice Lokur, Rohatagi said, “The prime place which was given in the Constitution—and the Supreme Court is the conscience keeper of the nation—to cases of infraction of liberty and the like have been pushed back and what comes to mind are cases of habeas cases and other cases which are now taking anywhere between six months to a year to decide.“They were always treated with utmost priority. A habeas corpus case was taken up immediately and decided within two weeks. But that’s not so. Other thinks seem to have taken over.”However, Rohatgi added a word of caution, saying, “It’s very well to blame somebody. But I think the Supreme Court has also taken on too much. The role of a traditional court has long been lost. If you take on too much sometimes your priorities differ and this kind of inconsistencies come but yes, the Supreme Court should shrug off this inaction on these kind of cases and take them up vigorously.”Both Sibal and Patekar said corporate matters were being given more importance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judiciary-has-put-personal-liberty-human-rights-on%C2%A0back-burner-187997

22-12-2020||Mumbai||Sena head office to be epicentre of political earthquakes: Sanjay Raut||The Shiv Sena Bhavan in Mumbai will emerge as the epicentre of future “political earthquakes” in Maharashtra, party MP Sanjay Raut said on Tuesday while hitting back at the BJP over claim of its leaders of “exodus” from other parties.He also said that the people of Maharashtra wanted Sena president and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to be part of national politics while remaining rooted in the state.“We have been hearing for the past some days that their party (BJP) is intact and none of its leaders will desert. Wait for some days, you will know who defects. Workers will come (to the Shiv Sena). But keep one thing in mind that the Shiv Sena Bhavan is going to be the epicentre of future political earthquakes,” Raut told reporters.He made these remarks immediately after some workers of the BJP joined the Uddhav Thackeray-led party at its head office in Dadar in central Mumbai.On Monday, senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis reportedly hinted at ‘exodus’ of cadres from other parties to the BJP in future.Raut said MVA constituents Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress are united, strong and are working in harmony.“People of the state feel that the MVA government will last for 20 to 25 years and not for the next four to five years. They (the people) feel Uddhav Thackeray should play the country’s politics as well as in the state....And it will happen,” the chief spokesperson of the Sena said.He said Maharashtra faced several crises over the past one year and people endured difficult period, due to the coronavirus pandemic.“But satisfaction which is visible on their faces is only because Uddhav Thackeray is the CM. The people think Thackeray communicates with them and takes their care. The chief minister has given them confidence to fight the crisis.And because of that confidence, several workers are coming to us,” Raut said.Taking a dig at the BJP, Raut said the opposition party should be given “Bharat Ratna” for criticising the Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over its decision to impose a night curfew.On Monday, the state government declared a night curfew from 11 pm to 6 am in municipal corporation areas (cities) from December 22 to January 5 as a precautionary measure amid growing concerns over the new coronavirus variant spreading in Britain.Raut said the decision to impose a night curfew was related to the safety of the common people and asked the BJP to be aware of happenings in the world.“The BJP may not be aware of what is happening around the world as Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has not gone abroad for several months. They should get that information,” he said.Asked about the BJP’s claim that the MVA government was feeling “helpless” on handling the pandemic, Raut said: “I can see the helplessness of the (Central) government on the issue of farmers. Haven’t seen such helplessness during the past 50 years”.He asked Sena workers to get the party elected in the elections to the Nashik Municipal Corporation.

22-12-2020||New Delhi||Central vista project marked by degree of executive highhandedness: 69 ex-bureaucrats to PM||A group of former civil servants have written an open letter to Prime Minster Narendra Modi expressing dismay over the central vista redevelopment project, which, they alleged, has been “marked by a degree of executive highhandedness” from its very inception.The 69 retired bureaucrats, under the aegis of Constitutional Conduct Group,  claimed that the country’s public health infrastructure was crying out for investment and asked why this “wasteful and unnecessary project must take precedence over social priorities like health and education”.The signatories included former IAS officers Jawhar Sircar, Jawed Usmani, NC Saxena, Aruna Roy, Harsh Mander and Rahul Khullar, and former IPS officers AS Dulat, Amitabh Mathur and Julio Ribeiro.“Notwithstanding the specious reasoning as to why a new Parliament building is at all necessary, it is a matter of great dismay that at a time when we are faced with an economy in perilous decline and a pandemic which has brought untold misery to millions, the government has chosen to invest vast sums on a project which represents nothing but the pursuit of pomp and grandeur,” they said.The central vista redevelopment project in the heart of the national capital envisages construction of a new Parliament complex, government buildings for central ministries, a new enclave for the vice president and a new prime minister’s office and residence among others.The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is executing the project, has revised its estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.“We are writing to you today to convey our dismay at the manner in which your government, and you, as its head, have chosen to completely disregard the rule of law in the matter of the Central Vista Redevelopment project. This project, from its very inception, has been marked by a degree of executive highhandedness rarely witnessed before,” alleged the letter.“Of particular concern is the manner in which environmental clearances were obtained for a plan which treats the green spaces and the built heritage of the central vista as an unnecessary hurdle to the achievement of objectives driven by monumental ambition,” it further alleged.The former civil servants also wondered what locus standi the prime minister has to lay the foundation stone of the Parliament building.“The prime minister is the head of the executive, not of the legislature. For a building that will accommodate the two Houses of Parliament, the appropriate protocol would have been for the President of India to lay the foundation stone. This was a clear instance of breach of constitutional propriety,” the letter alleged.Modi had on December 10 laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building.The signatories also alleged “brazen impropriety” in going ahead with the construction of the new Parliament building while the matter is still sub judice. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/central-vista-project-marked-by-degree-of-executive-highhandedness-69-ex-bureaucrats-to-pm-187992
22-12-2020||New Delhi||44% rural Indians willing to pay for COVID-19 vaccine; 51% consider coronavirus ‘Chinese conspiracy’: Survey||Nearly 44 per cent of rural Indians are willing to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine, while more than half of the population in India’s villages believe the coronavirus crisis is a “conspiracy by China’, a survey showed on Tuesday.The survey, conducted by Gaon Connection among 6,040 rural respondents across 60 districts in 16 states and one union territory, found that 36 per cent said they would not want to pay for it. The remaining 20 per cent said they are yet to decide on paying for the vaccine.Of those who were willing to pay, two-third said they can pay up to Rs 500 for two doses of the vaccine, whenever it is available.Meanwhile, at least 51 per cent of rural respondents called the coronavirus crisis a ‘conspiracy by China’ and about 18 per cent saw it as the government’s failure.Nearly 20 per cent said they consider it an ‘act of God’, 22 per cent blamed the negligence of the people for the pandemic and 18 per cent did not share any view.The face-to-face survey was conducted by the rural media platform’s surveyors between December 1 and December 10. It said the selection of states, covering all regions of the country, was based on the prevalence of COVID-19 as per the data of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.Gaon Connection said the survey has a margin of error of 5 per cent and a 95 per cent confidence level.The states covered under the north zone included Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana.States in the south zone included Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka. The west zone included Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh; whereas the east-northeast zone included Odisha, Assam, West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh.Around one-fourth of all respondents said that samples from at least one member of their household was taken for testing of COVID-19.The proportion of such households was the highest in the east-and-northeast zone, whereas it was the lowest in the north zone.Of the 25.9 per cent respondent households who reported at least one family member getting tested for COVID-19, more than half (59 per cent), said at least one person in their household had tested positive.Overall, 15 per cent of the total 6,040 respondent households reported at least one person in their household/friend circle testing positive for COVID-19.When asked if they had to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine, who in their household/family would they vaccinate first, the three most selected options were: old parents (33.3 per cent), children (26.5 per cent) and the main earner of the family (16 per cent).The majority of the rural respondent households suggested prioritising doctors and nurses for administering the COVID-19 vaccine, followed by frontline health workers such as ASHAs and ANMs (Auxiliary Nursing and Midwifery), sanitation workers, and police personnel.The survey also found that COVID-19 has also changed the food habits of rural citizens with almost 70 per cent of respondents (of the 54 per cent total respondents who said they consumed non-veg food items) saying they had stopped eating outside food.Over 33 per cent said they had started eating more vegetables, whereas 30 per cent said they were eating more fruits. However, every fourth BPL respondent household said its family members were not getting enough food to eat, it said.At least three vaccine candidates are being examined by the Indian authorities for emergency use authorisation, while a few more are currently in different stages of development and trials.The number of daily new coronavirus infections reported in the country was recorded below 20,000 after nearly six months on Tuesday while the COVID-19 active caseload has fallen below 3 lakh.India’s overall COVID-19 caseload stands at over 1 crore, while 1.46 lakh have died so far. More than 96 lakh have recuperated from the disease, pushing the national recovery rate to 95.65 per cent, while the COVID-19 case fatality rate now stands at 1.45 per cent. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/44-rural-indians-willing-to-pay-for-covid-19-vaccine-51-consider-coronavirus-chinese-conspiracy-survey-187990

22-12-2020||New Delhi||Ramani should have taken recourse to law, not social media allegations, Akbar tells court||Former Union minister M J Akbar Tuesday told a Delhi court that journalist Priya Ramani should have taken recourse to law instead of making allegation of sexual misconduct against him on social media.Akbar made the submission through senior lawyer Geeta Luthra during the final hearing of a criminal complaint filed by him against Ramani for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct 20 years ago when he was a journalist.Ramani had made allegation of sexual misconduct against Akbar in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018.During the hearing, the counsel termed the delay in lodging an FIR as an “important factor”.“What can you do on social media? You can’t fight with everyone. People on responsible position like journalists should not make such allegations on social media. They should come to court instead... You (Ramani) did not take the recourse to any law,” she said.The counsel further said that Ramani named Akbar in 2018 without any good faith or bona fide.“She names him in 2018 for reasons where I can’t see any good faith or bona fide. Everyone’s reputation is dear to them. There are persons to whom their reputation is dearer than life,” the counsel said.The Court will hear the matter further on December 24.Ramani had earlier said her allegations of sexual misconduct against Akbar were her truth and made in public good.Ramani disputed Akbar’s claims of having a stellar reputation “that had been tarnished by her allegation”.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani’s allegations in October 15, 2018.Akbar resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.He had earlier told the court that Ramani defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during the #MeToo campaign against him.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.

22-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi airport has storage capacity of 2.7 million COVID-19 vaccine vials at any given time: CEO||The Delhi airport has a storage capacity of 2.7 million vials of COVID-19 vaccine at any given point of time, said a top official on Tuesday.Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, the CEO of Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), said at a press briefing that the vaccine distribution programme, which was likely to begin from January, had been named 'Project Sanjivani' by the airport operator."We have a storage capacity of around 2.7 million vaccine vials at any moment of time. If we are able to conduct two rounds of distribution during a day, we can distribute 5.4 million vials daily," he said.The Centre had last Tuesday said that three firms – Bharat  Biotech, Serum Institute of India and Pfizer – have sought emergency approvals for their vaccines and they were being examined by the COVID-19 subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO).Jaipuriar said at the briefing that the Pfizer vaccine had to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius, and therefore, the Delhi airport did not have any storage facility for that vaccine."However, if you go through the literature at the Pfizer website, it says that the vaccine can be stocked with dry ice for 30 days and at 2-8 degrees for five days. So, total 35 days are available for distribution, which should be sufficient and we are totally geared up for that," he added.The vaccines of Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech can be stored at regular fridge temperatures.The Delhi airport has two cargo terminals with cool chambers where temperature can be set anywhere between -20 degrees Celsius to 25 degrees Celsius."These vaccines can come in an envirotainer which can be plugged in to keep the vaccines cool. We have made about 60 plug points where they can be plugged in and they can stay there at the same temperature," Jaipuriar noted.The Delhi airport has also made arrangements for dry ice supply so that the vaccine can be kept stable for a longer period, he said.All these measures are part of Project Sanjivani."We have made a separate entrance for trucks that are likely to carry vaccines. There is a truck management system where the slot can be booked in advance," said Jaipuriar.He said the company was looking at various options so that the vaccine batches get quick approvals from different government bodies at the airport so that they could be sent out as soon as they land at the airport.

22-12-2020||New Delhi||New coronavirus strain still not found in India:  Health official||India has not witnessed any significant mutation of COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV2 virus so far, the central government said on Tuesday.  adding that it was stepping up efforts to conduct  genome sequencing of the samples of recent travellers from the UK.“Our labs have done genome sequencing of thousands of viruses isolated in the country and so far there is no signal or any significant mutation in India. But because we live in an interconnected world and Australia and Denmark have reported variants of the virus, we have prioritised genome sequencing of recent samples from incoming passengers from the UK,” VK Paul, a member of NITI Aayog, said.He said the UK mutation was not a cause for worry but yes it did call for heightened vigilance to ensure India doesn’t squander the gains made so far in pandemic management.“It’s not a cause for panic. We can say that based on our deep assessment of current data. The new variant of the virus is more transmissible but doesn’t have a greater propensity for death, hospitalisation or severe disease. Nor does it impact the potential of vaccines being developed in India and available elsewhere in the world. So yet we need to be watchful to preserve our gains by intensifying COVID appropriate behaviours and avoiding crowding but no cause for panic,” Paul said.The new variant of the COVID virus as reported by the UK has 17 changes, the most significant being to its spike protein which the virus used to bind to human cells.The UK mutation has increased the ability of the virus to infect which in itself is a challenge, said Paul calling for caution on a day when India issued fresh protocols to test everyone coming in or transiting through the UK through the last four weeks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-coronavirus-strain-still-not-found-in-india%C2%A0-health-official-187958

22-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Ishrat Jahan alleges in court beating, harassment by jail inmates||Former Congress Councillor Ishrat Jahan, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a north-east Delhi riots case, alleged before a court here on Tuesday that she was beaten badly by inmates at Mandoli jail and was continuously facing harassment in prison.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat directed the jail authorities to take immediate steps to ensure Jahan's security and ensure that she was not harassed further for bringing her complaints before the court.The court sought a detailed report from the prison authorities on Wednesday on the steps that have been taken to address the issue and to also state if shifting to her to another jail was required.When the judge asked the Assistant Superintendent of Mandoli jail whether such an incident has occurred, she confirmed it and said necessary steps have been taken.To this the judge told the jail official, “She (Jahan) seems to be in a state of utter fear. Please talk to her immediately and understand the situation. File a detailed report about the steps taken to allay her apprehension and her fear."Take all the necessary steps. Take immediate steps. I don't want to hear that the accused was further harassed by her inmates or anybody else because she complained. I do not want to hear that the present accused is harmed in any way.”It also directed the prison authorities to produce her before the court on Wednesday through video conferencing.While making the submissions directly to the court, Jahan said it was the second incident within one month and was under immense stress due to the continuous harassment, physically and verbally.“This is the second incident in a month. In the morning today at 6:30 Am, they (inmates) beat me badly and abused me verbally. One of the inmates even slit her hand so that I am punished on a false complaint. Fortunately, the jail officials did not listen to them. I have given a written complaint also. They keep calling me a terrorist. They also demanded money from me in the canteen,” Jahan alleged.She further alleged that she has been facing harassment in jail for the past four months and had requested to be shifted to Tihar prison but it was refused due to the current COVID-19 pandemic.Advocate Pradeep Teotia, appearing for Jahan, further alleged that previously also she was beaten up by her inmates, following which one of the inmates were shifted to another jail.“One of the inmates beat her up badly previously. A complaint was filed before the Deputy Superintendent and that inmate was shifted to another jail. Two ladies in her prison cell beat her up today. While she was offering her morning prayers, they objected to it and started abusing her and beating her,” Teotia alleged.Advocate Misbah Bin Tariq, who was also present at the hearing, requested the court to take immediate action and view her situation with urgency as Jahan was a member of the advocates' Bar.Jahan further said she was suffering from some medical condition for which she has not been taken to a hospital nor any tests conducted.Advocate Rizwan, appearing for co-accused and suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, claimed that most of the accused in the north-east Delhi riots cases were facing discrimination in prison, either by the inmates or jail authorities.He further alleged that the accused have been declared as “terrorists” before the conclusion of the trial.“Almost all the accused are facing discrimination in jail. They have been declared as terrorists before the conclusion of the trial. Jail authorities behave adversely with them. Proper monitoring by the court is important in the cases, especially the conspiracy case in which the accused have been booked under the UAP Act,” he said.To this, the Judge said, “An accused is an accused, not a convict.” Another accused in the case, Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha, claimed that his family members have been trying to meet him through video conferencing but their requests have not been approved.Tanha also alleged that he has been repeatedly called “terrorists” in prison.Tanha's counsel, advocate Sowjhanya Shankaran, said previously when several of the accused had said they have been given basic things in prison, the court had sought a report from the jail authorities but the report has not come yet.The judge had on November 3 said he would go and inspect the situation physically if things did not improve. But since all the grievances were taken care of by the jail authorities, the judge did not go for a physical inspection.Co-accused Umar Khalid told the court that even after a month, a soft copy of the charge sheet had not been supplied to him.The judge asked his counsel to move an application before the Tihar prison authorities, where Khalid is lodged, to allow access to the soft copy.The court has put up the matter for further hearing on January 5.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

In case of a positive sample, it is recommended that spike gene-based RT-PCR test should also be performed by an appropriate laboratory,” the SOPs say.Also read: 6 passengers on London-Delhi flight test Covid positivePassengers testing positive shall be isolated in an institutional isolation facility in a separate (isolation) unit coordinated by the respective state health authorities. If the report of the sequencing is consistent with the current SARS-CoV-2 virus genome circulating in the country; the ongoing treatment protocol, including home isolation/treatment at facility level as per case severity, may be followed but if the genomic sequencing indicates the presence of new variant of SARS-CoV-2 (reported by the UK) then the patient will continue to remain in a separate isolation unit.The patient shall be tested on 14th day, after having tested positive in the initial test.In case the sample is found positive on the 14th day, further sample may be taken until his two consecutive samples taken 24 hours apart are tested negative.Those who are found negative on testing with RT-PCR at the airport would be advised quarantine at home.The SOPs also sayState-wise passenger manifest of the flights from the UK landing at various international airports in India for the past 4 weeks (from November 25 to December 23) shall be conveyed by the Bureau of Immigration to state governments and Integrated DiseaseSurveillance Programme (IDSP) so that this data would be provided to the surveillance teams.Importantly, all the contacts (without any exception) of those travellers who arrived at various airports on December 21-23 and tested positive would be subjected to institutional quarantine in separate quarantine centres and would be tested as per ICMR guidelines.Contacts of the suspect case have been defined as co-passengers seated in the same row, three rows in front and three rows behind along with identified cabin crew.Even names of those found RT-PCR negative at airport testing shall be shared with the respective states by the central unit of IDSP and advised for quarantine at home and tested as per ICMR guidelines.Those international travellers from the UK who arrived in India from November 25 to December 8 (1st and 2nd week from November 25) will be contacted by District Surveillance Officers and advised to self-monitor their health. If anyone amongst them develops symptoms, they will be tested by RT PCR and subjected to the protocols as stated in the SOP.“The list of international travellers who arrived in India, as described in the scope above, between December 9 to 23 (3rd and 4th week) will be shared with respective state and District Surveillance Officers for daily follow-up till 14 days after their arrival in India.These passengers will receive daily calls or visit from state health officials to ask about their health status for the day.“You are requested to self-monitor for development of symptoms suggestive of Covid, ie, fever, cough, difficulty in breathing for 28 days from the date of arrival from the UK.In case you develop symptoms (fever, cough, difficulty in breathing), put on a mask immediately, isolate yourself at home and inform District Surveillance Officer or contact National (1075) or State Helpline. District Surveillance Officer has to ensure daily follow-up of passengers under observation for 28 days starting from date of arrival,” the Ministry said.For all the above travellers, District Surveillance Officer shall facilitate testing (irrespective of previous testing at the place of origin or at the airport of arrival) with RT-PCR.“In case the passengers have moved to locations outside the city of arrival, intimation should be sent to the district/state concerned for needful as above,” SOPs say.Those who test positive shall be isolated in an institutional isolation facility in a separate (isolation) unit by the respective state health authorities and tested as per new protocols issued keeping the mutated UK strain in mind.The Centre said a new variant of SARS-CoV 2 virus [Variant Under Investigation (VUI)-20212/01] has been reported by the Government of United Kingdom (UK) to World Health Organisation (WHO).“This variant is estimated by European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) to be more transmissible and affecting younger population. This variant is defined by a set of 17 changes or mutations. One of the most significant is an N501Y mutation in the spike protein that the virus uses to bind to the human ACE2 receptor. Changes in this part of the spike protein may result in the virus becoming more infectious and spreading more easily between people,” notes the new SOP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-orders-surveillance-of-all-passengers-who-came-from-or-transited-through-uk-in-past-4-weeks-187940

We have repeatedly deprecated such attempts of the state governments to approach this court only to complete a mere formality,” said the bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy.The top court noted in its order that it has dealt with the issue of government authorities approaching courts belatedly as if the statute of limitation “does not exist for them”.“The special leave petition has been filed after a delay of 462 days. This is one more case which we have categorized as a ‘certificate cases' filed before this court to complete a mere formality and save the skin of officers who have been throughout negligent in defending a litigation!” the apex court said.The top court, while referring to a judgement passed by the apex court in October this year, said it had defined “certificate cases” the objective of which is only to put a quietus to the issue by recording that nothing could be done because the highest court had dismissed the appeal. “We have repeatedly deprecated such practice and process,” it said.When the counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that a valuable land is involved in the matter, the bench said, “In our view, if it was so, then the officers responsible for the manner in defending this petition must be made to pay for it.” “We are thus constrained to dismiss the petition as barred by time and impose cost of Rs 15,000 on the petitioner for wastage of judicial time. We put it to the counsel that the cost would have been much greater but for the fact that a young counsel is appearing before us and we have given considerable concession in the costs on that factor alone,” the bench said.It directed that cost be recovered from the officers responsible for delay in filing of plea in the apex court.

22-12-2020||New Delhi||Kids at crossroads in custody battles: 40-50 pc cases are "facade", says Judge||Children are at "crossroads" and undergo "deep trauma" in custody litigations between estranged couples and almost 40-50 per cent of such fights are "fake" and “facade” to pursue a hidden agenda except for their welfare, a District Judge has said in her book.Principal District Judge Poonam A Bamba, in the book, “Parents at War- Custody battles in Indian courts”, has narrated her judicial experience in dealing with the bitterly-fought custody battles in courts.In an exclusive interaction with PTI on the book, the judge said fake custody litigations burden the judicial system, affected the children adversely and were taxing for all the parties concerned.She said the book was an endeavour to bring forth the plight of the children who bear the brunt of custody battles between parents and undergo deep trauma.“People separate after divorce and then the fight for custody starts. Battles become murkier. Both want custody of the child. The child is the ultimate sufferer here. He/she is at the crossroads of the litigation. Parents unknowingly cause permanent damage to the child. This book is an effort to bring this message to the parents that the welfare of the child is paramount,” Judge Bamba said.Sharing real-life cases, she wrote in the book that the hidden agenda ranged from avenging the divorce petition filed by the custodial parent (a parent in the custody of the child) to a counterblast to a dowry case, to a complaint by the wife under the Domestic Violence Act.“May I say that like drugs, custody litigation can also be spurious. Such cases may seem genuine at first glance but all are not so. Though I have not carried out any empirical study, it will not be incorrect to say that roughly 40 to 50 per cent of custody litigation has actually nothing to do with the custody of the child," she said in the book."The custody petition is only a facade to pursue a hidden agenda, which could range from avenging the divorce petition filed by the custodial parent (a parent in the custody of the child) to a counterblast to a dowry case, to a complaint by the wife under the Domestic Violence Act. It could even be to pressurise or harass the wife who has filed a petition for maintenance for herself and the child.“Such fake custody litigation, where the true intent is to achieve an oblique purpose, is wasteful and burdens the already burdened justice system. It is also physically, mentally and financially taxing to the other side. And of course, such litigation also puts the child under stress,” she wrote.The book carries various stories from her private journal during her tenure at the family court. It talks about the importance of the judiciary, being “parens patriae” (public policy power of the state/court to intervene against an abusive or negligent parent, legal guardian, or informal caretaker), as well as the constraints of the courts.“The courts' task would have been so much simpler if they had a love-meter to measure the love and care each person claimed to have in his/her heart for the child,” Judge Bamba wrote.The 240-page book has broken down legal cases into simple emotional tales and also talks about the legal process and the laws in layman's terms.“Each story carried a different emotion. Some were plain and simple angry stories, some very dejected, some hurtful, and some revengeful. At the bottom of most of these stories, all I found was insecurity. Custodial parents are insecure because they fear losing control. Non-custodial parents' battles generally arise from a place of want, a feeling of deprivation,” the book said.The judge said it was immensely taxing emotionally and mentally to see parents fight, sometimes throwing ugly accusations against each other.“The constant bickering of the parents, the emotional trauma of the child affected me emotionally. At the end of the day, I just wanted to sit quietly at my chamber. Mediation and morning walk helped me deal with it," she said.“Parents at custody battles don't want to talk to each other or come to an understanding. They see the other person from their lenses. To them, their suffering is paramount. All objectivity is lost. They are hardly able to see the child's perspective,” she added.She said besides psychological trauma, children sometimes developed psychosomatic symptoms and childhood wounds take a long time to heal.“Children suffered from obesity, nausea, and aches. They develop trust issues and commitment issues. Their belief systems are developed based on their childhood trauma. They are impacted for a lifetime,” Judge Bamba said.While citing a case in which one of the parents produced a psychologist's report before the court to show how visits by the other parent were harming the child, the judge wrote non-availability of experts/ psychologists /psychiatrists in family courts was a constraint.“It becomes quite a task for the court to arrive at its own conclusion after having before it such findings. However, the possibility of such reports being influenced can also not be ruled out... Non-availability of services of experts/psychologists/psychiatrists to Family Courts is deeply felt in such situations. Reference then needs to be made to psychiatrists/child psychologists at a government hospital and such an assessment is a long-drawn process requiring several sittings with the child,” the book stated.The book also suggested solutions, from pre-litigation counselling, workshops for advocates to sensitising about children's vulnerabilities and wishes, to co-parenting.

22-12-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena takes a dig at Modi over his gurdwara visit amid farmers' stir||The Shiv Sena on Tuesday wondered what will be the outcome of the ongoing farmers' protest after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited a gurdwara and sought inspiration from Guru Tegh Bahadur, whose followers are among those protesters.An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' was referring to Modi's visit on Sunday to Gurdwara Rakabganj in Delhi where he paid tributes to Guru Tegh Bahadur for his supreme sacrifice.Guru Teg Bahadur, whose martyrdom day was observed on Saturday, was cremated at Gurdwara Rakabganj.Also read: Protesting farmers show black flags to Haryana CM Khattar during his Ambala visitThousands of farmers, including Sikhs, have been protesting near the Delhi borders since November 26 against the Modi government's three new farm laws.The editorial in the Marathi daily said farmers from Punjab did not flinch even when Modi reached the gurdwara "turning his back towards the Sikh peasants protest" and continued with their demonstration."Prime Minister Modi sought inspiration from Guru Tegh Bahadur. Happy about it. Thousands of Sikh fighters are also fighting (protesting) from the same inspiration near Delhi border. Hence, it is a question what will be the outcome of the battle," read the editorial.Also read: Armed with revolutionary poem by Pash, Faridkot farmer cycles 400 km to Tikri borderIt said 'gurbani' was being played when the Prime Minister reached the gurdwara.The gurbani says services and devotion towards God will be of no use if one does not change his/her thoughts, the editorial noted.The gurbani says reading holy religious book several times will be of no use if one does not understand its teachings, and also asks what will one do when his/her time comes and an account of his/her deeds is checked, it said.The gurbani mentions that none could defend himself from time, it added.Also read: Farmer union leaders to meet, discuss plan of actionIt is "not right" that Modi’s political opponents criticise him for anything he does, the editorial said in a cryptic remark and asked what was there to be restless if he visited the gurdwara.Modi’s opponents are alleging "politics" behind the Prime Minister’s visit to the gurdwara and asking why are the farmers from Punjab protesting in the cold if he loves Sikhs so much, it said."...but none should question Modi's faith. Guru Tegh Bahadur was a great saint. The Guru accepted martyrdom for humanity, principles and ideals...he was the protector of religion. Hence, not only Sikhs, everyone on this land should bow before Guru Tegh Bahadur," read the editorial.

22-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Development before politics, nation before ideology: PM Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 22In a major outreach, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday called the Aligarh Muslim University ‘Mini India’ that represented the diversity of the county. Addressing AMU alumni, teachers and staff on its centennial celebrations, the PM lauded the university for its role in crafting and polishing millions of lives, giving them modern and scientific thinking and inspiring them to work for the society and the country. “The AMU has changed many lives,” he said, referring to its exemplary role in India’s Independence struggle, nation building and the ongoing coronavirus crisis. “AMU is like Mini India…along with Urdu and Arabic, Hindi and Sanskrit is taught here. Its library has Koran and also Bhagvad Geeta and Ramayana. The diversity here is not just the strength of a prestigious institution like the AMU but the entire country,” he said.At the same time he advocated “vigilance against misleading propaganda” and keeping “interest of the nation supreme”. “Politics can wait but development cannot, similarly poor belonging to whichever section also cannot wait,” he said. Though he did not refer to the ongoing farmer’ agitation, political observers read hints towards it in his observations. Notably AMU students, who earlier participated in anti-CAA protests, have also extended support to protesting farmers, urging President Ram Nath Kovind to intervene and revoke the three contentious laws.   The PM said while there can be ideological differences among people when it is the question of country’s progress all differences should be kept aside. “On such issues we cannot have differences despite ideological and personal differences. There were difference of opinion in AMU... but Independence struggle became common ground. We need to work on common ground like Independence.” “We must realise that politics is an important part of society but there are many other issues in society besides politics. For a new India, the core is that welfare must not be seen from the prism of politics. There are some elements who may have an issue with this....they will spread negativity. But these people will be sidelined if we work for the betterment of the country keeping aside politics. Politics can wait, but the country cannot wait for development, the poor and disadvantaged cannot wait for development,” he said. Quoting Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the founder of AMU, the PM said the biggest duty of every citizen is towards the country and its progress. The first and foremost duty of one who is concerned about his country is to work for the welfare of all people, irrespective of caste, creed or religion. “For the progress of country, every strata should progress so that everyone gets a chance to realise their dreams without religion and other constraints,” the PM said, adding that his government is working with the same intention, progress without any discrimination, enumerating its various pro-poor, pro-women progammes and policies, including law on Triple Talaq.“There was a time when the dropout rate of Muslim girls was more than 70 pc, today it has dropped to 30 pc due to programmes like Swachch Bharat,” urging all institutions to encourage women towards not just education but higher education and empowerment. As he spoke of New Education Policy and increase in number of educational institutions like IITs and AIIMS in the country, he assigned AMU hostels “extra curriculum task associated with India’s Independence”.“Research on freedom fighter about which not much is known,” he said. To its alumni he asked suggestions on making India ‘atmanirbhar. “27 years after the AMU was formed in 1920, we got our Independence. This is 2020 and next 27 years are very important for your life to make it a modern India,” the PM said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/development-before-politics-nation-before-ideology-pm-modi-187918

This strain is spreading and growing rapidly in the UK. It has been reported that this variant has an unusually large number of genetic changes, particularly in the spike protein.Harsh Vardhan, Union Health ministerNo need to panicThe government is fully alert.

22-12-2020||Chandigarh||Nothing new in talks offer: Farm unions||Farmer leaders today said they were always ready for dialogue, but claimed that there was nothing new in the Centre’s latest letter to them seeking a date for the next round of talks. After launching a relay fast, the leaders said they would take a call on the invite at Sanyukt Morcha meeting at Singhu on Tuesday.Read also: Back from Delhi, 2 more farmers dieBack from protest, farmer Kulbir Singh of a village in Guruharsahai allegedly hanged himself in his fields while Hakam Singh of Sangrur died of poor health.Sukhdev Singh Kokriwal said they would study the contents of the letter before sending a reply to the Union Government. Saying that the invite is “meaningless” since they won’t settle for anything less than repealing of the laws, BKU’s Rattan Mann said they did not want to close the channel for talks. “We don’t want the government to accuse us of being non-cooperative. But there is nothing new in the offer letter that hasn’t already been considered and rejected,” he said.Fformer IAS officers back agitationAt least 18 retired IAS officers, including those who served as Chief Secys, have appealed to the Centre to withdraw the three “anti-farmer” laws.Another leader, Harinder Singh Lakhowal, said the invite was “vague”. “The government should have clearly mentioned the date and time of the meeting and the name of representatives who will talk on its behalf. The letter just says that the government is willing to talk to the farmers at a place and time of their choice,” he said.Farmer leader Joginder Ugrahan too said: “We will deliberate on the invite, although it does not promise much as repealing of laws is our only demand.”BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said the government had mentioned that it wanted to hold talks over its earlier proposal of amendments in the laws. “On this issue, we had refused to talk to them earlier,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nothing-new-in-talks-offer-farm-unions-187727

Modi said hostility would never achieve peace and in the past, humanity took the path of confrontation instead of collaboration. “From imperialism to the world wars. From the arms race to the space race. We had dialogues, but they were aimed at pulling others down. Now, let us rise together,” Modi said.Lord Buddha’s teachings command the strength to turn the discourse from enmity to empowerment and his teachings also make us large-hearted, the PM said.“Buddha’s teachings tell us: Learn from the past and work towards a better future,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/global-growth-talks-cant-happen-among-few-bigger-table-must-pm-187732

22-12-2020||Mumbai||Sena links Ram Temple fund drive to 2024 polls, BJP refutes||The Shiv Sena on Monday alleged that the mass contact initiative to collect funds from public for the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya was akin to “canvassing” for the 2024 general elections in the name of Lord Ram.Hitting backAn editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said it was never decided that the grand temple would be constructed through public donations, and “political campaigning in the name of Lord Ram has to be stopped at some point of time”.“But the issue of public donations is not simple. It is political,” it alleged.Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust’s general secretary Champat Rai last week said the Trust was going to start a mass contact and contribution campaign across the country for construction of the temple.“It will be built using domestic funds collected from the general public through a mass contact programme as the Trust doesn’t have required approvals for accepting donations from abroad,” Rai said.The Marathi daily, without naming any party or organisation, said, “The temple, basically, is not being built for political gains of a political party, but for unfurling the pennants of Hindu pride of the country.” It claimed four lakh volunteers will implement the mass contact initiative. “This mass contact programme is campaigning for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls in the name of Lord Ram. The political campaigning in Lord Ram’s name has to be stopped at some point,” it said.The editorial asked who the volunteers (for the mass contact drive) exactly were and sought clarity on their parent organisation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sena-links-ram-temple-fund-drive-to-2024-polls-bjp-refutes-187736
