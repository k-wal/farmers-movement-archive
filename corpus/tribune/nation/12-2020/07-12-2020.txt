07-12-2020||Guwahati||First phase of BTC polls passes off peacefully; over 75% voting recorded||The much-awaited voting for the 40-member Bodo Territorial Council (BTC) took place on Monday with over 75 per cent voters exercising their franchise in the first phase.Till the closing time of 4:30 pm, 75.21 per cent polling took place out of a total of 13,64,018 voters, who sealed the fate of 130 candidates for 21 constituencies spread across Udalguri and Baksa districts.An official of the Assam State Election Commission (ASEC) said long queues were still there at several of the booths out of the total 1,739 polling stations as they entered the compounds before 4:30 pm and the voting percentage was likely to go up further."It was a complete peaceful voting. There was not a single untoward incident reported from anywhere," he added.The voting through paper ballot is being done observing COVID-19 protocols by the officials like wearing masks, maintaining social distance inside the booth and keeping sanitisers inside the compound.However, a large number of voters were seen not following the coronavirus safety regulations by coming to booths without masks and people huddling in groups.Even many senior leaders like BJP's Biswajit Daimary, who recently resigned from Rajya Sabha and shifted side from BPF, and some candidates cast their votes without wearing masks.A festive look was seen at many places with roadside shops and eateries have been set up, and people thronged there in large numbers, thereby giving a toss to COVID-19 protocols.No curbs for coronavirus were followed in the roadside shops and eateries with voters crowding around them with no masks or observing social distancing.The second phase of polling for 19 constituencies will take place on December 10, when 10,23,404 voters will decide the future of 111 candidates by exercising their franchise across 1,407 polling stations in Kokrajhar and Chirang districts.The counting for both the phases will be held on December 12, beginning at 8 am and will continue till completion of the process.Out of the total 3,164 polling booths, the authorities have marked 606 as very sensitive and 1,266 as sensitive, and arranged tight security measures in those, an ASEC official said.A total of 23,87,422 voters will exercise their franchise to elect their representatives for the local council, formed in 2003 and elections held since 2005.The election to the 40-member BTC was scheduled on April 4, but it was postponed indefinitely due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.Subsequently, Assam Governor Jagdish Mukhi assumed administration of the Council on expiry of its five-year term on Apr 27, 2020.Hagrama Mohilary-led ruling Bodoland People's Front (BPF) is trying hard to save its 15-year old BTC government, while its state ally BJP is pulling all gears to dethrone its partner from the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR).The BJP and BPF are contesting separately and both the parties were engaged in bitter campaign with usage of many unparliamentary words by the leaders of the two forces.BJP is running its first state government in Assam in alliance with the BPF and Asom Gana Parishad (AGP).United People's Party Liberal (UPPL) is another strong outfit apart from BPF and BJP. Its chief Pramod Boro, who joined the party from All Bodo Students Union (ABSU), is touted to be a strong contender for the post of Chief Executive Member, the head of BTC.Other parties like Gana Suraksha Party (GSP), Congress- AIUDF alliance and scores of independent candidates are also claiming to get voters sympathy and support.

07-12-2020||Kollam/Kannur||Kerala CM slams Congress, BJP over CPI(M) activist’s killing||A 52-year-old CPI(M) activist was stabbed to death near Kollam on Monday, prompting a strong reaction from  Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan who lashed out at the RSS and the Congress over the killing.The murder comes just as the first phase of local body polls is being held on Tuesday.At least five CPI(M) workers were killed in the last 110 days and all the culprits will be brought to book, Vijayan said at a function in Kannur.The left activist was fatally stabbed, allegedly by a BJP worker, police sources said.Munroe Island resident Manilal was attacked last night by Ashokan (55), who was later arrested, police said.The chief minister asked the RSS and the Congress to make it clear whether the killings were part of their joint decision.“RSS workers murdered CPI(M) activist Manilal who was busy with election campaigning activities. At least five CPI(M) activists were killed in the last 110 days.There were news reports that the RSS and the United Democratic Front led by Congress have forged an alliance in the state for the local body polls. They should make it clear whether these consecutive murders were part of their joint decision. The culprits will be brought to book,” Vijayan said in a Facebook post.CPI(M) state secretary in-charge A Vijayaraghavan said the killing was an attempt to disrupt peace ahead of polling for the first phase of the local body elections on Tuesday.“RSS criminals have murdered a CPI(M) activist Manilal at around 8.30 pm on Sunday night in front of the LDF election committee office.This murder is a concocted plan by the RSS to disrupt the peace in the locality hours before the local polls,” Vijayaraghavan posted on Facebook.CPI(M) claimed the RSS was deliberately trying to create an atmosphere of terror in a region with no history of violence.“We condemn the murder of comrade Manilal.We also urge all democratic forces to protest against this brutal murder,” the party said in a statement.However, police said they were investigating the matter and yet to confirm whether it was a political murder.Police said Ashokan came in an autorickshaw and attacked Manilal who was standing in front of the election office of the LDF.The BJP is yet to react to the allegations of the CPI(M).This is the fifth CPI(M) worker killed in the state since August 20.In August, a CPI(M) worker from Kayamkulam was killed by motorcycle-borne assailants and a Congress municipal councillor was arrested in the case.PU Sanoop, a branch secretary of ruling CPI(M), was stabbed to death in October allegedly by a gang of rightwing outfits, according to sources.Earlier, on August 30, two DYFI activists were hacked to death, allegedly by Congress activists at Venjaramoodu in Thiruvananthapuram. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-cm-slams-congress-bjp-over-cpim-activists-killing-181174

Such transactions detected so far across all the locations combined is upwards Rs150 crore, of which payments made of a total of more than Rs 100 crore have been found to be violative of various sections of the Income-tax Act,” the CBDT said in a statement.“Such seized documents are voluminous and are being investigated further,” it added.It, however, did not identify the parties searched. The CBDT frames policy for the tax department            “The main allegations against the group is that it has routed accommodation entries of more than Rs 23 crore and Rs 62 crore in the form of non-genuine share capital and non-genuine unsecured loans respectively, through certain Kolkata-based shell companies.“All this was done by suppression of its true net profit,” the CBDT said.It said the raids “established” that the group engages in out-of-books transactions.The CBDT alleged that loan transactions made in cash were also found to be more than Rs 10 crore.“Stock difference of more than Rs 7 crore was found and no cogent explanation regarding the same was provided.”        “In the office of the Kolkata-based shell company acquired by one of the entities of the group, no books of accounts and ROC mandated documents were found, proving the same to be a bogus entity used only to route unaccounted income of the group,” it said.Some cash investments in share capital “during demonetisation period” were also detected, the CBDT said.

07-12-2020||New Delhi||Bankers not to participate in Bharat Bandh on Tuesday||Bank unions said they will not participate in the ‘Bharat Bandh’ on Tuesday, even as they expressed solidarity with farmers protesting against the new farm laws.Farmer groups, camping at various Delhi border points for over a week, have called for a nationwide shutdown on Tuesday to protest against three recently enacted agriculture-related legislations.All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC) General Secretary Soumya Datta said the union has expressed its solidarity with farmers but will not be participating in the Bharat Bandh called by them.Similarly, All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) General Secretary CH Venkatachalam said the union would not go on strike or abstain from work but it supports the farmers’ agitation. Union members would wear black badges while on duty, stage protest after or before working hours and display placards before bank branches to support the cause of farmers of the country, Venkatachalam said, but added that banking operations will not be hit.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting against the new farm laws which they claim will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporate houses.Meanwhile, farmer leaders have said that nobody should be forced to observe ‘Bharat Bandh’ on Tuesday and that emergency services will be allowed. Several rounds of talks between the Centre and farmers have failed to break the deadlock. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bankers-not-to-participate-in-bharat-bandh-on-tuesday-181172
07-12-2020||New Delhi||More support pours in, railway unions AIRF, NFIR to observe Bharat Bandh||Two of the biggest railway unions on Monday pledged their support to the Bharat Bandh on December 8 called by farmer unions which have been protesting on Delhi's borders against the Centre's new agri-marketing laws.The All India Railwaymen's Federation (AIRF) and the National Federation of Indian Railwaymen (NFIR) extended their support to the agitating farmers by calling on their members to hold rallies and demonstrations on December 8 in a show of solidarity with the farmers.AIRF general secretary Shiva Gopal Mishra met the agitating farmers at Singhu border and assured them that members of the railway union are with them in their fight against the new agriculture laws.“We have written to our affiliates all over the Indian Railways to extend support to the farmers in their struggle to achieve their genuine demands, on December 8, 2020 during ‘Bharat Bandh'.“I have already advised AIRF affiliates to organise agitation programmes, dharna, demonstrations and rallies during lunch hour against anti-farmer policies of the Government of India,” said Mishra.“I hope that the government will give cognizance to the genuine demands of the farmers and redress the same at the earliest,” he added.NFIR general secretary M Raghavaiah, in a statement, appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to accept the demands of the farmers.He said the railway families were with the “annadata” (food-giving) in their struggle against the anti-farm laws which are “detrimental to the farmer community of the nation”.“The NFIR general secretary advised all its affiliate unions throughout the Indian Railways to conduct dharnas, rallies and demonstrations in solidarity with the farmers' struggle and against anti-farmer decisions of the Central government,” the statement said.The two unions comprising 13 lakh railway employees and around 20 lakh retired employees, according to the union leaders, are the latest to show solidarity with the agitating farmers.The farmers have found support from transport unions and the joint forum of trade unions like the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS) and the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU).Opposition parties like the Congress, NCP, SP, INLD and the Left parties have also come out in support of the stir.After five rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmer unions failed to end the impasse, the two sides are again set to meet on December 9, a day after the countrywide strike.The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.

07-12-2020||Bengaluru||Law against ‘love jihad’ during next session: Karnataka CM||The Karnataka government on Monday made it clear that the anti-cow slaughter bill will be introduced during the ongoing winter session of the Karnataka legislature, while a law against “love jihad” will be taken up in the next session.“Anti-cow slaughter, we had earlier (previous tenure) tabled it, but it was not given assent.“I have asked the Law Minister to table it once again.. it will be tabled by tomorrow or the day after and we will get it approved,” Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said.Speaking to reporters at Sagara, he said “Love Jihad, we will think about it in the next assembly session.We will not be tabling it in this session.Anti-cow slaughter, we will do it now.”The BJP’s Karnataka state executive on Saturday had adopted resolutions for the passage and implementation of the two legislations.Stating that it has been decided at the government level to enact anti-cow slaughter legislation during this session, Revenue Minister R Ashoka too said, the bill against “love jihad” will be taken up during the next session.Speaking to reporters here, he said, “Cow is worshiped as god by farmers..there is a special place for cows in Indian culture, so to stop its killing  we are beginning this law in Karnataka.“No love jihad during this session, in the next session we will remove love jihad.”Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai had said that the state will have a law against “love jihad”, and officials have been directed to gather information on an ordinance promulgated in Uttar Pradesh in this regard.Uttar Pradesh had recently promulgated an ordinance against forcible or fraudulent religious conversions, which provides for imprisonment of up to 10 years and fine of up to Rs 50,000 under different categories.“Love jihad” is a term used by right wing activists to refer to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love.Regarding the anti-cow slaughter legislation, a team of officials led by Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chavan had recently visited Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, where the law has been enacted, to study about its implementation, aimed at strengthening the bill to be introduced here during the winter session that began today.Chavan today said he and his team have gathered information on implementation of anti-cow slaughter law in UP and Gujarat, and after discussion with CM and cabinet colleagues the bill will be introduced  during this session.The BJP in its manifesto ahead of the 2018 Assembly election had promised prohibition of cow slaughter.Despite resistance from the opposition, the then BJP government led by B S Yediyurappa in 2010 had got the controversial Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill passed.It proposed to replace the Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Preservation Act, 1964.The bill had widened the definition of “cattle” and imposed a blanket ban on cattle slaughter, coupled with stringent penalty clauses for violation.However, the Congress government headed by Siddaramaiah that came to power in 2013, withdrew the bill that was before the President for his assent.After the BJP came back to power in the state, several party leaders have been making a pitch to re-enact the anti-cow slaughter law.Leader of Opposition in the Karnataka assembly Siddaramaiah has said that the Congress will oppose if the government tries to bring in legislation against “love jihad” and cow slaughter.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/law-against-love-jihad-during-next-session-karnataka-cm-181162
07-12-2020||---||Farmers' protest: Parkash Singh Badal writes to PM, seeks his ‘personal intervention’ in reaching a solution||Chandigarh, December 7With the standoff between the protesting farmers and Centre over the farm laws failing to end, former Punjab Chief Minister and veteran SAD leader Parkash Singh Badal on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his “personal intervention” to reach a solution.  The following is the complete text of the letter:I write this at a time when the problems facing the country are fast assuming the proportions of a grave crisis and our approach towards these needs an immediate course correction.I am deeply worried about the ongoing farmers’ crisis. It seems to me that the issue could have been dealt with better if the government had paid  greater attention  to the honest feedback on what the brave and selfless ‘annadata’ of the nation really thought of the government’s initiatives.In addition, the government needed to take the stake-holders of the issue on board. I found it hard to believe that any government, especially one with such a massive mandate as yours, would allow a failure of this kind to affect its decision making.The government would have done well to enact a legislation affecting the destiny of millions and millions of farmers only after taking their representatives and the farmer-friendly political parties like the Shiromani Akali Dal in confidence.The deepening crisis of the beleaguered peasantry required and requires that they be heard before any decision concerning them is taken. In fact, this practice must be followed in every important decision. The result of the failure to do this so far has resulted in the present confrontation that was so easily avoidable.Another aspect of the crisis concerns our approach to politics in general. The pain and the deep anxiety writ large on the faces of the farmers these days painfully emphasizes how politics of confrontation has fractured our social fabric.Consultation, conciliation and consensus are the foundation of any democracy. Consultative processes alone lead to consensus, and consensus alone is the recipe for avoiding confrontations like the one we see now between the government and the farmers.Once it became clear that the three Ordinances were not finding acceptance even among the Government’s own Alliance partners like the Shiromani Akali Dal, the obvious course open to the Government was to convene an All Party Meeting. There is a democratic convention in our country to follow this course whenever there is a national stalemate.The government would not have been bound to accept the Opposition’s views but it would have gained from their wisdom. I was surprised that this option was not taken.Further, the farmers’ issue concerned every state government. Agriculture in fact is a state subject and the state governments are in the best position to understand and address the issues of their respective farmers.The failure to consult states on an issue that concerns nearly 70% of the country’s total population shows the government’s indifference to or rejection of the federal principle. This was unbelievable because you have yourself been among the biggest champions of federal structure.As Chief Minister of Gujarat, you had always advocated more powers and a greater role to the states in running the country as a genuinely federal nation. On its part, the Shiromani Akali Dal has   been in the forefront of the battle for federalism and it will continue to work with other like-minded parties in the country for making India truly federal.I say this because I sincerely believe that the roots of the ongoing crisis lie in the abdication of our commitment to the federal approach.The farmers’ crisis is not the only instance where this inclusive approach to nation building has been ignored or abandoned. The county and its government need to follow an approach based on widespread consultation and consensus. The scars left by our failure to do so in the recent divisive and destabilizing moments will take a long time to heal.Keeping all this in view, I take the liberty of sharing with you the fruit of my long experience in public life. The farmers struggle has an important lesson for the country. The country’s bread winner has demonstrated its commitment to secular and peaceful democratic ideals.The farmers assembled for a common cause represent the rich diversity of the nation. One of the most precious lessons I learnt as a servant of the people is to understand, appreciate and celebrate this secular respect for the diversity of our great nation which comprises people of diverse faiths, languages, cultures and even ethnic backgrounds.The Great Guru Sahiban and other holy men and women, Sufi saints and yogis have lit the path of peaceful and mutually respectful co-existence.The   Guru Sahiban gave us the concept of Sarbat the Bhala (Universal Welfare).  Great rulers in this country have always used the unifying wisdom contained in this vision of Sarbat da Bhala and served the nation and its people through consensus.The other message from the current crisis is about the need to avoid confrontation as a way to address social and political issues.During my long tenure in public life, I have often confronted situations involving people with conflicting   backgrounds and persuasions making diverse and conflicting demands. I have battled against dictatorship during the Emergency days. My experience tells me that    respect for peaceful democratic values offers us the best solutions to even the most complex and intractable problems.The country has seen how statesmen like Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee understood and respected the beauty of the diversity of our nation and turned it into an asset.I have been greatly pained to see   peacefully and democratically protesting farmers, even women and children, subjected to tear gas shells, water cannons and lathicharge by the government of Haryana.I also find it intriguing that the government is trying to impose on a section of the people gifts which they are neither willing to accept nor deem beneficial for them. Why must the government thrust a “benefit” on the people if they do not see it as beneficial?The ongoing farmers’ crisis needs your immediate and undivided attention. In the circumstances, I strongly urge you to show magnanimity in approach and to personally intervene to get the stalemate broken.As a first step, the three Acts in question that have pushed the country into deep turmoil must be withdrawn without making the farmers and their families endure any more suffering in this biting cold. The issue does not concern farmers alone but affects the entire economic fabric of the country, as traders, businessmen, shopkeepers, arhtiyas and labour are also directly affected by it.In addition, the Government must categorically make 100% procurement of farmers’ produce at Minimum Support Price (fixed as per Swaminathan Formula, C2+50) a statutory legal right of the farmer.In the end, I wish to re-emphasize the need for a liberal, secular democratic approach to solve all the problems facing the country today, including this one.I request your immediate personal intervention in this regard.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-parkash-singh-badal-writes-to-pm-seeks-his-personal-intervention-in-reaching-a-solution-181161
07-12-2020||New Delhi||Navy rescue teams recover body believed to be of missing pilot near MiG-29K crash site||Rescue teams of the Indian Navy have recovered a body, believed to be that of pilot Commander Nishant Singh who went missing after his MiG-29K aircraft crashed into the Arabian Sea 11 days back, official sources said on Monday.They said DNA testing is being carried out to ascertain the identity of the body, which has been recovered from the site of the crash.“There are reasons to believe that the body is of Commander Nishant Singh. However, it can be fully ascertained following the result of the DNA testing,” said an official on condition of anonymity.Indian Navy pilot Commander Singh went missing in the Arabian Sea after his MiG-29K aircraft crashed into the Arabian Sea on November 26. The second pilot was rescued soon after the incident.The Indian Navy deployed nine warships, 14 aircraft and a number of fast interceptor craft as part of the search and rescue mission to locate Commander Singh.Some debris of the aircraft including landing gear, turbo charger and fuel tank engine were located last week.The Navy had ordered a high-level inquiry to investigate the incident which was the third involving the Mig-29K in the last one year.A MiG-29K twin-seat fighter aircraft had crashed in South Goa district on November 16 last year, but both the pilots had ejected safely.Another MIG-29K crashed into the Arabian Sea off the Goa coast on February 23 this year after taking off from INS Hansa, a prominent naval air station at Vasco in Goa. The pilot of the aircraft had managed to eject safely.The MiG-29K is an all-weather carrier-based multirole fighter aircraft developed by Russian aerospace company Mikoyan (MiG). The Indian Navy had procured a fleet of 45 MiG-29Ks from Russia at a cost of around USD 2 billion to operate from INS Vikramaditya. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/navy-rescue-teams-recover-body-believed-to-be-of-missing-pilot-near-mig-29k-crash-site-181160
07-12-2020||New Delhi||Nobody should be forced to observe Bharat Bandh, emergency services allowed: Farmer leaders||Farmer leaders on Monday said that emergency services will not be disturbed during Tuesday’s ‘Bharat Bandh’, and appealed to their affiliates to not force anyone to observe the shut down against the three recently enacted agriculture-related laws.Addressing a press conference here, farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said the Centre will have to accept the farmers’ demand of scrapping the new laws whose passage has sparked protests by thousands of farmers who have been camping at various border points of Delhi for the past 11 days.The agitating farmers have already announced that they would occupy toll plazas between 11 am to 3 pm during the ‘Bharat Bandh’.Bhartiya Kisan Ekta Sangathan president Jagjit Singh Dallewala appealed to farmers to maintain peace and to not enter into any scuffle with anyone to enforce the bandh.“People have been coming out in our support own their own. There is no need to force anyone to observe the bandh,” he said.“The ‘chakka jam’ will end at 3 pm, but the bandh will be observed through the entire day,” he said.The farmer leader said the ‘bandh’ will be effective across the country, but the major impact will be felt in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.“Emergency services, such as healthcare facilities and ambulances, and marriage processions will be allowed during the bandh,” Dallewala said.“The Modi government will have to accept our demands. We want nothing less than withdrawal of new farm laws,” Rajewal asserted.He said the Punjabi diaspora in Germany, Australia, the US and other countries will also support the bandh through symbolic protests.Referring to the Centre’s offer to amend the contentious laws, another farmer leader, Darshan Pal, asked as to why the government was agreeing to amend the laws now after initially claiming they will benefit the peasantry.“We want the government to reinstate the old farm laws even if the government thinks it is not good for farmers,” Pal also said.The protest has become a “material force” for the entire country, even for the Punjabi diaspora abroad, he said, and thanked all personalities and sportspersons who have returned their awards in their support.All India Railwaymen’s Federation’s General Secretary Shiv Gopal Mishra said all its branches across the country will support the Bharat Bandh.“The federation will give a call for a rail rook if the farmers’ demands were not me he warned.CPI leader Annie Raja said around 20 lakh members of the National Federation of Indian women across 28 states will participate in the bandh.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws. Several rounds of talks between the Centre and farmers have failed to break the deadlock.The government has been defending the laws, saying they will help farmers by bringing in new technology and allow them to sell their produce at better prices.

07-12-2020||Mumbai/Pune/Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Ruling Shiv Sena, NCP and Cong support Bharat Bandh||The ruling Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress are among the key parties from Maharashtra to support Tuesday’s ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by peasants’ bodies which have been opposing the Centre’s farm laws.Speaking to reporters here, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut urged people to take part in the “non-political” bandh to support farmers.“People should willingly take part in the bandh. This will show true support to the farmers. This is not a political bandh though several parties have decided to take part in it,” Raut said.“This is not the bandh for raising demands of a political party, but to strengthen the voice of farmers of the country,” the Rajya Sabha member said.Maharashtra minister and NCP national spokesperson Nawab Malik said workers of the Sharad Pawar-led party will join the shutdown by observing social distancing norms.Maharashtra minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan said everyone should participate in the bandh to support farmers who have been agitating over the past fortnight in biting cold in Delhi.Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) leader Prakash Ambedkar has also supported the bandh.“The Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi will take part in the agitation tomorrow,” Ambedkar tweeted.Extending his support, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) leader Raju Shetti told reporters in Pune: “It is being projected that the ongoing agitation is limited to farmers from Haryana and Punjab. But the government should understand and take note that this is a nationwide agitation of cultivators”.“Farmers are very angry. In such scenario, the role of the government should be that of a mother who should try to hear their concerns,” Shetti said.Left parties and the Aam Aadmi Party among others have already announced their support to the shutdown.Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in Navi Mumbai, Nashik, Dhule, Pune and Solapur are likely to remain closed during the bandh.

07-12-2020||Sonepat (Singhu border)||As they owe gratitude to gurdwaras for feeding them, TN farmers join protest at Singhu border||Tamil Nadu farmers who led months long protest at Jantar Mantar (Delhi) in 2017 and then again in 2018 have joined their Punjab and Haryana counterparts at the Singhu border.They say they have come here as they owe gratitude to gurdwaras which had fed and gave shelter to them during their protests.  “When thousands of farmers from Tamil Nadu had protested at Jantar Mantar, only gurdwaras provided us with food, shelter, medical help and everything. That is the reason, the Punjab farmers are our brothers and sisters. Not only that, if there is no Punjab, there is no India. This state is providing food to the whole country,” said R Sellaperumal, State Propaganda Secretary of National South Indian River Inter-Linking Farmers’ Association. The association had come to national prominence in 2017 when they led scores of Tamil Nadu farmers in using unique methods to highlight their protest including rolling naked on road, holding dead snakes in their mouths, eating mice and holding human skulls which they claim were of those farmers who committed suicide in distress.They were seeking drought relief package, loan waiver and Cauvery Management Board from the Centre. For Singhu border, a message in Tamil from a protesting farmer on the Sun TV channel acted as catalyst. Rajwinder Singh, who has been protesting at Singhu border from the day one and is associated with farmers’ leader Baldev Singh Sirsa, had issued an appeal. “I know the Tamil language. I appealed to the Tamil Nadu farmers to join us against the farm laws. The message went viral. After that a number of farmers’ groups contacted us. Four to five groups have already reached here including one representing actor Kamal Hassan,” said Singh. “Our president P Ayyakannu was to come here too but the state government has not been allowing him. Fifty people could come here by train, but 100 more are coming. The state government has been stopping our farmers to come here,” said Sellaperumal.“These agrarian laws would turn farmers into beggars. Until these laws are cancelled, we will not move from this place to Chennai,” he said.      “We want to make this government (Central government) listen to us. Out state government has also not been doing anything for the farmers,” said Andabar, Association’s Ariyalur (Tamil Nadu) president.  “All protesting Tamil Nadu farmers would have died had gurdwaras not helped us in 2017 and 2018. We want to help our Punjab farmers,” said Jothimurugan, Association’s Chennai president. A delegation from ‘Naam Tamilar Party’ also addressed farmers at the Singhu border. One of the speakers attempted to speak in Punjabi and said, “Tussi Aise Hi Datte Raho (You should continue to deploy like this).”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-they-owe-gratitude-to-gurdwaras-for-feeding-them-tn-farmers-join-protest-at-singhu-border-181155
07-12-2020||Siliguri||One dead as BJP workers clash with police in West Bengal||Police fired teargas shells and used water cannons on Monday to quell a violent protest called by the Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) against the Mamata Banerjee government during which a BJP worker died, officials said.Several protesters and police personnel were injured in clashes.The BJP alleged that a party worker identified as Ullen Ray was "beaten to death" by the police during a batoncharge. However, police claimed there was no lathicharge and the cause of death of the protester was being ascertained.The BJP condemned the police action and demanded imposition of President's rule in West Bengal in view of "breakdown of law and order".The party has called a 12-hour bandh in north Bengal on Tuesday.BJP workers were seen fighting pitched battles with police after they were stopped from moving past barricades at two points near branch secretariat 'Uttarkanya' during the rally called to protest the TMC "misrule".The BJYM, the youth wing of the BJP, led by its chief and Lok Sabha member Tejaswi Surya, took out two protest marches claiming the state government had not fulfilled the promises made to the people of north Bengal and that the benefits of welfare schemes had failed to reach the common man.Police used water cannons and burst tear gas shells to stop the protesters from marching to the secretariat and were pelted with stones.Agitators also set on fire some bamboo barricades.State BJP head Dilip Ghosh, who led a rally to Fulbari Bazar, one of the two approach points to the secretariat building, said the government was "using coercion" as it was scared of the saffron party's rise in West Bengal.A second rally, led by the party's national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and BJYM president Tejaswi Surya, broke the first two layers of the police cordon near Tinbatti more, about 1 km from Uttarkanya, but could not get past the third as police sprayed the protesters with coloured water.According to BJP sources, Vijayvargiya and Surya had to be escorted to their vehicles by their security guards after the former fell ill.Ghosh later claimed that a party activist, injured in police action, had succumbed to injuries at a local hospital."One of our party activists Ullen Ray, who was mercilessly beaten up by police, died at a hospital here. Many other BJP workers have been injured and are being treated at the hospital," Ghosh said.However, police rejected the allegation and claimed no lathicharge had taken place."Today in Siliguri, serious acts of violence were committed by the supporters of a political party during their protest program. They resorted to arson, brick-batting, firing and vandalism of govt property," West Bengal Police said in a tweet."Police showed restraint and didn't do lathicharge or use firearms. Only water cannons and tear gas were used to disperse the violent crowd. However, death of a person has been reported. Body is being sent for PM (post-mortem). The actual cause of death will be known only after the PM." it said in a series of tweets.Talking to reporters later, Vijayvargiya demanded President's rule in the state, claiming "law and order has collapsed"."There is criminalisation of police in West Bengal. The way they carried out a brutal attack on peaceful protesters shows the state machinery has been politicised totally," the BJP's West Bengal minder alleged.Tejaswi Surya alleged police hurled stones and were joined by "TMC goons" who threw crude bombs."This 'tanashahi' (dictatorship) cannot continue. We ask all democratic forces to join hands to dislodge this undemocratic, tyrant government."BJYM state president Saumitra Khan said at least 50 protesters were injured and threatened to launch an agitation against "police atrocity" across the state.Senior TMC MP Sougata Roy insisted police showed restraint by not resorting to firing despite serious provocation.Roy alleged the BJP was repeatedly trying to create disturbance in the state in the name of democratic movements.He said though it was unfortunate that many BJP workers were injured, the situation had gone out of control.In October this year, similar clashes between police and BJP supporters took place during the 'March to Nabanna', the state secretariat in Howrah district.

The Osmania University is yet to announce the new exam schedule, but is likely to hold the exam sometime this week itself.Telangana is expected to see a complete bandh due to the massive opposition to the three agricultural laws passed by the Union government recently.University officials said that the exams had been postponed keeping in view the possible disruption in transport and normal life. The Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TRSTC) bus services are expected to halt for some part of the day.Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) has told his Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) party workers to observe a peaceful, yet complete bandh to support the farmers of the nation. It is expected that trades, business and transport unions will join the call for bandh.Farmer associations in Telangana, however, have been saying that the TRS government should also look at how states such as Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh rejected the farm laws through amendments at the state level.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/university-exams-postponed-in-telangana-due-to-farmers-bandh-call-181147

After 30-35 years!” a Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul commented after advocate Neela Gokhale said that the petition would be argued by senior advocate Harish Salve. The Bench posted it for hearing next week.Petitioner Veena Sarin said her petition was “a genuine desire to bring about an end to the undemocratic nightmare, infamously known as ‘the emergency’ and to seek “a peaceful closure, that can be brought only by an acknowledgment and declaration by the highest court of justice of the country in which citizens repose the highest level of confidence and faith, that the said incident was unconstitutional.”She has relied on the 2017 judgment in KS Puttaswamy case which overruled the top court’s infamous decision in ADM Jabalpur versus Shivkant Shukla (1976).She said “the present petition is a plea for justice and restitution of a lifetime spent in utter misery and anguish on account of the atrocities suffered by the petitioner, her deceased husband and her family”.Recounting her agony, she said in their bid to plunder businesses and homes of victims, the government authorities had targeted her and her husband with unjustifiable and arbitrary detention orders which forced them flee India.“His business was shut down, assets and valuables including immovable property were seized and appropriated. The Petitioner’s husband succumbed to the pressure and died. Since then the Petitioner has been single-handedly facing all proceedings initiated against her husband during the Emergency period, which were arbitrarily pursued, she submitted.Sarin said the compensation money should be recovered from the authorities who have participated in misuse of powers during the Emergency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-defers-hearing-on-94-year-old-womans-plea-seeking-rs-25-cr-compensation-for-emergency-181145
07-12-2020||Midnapore (West Bengal)||Bengal will never bow its head before murderers of Mahatma Gandhi: Mamata||Accusing the BJP of practising "divisive politics for its personal gains", West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday said the state, where all communities had long lived in harmony, would "never bow its head before the murderers of Mahatma Gandhi".Banerjee, while addressing a rally in West Midnapore, slammed the BJP government at the Centre for its "arrogance and indifference" towards the plight of farmers, who had been protesting against the newly enacted agriculture laws.She contended that the Central government should immediately withdraw the "anti-people" farm laws or step down.The feisty TMC boss claimed that she would rather stay in jail than "remain silent or put up with BJP's misrule"."We don't believe in Bengali-non-Bengali politics. Both are our brothers and sisters. We also don't believe in Hindu-Muslim politics, like the BJP."The state has a long history of all communities living in harmony. The people of the state would never bow their heads before those who murdered Mahatma Gandhi," she said, without taking any name.Iterating that the BJP was a party of "outsiders", Banerjee said she would never allow the saffron camp to take control of Bengal, and urged the people of the state to resist any such attempt."If goons from outside come to our state and terrorise you, all of you should put up a united fight against them. We believe in peace. We won't allow them to have a free run here.“We will never allow outsiders to take control of the state," the Chief Minister maintained.Pledging her government's support to the farmers' agitation over the new agriculture laws, she said the BJP-led government at the Centre "should no longer continue to remain in power after sacrificing the rights of the farmers".She claimed that the saffron party was trying to malign her government and its welfare programmes."No matter what developmental work we do, they (BJP) will always try to malign us. But what about the Rafale scam?“What about the PM CARES fund? The Centre should publish a white paper on the amount of money the PM CARES Fund has received so far," she said.Alleging that the saffron party "threatens its opposition leaders and sends them to prison", Banerjee said, "I am not afraid of going to jail. I would prefer going to prison to compromising with the misrule of the BJP".Taking potshots at the CPI(M), Banerjee said, "Earlier, the CPI(M) had unleashed a reign of terror in West Midnapore. Several people were killed and were rendered homeless by CPI(M) goons. People didn't dare to come out of their homes then.""Junglemahal is at peace now. The guns of Maoists have fallen silent. CPI(M) goons have switched over to the BJP. Only the colour has changed," she said.Exuding confidence of returning to power for the third consecutive time with a bigger mandate, Banerjee said the saffron camp and the CPI(M) would suffer a severe drubbing in the next Assembly polls.The CM announced that her government would continue to dole out free ration beyond June next year after her party returns to power for the third consecutive time.The BJP has made deep inroads into Junglemahal – comprising parts of West Midnapore, Jhargram, Bankura and Purulia – during the last Lok Sabha polls, bagging five of the six Parliamentary seats in the area.Elections to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly are likely to be held in April-May next year.

07-12-2020||Lucknow||Cops detain Akhilesh Yadav after he sits on dharna on road, breaks cordon||Police took Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav into custody on Monday after party workers led by him broke through a security cordon to sit on a dharna in the heart of the city to oppose the new farm Bills.Yadav was detained for violating section 144 of the CrPC which prevents assembly of five or more people at one spot.With UP Police laying a virtual siege to the area around the Samajwadi Party headquarters here, a defiant Yadav sat on a dharna on the road for some time joined by several party leaders, before he was detained by the UP Police and bundled into a police van to remove him from the spot.“If the new farm laws are intended to help the farmers, then why are they on the war path? Why is the government so adamant? If farmers don’t want the new laws, the government should take these back,” he told reporters at the protest site.TV footage showed police using ‘laathis’ to push back SP workers.While being whisked away to Eco Garden in the state capital by the police, Yadav said, “This is a dictatorial approach of the BJP. It has blatantly violated the Constitution. There is no coronavirus for the BJP, it is only for the opposition. The BJP can hold meetings and election campaigns anywhere, and for it there will be no coronavirus threat. The government wants to kill democracy on the pretext of coronavirus,” he said.The government is insulting every SP worker, he said, adding that the non-confidence towards the government is increasing and it cannot be saved.The SP chief was scheduled to go to Kannauj to lead farmers protest there after the party gave a call for a statewide “kisan yatra” against the farm laws on Monday, but he was not allowed to leave his residence and proceed further.Yadav said the government should bring laws which can ensure doubling of farmers’ income, “but the government’s intention is not clear”.Soon after his detention, the SP MP wrote to the Lok Sabha Speaker complaining that he was being stopped from going to the programme (in Kannauj) “at the behest of the UP government”.“I am a Lok Sabha MP and national president of the Samajwadi Party. Along with this, I have discharged the constitutional responsibility of an ex-chief minister. To extend support to farmers, my programme was to be held in Kannauj on December 7, and it was declared earlier,” he said.“On the directions of the Uttar Pradesh government, I was stopped from going to the programme. A heavy police force was deployed at my residence on the Vikramaditya Marg. The police took my vehicles in its custody. This undemocratic behaviour is a violation of my rights. This amounts to breach of privileges of an MP,” Yadav said.He urged the Lok Sabha speaker to “immediately intervene” so that his rights to carry out democratic activities can be restored.Earlier on Monday, the Uttar Pradesh Police sealed a road near the Samajwadi Party office here and placed barricades on it ahead of Akhilesh Yadav’s visit to Kannauj for a ‘Kisan Yatra’.Station House Officer (SHO), Gautampalli, Chandrashekhar Singh said, “Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav was to visit Kannauj for a programme, but the Kannauj district magistrate did not give permission for it. Hence, the portion of the Vikramaditya Marg leading to the SP office has been sealed.”      Yadav, a former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, was slated to travel to Kannauj, around 125 km from the Uttar Pradesh capital, for a tractor rally as part of the ‘Kisan Yatra’ in support of farmers protesting against the Centre’s new agri laws and the ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by them on Tuesday. The 13-km yatra was planned from Thathia to Tirwa.Reports of SP workers staging protests also came from Baghpat, Mirzapur, Varanasi, Bhadohi, Prayagraj and Sonbhadra among other districts of the state. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cops-detain-akhilesh-yadav-after-he-sits-on-dharna-on-road-breaks-cordon-181142
07-12-2020||New Delhi||GST-registered small biz to file 4 sales returns in a year from January||Businesses with up to Rs 5 crore turnover will have to file only four GST sales returns, or GSTR-3B, from January instead of 12 at present, according to sources.The Quarterly filing of Return with Monthly Payment (QRMP) Scheme would impact almost 94 lakh taxpayers, about 92 per cent of the total tax base of the goods and services tax (GST), said a source.With this, from January onwards, small taxpayers would need to file only eight returns (four GSTR-3B and four GSTR-1 returns) in a year, said the source.The source further said the scheme also brings in the concept of providing input tax credit (ITC) only on the reported invoices, thereby putting a significant curb on the menace of fake invoice frauds.Sources in the know of the matter said the QRMP scheme had optional feature of invoice filing facility (IFF) to mitigate business-related hardships for the small and medium taxpayers.Under the facility of IFF, the small taxpayers who opt to be quarterly return filers under the QRMP scheme would be able to upload and file such invoices even in the first and second month of the quarter for which there is demand from the recipients.Further, this would engage buyers who earlier used to avoid purchase from the small taxpayers in the want of uploading of invoices in the system on monthly basis, said the sources.They further said the taxpayers would need not upload and file all the invoices for the month and could upload and file only those invoices that were required to be filed in the IFF as per demand of the recipients.The remaining invoices of the first and second months can be uploaded in the quarterly GSTR-1 return. The IFF would be available up to a cut-off date and credit would flow to the recipient after the cut-off date on filing of the IFF, they added.The GST Council in its meeting on October 5 had said registered person having an aggregate turnover up to Rs 5 crore might be allowed to furnish return on a quarterly basis along with monthly payment of tax, with effect from January 1, 2021.With the launch of the QRMP scheme on December 5, taxpayers with up to Rs 5 crore turnover have the option to file their GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B returns quarterly beginning January-March period.Taxpayers can make GST payments through challan every month either by self-assessment of monthly liability or 35 per cent of net cash liability of the previous filed GSTR-3B of the quarter. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gst-registered-small-biz-to-file-4-sales-returns-in-a-year-from-january-181140
07-12-2020||Kolkata||TMC’s pitch for peaceful coexistence faces the BJP challenge||“Ram and Rahim could coexist peacefully here and so do the others,” West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday while addressing a rally in Medinipur.In Siliguri, 650 km away from Mediniur, BJP general secretary and the party’s West Bengal unit in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya also addressed people but the tenor of his speech was completely different from that of Banerjee.Accusing the Trinamool Congress supremo of Muslim appeasement, Vijayvargiya alleged that it was because of her that immersion programme of the Hindu Goddess Durga had to be put on hold so that the Muharram procession of the Shia Muslims could take place as planned.Attacking Mamata for describing the BJP as a party of outsiders, Vijayvargiya alleged that while Mamata Banerjee was ready to host Rohingya Muslim refugees of Myanmar, she wanted BJP leaders from outside the state to be driven away from West Bengal.Both Mamata’s rally at Medinipur and BJP’s “Uttarkanya Abhiyan” (“Uttarkanya” is the local secretariat created for people living in the northern districts) programme were held keeping in mind the Assembly elections which are going to be held in West Bengal by April 2021.The difference in the tone and tenor of the speeches by Mamata and Vijayvargiya made it clear how TMC and BJP – the two principal rivals in the hustings – will go about campaigning for the polls.Besides the security the religious minorities enjoy in West Bengal, Mamata also talked about various welfare schemes introduced by her including the most recent health insurance scheme. The scheme, according to Mamata, will provide health cover of up to Rs five lakh to each one of the 10 crore population in the state.No other state government in the country would provide food grain under the PDS free of cost (free distribution of food grain started during lockdown has been extended  up to June 2021 in West Bengal) or provided cycles free of cost to school students, the chief minister claimed.Mamata also strongly supported the ongoing farmers’ agitation and said the Modi government should either repeal the farm laws or quit.To underscore her commitment to the farming community, Mamata cited the agitation led by her in 2007 to prevent acquisition of farm land by the then Left Front government in the state for handing over to industry. “I have not forgotten those days”, Mamata said.The BJP programme saw pitched battles fought between party workers and police in full riot gear. While the BJP workers broke through barriers set up by the police and pelted the cops with stones, the police retaliated by using water cannon against the protesters and also chased them with lathis.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh later claimed that one Pulin Roy of BJP lost his life in the police action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmcs-pitch-for-peaceful-coexistence-faces-the-bjp-challenge-181139

Consequently, they had come to believe that Hindustan was an alien and foreign country."He further said that now the PAGD leaders were on the back-foot with BJP leaders making inroads among the locals, and calling their bluff and false, anti-India narrative.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gupkar-alliance-a-divided-house-bjp-mp-zafar-islam-181135

She had also allegedly insinuated the top court for giving bail to TV journalist Arnab Goswami.“I am satisfied that each of the tweets with cartoons attached is in contempt of the Supreme Court of India, hence I grant my consent,” the had AG said in his letter to Kashyap.Earlier, the Attorney General KK Venugopal had on November 12 given his consent to initiate criminal contempt of court proceedings against standup comedian Kunal Kamra for his tweets insinuating the Supreme Court after it gave bail to Arnab Goswami in an abetment to suicide case.Terming Kamra’s tweets as “highly objectionable”, Venugopal had said in his opinion it “constitutes criminal contempt of court.”“The tweets are not only in bad taste but clearly cross the line between humour and contempt of court, the Attorney General, who recently refused to give consent for initiating contempt of court proceedings against several persons,” had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petition-seeks-criminal-contempt-action-against-comic-artist-for-tweets-scandalising-judiciary-181133

I believe the mandis at Ghazipur, Okhla and Narela will also be closed due to ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by farmers,” Adil Khan, chairman of Azadapur Mandi, said.Khan said he personally has appealed to people from all walks of life to support the farmers who feed the country.Chairman of Ghazipur wholesale mandi for vegetables, fruits and poultry and meat said many traders’ association in the market have said they will join the strike.Some auto and taxi unions in the city have also decided to join the ‘Bharat Bandh’ on Tuesday.Kamaljeet Gill, president of Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi, comprising mainly drivers working with cab aggregators, said drivers will not run their cabs associated with Ola, Uber and other app-based aggregators on the day.President of Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters’ Association Sanjay Samrat, in a statement, said several unions including Delhi State Taxi Cooperative Society and Kaumi Ekta Welfare Association will join the strike.However, many other auto and taxi unions have decided to continue normal services despite their support to demands raised by the agitating farmers.Rajender Soni, general secretary of Delhi Auto Rikshaw Sangh, and Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union said “important” auto, taxi and last-mile vehicle driver unions will not join the strike.Chandu Chaurasia, vice president of Capital Driver Welfare Association, said the demands of farmers need to be met by the government but it should not be achieved by causing inconvenience to ordinary people.Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) and All India Transport Welfare Association (AITWA), in a joint statement, said trade and transport sector will function normally despite the ‘Bharat Bandh’ call.“No farmer body has contacted us or sought our support with regard to Bharat Bandh. So trade and transport service will continue normally in Delhi and other parts of the country,” the statement said.Delhi Police have made adequate arrangements to ensure normal movement of people on roads during the proposed ‘Bharat Bandh’, an official statement said. A traffic advisory has been issued for the smooth movement of vehicles.

While Gurmail is a 2014 Dhyanchand awardee, Rajbir was bestowed the Arjuna in 1984.“The farmers have always supported us. We felt bad when we saw that our farmer brothers were lathicharged, roads were closed. Farmers are sitting on streets in bitter cold for their rights,” said Kartar, gold medallist in the 1978 and 1986 Asian games.“I am a farmer’s son I still do farming despite being IG, Police,” he added.The athletes, who reached Delhi on Sunday, began their march from the Press Club of India but were halted near Krishi Bhavan by the police and sent back.“I would like to request the government to repeal the draconian law. When the entire country was shivering for the fear of corona, they passed the bill in both houses and got it passed from the President,” Kartar said.“I agree there is a need for change in farm laws but when our children are not happy, the government’s priority should be to make them happy...Why is the government forcibly trying to push the farmers into accepting the contentious bill?” he asked.The Indian Olympic Association offered its first comments on the sportspersons’ involvement in the protest, urging them to have faith in the government and to treat their national honours and the agitation as “two separate things.”                “Of late sportspersons are seen to be announcing return of their National Awards as a mark of their support for the recent farmers issue. National Awards and farmers issue are two separate things,” IOA President Narinder Batra and Secretary General Rajeev Mehta said in a joint statement.The marching athletes claimed to have the support of several Arjuna and other national sports awards winners.Earlier, Khel Ratna awardee and India’s first Olympic medal-winning boxer Vijender Singh had also threatened to return the honour in support of the protesting farmers.Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana are camping at various Delhi border points for over a week, protesting against the new farm laws, which they claim will dismantle the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporate houses.Farmers’ concern is that these laws, aimed at reforming the sector, will eliminate the MSP and mandis that ensure their earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their produce.The government is holding talks with farmers, who have called for a ‘Bharat Bandh’ on December 8, supported by various political parties.

Patar had received the Padma Shri in 2012.Earlier, Akali Dal stalwart and former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal had announced he would return his Padma Vibhushan award in protest  against "the betrayal of the farmers by the Government of India."In a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind, Badal said he was returning the award due to "the shocking indifference and contempt with which the government was treating the ongoing peaceful and democratic agitation of the farmers against the three farm Acts".Incidentally, SAD (Democratic) chief and rebel Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has also announced that he would be returning his Padma Bhushan award.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other areas have stayed put at various Delhi border points, protesting against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporate firms.Several international sports persons from Punjab had also announced to return their sports awards and extended support to the farmers’ agitation. — with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjabi-poet-surjit-patar-to-return-padma-shri-in-solidarity-with-farmers-181124

Major political parties, such as the Congress, NCP, DMK, SP, TRS and Left on Sunday came out in strong support of the bandh.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws.Talks between the government and protesting farmers remained inconclusive on Saturday even after five rounds of discussions as union leaders stuck to their demand for the repeal of the new farm laws and went on a 'maun vrat' seeking a clear 'yes or no' reply, forcing the Centre to call for another meeting on December 9 to resolve the deadlock.

07-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||BJP slams Opposition for jumping on to farmers' Bharat Bandh for political survival||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 7Ahead of the Bharat Bandh on Tuesday, the BJP on Monday took on Opposition parties, slamming them for their “doubles standards” over reforms in the farming sector even as they themselves advocated these during their regimes.Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, dispelling farmers’ fears over their land and MSP, said though farmers themselves told politicians to stay away from their agitation, political parties were “desperately trying to jump on to the bandwagon for political existence”.“What the Narendra Modi government is doing the UPA governments have been doing in the states for long. For their political survival, they are joining any agitation. Even though farmers have said political parties are not welcome, they have jumped on and are opposing the Narendra Modi government for the sake of opposition, forgetting their own works in the past,” he said.Ahead of the Bharat Bandh, several Opposition parties, including the Congress, Samajwadi Party, TMC, NCP, RJD and the AAP, are mounting attack, leading to a massive political breakout on the issue. Sources say top central ministers are in a huddle on the ongoing agitation and politics. Prasad, however, refused to comment on farmers' dialogue with ministers and the ongoing deliberations on the issue within the government. “These are matters of discussion. I am here only to expose the double standards, duplicacy and hypocrisy of Opposition who should understand the mood of the nation. From the national level to civic elections,” he said.Incidentally, some farmers' leaders said there is nothing wrong in politicians lending support.“It is not politics whenever something wrong happens it is the job of the Opposition to lend support,” BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said.Meanwhile, quoting documents and statements from the past, Prasad said Congress' 2019 manifesto promised to “repeal the APMC Act and make the trade in agriculture free from all the restrictions”.Prasad also claimed that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi told party CMs in 2013 (when the UPA was in power in the Centre) that farmers should be able to sell directly to private players.“NCP leader Sharad Pawar, who is also opposing the three Acts, as the Agriculture Minister in 2010 wrote to CMs advocating requirement of huge investment in market infrastructure etc. Pawar said in an interview in 2005 that the APMC Act is being abolished and in his assessment it will take just another six months maximum. He said that till there is APMC Act there will be no support from the Centre. If this is not selfish politics and duplicity to save political existence, what is it,” Prasad questionedPrasad also slammed Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav reminding him his father Mulayam Singh’s statement as a member of Standing Committee. “He said it is important that farmers are saved from mandi ‘changul’ (stranglehold). The Akali Dal said the same. During the Congress regime, contract farming was implemented in several Congress-ruled states, including Haryana, Assam, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh."He also slammed Yogendra Yadav, reminding him of his tweet in 2017 that Modi government has washed its hands off ‘mandi’ reforms. Delhi CM Arvind Kejrwial is implementing the three Central Acts, he added.Asserting that “farmers land will not be allowed to be leased, sold or mortgaged,” Prasad said it is also the question of small and medium farmers whose participation is incresing on more than 1,000 NAMs in the country. As many as 1.68 crore farmers are registered on them, he said, adding that 64 per cent of paddy MSP this season was drawn by Punjab.Reminding Punjab CM Amarinder Singh of the Pepsico plant he inaugurated in March 2019, he accused him of adopting “shameful double standards to confuse farmers on wrong facts” on corporates.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-slams-opposition-for-jumping-on-to-farmers-bharat-bandh-for-political-survival-181122

The solution now is to repeal the laws, call a session of Parliament and discuss issues afresh,” Jakhar said.He said the “rigid” Centre was responsible for the agitation and for farmers sitting out in bitter cold.Jakhar also warned that the agitation was impacting food security. “Food security is an integral part of national security. Neither can be outsourced,” he said adding that the intention of the bills was suspect and farmers would not allow corporatisation of agriculture.“Farmers cannot be run through contractors. Also rather than spending money on a new parliament building, the Centre should realise that Parliament doesn’t run on buildings. It runs on emotions,” Jakhar said accusing the government of hurting the sentiments of farmers and not taking cognisance of their feelings.“The discussions taking place on borders today should have taken place in Parliament. Also the government should stop following the US model of lobbying. We will not let farming be outsourced. And we will not let national security outsourced,” he said.Jakhar also warned against certain sections instigating farmers of Haryana to raise the SYL issue in the ongoing protests. “Don’t let anyone divide Haryana and Punjab farmers. Some people are asking for SYL to be included but farmers cannot be divided,” he said terming the ongoing agitation a revolution.The Congress also appealed to commuters to “keep their inconveniences due to the bandh aside and lend support to Bharat bandh”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-mps-from-punjab-haryana-stage-dharna-at-jantar-mantar-want-parliament-session-to-be-convened-181111

India’s case per million is 6,988 against the world average of 8,438,” it said further.The total recoveries have surged to 91,39,901.“The gap between recoveries and active cases has crossed 87 lakhs (87,43,172) as on date,” the Ministry said.Of the new recovered cases, 81.20 per cent are from 10 states and UTs.Maharashtra has reported the maximum number of single day recoveries with7,486 newly recovered cases.

07-12-2020||Lucknow||Reforms needed for development, says PM amid farmers' protest||Amid the row over laws meant to bring a major change in the agri-marketing sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said reforms are needed for development and some laws from the past century have become a burden now.Launching the Agra Metro rail project through video conference, Modi said the reforms carried out by his government are also getting reflected in election results.His pitch on the importance of reforms comes ahead of Tuesday’s Bharat Bandh over the three new farm laws enacted at the Centre. But during his brief address, the Prime Minister made no direct reference to the new laws or farmers’ protests.Also read: Congress MPs from Punjab, Haryana stage dharna at Jantar Mantar; want Parliament session to be convenedKejriwal visits Singhu border, reviews arrangements for protesting farmersProtesting farmers call on people to back Bharat bandh“Reforms are needed for development. Reforms are very much needed for a new order and to give new facilities. We cannot build the next century with the laws of the previous century,” he said.“Some laws that used to be good in the past century have become a burden in the present century. Reforms should be a continuous process,” he said.Modi said his government is carrying out “holistic reforms”.  “Earlier, reforms used to happen in a piecemeal manner, or keeping in mind some sectors and departments,” the Prime Minister said.He said the reforms carried out in recent past have infused self-confidence in the country, adding that people will be satisfied when they go through the “finer details”.“This confidence has been seen in every election in the recent past. A glimpse of this confidence is seen in the election results in every part of the country, including Uttar Pradesh,” he said.The Prime Minister said in recent years the poor and the middle class have showered their “unprecedented blessings” on the efforts of the government. He said their support and the small joys experienced by the countrymen “gives me the courage to do new things and take new initiatives”.Modi said his government intends to solve the festering problems faced by people, make life easy, increase investment and ensure the maximum use of modern technology.He said a major problem in the country’s infrastructure sector was that new projects were announced but not much attention was given on how they will be funded.His government ensures the availability of funds at the start of a new project itself, Modi said.He said over Rs 100 lak- crore will be spent under the National Infrastructure Pipeline project and work is being done on the master plan for multi-modal connectivity. Efforts are also on to attract investment from all over the world to improve the country’s infrastructure, he added.Work is being carried out on 1,000 km of new Metro rail lines in 27 cities countrywide, Modi said, claiming big progress in this sector since his first government took charge in 2014.The Rs 8,379.62-crore Agro Metro project has two corridors with a total length of 29.4 km and will connect major tourist attractions like Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Sikandara with railway stations and bus stands.The project is scheduled to be completed in five years. Agra has a population of 26 lakh, and about 60 lakh tourists visit the city every year.The Prime Minister said tourism sector benefits the most from better connectivity and infrastructure. Work is on to make “local tourism vocal”, he added.He said the government has not only increased the number of countries covered under the e-visa scheme, it has also significantly reduced the tax on hotel room tariff.“With the efforts of the government, India is now ranked at number 34 on Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index.In 2013, India was ranked 65th on this index,” he said, while hoping for a recovery in the sector as the coronavirus situation improves. .Union Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath attended the event.

07-12-2020||Ravi S Singh||Union Jal Shakti Ministry dispatches teams to West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 7The Union Jal Shakti Ministry on Monday dispatched teams of experts in the opposition-ruled states of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh to provide assistance to them to realise the Centre’s goal of “Har Ghar Jal” under its flagship Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM).The call for the “Har Ghar Jal” was given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It aims to provide every rural household in the country with piped drinking water by 2024.Although the Ministry officials say the sending of the teams last week was apolitical, the two states are on the BJP radar for its expansion.Political observers see the development more than mere coincidence, especially with regard to the timing.In West Bengal, the BJP is on an expansion spree, to the extent of it winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state since the 2019 general elections and emerging as the principal challenger to the ruling TMC.In the process, it decimated the Left Front and the Congress.Assembly elections in West Bengal are due in April-May next year and the BJP has made it known that it will go full tilt to dethrone the ruling TMC from power.In Andhra Pradesh, the BJP is said to be preparing grounds for a surge, just like it did in recent Hyderabad Municipal Corporation election in Telangana, which was carved out of it (Andhra Pradesh).It has emerged as the main Opposition in the corporation from nowhere, marginalising the established regional player TDP, and the Congress in the process.“The team is visiting different parts of the West Bengal and interacting with field-level officials involved with the implementation of water supply schemes, as well as Gram Pradhans and members of Gram Panchayats,” the Jal Shakti Ministry said.The team is also holding meetings with the chairpersons of the District Water and Sanitation Mission and District Collectors to brief them about the progress and seek their intervention for speedy implementation of the programme.“The Government of India is working in tandem with the states to achieve the goals of JJM within the time frame,” the Ministry in communique said.During 2020-21, fund allocation to West Bengal has increased to Rs 1,610.76 crore. With an opening balance of Rs 1,146.58 crore, the state has an assured availability of Rs 2,760.76 crore of Central share funds.Hence during 2020-21, along with the state share, about Rs 5,770 crore is available under the Jal Jeevan Mission to provide household tap connections in West Bengal.Further, additional funds, too, can be provided based on the progress of implementation in the form of performance incentive under the JJM.West Bengal has received Rs 4,412 crore as the 15th Finance Commission Grants to Panchayati Raj Institutions, 50 per cent of which will mandatorily be spent on water and sanitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-jal-shakti-ministry-dispatches-teams-to-west-bengal-and-andhra-pradesh-181098
07-12-2020||Satya Prakash||Derogatory remarks against Sufi saint: SC refuses to quash FIRs against news anchor Amish Devgan||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 7The Supreme Court on Monday refused to quash FIRs against TV news anchor Amish Devgan for his alleged defamatory remark against Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti, but said the protection from arrest given to him would continue if he cooperated with the investigation.“Having given our careful and in-depth consideration, we do not think it would be appropriate at this stage to quash the FIRs and thus stall the investigation into all the relevant aspects,” a Bench of Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice Sanjiv Khanna said.The Bench, however, clubbed all seven FIRs lodged against Devgan in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana to Ajmer in Rajasthan. It also asked the stated concerned “to examine the threat perception of the petitioner and family members and take appropriate steps as may be necessary.”Devgan had sought clubbing of all cases against him for what he described as an “inadvertent mistake” of uttering “Chishti” in place of “Khilji” in a show telecast on June 15. He had issued a clarification and apologised for the slip of tongue. Such errors can’t be treated as criminal offences, he had submitted.It said, “‘Hate speech’ has no redeeming or legitimate purpose other than hatred towards a particular group. A publication which contains unnecessary asides which appear to have no real purpose other than to disparage will tend to evidence that the publications were written with a mala fide intention. However, opinions may not reflect mala fide intention.”Quoting from an article by Alice E. Marwick and Ross Miller of Fordham University, New York, the Bench said there were three distinct elements that legislatures and courts can use to define and identify ‘hate speech’, namely – content-based element, intent-based element and harm-based element (or impact-based element).However, it said “the three elements are not watertight silos and do overlap and are interconnected and linked. Only when they are present, that they produce structural continuity to constitute ‘hate speech’.”“Every right and indulgence has a limit. Further, when the offending act creates public disorder and violence, whether alone or with others, then the aspect of ‘who’ and question of indulgence would lose significance and may be of little consequence,” the top court said.On the importance of tolerance, the Bench said, “Tolerance is being fair to allow reasonable consensus to emerge despite differences. In essence, it implies non-discrimination of individuals or groups, but without negating the right to disagree and disapprove belief and behaviour.”The Bench, however, noted, “Political speech relating to government policies requires greater protection for preservation and promotion of democracy. Falsity of the accusation would not be sufficient to constitute a criminal offence of ‘hate speech’.”It said, “Therefore, anti-democratic speech in general and political extremist speech in particular, which has no useful purpose, if and only when in the nature of incitement to violence that ‘creates’, or is ‘likely to create’ or ‘promotes’ or is ‘likely to promote’ public disorder, would not be protected.”The court acknowledged that “in many ways, free speech has empowered those who were marginalised and discriminated against and thus it would be wholly incorrect and a mistake to assume that free speech is an elite concept and indulgence.”Adding caveat to treatment of historical events, the top court said, “The historical truth must be depicted without in any way disclosing or encouraging hatred or enmity between different classes or communities.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/derogatory-remarks-against-sufi-saint-sc-refuses-to-quash-firs-against-news-anchor-amish-devgan-181093

When the monsoon is more than normal, such quakes are felt after two- three months of rainfall,” ISR Director Sumer Chopra said.“The frequency varies but quakes occur generally during this period in Talala in Gir Somnath district as well as Porbandar and Jamnagar, which had earlier experienced similar activity, but it has now subsided,” he said.Recently, similar activities were experienced in Porbandar, which were not seen before, he said.“Rocks in these regions are fractured. When water seeps into the fractures, pore pressure is generated. The rocks are already critically stressed. Water adds to the existing pressure, causing the release of quakes. These are small activities and nothing to worry about,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/19-mild-earthquakes-felt-in-gujarats-gir-somnath-no-casualty-181091

Watch out for those who throw hat in the ring,” the Governor said a tweet with regard to the step.Dhankhar also brought up the issue of the controversy pertaining to allegations of corruption in purchasing of medical equipment worth Rs 2,000 crore by the state government to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. A three-member committee headed by the state home secretary was constituted to look into the allegations.“Hope there is no repeat of #PANDEMICPURCHASE where transparency and accountability were casualty and even the eye wash probe is guarded secret,” Dhankhar wrote in his comment in another tweet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-to-allow-govt-hospitals-for-use-as-private-medical-colleges-181090

Stop at the foundation laying ceremony. Some deference must be shown to the Court,” said the Bench, which clarified that the government could proceed with paperwork relating to the project.“Just because there is no stay, it does not mean that you (Centre) can go ahead with everything,” said the Bench that had on April 30 refused to stay the project.The top court, which on November 5 had reserved its verdict on PILs challenging various permissions given by authorities for the redevelopment of Central Vista in Lutyens’ Delhi, specially assembled after coming to know that the government was going ahead with the project without waiting for its verdict.On Monday, the court told Mehta: “We have shown deference to you and expected that you will act in a prudent manner. The same deference should be shown to the Court and there should be no demolition or construction.”As the court expressed its displeasure, Mehta took time out from the court to seek instructions. He came back in five minutes; apologised to the court and gave an undertaking about not effecting any physical changes at the site.The Central Vista redevelopment plan, which aims to free up the 75-acre land in the heart of the Capital, involves the demolition of around 10 buildings, including the Shastri Bhawan, the Udyog Bhawan, the Krishi Bhawan, the Vigyan Bhawan, the Vice President’s House and the Lok Nayak Bhawan.Announced in September last year, it envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 1,224 MPs, expected to be constructed by August 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024.The Gujarat-based architecture firm, HCP Design, Planning and Management Private Limited, has won the consultancy bid for the ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista to construct a common central secretariat complex and a new Parliament building.The petitioners, including activist Rajeev Suri, have challenged various permissions given to the project by the authorities, including the nod for change of land use. They have questioned the project over environmental clearance granted to the project and the historical value of the existing building.Asserting that there was no element of arbitrariness or favouritism in selection of the consultant for the project, the Centre has defended the project, saying it would “save money” paid as rent for housing the Central Government ministries in the national capital.Last month, Mehta had contended that “courts cannot strike down policy decisions merely because it feels a better policy decision could have been taken”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-foundation-stone-laying-ceremony-for-new-parliament-building-181089

07-12-2020||Vijay Mohan||BRO adopts new techniques for controlled blasting in road construction||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 7Amid enhanced scope of work and impetus on improving infrastructure in far-flung areas, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is adopting new techniques for controlled blasting developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) that would be more effective for undertaking construction works in rugged terrain.Following a memorandum of understanding signed by the BRO with the CSIR’s Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR), a team of scientists from the institute undertook a series of field visits and spent several months at various sites to suggest blast designs on various border roads.According to a senior BRO officer, difficulties faced in rock blasting during the cutting and formation work of roads in high altitude areas, both in the northern as well as north-eastern theatres, is among major reasons for slow progress of construction in the hills.“Field reports from units responsible for critical border roads, including those in Ladakh, Arunachal and Uttarakhand, have confirmed that controlled blasting techniques developed by the CIMFR has been effective and safe in enhancing the pace of road construction works,” the officer added.A fresh agreement on ‘Advice on Controlled Blast Design for Excavation of Rock at BRO Road Construction Sites’ was signed between the BRO and the CIMFR a few days ago. The tie-up is for a period of five years which can be extended on mutual consent.The technology of controlled blasting techniques would enable proper fragmentation of rock and muck. It would ensure that drilling efforts are substantially reduced and the blasting is more controlled and optimum slope stabilisation is achieved.The progress enhancement due to CSIR-CIMFR technique has been appreciated by the BRO officials and other states, leading to the signing of the current agreement for a period of five years which can be extended further upon mutual understanding.Blasting, which involves the use of various types and quantities of explosives, is a highly technical and hazardous activity that requires a high degree of planning, task evaluation and impact assessment, a BRO officer said. One of the biggest hazards of blasting is flyrock (fragments of rock that get thrown around) that can pose a danger to the personnel, the equipment or the structures in the vicinity.“The challenge in controlled blasting is to ensure that fragments and debris are restricted within a specified area through blast design patterns and also to correctly assess the blast induced ground vibration levels and air overpressure in places which are prone to landslides or where built-up structures are present,” the officer said.The BRO, which is tasked with the construction and maintenance of critical road network in border regions, had stepped up its activities recently to ensure that the lines of communication to forward areas along the border with China remain open.A number of strategic bridges were also inaugurated this summer and more are in the pipeline.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bro-adopts-new-techniques-for-controlled-blasting-in-road-construction-181083
07-12-2020||New Delhi||After Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech seeks emergency use authorisation for Covid vaccine||Bharat Biotech on Monday applied to the Drug Controller for emergency use authorisation for COVAXIN, one of the two indigenous COVID vaccines being developed in India.This makes Bharat Biotech the first company to apply for regulatory approvals for a “fully developed and made in India COVID vaccine”.The COVAXIN trials are in late stage phase 3 and the vaccine is being developed by the Hyderabad-based company in collaboration with the ICMR.Bharat Biotech vaccine would be the first indigenous vaccine to seek regulator’s emergency nod.Pfizer India and Serum Institute have already sought authorisations. While Pfizer is a vaccine developed by foreign firms, SII-manufactured Covishield is being produced in India but was developed abroad by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.As of today three vaccine makers have sought emergency nod for use in India.Earlier, the Serum Institute of India on Sunday became the first indigenous company to apply to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) seeking emergency use authorisation for the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine in the country citing unmet medical needs due to the pandemic and in the interest of the public at large, official sources said.A day earlier, the Indian arm of US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer became the first to seek a similar approval from India's drug regulator for its own COVID-19 vaccine in the country, after securing such clearance in the UK and Bahrain.The phase-three clinical trial of the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, is being conducted by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India on Sunday (SII), co-sponsored by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in various parts of the country in addition to clinical studies being carried out by Oxford-AstraZeneca in the UK and Brazil.Based on phase two and three clinical trial results, the SII with the help of the ICMR will pursue early availability of the vaccine for India, the country's apex health research body had said last month.According to the ICMR, the SII has already manufactured 40 million doses of the vaccine under the at-risk manufacturing and stockpiling license it obtained from the DCGI.Official sources, citing the SII application, said the firm has stated that data from four clinical studies, two in the UK and one each in Brazil and India, shows that Covishield is highly efficacious against symptomatic and most importantly against severe COVID-19 infections.The results are in line with other anti-coronavirus vaccines and because of the huge disease burden, Covishield is predicted to alleviate substantial COVID-19 mortality and morbidity, the firm is learnt to have said."In terms of safety, Covishield was well tolerated with respect to solicited adverse events and was not associated with an increased number of SAEs and deaths. A majority of solicited reactions were mild in severity and resolved without any sequelae."Therefore, Covishield is safe and well-tolerated and can be used effectively for prevention of COVID-19 in the targeted population. Thus, the benefit to risk ratio strongly supports the widespread use of Covishield," a source said quoting the application.In order to introduce an urgently needed vaccine against COVID-19 in India, SII, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, has entered into a collaboration with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca to manufacture the vaccine.The SII has also submitted 12 batches of the vaccine to the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) in Kasauli for testing, a source said."In line with our philosophy we assure you that for COVID-19 vaccines also, we are committed to make our country 'aatmanirbhar' (self-reliant) and fulfil our prime minister's clarion call of 'vocal for local' and 'making in India' for the world," stated the application signed by Prakash Kumar Singh, Additional Director, Government and Regulatory Affairs at Serum Institute of India (SII).In view of all these facts and unmet medical needs in the interest of the public at large to save millions of people in the country and across the globe, early availability of a vaccine against COVID-19 is a necessity, it stated."So, in the national interest, we request you to grant us emergency use authorisation of Covishield based on our application and in view of immediate need for a safe, effective, programmatically suitable and affordable vaccine for our country," the application read.According to sources, this vaccine is logistically feasible for distribution in the country's both urban and rural parts as it can be stored at two to eight degrees Celsius, which is an ideal temperature for being kept in cold storages in the country.As a rapid regulatory response, the DCGI on August 2 had given nod to SII for conducting the combined phase two and three human clinical trials of the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine in the country.

I took it up as a challenge because l always aim at making customized jewellery," said Harshit.The work on the ring started in 2018 and it was completed by February 2020," said Harshit, who learnt jewel designing from Surat after doing his BBA and MBA from SRM University in Meerut.Each and every diamond was specially tested and all of them are of EF colour and Very Very Slightly Included (VVS) clarity.These are the best quality of diamonds used in jewellery worldwide.The ring is certified by International Gemological Laboratory (IGI) which is one of the most prestigious labs for diamond jewellery certification globally.Talking about the design, Harshit said, "I was toying with several designs for a long time and eventually found it in my garden. A marigold flower caught my eye and I put it in between my fingers to see how it will look. It was then that I decided that this would be my design." Each petal in the ring is uniquely shaped and none of the petals are identical to each other which gives the ring a perfect blend of organic symmetry, design and alignment.Refusing to divulge the ring's price, he said, "It is priceless. We will keep it with us for now because we are emotionally attached to it." IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-jeweller-makes-priceless-diamond-ring-sets-record-181079

Chandumajra said the Chief Minister had agreed that the management should have representatives of Sikhs from all over the country.Presently, only Sikhs from Maharashtra are part of the management after the previous Shiv Sena-BJP combine government had recast the membership. “Thackeray has agreed that two representatives of the SGPC should be part of the management. This was an important demand of the Sikh community in India and abroad. The CM has ordered holding of meetings next week to formalise this arrangement,” he said.Chandumajra said the Shiv Sena chief was pained at the attack on federalism by the BJP government and it’s attempts to weaken regional parties and dethrone the regional governments.Chandumajra had yesterday met All India Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata. He said Thackeray and Mamata Banerjee were looking forward to the new political front.He said the SAD delegation would meet former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in the coming week. It has already met Biju Janta Dal president and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.“The regional parties have to come together to save the federal system in the country and to end the dictatorial government of Narendra Modi,” said Chandumajra. The SAD and Shiv Sena were among the oldest allies of the BJP. While the SAD broke ties with the BJP over the farm laws, the Shiv Sena had parted ways earlier over differences in Maharashtra polls.‘Efforts on to keep federalism alive’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sad-delegation-meets-shiv-sena-chief-to-forge-national-front-180831

The Trinamool Congress, RJD and the Left parties, besides 10 central trade unions, had on Saturday backed the countrywide strike.NCP chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar warned the Centre that if the deadlock continued, the agitation would not be limited to Delhi and people from across the country would come in support of the protesting farmers.Edit: Need a solutionCongress president Sonia Gandhi and Pawar led a grouping of 11 opposition parties to issue a statement today, declaring their support for the bandh. “We extend our solidarity with the farmers’ ongoing struggle and extend our support to their call for Bharat bandh, demanding the withdrawal of retrograde agricultural laws and the electricity amendment Bill,” said a statement signed by Sonia Gandhi, Pawar, DMK’s MK Stalin, RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, NC’s Farooq Abdullah, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav, CPM’s Sitaram Yechury, CPI’s D Raja, CPI(ML)’s Dipankar Bhattacharya, All India Forward Bloc’s Debabrata Biswas and RSP’s Manoj Bhattacharya.The leaders said the farm laws passed in Parliament “in a brazen anti-democratic manner threaten India’s food security… lay the basis for abolition of the MSP and mortgage Indian agriculture and our markets to the caprices of multinational agri-business corporations.”The opposition leaders asked the Centre to adhere to democratic processes and meet the “legitimate demands of our kisan-annadatas”. Pawar, whose NCP is part of the Congress-led UPA, said farmers from Punjab and Haryana contributed the most to the country’s agriculture. “I hope wisdom dawns on the government and it takes cognisance to resolve the issue. If this stalemate continues, the protest will not be limited to Delhi, but people from every nook and corner of the country will come in support of the protesting farmers,” he said.Laws illegal, says SC Bar Association chiefSupreme Court Bar Association president Dushyant Dave has termed the Centre’s farm laws “unconstitutional and illegal” and offered his services free of cost to the farmers.

It has sought an action taken report from them by December 15.According to a CPCB statement, the monitoring of 22 drains in Delhi has found 14 drains “untapped, discharging sewage”.In the past, the CPCB observed froth formation and increase in ammonia levels in the Yamuna because of discharge of untreated sewage, non-operation of existing sewage treatment plants (STPs), improper functioning of effluent treatment plants (ETPs) installed by the industries and common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) located on the banks of the river.Taking cognisance, the CPCB issued directions to the Delhi Jal Board to submit a time-bound action plan to ensure compliance to norms by STPs and that no untreated sewage was discharged in these drains, the official statement said.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee has been directed to take action against non-complying CETPs and industrial units. Similar directions have also been issued to the State Pollution Control Boards of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpcb-concerned-over-frothing-in-yamuna-180822

Political observers see this more than coincidence, especially with regard the timing.In West Bengal, the BJP is on expansion spree, to the extent of it winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state in the 2019 General Election and emerging as principal challenger to the ruling TMC while decimating the dominant Left Front and the Congress.Assembly elections in Bengal are due next year and the BJP will go full tilt to emerge victorious. In Andhra Pradesh, the BJP is said to be preparing the ground for a surge, just like it did in recent Hyderabad Municipal Corporation election in Telangana, which was carved out of it (Andhra Pradesh). It emerged as the main Opposition, marginalising the regional player TDP, and the Congress in the process.“The team is visiting different parts of West Bengal and interacting with field-level officials involved with implementation of water supply schemes as well as gram pradhans and members of gram panchayats,” the Jal Shakti Ministry said.The team is also holding meetings with the Chairperson of the District Water and Sanitation Mission/District Collector to brief them about the progress and seek their intervention for speedy implementation of the programme.During 2020-21, fund allocation to West Bengal has increased to Rs 1,610.76 crore. With an opening balance of Rs 1,146.58 crore, the state has an assured availability of Rs 2,760.76 crore of Central share funds. During 2020-21, along with state share, Rs 5,770 crore is available under the JJM to provide household tap connections in West Bengal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-potable-water-in-every-home-centre-sends-teams-to-bengal-ap-180823

The SC orders also covered children in foster care.The government data shows 132 children in childcare institutions have so far contracted Covid-19 — a reason why it was considered urgent to send children home as the pandemic surged.Since the passing of the Supreme Court orders in April, 64 per cent children (1,45,788 out of 2,27,518) in need of care and protection who were in childcare institutions have been restored to their families and child welfare committees are telephonically monitoring their progress at home.High Courts and state representatives shared the above data at a national consultation on the issue organised by the SC’s Juvenile Justice Committee in coordination with the UNICEF.The consultation engaged chiefs and members of Juvenile Justice Committees of High Courts and was led by Justice S Ravindra Bhat, Judge, Supreme Court, and Chair of the SC Juvenile Justice Committee.Secretary, Women and Child Development Ministry, Ram Manohar Mishra, meanwhile, said the Centre had appealed to states to draft detailed district action plans for the support of children for future.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-risk-60-juvenile-delinquents-sent-home-180824
07-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Sangh affiliate says no to bandh||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 6While farmer ‘jathebandis’ and unions today outlined details of the December 8 ‘Bharat bandh’, the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh announced its opposition, saying “such demonstrations always prove detrimental to the nation and farmers”.The RSS affiliate, which has been supporting the farmers’ stir against the three Central Acts, said now that the Modi government had agreed to amendments, farmer unions should take what was being offered to them “gracefully and respectfully”. “What is the ‘aqalmandi’ (sensibility) in rejecting what is being offered in a respectful manner? They should have accepted the offer,” BKS general secretary Badri Narayan Chaudhary said.BKS leaders opine that while the demonstration is going on in a peaceful manner, “it is evident that certain anti-social elements, external forces and some political parties are manoeuvring the demonstration towards acrimony”.Recollecting the 2017 Mandsaur incidence in which six farmers were shot dead, Chaudhary said, “Leaders of that movement eventually became legislatures and ministers in the government while families of farmers were ruined. We asked Punjab ‘jathebandis’ and unions to postpone ‘Bharat bandh’, but they declined. It is obvious that some other forces are calling the shots.”He also questioned why Punjab farmers were demanding to repeal the Central laws when the Punjab Government had already nullified these. Organising secretary Dinesh Kulkarni said the ongoing agitation on Delhi borders “is no longer a farmers’ movement and various other elements, including political, have crept into it”.Pawar to meet Prez on Dec 9Mumbai: NCP chief Sharad Pawar is scheduled to meet President Ram Nath Kovind on December 9 over the ongoing farmers’ protest against the new agrarian laws, the party said here on Sunday.NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said the former Union agriculture minister will apprise Kovind of the situation in the country in the backdrop of the protest.Pawar will be accompanied by CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, CPI leader D Raja and DMK MP TR Baalu.Pawar asked the Centre to take serious cognisance of the ongoing farmers' protest and said if the deadlock continues, the agitation will not be limited to Delhi and people from across the country will stand by the protesting cultivators. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sangh-affiliate-says-no-to-bandh-180825

We have readied 50 beds in the GGH in Vijayawada to shift patients, if required. Our medical teams are attending to every patient,” the Deputy Chief Minister said.BJP MP GVL Narasimha Rao, who spoke to state Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney, said a five-member team of doctors from AIIMS at Mangalagiri here was visiting Eluru to treat the patients.Rao said he spoke to AIIMS, Delhi Director Randeep Guleria and other experts on the mysterious disease and also made them talk to the West Godavari district medical officials.Poisonous organic substances could be the most likely cause of the disease, the MP said after talking to the experts.TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh too visited the hospital and spoke to the victims.He blamed the Jagan Mohan Reddy government’s negligence for the disease outbreak, though initially it was suspected that water contamination caused it.Expressing anguish over 290 people falling ill, TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu demanded a full-fledged inquiry into the disease outbreak and declaration of health emergency in Eluru city.Meanwhile, health authorities could not yet establish the cause of the sudden disease, though blood tests and CT scans were performed.The probable cause could become evident only after the culture test results came in.E-coli results were also awaited, Joint Collector Himanshu Shukla said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-dies-292-taken-ill-in-andhra-pradesh-180774

For trials in India, we have adopted accelerated rolling reviews of multiple phases at the same time. Interim analysis of clinical trial data at predefined stages is also permitted to facilitate early decisions in an emergency situation.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pfizer-seeks-nod-for-vaccine-local-trial-exemption-180690
