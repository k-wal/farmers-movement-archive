We reimposed the same following a demand from the state’s women. This has resulted in manifold benefits for the people of Bihar,” he said.“Moreover, there have been a number of studies which vindicate the stand taken by us on the issue of liquor. A recent study has even claimed that consumption of alcohol dilutes the efficacy of the corona vaccine. The WHO has enumerated a number of diseases that result from drinking, which I keep highlighting,” Kumar said.The prohibition law should be strictly enforced in the state and stern action must be taken against those found involved in bootlegging, he said.“If such people happen to be from outside the state, they also must be identified and brought under the dragnet,” he added.The chief minister also directed officials to take all possible measures to keep crime under control and underscored the need for countering “negativity spread against Bihar on the social media, by apprising the people of the good things that are happening here”. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/enforce-strict-liquor-prohibition-dont-spare-violators-from-outside-bihar-nitish-tells-officials-183408

This is the stand of the government,” he told reporters at Kannur.Kerala is the latest to announce free of cost COVID-19 vaccine for its people. States, including Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, have already made a similar announcement.The Centre on Tuesday said three COVID-19 vaccines, developed by Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India and Pfizer, are under active consideration of India’s drug regulator and there is hope that early licensure is possible for all or any of them.Five vaccine candidates are under different phases of clinical trials in the country.Vijayan said the quantity of the vaccine that would be allotted to the state by the Centre was not yet known.“The fact is that the number of COVID-19 cases are decreasing, which is a matter of relief. However, it needs to be seen if the local body polls, two phases of which are over, would contribute to increase in cases. That will be known only in the days to come,” he said.If the cases do not increase, this trend (of cases declining) will continue, the chief minister added.Kerala on Saturday recorded 5,949 COVID-19 cases and 32 deaths, taking the caseload to 6.64 lakh and the toll to 2,594. The active cases stood at 60,029. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/free-covid-19-vaccine-for-all-in-kerala-cm-vijayan-183407

Former Israeli ambassador to India Mark Sofer was non-resident ambassador to Bhutan in 2010-11.A fortnight earlier, Germany, which sees China as a systemic rival, had upgraded its consulate in Thimphu into a full-fledged embassy.In addition to deepening cooperation in economic, technological and agriculture development, the two ambassadors highlighted that the ties between the peoples through cultural exchanges and tourism would also be further enhanced, said an Israeli embassy news release.Following the ceremony the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, Tandi Dorji and Gabi Ashkenazi sent congratulations to each other. Despite the absence of diplomatic relations, Israel has supported Bhutan’s human resource development since 1982, especially in agriculture development.Diplomatic ties would create new avenues for cooperation in water management, technology, human resource development, agricultural sciences and other areas of mutual benefit, added the news release.Bhutan now has formal diplomatic relations with only 54 countries but not with China, the US, the UK, France and Russia. It has embassies in seven countries. It had closed its borders with China after the PLA’s invasion of Tibet in 1959.As is the case with the German ambassador Walter Lindner, Malka may be non-resident envoy to Bhutan.The Israeli Foreign Minister also invited his counterpart to visit Israel to promote cooperation between the countries which could pave the way for the King of Bhutan’s first official visit to Israel.Israel briefly had a nonresident ambassador to Bhutan in 2010, Mark Sofer, who was Israel's ambassador to Sri Lanka at the time.In 2017, Gilad Cohen, the head of Israel's Asia-Pacific division, became the most senior Israeli official to visit Bhutan. During his trip, he met the country's Prime Minister.Bhutan, which is about twice as large as Israel, but with only 800,000 residents, is thought to be one of the most beautiful countries in the world, but limits tourism, especially from outside South Asia, and only allowed television and the Internet in 1999, in an attempt to preserve its culture and natural resources.It uniquely measures its quality of life by "Gross National Happiness" instead of gross domestic product (GDP), and in fact, the World Happiness Report was a joint initiative of the Bhutanese Prime Minister and UN Secretary-General in 2011. That metric emphasizes sustainable development, environmental conservation, preservation of culture and good governance, as well as mental and physical health, among other values.The Bhutanese are thought to be among the happiest people in the world, and the happiest in Asia, but they are also among the poorest in the world.Its main export is hydroelectric energy, to India.Bhutan became a constitutional monarchy, holding its first general election in 2008. Before that it was an absolute monarchy. Its king’s official title is Dragon King.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/israel-establishes-diplomatic-ties-with-bhutan-183406

The suspect has been booked under (sections) 295, 295-A and 427 of the Pakistan Penal Code," he said, adding that the suspect told the police that his 'religious sentiments' were hurt seeing the statue of a Sikh ruler at the fort.Early in August 2019, two young men belonging to a religious party – Tehreek-Labbaik Pakistan of Maulana Khaim Rizvi – had vandalised the statue. They had used sticks to damage the figure.In June 2019, Maharaja Singh's statue was unveiled in a colourful ceremony in which several Sikh delegates from India, Pakistan and other countries had participated. The event was organised by Bobby Singh Bansal from the UK, in collaboration with the Walled City of Lahore Authority.The nine-feet statue is made of cold bronze. It shows the regal Sikh emperor sitting on a horse, sword in hand, complete in Sikh attire.Sculpted by local artists, under the aegis of the Fakir Khana Museum, the statue is meant to invoke the feeling of the emperor being present, with its real life proportions, and was unveiled on his 180th death anniversary. Ranjit Singh died in 1839.“The project was meant to commemorate the 180th death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and to forge a lasting friendship amongst the people of Punjab,” Bobby Singh Bansal had said.His organisation SK Foundation, UK, commissioned the statue in 2016. “We donated it to the people of Pakistan to promote Sikh heritage and tourism here,” he had said.Maharaja Singh was the leader of the Sikh Empire, which ruled the northwest Indian subcontinent in the early half of the 19th century.

12-12-2020||New Delhi||If there are anti-social elements in farmers’ protests, govt should catch them: Rakesh Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Saturday said farmers unions are not aware of the presence of any anti-social elements in their ongoing protests against the Centre’s new farm laws and asked the government to nab them if it feels so.His comments came a day after the Centre asked the protesting farmers to be vigilant against their platform being misused, saying some “anti-social” as well as “Leftist and Maoist” elements are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the agitation.Tikait accused the government of trying to “malign” their protests against the new agriculture laws.“We do not know about the presence of anti-social elements in our agitation. The government is trying to distract the farmers. By saying all this, it is trying to malign our movement. And if it thinks there are any such elements in our protests, it should catch them. We have not stopped the government,” he told PTI.On Human Rights Day on Thursday, photographs of some protesters at the Tikri border holding posters and demanding the release of several activists arrested under various charges had gone viral on social media, prompting Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar to say that these “anti-social elements” are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasants’ movement under the guise of farmers.Earlier in the day, farmer leader Kanwalpreet Singh Pannu alleged at a press conference that the government tried to weaken their agitation, but the protesting farmers did not let that happen.“The government tried to weaken our agitation by dividing us (various farmer unions). I want to say that the ongoing agitation is fully under the control of 32 farmer unions. We will fail every government attempt to divide us,” he said.Pannu said they are ready to hold talks with the government, but will first discuss repealing the three new farm laws and announced that representatives of their unions would sit on a hunger strike during a nationwide protest on December 14.He also said thousands of farmers will start their “Delhi Chalo’ march with their tractors from Rajasthan’s Shahjahanpur through the Jaipur-Delhi highway at 11 am on Sunday.

12-12-2020||New Delhi||Hope to have serious discussions on trade issues with Biden administration: Jaishankar||There was a fairly serious negotiation between India and the Trump administration on resolving the outstanding trade issues as well as to clinch a trade deal, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday while hoping to have talks over it with the Biden dispensation.The external affairs minister said the focus of the talks was to address the “differences” before moving towards “something bigger”.Participating in an interactive session at the annual general meeting of industry body FICCI, Jaishankar said the US economy was largely a “complementary” one and that there was “no fundamental clash of interests” between the two sides though there are some areas of overlap.“There was a fairly serious negotiation between our government and the Trump administration on resolving the outstanding trade issues. I think the general thinking on both sides was ‘let’s deal with differences before we think of something bigger’,” he said.The external affairs minister said a lot of discussions had taken place over the proposed deal.“For a variety of reasons, they didn’t close it out. I can tell you on our side, we were dead serious. We wanted to deal with those issues because we thought there was something much bigger that was in store for the relationship. But it didn’t happen. And often when it comes to trade discussions (they) are like business discussions between two governments,” he said.In such discussions, the devil is in the details, he said, adding, “If you do not close out a deal, it is not a deal.”  “We made a very focused serious persevering effort, it didn’t get done this year. I do believe that in a very very basic way, the US is a complementary economy,” he said.The external affairs minister further said: “I certainly hope that we have serious discussions once the (Biden) administration comes in. I know our minister is very focused on it, and it is something which is rightly very important on his agenda.”  The Trump administration last year terminated India’s designation as a beneficiary under the key GSP trade programme on the ground that it has not provided the US equitable and reasonable access to its markets.Export of certain goods to the US was previously allowed in duty-free category under a special trade scheme called the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).The US has been seeking greater access to India’s huge poultry and dairy markets. However, India has some reservations over it.Asked about the outcome of the US presidential election, Jaishankar suggested that the ties between the two countries will continue to expand.“If I were to sum up my takeaway from the Biden administration coming into office, I would say vis-a-vis the world, quite apart from the security issues and the political influence issues, one big question for them is---how do they keep America competitive. And the other big question is really, how do they deal with the climate change challenge,” he said.Jaishankar said the Indo-US relationship is at a “different level” now and that cooperation in security and defence will continue to be key aspects of it.“When it comes to economic issues, especially competitiveness, I think India can make a big difference. Because we are actually doing today much more on global issues and global challenges than we have done before, even on something like climate change if you look,” he added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hope-to-have-serious-discussions-on-trade-issues-with-biden-administration-jaishankar-183397
12-12-2020||---||Farmers’ body slams Centre for portraying demand for release of intellectuals as ‘Naxal infiltration’ of farmer struggle||New Delhi, December 12The BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) on Saturday slammed the BJP-led Centre for portraying its demand for the release of intellectuals as “Naxal infiltration/Khalistani struggle” in the movement and declared to intensify struggle.Calling upon "people to repel the provocative and divisive tactics used by the BJP government and intensify the struggle", BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh said preparations were on in full swing for massive protests at district level across Punjab on December 14 in which lakhs of people would participate.Addressing kisan morcha at Tikri border here, Joginder Singh called it an important stage of the struggle.He said family members of farmers who had committed suicide across Punjab will take special part in the agitation at Tikri border on December 16 and "show the world the pain of Punjab's agricultural crisis"."The brutal realities of the families of the farmers who have lost their lives due to debt will be exposed to the world. This will show how these new agricultural laws will increase only the yield of debt crops and sow the seeds of suicide," he said."On one hand, the Modi government is proposing minor amendments in the laws and on the other hand it is spreading inflammatory propaganda about the farmers’ struggle."The demand for the release of intellectuals is being termed as Naxal infiltration, sometimes it is portrayed as a Khalistani struggle and the action to block the Jaipur Highway is being used to create an illusion of violence," he added.Ugrahan said the "tried and tested weapon of misleading propaganda by the BJP will be thwarted by the struggling farmers with the cooperation of all working classes”.“This provocative propaganda is aimed at putting pressure on the struggling masses to accept the proposed amendments," the farmers’ body said in a statement.It further said: "The impasse in the proposed amendments was evident from today's statement of the BJP in which the party had announced a campaign to enumerate the benefits of the law in 700 districts across the country."A convoy of hundreds of activists led by the rationalist society from within Punjab also joined the protest on Saturday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-body-slams-centre-for-portraying-demand-for-release-of-intellectuals-as-naxal-infiltration-of-farmer-struggle-183392
12-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmer group in support of new agri laws meets Tomar, threatens to protest if repealed||Amid an ongoing protest against three farm laws, a delegation of 29 farmers from Haryana met Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday to extend their support to the new legislations and threatened to stage a protest if those are repealed.The delegation, led by Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (Mann) Haryana state leader Guni Prakash, submitted a “letter of support” to Tomar on the farm laws passed by Parliament in September and demanded the government to continue with these legislations.“We will also protest if the government repeals the laws. We have given a memorandum to all districts,” Prakash told reporters after the meeting.He also sought to know why the previous government did not implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission till 2014.“Everyone has a right to protest. They have, so do we. We are in support of the three laws, but this protest is being led by Leftists and those who are violent,” he said.Claiming that the ongoing farmers’ agitation is no longer a peasant movement, the BKU leader said, “It has taken a political colour. Farmers will get real freedom through these three laws.”This was the second group of farmers from Haryana that met Tomar and extended support to the farm laws. The first group had met the minister on December 7.No breakthrough has been achieved during the six rounds of talks between the Centre and the agitating farmers so far, as the farmers have stuck to their demand for a repeal of the laws, despite the government sending them a draft proposal to amend specific issues without abolishing the legislations.The three laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and scrap the mandis (wholesale markets), leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has maintained that the MSP and the mandi system would continue and would rather be improved and strengthened further. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-group-in-support-of-new-agri-laws-meets-tomar-threatens-to-protest-if-repealed-183391
12-12-2020||---||Uzbekistan on board for India-Iran connectivity initiative||New Delhi, December 12In a rare quicksilver move in diplomacy, India, Iran and Uzbekistan will hold trilateral meeting on the joint use of Chabahar port on December 14, three days after it was proposed by Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev during a virtual summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The move will increase the use of Chabahar Port in Iran to step up its trade and economic engagement with Central Asia bypassing Pakistan. Uzbekistan is Central Asia’s most populous nation and has ample reserves of uranium, gold, coal and oil. Some of these natural resources could be evacuated from Chabahar to parts of world not easily accessible to this double landlocked country.“This would open up economic opportunities for the traders and business community of the region. Besides Uzbekistan, other Central Asian countries have also shown interest in using the port. India seeks to cooperate closely with regional countries on this issue,” said a MEA statement.In an indication of the importance assigned to the first ‘Trilateral Working Group Meeting’, the co-chairs will be at the Deputy Minister level from Iran and Uzbekistan, and Secretary-level from India.India is involved in the development of the first phase of Shahid Beheshti Port in Chabahar in cooperation with Iran to open up sea-land connectivity between India and Afghanistan. The plan is to push this connectivity into Central Asia and beyond. Aware that this route provides a second access from the sea apart from Karachi, the US has given a waiver from sanctions for the development of this Iranian port.The route, if gets patronised by Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, will render insignificant Pakistan’s blocking of connectivity initiatives in the region, especially from India to Afghanistan and the five Central Asian nations.India, as also the US and the European Union, have been engaging with Uzbekistan more intensively after Mirziyoyev took over in 2016 following Islam Karimov’s death after a quarter of a century as President. All three powers are using the C-5 + 1 format of interacting simultaneously with all five Central Asian countries as well as on a one-to-one basis. India made a breakthrough in strategic ties with Uzbekistan last year when it inked an agreement to import uranium to power its nuclear power plants.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uzbekistan-on-board-for-india-iran-connectivity-initiative-183388
12-12-2020||Kolkata||If Bengal doesn’t reply on complaints, will handover matter to MHA: NCW chief||The National Commission for Women (NCW) will submit details of over 260 complaints from West Bengal to the Ministry of Home Affairs for further action if the state administration fails to respond to them within 15 days, its chairperson Rekha Sharma said on Saturday.Sharma was on a two-day visit to the state to inquire into “inaction” on 267 complaints, including two the women’s rights panel has initiated on its own.The ruling Trinamool Congress, however, claimed that the number of crime against women per one lakh population in Kolkata is much less than that in Ahmedabad in BJP-ruled Gujarat.The NCW chief said: “The worrisome situation in West Bengal is police don’t reply, and no action has been taken on the complaints. Neither the director general of police nor the chief secretary meets me, and this not the first time. They send their subordinates who are clueless about everything”. “In the last eight months, there have been more than 260 complaints, and no report has been sent to us,” Sharma told PTI.She said that she will write to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and if the commission doesn’t get any response on the complaints within the next 15 days, the matter will be forwarded to the home ministry.“We met governor during our visit this time. I am not saying the government can control things, but it can at least take action,” she said.The commission has raised concern about the “rising problem of trafficking of women” from north Bengal and tribal areas of the state.Senior TMC MP Sougata Ray later said, “The NCW chief is a BJP leader and she spent two hours at BJP head office Raj Bhavan today. So her comments are not surprising.”  The TMC has on several occasions in the past accused Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar of functioning like a BJP leader.He claimed that cases of crime against women per one lakh population in Delhi and Ahmedabad are 1,457 and 826 respectively, while the figure is 152 in Kolkata.Ray, however, did not specify the year of data he gave.He also claimed said the rate of crime against women has come down by 21 per cent since the TMC came to power in the state.West Bengal’s Women and Child Development Minister Sashi Panja also claimed that women are safer in the state than any other part of the country.“The state government has taken all steps for the security of the women. The allegations against the state administration are baseless and politically motivated,” she said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-bengal-doesnt-reply-on-complaints-will-handover-matter-to-mha-ncw-chief-183383

12-12-2020||New Delhi||CBI conducting internal enquiry into 'missing' gold: Officials||The CBI has set up an "internal enquiry" after 103 kg gold worth Rs 43 crore, seized and sealed by it eight years ago, went missing, officials said.The Madras High Court has directed the Tamil Nadu Crime Branch-CID police to probe the case of "missing" gold, which left the country's premier investigating agency red-faced.The gold is part of 400.47-kg bullion and ornaments confiscated by the CBI when it carried out searches at the office of Surana Corporation Ltd in Chennai in 2012 in a case pertaining to alleged favours extended by officials of Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation of India (MMTC) to the firm in import of gold and silver.During the hearing on the matter in the High Court, the agency lawyer submitted that "an internal enquiry is being conducted by the CBI in this regard"."When this Court expressed its opinion, as to why no FIR was registered for theft, the learned Special Public Prosecutor submitted that an internal enquiry is being conducted by the CBI in this regard. He requested this Court to give a direction to the CBI to register an FIR for theft and conduct investigation. He even suggested that this Court could direct the CBI of the neighbouring State or the National Investigating Agency to conduct the investigation," said the High Court Bench."Had any property been lost either from the malkhana (property room) of the Court or from the malkhana of the CBI, what should have been done?” The answer to this question is obvious.“A regular FIR for theft should have been registered in the jurisdictional police station and the police investigation under Chapter XII of CrPC should have been conducted", the High Court noted.Normally, in such a case of missing property, the CBI immediately files an FIR with the local police but even after the case came to the notice of CBI Director RK Shukla in March this year, no FIR has been registered so far.Senior IPS officer Shukla, with no prior experience in the CBI, was appointed as its chief in February 2018. His two-year fixed tenure is coming to an end next February.There was no response to an SMS seeking the response of the CBI Director on the matter.

12-12-2020||Sonepat/New Delhi||Ready for talks with govt, but will first discuss repealing agri laws: Farmer leaders||Sticking to their demands, farmer leaders Saturday said they are ready to hold talks with the government, but will first discuss repealing the three new farm laws, and announced further intensification of their ongoing protest against the legislations.Addressing a press conference at Singhu Border here, farmer leader Kanwalpreet Singh Pannu said thousands of farmers will start their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march from Rajasthan’s Shahjahanpur through the Jaipur-Delhi Highway at 11 am on Sunday.He said farmers from other parts of the country are also on their way to join the protesters here and they will take the agitation to the next level in the coming days.“If the government wants to hold talks, we are ready, but our main demand will remain the scrapping of the three laws. We will move onto our other demands only after that,” the farmer leader said.Farmer union leaders will also sit on a hunger strike between 8 am and 5 pm On December 14 against the new agriculture laws, he said. Leaders from all 32 unions will sit on hunger strike.Farmer leaders said they have given a call to women to intensify the protest. "We will make all arrangements for basic amenities for women by December 15," they said.They also denied any association with farmer leader VM Singh.Farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni announced to begin indefinite hunger strike from December 19 if demands were not met by then.Pannu alleged the government tried to weaken the agitation, but that the protesting farmers did not let it happen. The farmer leader vowed to keep the protest peaceful.The government on Friday asked the protesting farmers to be vigilant against their platform being misused, saying some “antisocial” as well as “Leftist and Maoist” elements were conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the agitation which has been going on for over two weeks now.Photographs of some protesters at the Tikri border seen holding posters demanding release of activists arrested under various charges had gone viral, prompting Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar to say that these “antisocial elements” are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasants’ movement under the guise of farmers.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the ‘mandi’ system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — TNS/PTIAlso read: Security at Delhi borders increased after farmers’ announcement to intensify stirRead the full text of the three bare Acts related to farming and agriculture marketingFarmers block toll plazas in Hisar, KarnalHow many sacrifices will farmers have to make to get agri laws repealed, asks RahulChapatti makers, washing machines ease farmers’ agitation at Tikri borderWhy MSP is a must for farmersRevoke farm laws, we’ll carry Modi’s posters, say unions||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ready-for-talks-with-govt-but-will-first-discuss-repealing-agri-laws-farmer-leaders-183359
12-12-2020||New Delhi||Nadda convoy attack: MHA bypasses Bengal govt, calls 3 IPS officers on central deputation||Days after an attack on the convoy of BJP chief J P Nadda, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued unilateral summons to three IPS officers of West Bengal to serve in central deputation for alleged dereliction of duties, officials said.The three officers—Bholanath Pandey (SP, Diamond Harbour), Praveen Tripathi (DIG, Presidency Range) and Rajeev Mishra (ADG, South Bengal) -- were responsible for the security of the BJP chief during his December 9-10 visit to the politically volatile state.The move is likely to further escalate the ongoing tussle between the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal and the BJP-led central government following the attack on the convoy of Nadda two days ago.Three Indian Police Service officers belonging to the West Bengal cadre have been called to serve in central deputation in view of the lapses that allegedly led to the attack on Nadda’s convoy, an MHA official said.The decision has been taken under the rules governing the all India service officers, the official said.Usually, the state government’s consent is taken before any all India service officer is called to serve in central deputation.But in this case, the MHA has unilaterally taken the decision, bypassing the state government.The three officers are perceived to be close to the present dispensation in West Bengal.On Friday, the MHA had summoned West Bengal’s chief secretary and police chief on December 14 for an explanation on the law and order situation in the state.However, the state government refused to acknowledge the summon.The chief secretary wrote to the Union home secretary, saying that he has been directed to request to “dispense with the presence of the state officials” in the meeting convened on December 14.The two top civil and police officers were called by the MHA after Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar sent a report on the attack on Nadda’s convoy on Thursday with stones and bricks at Diamond Harbour, the Lok Sabha constituency of the chief minister’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee.Dhankhar had also alleged at a press conference in Kolkata that violators of law in Bengal have the protection of police and administration and any resistance by the opposition is quelled.The West Bengal government also has not sent a report on the “serious security lapses” during Nadda’s visit to the state, as sought by the MHA.The chief minister had mockingly distorted Nadda’s name at a rally in Kolkata on Thursday and termed the attack on his convoy a “staged act”.Cars of several party leaders, including that of BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh which were part of the convoy, were damaged in the attack.Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said that “Bengal has descended into an era of tyranny, anarchy and darkness under the Trinamool rule... The manner in which political violence has been institutionalised and brought to the extreme in West Bengal under TMC rule is sad and worrying”.

12-12-2020||New Delhi||Economic indicators show encouraging signs: PM Modi||Economic indicators have shown encouraging signs of recovery of the Indian economy post-pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday as he vowed to keep government controls to a bare minimum and encourage private capital. In this time of pandemic, he said, the government has accorded highest priority to saving lives of Indians and the way India has handled the crisis through concerted effort has surprised the world.Compared to February when the pandemic started, things have changed in December, he said, adding, there is a road map to deal with this now.“Even the economic indicators are encouraging,” he added.Various measures taken by the government in the last six years has instilled confidence among global investors, he said.As a result, he said, “India has seen record Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment inflows during the pandemic.”          Addressing the FICCI Annual Convention, he said, a decisive government always strives to remove obstacles for others and always tries to contribute towards the society and the nation. Recalling the time when government was in all the sectors, he said, a visionary and decisive government, on the other hand, encourages all the stakeholders to realise their potential. Modi pointed out that in the last six years, the government has encouraged stakeholders in all sectors and this is reflected in the all-round reforms in sectors ranging from manufacturing to MSME; agriculture to infrastructure; from tech industry to taxation and from real estate to regulatory easing.Talking about various reforms undertaken by the government in the last six years, he said changes have been brought in manufacturing, MSMEs, agriculture, infrastructure and regulatory easing.As a result of taxation reform, he said, India has got competitive advantage in corporate tax rate and initiated faceless assessment and faceless appeal leaving behind the scar of tax terrorism and Inspector Raj.Pointing out that the old polices protected inefficiencies while ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ is guided to promote efficiency in all the sectors, he said the government has introduced Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to promote sunrise sectors and technology based industries.This scheme is for those industries which are on path to make India a global champion and those who would perform would be entitled to incentive, he added. The government last month approved the scheme for 10 sectors including telecom, automobiles and pharmaceuticals, taking the total outlay for such incentives to nearly Rs 2 lakh crore over a five-year period.Earlier, the government had announced PLIs for the telecom, APIs and medical devices.

12-12-2020||New Delhi||What should be poll expenditure limit for candidates in LS, assembly polls: EC panel asks political parties||The Election Commission has sought views of recognised national and state parties on what should be the limit of expenditure for candidates contesting Lok Sabha and assembly polls.In a letter sent out on December 7, the commission asked parties to send their “views and suggestions” on as to what should be the ceiling limit of election expenditure for candidates for Lok Sabha and assembly elections in the future.The parties have been asked to send their views to the nodal officer of the committee that was set up in October to revise the expenditure limit.While there is a limit on candidates to spend on their election campaign, there is no such cap on political parties.The committee was tasked to examine the issue of revising the expenditure limit for candidates for Lok Sabha and assembly polls in view of the increase in number of electors and rise in the Cost Inflation Index.  Expenditure limit for candidates was last revised in 2014. For Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the limit was enhanced in 2018.  “In last six years, the limit was not increased despite an increase in electorate from 834 million to 910 million in 2019 to 921 million now. Further, Cost Inflation Index during this period has increased from 220 to 280 in 2019 to 301 now,” the commission had said in October while announcing constitution of the panel.The committee will assess the change in number of electors across states and union territories, and its bearing on expenditure.It has also been mandated to assess the change in Cost Inflation Index and its bearing on the pattern of expenditure incurred by candidates in recent elections.The committee is likely to submit its report early next year to the poll panel.Considering the difficulties candidates could face in campaigning amid COVID-19, based on the recommendations of the EC, the government had in October enhanced the existing expenditure limit by 10 per cent.The 10 per cent hike was applicable in the Bihar assembly polls and various bypolls.The maximum limit for candidates differs from state to state. While it is more in larger states it is different for smaller states.After the Law Ministry notification of October, in bigger states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar and Haryana, the maximum expenditure a candidate can incur for campaigning in Lok Sabha polls is now Rs 77 lakh. So far it was Rs 70 lakh.For assembly polls, it has been hiked from Rs 28 lakh to Rs 30.8 lakh.For Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Telangana and Delhi, the expenditure limit for candidates for Lok Sabha polls is now Rs 77 lakh and for assembly elections, it is Rs 30.8 lakh.In Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura, the new limit is Rs 77 lakh for Lok Sabha elections and Rs 22 lakh for assembly polls.For Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Sikkim, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep, Puducherry and Ladakh, it is Rs 59.4 lakh for Lok Sabha elections and Rs 22 lakh for assembly polls. ---  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-should-be-poll-expenditure-limit-for-candidates-in-ls-assembly-polls-ec-panel-asks-political-parties-183349
12-12-2020||New Delhi||Congress accuses Modi govt of branding every opponent ‘Maoist’, asks it to accept farmers’ demands||The Congress on Saturday accused the Modi government of branding every person opposing it a “Maoist” and an “anti-national”, and urged the Centre to accede to the demands of the protesting farmers.The Opposition party’s assertion came a day after Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said some “anti-social elements” are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasants’ movement under the guise of farmers, and appealed to the protesting farming community to be vigilant against their platform being misused.Also, Food, Railway and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal was more direct in his charge, alleging that certain Leftist and Maoist elements seem to have taken “control” of the agitation and rather than discussing farmer issues, they seem to be having some other agenda.Tagging a media report on Goyal’s remarks, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted: “Mr Modi, autocracy has no place in democracy. Yours and your ministers’ policy is to declare every opponent a Maoist and an anti-national.”“Apologise to the farmers who are on a sit-in braving the fierce cold and rains, and accede to their rightful demands immediately,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.In another tweet, Surjewala attacked Modi for his remarks on Saturday at an event that the agri reforms will be beneficial for the farmers, saying farmers want pro-people governance not flowery speeches, and the people in the country want cheap ration.“The whole country is fed up of your enticing ‘lollypops’,” he said in a tweet in Hindi, attacking the Prime Minister.Farmers are protesting the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

"I also believe that what has happened is not actually in the interest of China. Because what it has done is -- it has significantly impacted public sentiment (in India). Professionally, I have seen the evolution of how the Indian public feels about China over the last many decades and I am old enough to remember much more difficult days, especially in my childhood and in my teens," he said.Jaishankar said a lot of work had gone into developing the relationship on both sides."I do not believe that the events of this year have helped at all. In fact I think the real danger is that the goodwill which was so carefully developed will dissipate." "But I also would say that, yes, we are being tested. I have every confidence that we will rise to the occasion; we will meet that national security challenge. But beyond that, at this time, I would really frankly keep my own counsel," Jaishankar said.The armies of India and China are locked in a tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May. Both sides have held multiple rounds of military and diplomatic talks. However, no breakthrough has been achieved yet. ---- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-being-tested-will-meet-national-security-challenge-external-affairs-minister-jaishankar-on-border-standoff-with-china-183340

You are trying to coerce the officers of West Bengal with political vindictiveness. It appears you are interfering with the federal structure," Banerjee added.He also claimed that a person, who is a convict in a case and named in 59 other criminal cases, was in the convoy of Nadda on December 10 and "made provocative gestures" to the TMC supporters standing on the roadside.He said that in respect of law and order, the state government is accountable to the legislative assembly "but not to you or to your home minister"."Laws have been thrown out in river by your action at the instance of Shri Amit Shah, BJP leader and Union Home Minister," the lawmaker said, adding that indirect attempts were being made to impose emergency in West Bengal.Banerjee said that with Parliament not in session, he was voicing strong opposition to the move by the Centre through the letter on behalf of his party.The MHA had on Friday summoned Chief Secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay and DGP Virendra asking them to present themselves on December 14 for an explanation on the law and order situation in the state, following Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar's report on the attack on Nadda's convoy by alleged supporters of the ruling TMC in South 24 Parganas district on December 10.The chief secretary wrote to the Union home secretary, saying he had been directed to request to "dispense with the presence of the state officials" in the meeting convened on December 14.

12-12-2020||Chennai||Madras HC quashes Income Tax proceedings against Karti Chidambaram, wife||The Madras High Court has quashed the Income Tax proceedings initiated against Karti Chidambaram, son of former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram, and his wife over alleged non-disclosure of cash transactions of about Rs 7 crore following the sale of a property near here.The Court, while ruling that the action is “not maintainable and premature”, clarified that proceedings might be initiated again if the authority concerned deemed the same was required after proper assessment.The prosecution case was that Karti, the Congress Member of Parliament, representing Sivaganga, and his wife Srinidhi received Rs 6.38 crore and Rs 1.35 crore in cash respectively, through the sale of a land owned by them near Muttukadu.However, they had neither disclosed the same in their assessment nor paid taxes for the income.Hence, the IT department initiated criminal prosecution for alleged non-disclosure of income by them to the tune of Rs 7.73 crore for 2015-16 fiscal.Challenging the same, the duo contended that the prosecution is liable to be quashed for procedural lapse.They argued that the prosecution had been initiated for filing of false return, which amounts to offence of giving false evidence before a court under the Indian Penal Code.As per the Income Tax Act, the proceedings of the assessing officer are deemed to be that of a proceeding of a civil court and therefore, only the assessing officer should have initiated the prosecution.But in this case, a deputy director of investigation of the department has initiated the prosecution, they claimed.Granting liberty to the department to initiate penal action as per law, if it chooses to, Justice N Sathish Kumar said the prosecution launched by the Deputy Director was not maintainable.The present complaint lodged by the prosecution is a premature one.If the assessing officer comes to the conclusion in proceedings under Section 153 of the Income Tax Act, it is open to the Department to initiate penal action as per law.Justice Sathish Kumar, who pronounced the order on Friday, observed that unless a finding is recorded by the assessing officer as to a wilful attempt to evade tax or filing false verification, the complaint filed by the Deputy Director is not maintainable.

I wish to clarify that his remarks have been made in an individual capacity and my ideologies are not the same in any manner,” Yuvraj said.“I also urge everyone to continue taking precautions to fight against Covid-19. The pandemic is not over yet and we need to continue to be careful to defeat the virus completely,” he said and ended the post with ‘Jai Jawan! Jai Kisan! Jai Hind!’                  Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana are camping at various Delhi border points, protesting against the new farm laws, which they claim will dismantle the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporate houses.In a show of solidarity with the farmers, some sportspersons from Punjab and Haryana, including Khel Ratna awardee Vijender Singh, have threatened to return the national sports awards they had won.The agitating farmers’ concern is that these laws, aimed at reforming the sector, will eliminate the MSP and mandis that ensure their earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their produce.

12-12-2020||New Delhi||Can't coerce family planning, Centre tells Supreme Court||The Centre has told the Supreme Court that India is unequivocally against forcing family planning on its people and any coercion to have a certain number of children is counter-productive and leads to demographic distortions.In an affidavit filed in the top court, the health ministry told the apex court that the family welfare programme in the country is voluntary in nature, which enables couples to decide the size of their family and adopt family planning methods best suited to them, according to their choice and without any compulsion.The submission was made in response to a PIL filed by BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay challenging a Delhi High Court order that dismissed a plea seeking certain steps, including two-child norm, to control the country's growing population.The ministry said that 'public health' is a state subject and the state governments must lead the process of health sector reforms in a suitable and sustainable manner to protect the common people from health hazards."Improvement in the health sector can be effectively led by the state government with effective monitoring and specific intervention to control and regulate the implementation process of the guidelines and schemes in a proper perspective," it said."The answering respondent no. (ministry) plays a supportive and facilitative role in achieving the health care reforms and outcomes. It is reiterated that the answering respondent no. 1 merely acts as a facilitator for providing accessible and affordable health care through state-led reforms in the health sector," it said. The ministry said that as far as implementation of the guidelines and schemes in the states is concerned, it does not have any direct role and it is the prerogative of the respective state governments to implement the schemes as per the prescribed guidelines.The ministry only allocates funds to state governments for implementation of the approved schemes, it added. The Ministry of Health And Family Welfare told the top court that India had adopted a comprehensive and holistic National Population Policy (NPP), 2000, with clearly articulated objectives, strategic themes and operational strategies.The National Health Policy (NHP), 2017 provides for a policy guidance to inform, clarify, strengthen and prioritise the role of the government in shaping health systems in all its dimensions, it said.

However, they were told that she had gone back to Delhi, police said.Jatav, after going back to Delhi, lodged a complaint at the Mayur Vihar Police Station against Chandni's brothers, accusing them of abducting her, they said."The Delhi Police during investigation reached Faranji and inquired about the whereabouts of Chandni.

I see uncertainty, competition and confrontation on the horizon. You may face situations where you will be repeatedly called upon to safeguard the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty against external and internal threats,” he said.The Lt General said “amid weapon proliferation, non-state actors pedalling conflict and expansionist global ideology, we have to strive hard to keep the peace and uphold the rule of law”.“I am confident that you will rise to the challenge,” he said.The vice chief of army staff asked cadets to become knowledge warriors, fully equipped with digital tools, but remember that the man behind the gun retains his prime importance.Lt Gen Saini said the high standards of training received at the IMA has equipped them to be effective leaders of men but underlined the importance of character in the profession.“Once a poor character is exposed to the troops there is no second chance to correct,” he said and asked them not to give in to vices like anger, arrogance and jealousy.The Lt General said the passing out cadets had become members of the world’s finest army and they had to uphold its reputation by dedicating themselves to protecting the country’s honour with a deep sense of commitment.“The expectation of an entire nation is on you,” he said.In total, 325 cadets became part of the Indian Army on Saturday after a colourful passing out parade carried out on the IMA’s drill square with the historic Chetwode Building in the backdrop.Seventy cadets from friendly neighbouring countries also passed out from the IMA on Saturday to become part of the armies of their respective countries.

12-12-2020||Chennai||Madras HC orders probe into missing 103 kg gold seized by CBI||The Madras High Court has ordered a probe by the Crime Branch-Crime Investigation Department (CBCID) into the missing 103.864 kg gold out of 400.47 kg seized by the Central Bureau of Investigation from Surana Corporation Ltd and kept under lock and key.The 103.864 kg gold was found missing when it was weighed to be handed over to the liquidator of Surana Corporation.The high court order came on Friday. The CBI in a curious submission told the court that the gold when it was seized several years back was weighed together and when it was to be handed over to the liquidator each item was weighed individually and hence there was a difference.According to CBI the seized gold were kept in the vaults of Surana Corporation and the keys were handed over to a special court for CBI cases.Rejecting an objection raised by the CBI against the CBCID probe as it would bring down the prestige of the organisation, the High Court said all policemen are to be trusted and ordered the probe.The court also ordered the liquidator C. Ramasubramaniam to lodge a complaint with the CBCID.The case dates back to 2012, when the CBI had booked a case against the officials of Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation (MMTC) for showing undue favours for Surana Corporation, a gold importer.The probe agency had raided Surana Corporation and seized 400.47 kg gold.Later the CBI said the seized gold was not needed for prosecuting the MMTC officials for corruption but filed another case in 2013 against Surana Corporation for violation of Foreign Trade Policy.The seized gold was transferred from 2012 case to 2013 case. Later the case was closed as there was no offence committed.However the CBI had petitioned the Special Court to transfer the gold to the office of Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on the ground that ownership of the metal is subject to corruption  inquiry.The company sought the possession of the gold as it had taken bank loans and State Bank of India (SBI) sought the possession of the yellow metal.The banks had initiated insolvency proceedings against Surana Corporation.The Special Court in 2017 ordered handing over of the gold to SBI and when the inventory was taken it was found that the gold weighed 296.06 only which is 103.864 kg less than the original 400.47 kg seized in 2012.Liquidator Ramasubramaniam had approached the High Court asking for a direction to CBI to hand over the missing gold.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madras-hc-orders-probe-into-missing-103-kg-gold-seized-by-cbi-183309
12-12-2020||---||New farm laws to dismantle walls between different sectors: PM Modi||New Delhi, December 12Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually ruled out a rethink on the three farm laws by stating that these were part of an inter-linked chain of reforms aimed at removing the walls that inhibited the growth of different sectors of the economy.“We saw walls dividing the agriculture sector with its associated segments such as agriculture infrastructure, food processing, storage and cold chains. After these walls are dismantled, the reforms will open up new markets for farmers, give them new options and enable them to benefit from the use of technology. These will lead to more investments and the prime beneficiary will be that farmer who lives off small patches of land,” said the Prime Minister while delivering the inaugural address at FICCI’s 93rd annual general meeting and convention on Friday via video conferencing.“Our economy does not need walls between different sectors but more and more bridges so that they can support each other,” he said while pointing out that private sector investment in the farm sector was dismal and it must invest especially in cold storages and fertilisers.Indicating that the government was firm in its reform plans in sectors ranging from manufacturing to MSMEs and from agriculture to infrastructure and taxation, the PM said “the confident do not hesitate. It is the weak who are insecure and do not give opportunities to those around them”.Also read: Security at Delhi borders increased after farmers’ announcement to intensify stirRead the full text of the three bare Acts related to farming and agriculture marketingFarmers block toll plazas in Hisar, KarnalHow many sacrifices will farmers have to make to get agri laws repealed, asks RahulChapatti makers, washing machines ease farmers’ agitation at Tikri borderWhy MSP is a must for farmersRevoke farm laws, we’ll carry Modi’s posters, say unions“This is the case with most governments.

Governments that are decisive remove obstacles for others,” he said.The government’s policies are conducive to develop the village-based economy and the government is committed to protecting the interests and welfare of farmers through its policies and actions, he declared.Informing the industrialists about other allied opportunities opening up in villages, and tier II and tier III cities, the PM said, “You should not lose out on the opportunity to invest in the villages and small cities. Your investments will open new doors for our brothers and sisters in the rural areas and the agriculture sector.”The Prime Minister referred to the latest indicators about the economy to assert that the situation had changed for the better because the government had prioritised the saving of lives over trade and commerce. And a government that can save its citizens from a pandemic, tends to rebound far more quickly, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-farm-laws-to-dismantle-walls-between-different-sectors-pm-modi-183308

The West Bengal Police had provided a bulletproof car and a pilot to JP Nadda, which was in addition to the escort (vehicle by state, personnel by CRPF) and PSOs (CRPF) he is entitled as a Z-category protectee,” he wrote.The DIG (Police) of the range was stationed in the area to supervise the arrangements. “While the central protectees had their own protection arrangements, these arrangements were made over and above the same from the end of the state,” Bandyopadhyay wrote. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-govt-defies-mha-summons-over-nadda-attack-183101

Terming dissuasive deterrence as the best guarantor of peace and stability, the CDS indicated that India was looking beyond the Quad grouping for partnerships in the maritime domain. As External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said on Tuesday, Rawat also pitched for more trilateral and multilaterals with maritime powers sharing the same values as India.Australian High Commissioner Barry O’Farrell AO pointed out that India and Australia faced significant hurdles; their common goals were more important than those of others. “The US and China are the most important in the India Pacific. They can set the tone for cooperation or competition. But the Indo-Pacific does not belong to either,’’ he observed, leaving enough space for India and Australia to play leadership roles.Appreciating PM Modi and Jaishankar for admirable regional leadership, he said it had served as the template for India’s constructive leadership and its attempts to shape the neighbourhood for the better.Militarism not the way forward||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-maritime-pacts-to-protect-strategic-autonomy-says-rawat-183103

It avoided discussing the merits and demerits of these laws but focused on the violation of Constitutional provisions and the breakdown of democratic processes in this saga.Referring to the farmers’ agitation to repeal three new farm-sector laws, the letter stated: “There were no consultations with farmers’ representatives before the legal process. Ordinances were issued during a pandemic.”Time was not given to debate the Bills and they were railroaded through Parliament. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-farm-bills-passed-sans-discussion-ex-civil-servants-183105

While Dr Singh was preoccupied with saving the coalition, which took a toll on governance, Modi seemed to have employed a rather autocratic style of governance during his ­first term, as seen by the bitter relationship among the government, the legislature and the judiciary. Only time will tell if there is a better understanding on such matters in the second term of this government.” On 2014 electoral rout, Mukherjee makes a candid admission, “Some members of the party have theorised that had I become the PM in 2004, the party might have averted the drubbing.

Must listen to this,” he said.Traffic blockades, sit-ins at more placesTo intensify the stir, farm unions said they would block the Delhi-Jaipur highway among others and hold dharnas at district headquarters & state capitals.With farmers planning to intensify their agitation, the BJP today decided to hold nationwide awareness drive, including chaupals, about the “benefits” of the laws. Sharad Pawar, NCP Chief‘Don’t test tolerance of farmers, stir may spread’The farmer is the ‘annadata’ of the country. His tolerance should not be tested. The protest is restricted to Delhi border, but it can’t be ruled out that it might spread to other areas.Farm unions said there was no “rail roko” in their renewed strategy to intensify protest. BKU (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal said the decision would be taken after consulting all unions.Meanwhile, the government said “Left and Maoist” elements were trying to spoil the atmosphere as a controversy erupted with surfacing of “posters of jailed extremists” at Tikri border. Tomar called it a “dangerous and diversionary tactic to divide the farmers”. “They can demand changes in the Acts…but what do these posters mean? The farmers should remain vigilant,” he said. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said: “This is a sinister design to hijack the movement. There is enough evidence to show that ‘tukde tukde gang’ is threatening to take over the protest.”BKU faction moves SCUP-based BKU (Bhanu) moved the Supreme Court against the farm laws, alleging these will make them “vulnerable to corporate greed”. TNSKaushik Basu, Ex - Chief Economist, World Bank‘New agricultural laws are flawed'The new agri laws are flawed and will be detrimental to farmers.Our farm regulation needs change, but the laws will end up serving corporate interests.Rajewal said the protest at Tikri was under the BKU-Ekta Ugrahan and it had nothing to do with “jathebandis” at Singhu. Tomar today again asked the farmers to return to the table, saying he was yet to hear from farmers regarding offer to amend the laws.

12-12-2020||Sanjeev Singh Bariana||Revoke farm laws, we’ll carry Modi’s posters, say unions||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 11“We are willing to return home flying the national flag as well as putting up posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on our tractors if the government repeals the contentious farm laws,” said BKU (Kadian) president Harmeet Singh Kadian while talking to The Tribune today.Not repealing the laws appears to be an ego issue with the PM and Home Minister Amit Shah, Kadian said while responding to a question on the deadlock.Not just Kadian, a number of farm leaders are firm about their demand for the withdrawal of the new laws. They fear that corporates will ultimately take control of the pricing mechanism and subsequently their land. The farmers are also not ready to accept the MSP “lollipop” because at “present too the government is paying MSP only on two or three of the 23 listed crops”.President of the BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) Jagjit Singh Dalewal said: “The entry of corporates in the fields of education, health and transport has affected the government set-ups. The same will happen to agriculture. History shows that budget planning by the corporates allows them to bear losses for a few years. Initially, they will lure farmers with more money, leading to closure of government mandis. Finally, corporates will be controlling the price.”Voicing similar apprehensions, BKU (Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said: “Agreeing to government amendments would have been akin to allowing the neck of the corporate camel inside the tent of farmers. If not stonewalled now, this will render farmers homeless.”The trust deficit between the unions and the Centre doesn’t appear to have lessened after the recent proposal sent out by the latter. “Whether we were being administered 100% pure poison of the farm laws or whether it is being diluted by 50%, it will still be poison. Allowing our cases in civil courts means nothing to us because a common farmer does not have enough resources to fight the corporates,” said Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher.“Ideally speaking, the government needs to withdraw the contentious farm laws for at least two years. Before bringing any change, the farmers need to be engaged in discussions,” he added.Vice-president of the Kirti Kisan Union Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala said the farmers were mainly protesting because agriculture was a state subject. “Why is the Centre thrusting the laws upon farmers? At this juncture we feel that even if the government makes amendments to the farm laws, it could backtrack and re-amend them after we call off our agitation.”“We are also finding it strange that the government that has not heard us for the past several months, agreed to make amendments within 10 days of our reaching the Delhi border,” Kadian said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/revoke-farm-laws-well-carry-modis-posters-say-unions-183111

12-12-2020||Aditi Tandon||Hesitancy, production delays can mar COVID vaccine success: New research||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 12As nations gear for COVID-19 vaccinations, landmark new research has shown that factors related to implementation will contribute more to the success of inoculation plans than the vaccine’s efficacy as determined in clinical trials.The findings based on mathematical simulation of vaccination say that the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine will decline substantially in the event of manufacturing or deployment delays, significant vaccine hesitancy, or greater epidemic severity.The research is a wake-up call for India and other Asian and African countries that have historically struggled with vaccine hesitancy, as seen in the fight against polio and HPV.“There is an urgent need for health officials to invest greater financial resources and attention to vaccine production and distribution programmes, to redouble efforts to promote public confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, and to encourage continued adherence to other mitigation approaches, even after a vaccine becomes available,” says a new research published in Health Affairs, a leading health policy journal.Based on the new findings, global vaccination experts including India’s Gagandeep Kang, have urged countries to start engaging communities for building public confidence in COVID vaccines.In an authored article, “The COVID-19 vaccines rush: Participatory community engagement matters more than ever”, published in The Lancet, Kang and others have said: “Policymakers must accelerate dialogue and support the development of community networks, leveraging and supporting existing local channels that influence decision making, such as community and faith leaders, teachers, sports and youth clubs, and online communities and networks.”Participatory community engagement is cost-effective, increases the uptake of vaccines, and substantially reduces health-care resources needed to achieve high vaccination coverage.The global experts say a top-down, one-size-fits-all approach must be avoided as it has derailed countless global health solutions.“In this new phase of the COVID-19 response, successful vaccine roll-out will only be achieved by ensuring effective community engagement, building local vaccine acceptability and confidence, and overcoming cultural, socioeconomic, and political barriers that lead to mistrust and hinder uptake of vaccines,” says Gagandeep Kang and co-authors.They note that from the outset it is important for nations to distinguish between people wholly opposed to vaccination and individuals with limited or inaccurate health information and work to address the challenges.HOW HESITANCY IMPACTS HEALTH PLANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hesitancy-production-delays-can-mar-covid-vaccine-success-new-research-183114
