26-12-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Farm laws: Kerala Assembly session likely to be held on Dec 31||Decks appear to have been cleared for the one-day session of the Kerala assembly on December 31 to discuss and pass a resolution against the three contentious farm laws of the Centre against which farmers are protesting in Delhi.Raj Bhavan sources said the clarification sought by Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has been given by the government and Khan could give his assent for the session by Monday.The governor had earlier turned down the plea of the LDF government to convene a special session on December 23 to discuss the new laws, saying Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had not addressed the question raised by him on the nature of emergency warranting the very brief session.In a letter to Vijayan, he had also stated that the government wanted the special session to “discuss a problem for which you have no jurisdiction to offer any solution”.Vijayan had shot off a letter to Khan on Tuesday describing as regrettable his decision while asserting that the governor was bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers and that moving resolutions and conducting discussions in the assembly “cannot be regulated by gubernatorial powers”.Kerala Law Minister A K Balan and Agricultural Minister V S Sunil Kumar had met the governor on Friday after the state government decided afresh to convene a one-day session to discuss and pass a resolution against the farm laws.They had later said the interaction was “positive”.Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan met the governor at Raj Bhavan on Saturday to invite him for the customary policy address for the budget session beginning on January 8.On the sidelines of the meeting, the governor and the speaker also discussed the December 31 session recommendation of the state cabinet to which Khan assured that an “appropriate decision” would be taken, assembly sources said.

26-12-2020||New Delhi||COVID mutant: Govt says focus on enhanced genomic surveillance||In the wake of a mutated variant of coronavirus detected in the UK, a genomic surveillance consortium has been formed for laboratory and epidemiological surveillance of circulating strains of the SARS-CoV-2 in India, the Centre said on Saturday.The genomic surveillance consortium, INSACOG, has been formed under the leadership of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), New Delhi. Further, more than 50 samples of UK returnees are currently under sequencing at the designated laboratories.Five per cent of the positive cases of COVID-19 from all states and UTs will be tested for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) as part of the strategy that has been put in place to detect and contain the mutant variant, the Union Health Ministry said after a meeting of the  National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 on the issue."It is proposed to continue enhanced genomic surveillance for early detection and containment of the UK variant SARS-CoV-2 strains. However, it is important to understand that like all other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 will continue to mutate," the ministry said.The mutated virus can also be contained by measures like social distancing, hand hygiene, wearing masks and also by an effective vaccine, as and when available, said the ministry.The meeting of the NTF was convened on Saturday by ICMR under co-chairpersonship of Dr Vinod Paul, Member NITI Aayog and Dr Balram Bhargava, Secretary, Director General ICMR.The main objective of the meeting was to discuss evidence-based modifications in testing, treatment and surveillance strategies for SARS-CoV-2 in view of the recent reports of the emergence of a new variant strain of the virus from the UK.It was emphasised that since the UK variant strain was implicated to cause increased transmissibility of the virus, it was critical to identify individuals infected with this strain and adequately contain them to prevent its transmission in India.The NTF concluded that there is no need to change the existing Treatment Protocol in view of mutations emerging in the strain.Further, since the ICMR has always advocated the use of two or more gene assays for testing SARS-CoV-2, it is unlikely to miss infected cases using the current testing strategy, said the ministry.The NTF recommended that in addition to the existing surveillance strategies, it was critical to conduct enhanced genomic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 especially in incoming passengers from the UK.The meeting was also attended by Prof Randeep Guleria, Director, AIIMS; Director General Health Services (DGHS); Drug Controller General of India (DCGI); Director, National Center for Disease Control (NCDC); other representatives from Ministry of Health and ICMR as well as independent subject experts."The variant strain has 14 non-synonymous (amino acid altering) mutations, 6 synonymous (non amino-acid altering), and 3 deletions."Eight mutations are present in the Spike (S) gene which carries the binding site (Receptor Binding Domain) of the ACE2 receptors, which are the point of entry of the virus into the human respiratory cells," the ministry said in its statement.The NTF deliberated in detail on aspects related to the current National Treatment Protocol, testing strategy and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 vis-à-vis the UK variant strain.The NTF was of the view that it will also be critical to conduct genome sequencing in samples where there is a dropout of the S gene in lab diagnosis, proven cases of re-infections etc.Routine genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 from representative samples all across the samples needs to be a continuous and well-planned activity, according to the statement.The designated laboratories where samples of UK returnees are currently under sequencing include NCDC, Delhi; CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi; CSIR - Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad; and DBT - Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneshwar.It is also being done at DBT-National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani; DBT-InStem-National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru; National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru and National Institute of Virology, Pune.The NCDC informed that the Centre had taken cognizance of the reports of mutant variant and the response of other countries to these reports.The situation is being monitored proactively.A strategy has been put under place  under which all passengers who had arrived from the UK between December 21 and 23  have been tested at the airports and only after the PCR test result are available, the negative passengers are permitted to exit the airports.         All positively tested passengers are put under institutional isolation and their samples sent for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).Only after the confirmation of the non-mutant variant upon WGS result, the positive cases are permitted to leave institutional isolation as per the existing management protocol.All the contacts of the positive cases are also put under facility quarantine and are tested as per the ICMR guidelines.Besides, the list of all UK arrivals during the last 28 days has been shared by the Bureau of Immigration with the states concerned.All passengers who had arrived from the UK between November 25 - December 20 are being tracked by the IDSP State Surveillance Units (SSUs) and District Surveillance Units (DSUs).Samples of all positive cases are being sent for the WGS and enhanced contact tracing of these positive cases is being undertaken and these contacts are also put under facility quarantine.

26-12-2020||New Delhi||Saradha scam: CBI moves fresh plea in SC to quiz WB IPS officer||The CBI has moved the Supreme Court seeking to question senior IPS officer and former Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar in connection with the multi-crore-rupee Saradha chit fund scam case.The central probe agency, which has been entrusted with the task of probing the Ponzi scheme cases in West Bengal by the apex court, has moved the fresh plea to quiz the senior police officer again, alleging that he has not been cooperating with it in the ongoing investigation, a source said.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said Kumar’s further questioning is necessary in order to unearth the larger nexus in the scam.The plea is likely to be taken up for hearing on the reopening of the apex court after the winter break.The Saradha group of companies allegedly duped lakhs of people to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore, promising higher rates of return on their investments.The scam was unearthed in 2013 during Kumar’s tenure as the Bidhannagar police commissioner.Kumar was part of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up by the West Bengal government for probing the scam, before the Supreme Court handed over the case to the CBI in 2014, along with other chit fund cases.In November last year, the apex court had sought the response of the IPS officer on the CBI’s appeal challenging the anticipatory bail granted to him in the chit fund scam by the Calcutta High Court.The probe agency had filed an appeal in the apex court against the October 1, 2019 order of the Calcutta High Court, which had granted Kumar the relief saying it was not an appropriate case for custodial interrogation.The high court had directed Kumar to cooperate with the investigating officers and make himself available before them for questioning on a 48-hour notice by the CBI.On September 21, 2019, a pre-arrest bail plea of the IPS officer was rejected by the Alipore District and Sessions Court in Kolkata.The Centre and the West Bengal government were also locked in an unprecedented standoff after a CBI team had reached Kumar’s official residence for questioning him, but had to retreat as the local police detained its officers.

26-12-2020||Patna||RJD challenges Nitish to snap ties with BJP following Arunachal developments||The Rashtriya Janata Dal on Saturday hinted at the possibility of a fresh alignment in Bihar if Chief Minister Nitish Kumar chose to snap ties with the BJP following the “humiliation” in Arunachal Pradesh.RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwary, however, made it clear that the ball lies in the court of the JD(U) boss who needed to realise that the development in the north-eastern state, where his party MLAs defected en masse to the BJP, was aimed at “settling old scores”.Tiwary recalled the incident of about a decade ago when Kumar had cancelled a dinner organised for visiting BJP leaders who were in Patna to take part in the party’s national executive.“Nitish Kumar had then made it amply clear that while he was okay with the BJP, he was very much averse to Narendra Modi, his then Gujarat counterpart. Now, Modi is not a man who is going to forgive and forget the slight,” Tiwary said.The veteran RJD leader, who has also been with the JD(U) for some time, insisted that the development in Arunachal Pradesh was “part of the chain of events that began with Chirag Paswan’s rebellion”.Paswan, the LJP president, had pulled out of the NDA ahead of the Bihar assembly polls vowing to dislodge Kumar from power. The LJP came a cropper in the elections though it succeeded in cutting into JD(U)’s votes, with BJP rebels fighting on its tickets in many seats.“The BJPs strategy was, firstly, to cut Nitish Kumar to size which it did successfully in the assembly polls. Now it has begun to humiliate him. What else could explain poaching of six JD(U) MLAs in Arunachal Pradesh where the BJP was already enjoying a very comfortable majority,” Tiwary asked.Tiwary, who had on the previous day sought to welcome any bold step by Kumar, said when asked to elaborate, “if he leaves the NDA, it cannot be that we will join hands with the BJP to run Nitish Kumar down. We have been consistent in opposing the BJP and he joined us for some time but switched sides because of reasons best known to him”.Kumar had joined hands with his arch rival Lalu Prasad, the RJD supremo, ahead of the assembly polls in 2015.The Grand Alliance that came into being with the two parties, and the Congress, coming together, won the elections handsomely and Kumar returned as Chief Minister with Tejashwi Yadav as his deputy.However, Tiwary also hinted that power equations could undergo a change this time, with the RJD still going strong but the JD(U) a pale shadow of its past self.“Nitish has to take a tough decision as to what matters more to him  his own dignity or the trappings of power”, said Tiwary who has known Kumar closely for five decades.RJD MLA and chief state spokesman Bhai Virendra, a Tejashwi Yadav loyalist, was even more blunt.“We have a standing offer to Nitish Kumar - give up your chair and help Tejashwi Yadav in forming a new government in the state. That would help him retain a bit of respectability. Else, his party would suffer the same fate here as it has in Arunachal Pradesh,” said Bhai Virendra.

26-12-2020||The schedule for classes 10 and 12 board examinations will be announced on December 31||CBSE board exam dates to be announced on December 31, says Education Minister||“I will announce the date on Dec 31 when the exams will commence for students appearing for CBSE board exams in 2021,” he tweeted.Nishank had earlier this week ruled out conducting board examinations for classes 10 and 12 till February in view of the COVID-19 situation. Usually, practical tests are conducted in January and theory exams begin in February and conclude in March.  On Tuesday, the Education minister had said that a decision on when to conduct the exams will be taken later after assessment of the situation and consultation with stakeholders.With no clarity on the board exam dates yet, several schools have already conducted pre-board exams online to keep the students prepared.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had earlier this month announced that board exams in 2021 will be conducted in written mode and not online.Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. They were partially reopened in some states from October 15.However, a few states have decided to keep them closed in view of a spike in the number of infections. The board exams had to be postponed mid-way in March. They were later cancelled and the results announced on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme. --- PTI📢Major announcements for students & parents!I will announce the date when the exams will commence for students appearing for #CBSE board exams in 2021.Stay tuned. pic.twitter.com/Lvp9Lf0qsT||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-board-exam-dates-to-be-announced-on-december-31-says-education-minister-189757
26-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra ATS to probe supply chain of drug racket in Himachal||A team from the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has gone to Himachal Pradesh to probe the supply chain of a drugs racket, which was unearthed by the Pune Railway Police following the seizure of charas worth Rs 1 crore, an official said on Saturday.The Railway Police last week had arrested two persons from Himachal Pradesh for alleged possession of 34 kg of charas at Pune station.During the investigation, it came to light that the arrested accused were in Pune to distribute the drug during New Year celebrations in Goa, Mumbai and other cities, the ATS official said.It was also found that the narcotic substance was being supplied regularly from Himachal Pradesh to Maharashtra and other states, he said.Considering the gravity of the offence, the Director General of Maharashtra Police transferred the investigation to the ATS, the official said.Accordingly, an ATS team headed by Superintendent of Police rank officer was dispatched to Kulu in Himachal Pradesh, it was stated.The team will investigate the cultivation of narcotics and the supply chain with the help of Himachal Pradesh police, the official added.

26-12-2020||New Delhi||PIL in SC seeks setting up of media tribunal to try hate speech, media trial, fake news cases||Amid allegations of hate speech, media trial, fake news and violation of right to privacy against the media, a PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking setting up of an independent media tribunal to make journalists and media houses accountable for such acts."Over the last few years, media trials, hate speech, propaganda news, paid news, have become the order of the day, thereby impeding the right to a fair trial of victims and right to fair and proportionate reporting,” petitioners Nilesh Navalakha, a film producer, and Nitin Memane submitted.He contended that “reckless reportage by the electronic media without accountability can, by no stretch of imagination, be read into the right to freedom of speech and expression enjoyed by the electronic media”.They argued that a citizen-led independent media tribunal was needed to hear and expeditiously adjudicate complaints against media businesses.He said such a body was needed to bring about a balance between the right to freedom of speech and expression of the media houses and right to reputation and the right to dignity as also in the interests of preserving peace and harmony.Maintaining that the exercise of power by the electronic media without any accountability was detrimental to the due process of law, and contrary to the rule of law, the PIL urged the top court to issue appropriate guidelines for regulation of media in exercise of the plenary and inherent powers under Article 32 and 142 of the Constitution, until a legislation was introduced. Contending that self-regulation by media cannot be the answer to the problem, he sought setting up of an independent high powered committee headed by a retired Chief Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court and comprising distinguished citizens from different fields and representatives of the Central Government to scrutinize the entire legal framework relating to regulation of media industry and recommend guidelines to be laid down by the top court.The petitioners, however, sought to clarify that his PIL wasn’t aimed at curbing the fundamental rights of the media and that he only wanted to ensure that those indulging in spreading misinformation, inflammatory coverage, ake news and breach of privacy were held to account.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-seeks-setting-up-of-media-tribunal-to-try-hate-speech-media-trial-fake-news-cases-189751
26-12-2020||New Delhi||Need to plug loopholes in anti-defection law: Naidu||Underlining the need to make the anti-defection law more stringent, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said if loopholes in it are not plugged, “we will be making a mockery of democracy”.He also cautioned that people will lose faith in the political class unless urgent and collective action is taken towards cleansing the system and promoting clean politics.Delivering the 3rd Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture organised by the India Foundation in Hyderabad, Naidu lamented that the absence of value-based politics, lack of ideology, hunger for power, muscle and money power and the entry of people with a criminal background into politics were leading to violence in the political arena.“Unless these undesirable trends are checked, the situation will further deteriorate and cause irreparable damage to the country’s polity,” he cautioned according to the text of his speech.Drawing attention to the manner in which the anti-defection law has been rendered ineffective, Naidu emphasised the need to make it more stringent and effective.Noting that defection matters cannot remain undecided for long periods, he suggested making it mandatory for the presiding officers to dispose defection matters within three months. “We will be making a mockery of democracy if we fail to plug the loopholes in anti-defection laws,” Naidu, also the chairperson of Rajya Sabha, observed.According to PRS Legislative Research, the anti-defection law seeks to prevent political defections which may be due to reward of office or other similar considerations.The Tenth Schedule was inserted in the Constitution in 1985. It lays down the process by which legislators may be disqualified on grounds of defection by the presiding officer of a legislature based on a petition by any other member of the House.The vice president felt that all political parties should put an end to “politics of convenience” and practice the “politics of conviction” and “politics of consensus” as demonstrated by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.He also called upon the political parties to shun populism and accord priority to long-term development.Expressing dismay over the sway of 4Cs—cash, caste, criminality and community—in Indian politics, he appealed to the people to elect their representatives on the basis of other 4Cs—character, conduct, calibre and capacity.Naidu emphasised that it is the duty of all political parties to ensure that their members, including legislators, maintain ethical conduct at all times and at all places. He also appealed to the legislators to raise the level of debates, follow standards, avoid unruly behaviour and always adhere to 3Ds—discuss, debate and decide—avoid the “4th D”—disrupt.Speaking on the theme of this year’s lecture, “Building democratic consensus - The Vajpayee way”, Naidu said for Vajpayee, consensus was not an expedient political tool rather it was a core element of his convictions. His consensual approach made him widely acceptable across the social and political spectrum, the vice president added.This consensual approach enabled him to successfully lead a large coalition to its full term in an era of unstable coalition governments.Naidu described Vajpayee as the “father of coalition practices” in India. However, Vajpayee’s ability to forge consensus did not necessarily mean compromise all the time, Naidu said.He cited the example of Vajpayee’s second stint as the prime minister in 1999 when he refused to budge under the pressure of a coalition partner and sacrificed his government.Calling Vajpayee as ‘vikas purush’, Naidu said that despite heading a coalition government, he successfully overcame all hurdles and paved the way of socio-economic transformation of the country.

26-12-2020||Kolkata||Amartya Sen says entire land occupied by him in Santiniketan registered on long term lease||Responding to the controversy following media reports that Visva Bharati has named him among those occupying additional illegal plot, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has said that the entire land occupied by him is registered in records and is entirely on long term lease.In a mail to the media on Friday, Sen also referred to a big yawn between the culture espoused in Santiniketan and that of the VC, apparently “empowered” by the government at the Centre.Referring to media reports that Visva Bharati Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty is busy arranging the eviction of unauthorised occupation of leased land in the campus and that he has also been named in the list of occupants, Sen said in the statement that the central university has never complained about any irregularity of landholding either to him or his family.The Nobel laureate asserted that the Visva Bharati land on which his house is situated is entirely on a long-term lease, which is nowhere near its expiry.“Additional land was bought by my father as free hold and registered in land records under mouja Surul,” he said “I could comment on the big gap between Santiniketan culture and that of the V.C., empowered as he is by the central government in Delhi with its growing control over Bengal,” Sen added.“I would prefer to use Indian laws as they exist. For mental strength, I may clutch the beautiful old picture of our home by Abanindranath Tagore, among others,” he said.Abanindranath Tagore is a famed painter of the Bengal School of Art. Sen was born in Santiniketan in 1933 and his maternal grandfather Kshitimohan Sen had joined the Brahmacharyashram at the call of Rabindranath Tagore and was its first Deshikottam, the highest accolade by the university, in 1952.Referring to recent reports on the VC’s claim to the faculty that Sen had called him up against eviction of hawkers before his Pratichi residence, Sen said: “He would be spared the necessity of inventing completely imagined conversations with me, beginning impossibly with me introducing myself as Bharat Ratna something that no one has ever heard me do”.He described Chakrabarty as “an inventive artist as well”.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who is standing by Sen, had earlier expressed anguish at recent developments alluding to the world renowned economist’s familial properties in Shantiniketan.Asking Sen to count her as a sister and friend in his war against “intolerance and totalitarianism,” Banerjee wrote that some “nouveau invaders” in Visva Bharati have started raising surprising and completely baseless allegations about his familial properties in Santiniketan.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh Friday said being a Nobel winner and economist of international repute, Sen should see to it that he is not used by some forces to score their political interests.“We may disagree with him ideologically but we have our respect for him. We urge him not to be used by anti-development political forces in West Bengal,” Ghosh told reporters. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amartya-sen-says-entire-land-occupied-by-him-in-santiniketan-registered-on-long-term-lease-189743

26-12-2020||New Delhi||Avoid drinking, says IMD as north India braces for ‘severe’ cold wave||It is going to get very cold in north India, and drinking alcohol at home or year-end parties won’t be a good idea, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).In its latest impact-based advisory, the IMD said “severe” cold wave is expected over Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and northern Rajasthan from December 28 and there is increased likelihood of various illnesses like flu, running nose or nosebleed which usually set in or get aggravated due to prolonged exposure to cold.“Don’t drink alcohol. It reduces your body temperature,” the advisory read.Also read: Hooligans spoil the fun in snowy Manali“Get indoors. Eat vitamin-C-rich fruits and moisturise your skin regularly to counter the effects of severe cold,” it said.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said the mercury will increase slightly on Sunday and Monday under the influence of a fresh Western Disturbance affecting the upper reaches of the Himalayas, but the relief will be short-lived.The Western Disturbance will lead to “scattered to fairly widespread” snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.After the wind system withdraws, cold and dry northerly/northwesterly winds from the western Himalayas will bring the minimum temperature in north India down by three to five degrees Celsius, the IMD said.“Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely in isolated pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, UP and north Rajasthan from December 28-29. Ground frost and dense fog is likely in isolated pockets in the region,” it said.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal. A “severe” cold wave is when the minimum temperature dips to two degrees Celsius or the departure is more than 6.4 degrees Celsius.On Sunday last, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 3.4 degrees Celsius, the lowest this season so far.

26-12-2020||New Delhi||Government proposes to set up University of Disability Studies and Rehabilitation Sciences||The government has proposed to set up a "first of its kind" university covering the entire gamut of disability studies and rehabilitation sciences in an accessible environment.In a public notice issued on December 24, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, has invited comments from stakeholders on a draft bill to set up the university.         In this regard, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities said, a draft bill namely the University of Disability Studies and Rehabilitation Sciences Bill, 2021 for establishing the proposed university had been prepared.The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities said it intended to set up a University of Disability Studies and Rehabilitation Sciences in Kamrup district in Assam through a separate act of Parliament."The proposed university, the first of its kind, will be a unique multidisciplinary academic institution conducting research, programmes and courses from bachelor's level onwards to cater to various disciplines covering the entire gamut of disability studies and rehabilitation sciences in an accessible environment," said the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities.The proposed university will have eight departments viz disability studies, rehabilitation sciences, audiology and speech language pathology, special education, psychology, nursing, orthotics and prosthetics and assistive technology, and inclusive and universal design."The proposed university's programmes will adopt a credit and grading system. The proposed university will offer affiliation to other institutions in disabilities and rehabilitation sciences in the country," it said.The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities has invited comments from the public on the draft University of Disability Studies and Rehabilitation Sciences Bill, 2021 by January 3, 2021.Prominent disabled rights body National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled, however, called it another "ill-conceived idea", which denied adequate time or space for stakeholders to respond."In this case, a mere nine days have been given to elicit response to a 131-page document," the NPRD said in a statement.     "All the more unacceptable is the fact that this university would be 'self-sustaining', in tune with the thrust of the New Education Policy 2020. With finances being generated from tuition fees, affiliation fees, etc., students from the marginalised sections will stand deprived," it said."Rather than wasting huge amounts of money on self-sustaining segregated centres of learning, it would auger well if the government adheres to the guiding principles of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act of equality and non-discrimination and adopts and promotes an inclusive, multidisciplinary approach," said the NPRD.

26-12-2020||New Delhi||I-T dept detects black income of Rs 100 crore after raids on contractors in Assam||Unaccounted income of Rs 100 crore has been detected after the income tax department raided three "leading" contractors of Northeast India based in Assam early this week, the CBDT said on Saturday.  The search and survey action was initiated on December 22 at fourteen locations in Guwahati, Silapathar and Pathsala in Assam and in Delhi."Cash of Rs 2.95 crore has been seized. Overall, undisclosed income to the tune of approximately Rs 100 crore has been unearthed so far during the search and survey operation," the Board said in a statement without sharing the identities of those raided.It added that "jewellery of Rs 9.79 lakh has been seized and the sources of acquisition of some other jewellery worth Rs 2 crore is under verification." The Central Board of Direct Taxes frames policy for the I-T department.The entities covered are "leading contractors of Northeast and one group is also involved in the hospitality business," it said."The main allegation against the three groups is that they have taken accommodation (dubious) entries in the form of non-genuine unsecured loans and also securities premium from dubious Kolkata-based shell (dummy) companies." "The three groups have suppressed their net profits across the years and routed back into business the unaccounted income through entry operators based out of Guwahati and Kolkata," the CBDT said.It has been established, the statement said, that the shell companies from which loans/premium had been taken exist "only on paper" and have no real business and creditworthiness.  "The entry operators, on being questioned, have admitted that the unsecured loans/share premium from the shell companies to the groups are non-genuine and bogus." "Evidences of the cash trail of routing of funds through securities premium was unearthed during search. It has been established that amounts to the tune of about Rs 65 crore were routed back into regular books involving shell companies which actually represent unaccounted income of the group," it said.The Board said a number of suspect cash transactions have been detected.  "It has been gathered during the search action that one of the groups engages in huge cash transactions in hospitality business of proportions as high as 50 per cent, which is under examination." "Some of the entities of the groups engage in purchases of jewellery in cash. The source of the cash purchases are under examination," it said.Further investigation is on to detect the actual quantum involved in tax evasion even as a locker found during the raids is yet to be "operated", it said.

26-12-2020||Mumbai||Former BJP leader Khadse called by ED in Bhosri land deal case||Former BJP leader Eknath Khadse on Saturday said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned him to its Mumbai office on December 30 for questioning in connection with a land deal in Bhosri near Pune.Khadse, who recently joined the NCP, had stepped down from the then Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra cabinet in 2016 after facing allegations regarding the same land deal.It was alleged that he misused his official powers to facilitate the purchase of government land by his family.Speaking to PTI over phone, Khadse said he received a summons from the ED through email.The land deal by his wife and son-in-law had been probed by the state Anti-Corruption Bureau’s (ACB) Pune and Nashik units as well as the Income Tax department, he said.These agencies did not find anything illegal in the deal which was worth Rs 4 crore, he said.“I cooperated with all agencies and now I will also visit the ED office,” he said.Khadse had been disgruntled for a long time after his resignation, as he claimed that he got a clean chit but the BJP still sidelined him. He quit the party and joined the NCP earlier this year. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-bjp-leader-khadse-called-by-ed-in-bhosri-land-deal-case-189729

26-12-2020||New Delhi||Around 50 Naga insurgents likely to join national mainstream: Military sources||Around 50 insurgents belonging to a breakaway faction of the Naga militant outfit NSCN(K) are likely to join the national mainstream as the group is finding it difficult to survive following enhanced cooperation between the Indian Army and the Myanmarese armed forces along the border, sources in the security establishment said on Saturday.The faction led by Niki Sumi has decided to surrender as a result of combined efforts against it by the Army, state security forces and military intelligence in the last few months, they said, adding it will be a boost for the Naga peace process.The overall coordination and cooperation between the Indian and Myanmarese armies on the management of the Indo-Myanmar border has improved following a recent visit to the neighbouring country by Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane, they said."The diplomatic efforts in the military domain by the Chief of Army Staff during his recent visit to Myanmar have played rich dividends," said an official on the condition of anonymity.In October, Gen Naravane, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, paid a crucial visit to Myanmar during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmar Navy besides agreeing to further deepen overall military and defence ties.Myanmar is one of India's strategic neighbours and shares a 1,640-kilometre-long border with a number of northeastern states including militancy-hit Nagaland and Manipur.The NSCN (Khaplang) and several other Naga militant groups have been demanding the establishment of a 'Greater Nagaland' comprising all the Naga-inhabited areas of neighbouring Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.The sources said Starson Lamkang, a key leader of the breakaway faction, along with 52 cadres are currently in the process of surrendering to the security forces in Phek district of Nagaland.They said eight more cadres of the group are also likely to surrender taking the total to around 60.The group led by Niki Sumi had broken away from the NSCN (K-Yung Aung). The total strength of the Niki faction appears to be 60-65 militants and its cadres decided to surrender as surviving in Myanmar became very difficult for them, the sources said.Sumi is an insurgent leader from the Sema tribe and belongs to Zunebhuto district of Nagaland, the sources said, adding he was a prominent "commander" in NSCN (K) group.He is also a key accused in the attack on an Army convoy in Manipur's Chandel district in June 2015 by the NSCN(K) in which 18 army personnel lost their lives. He carries a reward of Rs 10 lakh.Days after the attack, the Indian Army had carried out an operation in areas near the Indo-Myanmar against the NSCN (K) militants.India has been concerned over some militant groups from the Northeast region taking shelter in Myanmar. The country has been assuring India that it would not allow any insurgent group to use its territory against India.Various Naga militant groups are currently holding talks with the Centre to resolve the decades-old Naga issue. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/around-50-naga-insurgents-likely-to-join-national-mainstream-military-sources-189717
26-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Farmer unions agree to resume talks with govt, propose meeting on December 29||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 26It is too early to call it a ‘breakthrough’ but there seemed to be some movement forward in the ongoing deadlock between agitating farmers and the government on the farm laws.Responding to the December 24 invite by joint secretary Vivek Aggarwal, farmers’ unions on Saturday agreed for a meeting with Central ministers on December 29, at 11 am, in the Vigyan Bhawan. However, the meeting will be on the four-point agenda and as per the “sequence” decided by the Samyukt Kisan Morch “after due consultation with all organisations”. It includes “modalities to be adopted for the repeal of the three Central Farm Acts; Mechanisms to be adopted to make remunerative MSP recommended by the National Farmers’ Commission into a legally guaranteed entitlement for all farmers and all agricultural commodities; Amendments to be made and notified in the “Commission for the Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020” to exclude farmers from the penal provisions of the Ordinance; and Changes to be made in the draft Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 to protect the interests of farmers”.Accusing the government of “misleading the public by suppressing true facts about the deliberations in the previous meetings”, unions said “we have consistently demanded the repeal of the three Central Farm Acts, whereas the government has distorted our position as if we were asking for amendments to these Acts. “If you are sincere about respectfully listening to the farmers, as you say in your letter, the government must not indulge in misinformation about the previous meetings. The campaign launched by the entire state machinery to defame and malign the farmers’ movement must stop forthwith. Read alsoLet’s not allow lies to derail farm reformsIf it fructifies, the December-29 meeting will be the sixth formal attempt by farmer unions and the government to resolve the issue. The earlier meetings, including the one with Home Minister Amit Shah, failed to break the deadlock.However, while farmers’ unions have set conditions, including the repeal of three laws, sources say the government is ready for amendments but there can be no going back on the three Acts, something which Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made it clear in his address yesterday.BJP leaders claim that “Left leaning” leaders in the agitation are “misleading” farmers and other unions, “many of who are ready for an early resolution”. They also say that today’s breakthrough has come after “back-channel talks with those willing to end to the impasse. Left leaning unions’ leaders are misleading farmers and creating hurdles between the government and genuine farmers and their leaders”.Meanwhile, unions said on December 30 tractors will “march” from one border to the other and highways. They added that if the issue is not resolved, then on January 1 they will be making some “big announcement”. Today they “invited people of Delhi, Haryana and borders and enjoy langar” with them on the borders on the New Year day.  Read also: RLP convener Beniwal announces split from NDA over farm lawsMore Punjab farmers head towards protest sites near DelhiManoj Tiwari invites Kejriwal to his house, offers to clear his ‘doubts’ about farm lawsFarmers from Maharashtra reach Delhi border: All India Kisan SabhaPM blatantly lying on laws: Farm leaders Opposition misusing stir, claims Modi; give laws a year, Rajnath appeals to farmersSpeaking from Singhu border, Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav said “letter diplomacy is going on because the aim of the government is to put the ball in our court”.

26-12-2020||New Delhi||Oxford COVID-19 vaccine may become the first to get Indian regulator’s nod for emergency use||With preparations underway for a possible vaccine-rollout by January, the Indian drug regulator is looking at the UK, which sources believe may give its nod to the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine next week, before deciding on giving emergency use authorisation to the Serum Institute that is manufacturing the shots here.Once the UK drug regulator gives its approval to the Oxford vaccine, the expert committee on COVID-19 at the CDSCO will hold its meeting and thoroughly review the safety and immunogenicity data from the clinical evaluations conducted abroad and in India before granting any emergency authorisation for the vaccine here, official sources said.The process of granting emergency use approval for Bharat Biotech’s COVID-19 vaccine ‘Covaxin’ may take time as its phase 3 trials are still underway, while Pfizer is yet to make a presentation.“Going by this, Oxford vaccine ‘Covishield’ is likely to be the first to be rolled out in India,” a source said.Serum Institute of India (SII) last week also had submitted some additional data required by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), the sources said.Amid fears about the mutated variant of SARS-CoV-2 detected in the UK, government officials recently said that it will have no impact on the potential of emerging vaccines that are being developed in India and other countries.Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India (SII) and Pfizer had applied to the Drugs Controller General of India  (DCGI) seeking emergency use authorisation for their COVID-19 vaccines early this month.The subject expert committee (SEC) on COVID-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on December 9 had sought additional safety and efficacy data for COVID-19 vaccines of SII and Bharat Biotech after deliberating upon their applications.The application by the Indian arm of US pharmaceutical firm Pfizer was not taken up for deliberation as the company had sought more time for making a presentation before the committee.The Pfizer vaccine has already been approved by several countries including the UK, the US,  and Bahrain.While considering SII’s application, the SEC had recommended that the firm should submit an updated safety data of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in the country, immunogenicity data from the clinical trial in the UK and India, along with the outcome of the assessment of the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for grant of EUA.As for Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, “after detailed deliberation, the committee recommended that the firm should present the safety and efficacy data from the ongoing phase 3 clinical trial in the country for further consideration”, the SEC had said.The Pune-based SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has made a collaboration with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca to manufacture the vaccine.The SII has already manufactured 40 million doses of the vaccine, under the at-risk manufacturing and stockpiling licence from the DCGI, officials recently had said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-may-become-the-first-to-get-indian-regulators-nod-for-emergency-use-189714
26-12-2020||New Delhi||New book on Gandhi to be unveiled by RSS chief on Jan 1||Mahatma Gandhi’s 1909 work “Hind Swaraj” is grounded in ‘dharma’ which is often but inadequately translated as religion, says a new book on the father of the nation scheduled to be launched on January 1 by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.Authors J K Bajaj and M D Srinivas say their book “Making of a Hindu Patriot: Background of Gandhiji’s Hind Swaraj” has evolved out of their earlier effort to prepare an authentic edition of “Hind Swaraj” based on Gandhi’s handwritten manuscript of 1909 in Gujarati and his English translation of the text published from Phoenix in 1910.They say they have tried to tell the story of the evolution of “Hind Swaraj” as a text of religious patriotism and of Gandhi as a Hindu patriot, perhaps the greatest, Deshbhakta Mahatma, of our times.“We tell this story largely in his own words,” say Bajaj, founder-director of Centre for Policy Studies, and its founder-chairman Srinivas.Gandhi always perceived himself as a Hindu, perhaps a better Hindu than most others, and that is how his contemporaries saw him, they say.They argue that Gandhi’s early contact with the people of a different civilisation made him to “think consciously about the faith and ways of the ordinary small-town Hindu that he had imbibed and taken for granted since his early childhood”.“In South Africa, under pressure to convert from some of his Christian and Muslim well-wishers, he began a serious exploration into his own religion, and also Islam and Christianity, to discover for himself the meaning and responsibility of being a Hindu,” says the over 1,000-page book, published by Har-Anand Publications.“At the same time, faced with the extreme prejudice against Indians, to which he was personally exposed within the first few weeks of his arrival there (South Africa), he began to study and mediate on the difference between the Indian and the modern Western civilisation,” it says.According to the authors, “Hind Swaraj” is best read as a text of religious patriotism.“Leading and engaging in this (Satyagraha) struggle for establishing and preserving the dignity of India and the Indian people were thus a religious duty. It was also a patriotic duty. The two for him had become the same. He could say with conviction, as he did often, that patriotism for him was an aspect of his religion,” they say.They had published an ‘authentic edition’ of “Hind Swaraj” in 2011. It was released by Bhagwat and Narendra Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat.On New Year’s Day, “Making of a Hindu Patriot” will be launched by Bhagwat at Gandhi Darshan, Rajghat.“Some of the top leaders of the RSS and the BJP have been invited for the launch. This is perhaps the first physical book launch in the pandemic and we are ensuring all COVID-19 norms are in place,” says Narendra Kumar, founder-chairman of Har-Anand Publications.In February, Bhagwat had unveiled another book on Gandhi at the Gandhi Smriti memorial. He had then termed Gandhi as a “hardcore Sanatani Hindu” who stuck to his faith and respected other faiths as well.

26-12-2020||New Delhi||Will meet operating expenditure from earnings: Rail Board Chairman assesses pandemic-hit year||The Railways will meet its operating expenditure from its earnings despite the coronavirus pandemic, Railway Board Chairman VK Yadav said on Saturday, assessing a year that saw the national transporter scale down its passenger services to an unprecedented level to contain the spread of the virus.Addressing a Year-ender press meet, Yadav said several expenditure-control measures and freight revenue earnings will help compensate for the losses in the passenger segment.Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Railways’ passenger revenue has come down to just Rs 4,600 crore this year compared to Rs 53,000 crore last year, a slide of 87 per cent.Yadav said the Railways expects an increase in freight loading revenue on account of enhanced transportation of non-traditional commodities like food grain and fertilisers.“The Railways has so far spent 12 per cent less than last year. We have controlled our expenditure and since few trains are operational we are saving on fuel and inventory. Despite COVID-19, we will meet our operating expenditure from our revenue.“We have almost surpassed both freight loading and freight revenue of last year. So, this year’s freight revenue would be more than last year’s,” he said.Yadav also said the Railways biggest achievements this year was that it managed to maintain the supply line of essential commodities, ferried more than 60 lakh migrant workers home in Shramik Special trains and also managed to convert challenges into opportunities by clearing the backlog of all maintenance and safety works.Speaking on the bullet train project, Yadav said the Maharashtra government has assured the Railways that the remaining land will be provided for the project in the next four months.               “Once that is done, we can start work on the entire line and then bullet train from both the states can be commissioned together. We will get the full picture over the next four months and then decide if the commissioning will be done in phases or at once.“However, if the Maharashtra land acquisition is delayed, a 325-km stretch till Vapi will be commissioned. The decision will be taken in four months,” he said.So far, 68 per cent of the land identified for the project has been acquired.Regular mail, express, passenger and suburban services were suspended from March 25 when a nationwide lockdown came into effect to contain the spread of coronavirus.The Railways gradually started to reopen when it announced some Shramik Special trains from May 1 and some special trains later on. A majority of trains are still not in operation. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-meet-operating-expenditure-from-earnings-rail-board-chairman-assesses-pandemic-hit-year-189710
26-12-2020||Mumbai||Farmers from Maharashtra reach Delhi border: All India Kisan Sabha||A group of farmers from Maharashtra on Saturday joined protesters at one of the borders of Delhi, an All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) leader said and added that tillers have expressed willingness to discuss issues with the government but wanted certain clauses from the three agri laws removed.On Monday, thousands of farmers from Maharashtra had left for Delhi from Nashik in vehicles to join the ongoing agitation seeking the repeal of the legislations.“We received a rousing welcome at a New Delhi border. Farmers sitting on protests here welcomed us and thanked us for joining them,” All India Kisan Sabha secretary, Maharashtra, Ajit Navle, said in a statement.He said that farmers have expressed willingness to discuss their issues with the government, “but we want some clauses in the recently-passed laws, which do not protect the interests of farmers, removed”.The farmers from Maharashtra, who started off in private vehicles from Nashik on Monday, were led by leaders of the Kisan Sabha.According to the Kisan Sabha, cultivators from 21 districts in Maharashtra had joined the “vehicle march” to Delhi.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and Mandi systems will stay and has accused the opposition of misleading the farmers.Multiple rounds of talks held between the government and the protesting farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have failed to break the ongoing impasse. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-from-maharashtra-reach-delhi-border-all-india-kisan-sabha-189700
26-12-2020||New Delhi||Manoj Tiwari invites Kejriwal to his house, offers to clear his ‘doubts’ about farm laws||BJP MP Manoj Tiwari on Saturday invited Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to his residence here, offering to clear his "doubts" and explain to him benefits of the Centre's three farm laws.Kejriwal, who is Aam Aadmi Party's convener, on Friday claimed that the new agricultural reform laws would not benefit farmers in any way and do a lot of harm.Taking a dig at the Chief Minister, Tiwari said Kejriwal did not allow anyone to enter his house and refrained from meeting public representatives or extending invitations.Recently, three mayors and other leaders of the BJP-ruled municipal corporations sat on a dharna outside the Chief Minister's residence for 13 days but he did not meet them.Tiwari tweeted to Kejriwal, inviting the AAP convener to his official residence on Mother Teresa Crescent in Lutyen’s Delhi on Sunday 3 pm to explain the benefits of farm laws before media."Let’s do constructive politics for farmers' benefit," Tiwari said in his tweet.Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party have come out strongly in support of protesting farmers. Earlier this month, the Chief Minister had visited Singhu border, one of the protest sites, and reviewed arrangements made for farmers by the city government  "The BJP says that these laws will not harm farmers. But what is their benefit? They say that now the farmers will be able to sell their crop anywhere outside the market. But outside the market, the crop is sold at half the price. How is this a benefit? The truth is that these laws will do a lot of harm and don't have a single benefit," Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi on Friday.Tiwari, former Delhi BJP president, said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday explained benefits of farm laws and senior leaders, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah and national president JP Nadda, had repeatedly assured that MSP and mandis would continue."Still, if Arvind Kejriwal cannot find any benefits in the three farm laws and has some doubts he may accept my invitation. I will be happy to help him see the benefits of the farm laws," Tiwari said.Farmers from various parts of the country have been camping at different border points of Delhi for four weeks now to demand repeal of the three agri laws, which were voted through in Parliament in September amid strong protests by opposition parties.The three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.

26-12-2020||Lucknow||35 arrests, dozen FIRs as UP 'love jihad' law completes one month||Going full steam, the Uttar Pradesh police have made more than one arrest a day since the controversial anti-conversion ordinance came into effect a month ago, having apprehended about 35 people so far.Nearly a dozen FIRs have been lodged since the Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, was notified on November 27.Eight arrests were made from Etah, seven from Sitapur, four from Greater Noida, three each from Shahjahanpur and Azamgarh, two each from Moradabad, Muzaffarnagar, Bijnor and Kannauj and one each from Bareilly and Hardoi, officials said here.The first case was registered in Bareilly just a day after the legislation came into force.The police cracked the whip following a complaint of Tikaram Rathore, the father of a 20-year-girl and resident of Sharif Nagar village in Bareilly. He alleged that Uwaish Ahmad (22) had become friends with his daughter and was trying to "coax, coerce and lure" her to convert.An FIR was lodged at Deorania police station in Bareilly district and the accused was arrested on December 3.Acting swiftly after being tipped off about interfaith marriages, the Lucknow Police stopped a ceremony in the state capital, asking the couple to meet the legal requirements first.In Muzaffarnagar district, one Nadeem and an accomplice were arrested on December 6 for allegedly trying to force a married Hindu woman to convert.Nadeem, however, got reprieve when the Allahabad High Court directed the police not to take any coercive action against him.Likewise, in Moradabad, two brothers, arrested earlier this month under the anti-conversion law, were released on an order of a CJM court.Rashid and Salim were arrested on December 4 after they visited the registrar's office in Moradabad to record Rashid's marriage to a Hindu woman whose family had filed the complaint.Shabab Khan aka Rahul (38), who is married, was picked up in Mau district on December 3 and 13 of his accomplices booked for allegedly abducting a 27-year-old woman on the eve of her wedding on November 30 with an intent to change her religion.An FIR was lodged at Tambor police station in Sitapur district and 22-year-old Zubrail along with five of his family members and two locals was accused of kidnapping a 19-year-old girl and converting her. All, barring Zubrail, were arrested on December 5.In Bijnor, 22-year-old labourer Afzal was arrested on December 13 for allegedly kidnapping a girl from her home.A 19-year-old woman lodged an FIR with Shahabad police station in Hardoi district on December 11 alleging that she was raped on the pretext of marriage and also pressured to convert by one Mohammed Azad. She also alleged that she was being sold by Azad in Delhi.  Azad was booked for rape, for flouting UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Law, 2020 and for human trafficking. He was arrested on December 16.Rashid Ali (22) and Saleem Ali (25) were arrested under the new law in Moradabad district on similar charges.A man was sent to jail in Bijnor on December 16 for 'love jihad', a term coined by BJP leaders and right-wing activists to describe the crime against which Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has also spoken out.Addressing bypoll rallies in Jaunpur and Deoria, Adityanath had used the Hindu funeral chant of 'Ram Naam Satya Hai' to threaten those who do not respect daughters and sisters.Amid a hue and cry over the law, social activist Shantanu Sharma said, "We have no problems with the new law but its enforcement should not cause harassment to people. It should be ensured that it is not misused." "Making a new law doesn't mean that forcible conversions will be checked easily. Ultimately, it will be the police which will enforce it. It's too early to predict whether it will succeed in its purpose or not, but it should be used carefully," he said.Former UP Director General of Police Yashpal Singh said that when a girl flees, there is pressure for her recovery. "It (law) is good as per the social structure and with this there will be not exploitation. However, as per modern social outlook, people can feel stripped off their freedom." High court lawyer Sandeep Chowdhury said, "The law impinges upon the fundamental right to choice and the right to change of faith. It militates against the fundamental rights to individual autonomy, privacy, human dignity and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution." He pointed out that a PIL has already been filed in the Allahabad High Court challenging the law and now it is for the court to decide.The high court has asked the state government to respond to a petition which contended that the new law impinges upon the fundamental right to choice and the right to change of faith.During the hearing, the high court refused to grant any interim relief and directed the state government to file a counter affidavit by January 4.The ordinance aimed at curbing forcible or fraudulent religious conversions, including those for the sake of marriage, got the assent of UP Governor Anandiben Patel just within days of the state cabinet approving its draft.  The law provides for a jail term of up to 10 years for any violations. Under the law, which deals with different categories of offences, a marriage will be declared "null and void" if the conversion of a woman is solely for that purpose.The onus to prove that the conversion has not been done forcibly will lie on the accused and the convert.

26-12-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh cabinet okays law against conversion||‘The Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Bill, 2020’ which provides for up to 10 years in jail for conversion “through marriage or by any other fraudulent means” got the state cabinet’s approval on Saturday, Home Minister Narottam Mishra said.The bill in some ways is similar to the Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, notified by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh last month, which too provides for maximum punishment of 10 years for fraudulent conversions including those for the sake of marriage.Mishra claimed that once enacted, the law in MP will be the most stringent in the country.Offences under the proposed law will be cognisable and non-bailable. The bill, which seeks to replace the Religious Freedom Act of 1968, will be tabled in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly, Mishra said.“The new legislation will prohibit religious conversion or such efforts by misrepresentation, allurement, force, undue influence, coercion, marriage or any other fraudulent means. Abetment and conspiracy for religious conversion will also be prohibited under it,” he said.In another similarity to the Uttar Pradesh anti-conversion ordinance, any marriage solemnised in violation of the proposed law will be considered null and void.Those willing to convert will need to apply to the district administration 60 days in advance. The religious leaders facilitating the conversion will also have to inform about it 60 days in advance.Violation of these provisions would attract jail term of three to five years and fine of Rs 50,000, the minister said.In cases of religious conversion of members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and minors, a provision has been made for imprisonment of two to ten years in jail and Rs 50,000 fine, he said.There is provision of three to ten years of imprisonment and fine of Rs 50,000 in cases of marriage carried out by hiding religion, misrepresentation or impersonation, he said.In case of mass conversions (of two or more persons), a provision of five to ten years of imprisonment and minimum fine of Rs 1 lakh has been made, Mishra said.Repeat offenders will face five to ten years of imprisonment, Mishra said, adding that the registration of any organisation involved in such violation would be cancelled.Religious conversion in violation of this law would be considered null and void, he said.Parents, legal guardian or custodian and brothers and sisters of the converted person can lodge a complaint.Offences would be investigated by an officer not lower than sub-inspector’s rank, and it would be the responsibility of the accused to prove his innocence, the minister said.Under the UP ordinance too, onus of proving that conversion has been voluntary lies on the accused and the person who has been converted.A child born to the victim women will be entitled to get maintenance under the proposed law. Such children would be entitled to inherit the father’s properties too, Mishra said.In UP, a PIL has been filed in the Allahabad High Court challenging the ordiance, contending that it impinges upon the fundamental right to choice and right to change of faith. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madhya-pradesh-cabinet-okays-law-against-conversion-189669

26-12-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||21-year-old woman set to become India's youngest mayor||For the first time in life, she had walked into the prestigious council hall of the capitalcity's Municipal Corporation building six days ago to take oath as a Councillor of the ruling Marxist party.Though she was the 'baby' among the councillors, the proud Arya Rajendran faced the sea of onlookers in front of her with confidenceand uttered the oath with sheer maturity.But, that day, the 21-year-old college student- turned-councillor never thought that she would soon come back to the historic council hall as its supremo-the Mayor.If everything goes as expected, Arya, now a second-year graduation student of a city college, would not only become the new Mayor of Kerala's capital, a position held by several significant personalities in the past, but also the youngest ever Mayor in the country.According to party sources, the Thiruvananthapuram district secretariat of the ruling CPI(M), which met here on Friday, recommended Arya's name for the post of mayor, which has to be ratified by the party's state secretariat.BJP leader and former Maharashtra Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis had become the mayor of Nagpur Municipal Corporation at the age of 27.While replying to endless congratulatory messages from her modest rented house at Mudavanmukal here, Arya said she was yet to get official confirmation from her party about the new responsibility.A staunch party activist hailing from a hardcore Marxist family, she said maturity and leadership qualities cannot be measured with anyone's age."I have faced the election with confidence and courage. I am ready to shoulder any responsibility entrusted with me by my party. My dream is to take forward politics and my studies together," she said.Daughter of CPI(M) activist K Rajendran, an electrician by profession, and Sreelatha, an LIC agent, Arya is a B.Sc Maths second year student at the All Saints college here.She had won from the Mudavanmughal ward of the city Corporation, garnering 2,872 votes, 549 votes more than the rival Congress candidate.A state committee member of the Students Federation of India (SFI), she is also the state president of Balasangam, the children's wing of the Left party.As a Mayor, her top priority would be waste management in the capital city, which has been a challenging task for her predecessors also."Our city is beautiful. To keep it like this, it should be free of waste. Besides a scientific waste management system, a thorough awareness is needed among people not to dump waste on the waysides," Arya said.As a councillor, she wanted a family health centre in her ward and to implement programmes to reduce stress among children.Saying that her college teachers and friends were very much supportive of her political stint, Arya said she also wanted to find time to prepare for three semester exams she had missed due to the election campaign.An ardent fan of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in politics and superstar Mohanlal in cinema, the Mayor-designate also said she wanted to continue her studies as much as she can and to intervene in people's issues and find a solution for that."I am a person who grew up listening to my father saying that it is not in dividual, but party, which is supreme.I will continue as an obedient party comrade," she added.Actor Mohanlal, whose ancestral home is located at Mudavanmugal, called and congratulated Arya, which was aired, by party news channel, 'People' on Saturday.An excited Arya thanked him for his wishes and hoped that she would live up to the expectations of all.

26-12-2020||New Delhi||No corporate can grab your land: Shah||No corporate can snatch away a farmer's land as long as Narendra Modi is the prime minister of the country, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Friday and asserted that the provision of MSP will continue and mandis will not be shut down.Addressing a gathering in Kishangarh village in the national capital, Shah said if farmer organisations felt that any provision of the three new farm laws was against their interests, the Modi government was ready to discuss and consider it with an open mind.The opposition is crying hoarse over the farm laws, he said assuring farmers that the  three agricultural reform laws were in their interest and do not cause any harm to them.  "Neither MSP will end, nor anyone can snatch your land. I want to tell farmers that as long as Narendra Modi is the prime minister, no corporate can snatch away your land, this is BJP's promise to you," he asserted.Shah blamed the opposition, including the Congress, for spreading lies about the minimum support price (MSP) and other provisions of the farm laws."Opposition is telling brazen lies. I again reiterate that the MSP will continue and the mandis will not be closed. Farmers' welfare is the top-most priority of the Modi government," Shah said.Lashing at opposition parties, he said that they did not have any issues and were using farmers to serve their self interests."I want to tell farmers in the whole country that opposition leaders have no issues and they are spreading lies that MSP will end. The prime minister has clarified and now I again clarify that MSP is there and will continue," he said.  Shah said that UPA leaders have no right to speak about MSP. He added that nothing was done by them to fulfil farmers' demand for one-and-a-half times minimum support price on input cost of crops and it was implemented by the Modi government.Shah listed various steps taken by the government in agricultural sector to show how it kept farmers' welfare as its priority in comparison to those opposition leaders who were attacking it over farm laws.The opposition leaders, including "Rahul Baba", demanded loan waiver for farmers when the Modi government started Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme, he said."In ten years of UPA government farm loans of Rs 60,000 crore were waived, while Modi government transferred Rs 95,000 crore in the accounts of ten crore farmers in two and half years, and now Rs 18,000 crore is being transferred today without any middleman coming in between," he said.Shah further said, "I want to ask those who talk about farmers' interest, what they did do when they were in power? There was procurement of wheat and paddy worth Rs 3.74 lakh crore in 2009 to 2014, while the Modi government raised it to 8.22 lakh crore in 2014-19." Attacking Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, he said "I want to ask them who are talking about farmers? What was the budget for farmers in 2013-14 when UPA and Congress were in power. It was Rs 21,900 crore. The Modi government raised it to Rs 1.34 lakh crores in its last budget." Shah said that the farm reforms brought by Modi were undertaken during Congress led United Progressive Alliance(UPA) regime.  The reforms were given by Shankarlal Guru Committee in 2001 and by Montek Singh Ahluwalia, he said.The home minister also accused the opposition of spreading lies about mandis."The mandis will also continue. They are spreading lies that mandis will be closed. I want to ask the opposition which provision tells them that the mandis will be closed? If they want a discussion over it, I can send Ramesh Bidhuri (South Delhi BJP MP) to tell them that mandis will not be closed," Shah said amid a huge applause when he mentioned the name of Bidhuri who was present on the occasion.The opposition leaders are "wailing" now and "spreading lies " because the people of the country have discarded them and given Modi a place in their hearts, he said.Shah attended Kisan Samman Nidhi event and also listened to Modi's video interaction with farmers from several states, along with other BJP leaders at a Gaushala in Kishangarh village. As protests showed no signs of abating Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused opposition parties of instigating and misleading protesters, a charge he as well as many of his ministers and party colleagues have taken turns to make several times in the past. READ: Modi said farmers across the country are aware of their reality, “what they did for them while they were in power”. “Those faking concerns over farmers’ lands, where were they when their lands were being grabbed,” he said while addressing farmers on the day he directly transferred Rs 18,000 crore to nine crore farmers across the country under the PM-Kisan scheme.Union ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Prakash Javadekar and Smriti Irani were among the leaders who separately interacted with farmers at various places across the country and together with the gathering listened to the prime minister's address. In his rally, Singh appealed to farmers to try the three new farm laws as an "experiment" for a year or two and in case they are found not beneficial for the farming community, the government will do all necessary amendments.Separately, Shah said no corporate can snatch away any farmer's land as long as Modi is Prime Minister and asserted that the provision of MSP will continue and mandis will not be shut down.In Amethi, Irani launched a scathing attack on Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of "lying and misleading" farmers over the Centre's recent farm laws."He is shedding crocodile tears for farmers and misleading them. His own jija (brother-in-law) has encroached upon the land of farmers," she alleged, in an apparent reference to charges levelled against Robert Vadra by political rivals.Modi released the installment of Rs 2,000 to every farmer on the birth anniversary of the former prime minister and BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which is every year celebrated as "Good Governance Day" by the ruling party.Under the PM-KISAN scheme, a financial benefit of Rs 6,000 per year is provided to small and marginal farmers, payable in three equal installments of Rs 2,000 each. The fund is transferred directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-corporate-can-grab-your-land-shah-189272

Besides, the advances of the past four years and the strategic convergence which we have seen deepened in the current administration will continue, but they need to be buttressed with broader focus on our shared democratic values,” President of the US-India Business Council Nisha Biswal said, addressing the inaugural Atal Bihari Memorial Lecture organised by the Ministry of External Affairs.‘Vajpayee Was Titan Of His Times’Atalji was a titan of his times who left an indelible stamp on many of India’s policies. His vision of India-US cooperation has been advanced, particularly in recent years. —S Jaishankar, External Affairs Minister“Our geopolitical ambitions need to be paired with a firm grasp and strategy for engaging the geo-economic realities of the Indo-Pacific,”Recounting the upward trajectory of the relationship since the time Vajpayee was at the helm of affairs, she said Vajpayee was able to foresee what many others failed to see. He saw the potential dangers posed by a rising and unchecked China. And he saw the importance of US-India partnership.Today, she said the geo-economics realities were such that for either the US to succeed and be competitive with the production capacity and efficiency of China would require working together by both countries and develop more effective and efficient economy in respective countries.Biswal, who served in the Obama administration, said today the two large economies — the US and India — are outside two major trading blocks in Asia and trade policy in democracies are neither easy nor politically popular.“Despite the fact that we have not been able to conclude even a small agreement between the two countries, we have seen the promise of a growing economic partnership drive greater trade and investment in both US and India,” she suggested.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-need-to-work-closely-to-compete-with-china-biswal-189462

The question of not cooperating on a scheme that is benefitting farmers seems absurd. —Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal Chief MinisterSpeaking at an event today in which he distributed Rs18,000 crore to over nine crore farmers, Modi said while Mamata had expressed solidarity with the farmers protesting against new farm laws, she had blocked the implementation of the PM-Kisan scheme in West Bengal.In response, Banerjee said PM Modi was trying to mislead people with half-truth and distorted facts.“Let me set the record straight. We have always been ready to cooperate in the interest of the farmers. I personally have written two letters and have even spoken to the minister concerned two days ago but they are refusing to cooperate and are instead indulging in malicious propaganda for political gains,” said Banerjee.Banerjee said when the West Bengal Government was implementing so many schemes in the state with the Centre, the question of not cooperating on a scheme that was benefitting farmers seemed absurd.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/half-truths-mamata-on-pm-kisan-scheme-189464
26-12-2020||---||Opposition misusing stir, claims Modi; give laws a year, Rajnath appeals to farmers||New Delhi/Chandigarh, Dec 25Prime Minister Narendra Modi today made another attempt to reach out to the protesting farmers on the three agricultural laws even as he accused the Opposition of misleading the farmers for petty political gains.Interacting virtually with farmers from across the country while transferring Rs 18,000 crore into the accounts of around nine crore farmers under the PM-Kisan scheme, he said, “The government is always open to talks, but the discussions must be based on facts.”The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, a joint forum of farmers’ organisations protesting at the Delhi borders, said it would meet on Saturday to take a call on the offer. It said instead of interacting with a handful of farmers through video-conferencing, the PM should have visited Singhu or Tikri borders to address the farmers and resolve their issues.“The PM today said rumours are being spread on MSP and farmers are being misled. Why can’t the government come out with an ordinance to make MSP a legal right?” asked Harinder Singh Lakhowal, BKU (Lakhowal) general secretary.Union Minister Rajnath Singh, meanwhile, appealed to the farmers to try the new laws as an “experiment” for a year or two and in case these were not found beneficial, the government would bring in all necessary amendments.Describing the protesting farmers as his own people, Rajnath said, “Those sitting on dharna are farmers and are born to farmers’ families. We have a lot of respect for them.”Slamming the Opposition, especially the Congress, Trinamool and the Left, the PM alleged those rejected by the people were doing event management at the protest sites for political survival. “They are misleading the farmers by not allowing dialogue to take place. They are adding more issues to their original demand of MSP—the release of those jailed for violence, toll taxes, etc,” he said.Acknowledging that some innocent farmers too were part of the agitation, he said the laws were needed even the more as 80 per cent farmers in the country were marginal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-misusing-stir-claims-modi-give-laws-a-year-rajnath-appeals-to-farmers-189232

26-12-2020||New Delhi||2020 saw sharp spike in domestic violence||Domestic violence against women remained a prime cause of concern for the Ministry of Woman and Child Development in 2020 with over 5,000 such complaints received during the year.The National Commission for Women was flooded with complaints of domestic violence in March as the lockdown, imposed in view of the Covid outbreak, forced women to remain confined in their homes with their abusers.The number of complaints went on increasing through the months and in July, a record number of 660 such complaints were received. Over 5,000 complaints of domestic violence were received by the NCW in 2020.NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma has attributed the rise in complaints to factors like economic insecurity, financial instability and isolation among others. “Victims of domestic violence are distanced from their regular support systems making it difficult for them to call out for help. The series of lockdowns in India reduced the opportunities of reporting of domestic violence cases,” Sharma said.She said the lockdown incapacitated women by preventing them from moving to safer places in cases of violence and abuse, reduced contact with the natal family which is usually the first point of contact for the victim.“The machinery under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act had not been identified as an essential service during the lockdown. Hence, protection officers and NGOs were not able to visit the victims,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2020-saw-sharp-spike-in-domestic-violence-189489

The EC holds Lok Sabha, Assembly, Legislative Council and Rajya Sabha poll through its CEOs in the states.The commission has been working on such a suggestion at a time when the poll panel is preparing to conduct elections in five states, including West Bengal, where ruling TMC and BJP are engaged in fierce electoral battle.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-proposes-to-protect-poll-officials-from-harassment-189487
