Neutralising any threat to Aksai Chin and permannently securing areas up to its 1959 claim lines were other immediate objectives of Chinese mobilisation, he added.China had occupied all territory it required by 1962 and it does not require any more land as far as its strategic interests are concerned. It is using such incidents merely as a tool to assert its hegemony over India and embarrass it. Stating that China wants India to be a junior cooperative partner on the world stage and not a competitor, he said that the moment China perceives India’s assertiveness, it will react through border skirmishes.India’s growing relations with the US, Japan, Vietnman, influence in the Indo-Pacific region, aggressive posturing in Dokalam, development of border infrastructure in eastern Ladakh changing the status of Jammu and Kashmir and the Home Minister’s subsequent statement that Aksai Chin and Gilgit-Baltistan areas would be regained, were other triggers for the current stand-off, he said. Lt Gen Raj Shukla, GOC-in-C, Army Training Command, said that tactically our response sto the Chinese have been fairly good, but we need to synergise them in the larger strategic framework. Stating that we need to brace up and act against the strategic squeeze from the LAC to the Indian Ocean Region, he added that a systematic and successful deterrence to China is very much possible. He said that a lot of work is being done in the arena of military education and the syllabus of all institutions right from the National Defence Academy to the National Defence College is being revamped. He also stressed upon making out response mechanism stronger and bolder.Former GOC-in-C, Northern Command, Lt Gen DS Hooda said that it was clear from the level of preparedness that this incident was different from earlier incursions and the level of violence seen was unprecedented. “We were also taken by surprise as to why the PLA was doing it at this time when the entire world was affected by the Covid pandemic and neither ws there any breakdown in Sino-Indian ties or any large trigger,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/military-literature-festival-moving-troops-ahead-in-some-sectors-can-fully-neutralise-chinas-advantage-186171

18-12-2020||New Delhi||India well positioned to play vital role in Indian Ocean Region: Army Vice Chief||India’s dominant position at the geographical centre of the Indian Ocean as well as its robust economy and global standing as an upholder of law and democratic values placed it in a firm position to play a vital role in the quest for peace and stability in the region, Vice Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen SK Saini said on Friday.In his address at the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies (CENJOWS), a military think-tank, he said India believes that adherence to rule of law, transparency, and respect for all nations and peaceful resolution of disputes are non-negotiable aspects to harness the vast potential of Indian Ocean.His comments came amid growing global concerns over China’s increasing military muscle-flexing in the Indian Ocean, a region that is critical for India’s strategic interests.The Vice Chief of Army staff cautioned that the increasing interest of “extra regional forces” and the existing challenges of piracy, human trafficking, ad illegal fishing have all made the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) volatile and a potential “global battlefield”.India has significantly expanded its deployment of warships and submarines in the Indian Ocean Region in the last few months following its border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh, ostensibly to send across a message to Beijing.Lt Gen Saini identified preserving and facilitating the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as among key challenges, adding inadequate arrangements for equitable and peaceful harnessing of natural resources were also important aspect of the overall scenario.“These concerns have been further accentuated by unilateral actions by some of the nations which have not only questioned the rights of the IOR nations to utilise their exclusive economic zones but have also challenged their sovereignty over some of the strategically located Islands itself,” he said.The Vice Chief of Army Staff said such actions to change the “well-established equilibrium” has resulted in “immense turbulence and an intense superpower rivalry” in the region.“India’s dominant position at the geographical centre of the IOR, a robust economy and a global standing as an upholder of law and democratic values, places it well to play a vital role in the quest for peace and stability in the region,” he said.Lt Gen Saini said India has been increasingly engaging with all nations of the IOR and its outreach towards the East through the doctrine of SAGAR or ‘Security and Growth for All’ has been a pillar of its overarching foreign policy.“India recognises and believes that to harness the vast potential of the Indian Ocean for economic development, adherence to rule of law, transparency, and respect for all nations and peaceful resolution of disputes will be inviolate and non-negotiable aspects,” he said.“It would be appropriate to say that our role as a net security provider in the region is now a strategic obligation and no longer a matter of choice. India, therefore, needs to formulate a well defined IOR strategy and follow a robust capability development road map to live up to its potential in this region,” he said.Lt Gen Saini said the unfolding diplomacy in the IOR is a clear indicator that the world powers want to forge partnerships with India to ensure peace and development in the region.The Vice Chief of Army Staff reiterated that the geographical factors coupled with the slow and steady shift of power from the West to the East, have resulted in the IOR becoming a hub of global geopolitical rivalry.The discussion was organised to get the defence forces, Indian industry, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders into a common platform in order to understand the complexities of changing dynamics in the Indian Ocean Region and to evolve coherent policies to address the future challenges. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-well-positioned-to-play-vital-role-in-indian-ocean-region-army-vice-chief-186166
18-12-2020||Ghaziabad||BKU leader Tikait junks PM’s claim on MSP||BKU leader Rakesh Tikait on Friday junked Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim of implementing recommendations of the Swaminathan commission on the MSP for crops, saying farmers are committing suicide as they are not getting the remunerative price of their produce.Till today, cultivators of Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh are not getting the minimum support price (MSP) of pulses and are committing suicide, he said in a message to the PTI.The claim of the implementation of the commission report is totally false, he said. The Union government has not assured farmers that they will get the MSP of their produce and there is no provision for it in the agricultural laws passed by the Centre recently, he said in a WhatsApp message.He said farmers do not want an aid of Rs 500 per month being given by the Centre but demand the minimum support price for their produce.Farmers are not beggars, Tikait added. He also alleged that the government is helping sugar mill owners by giving them export subsidy by which arrears of sugarcane growers will be paid.They are helping sugar mills owners and farmers will not benefit by it as they will only get their dues, Tikat added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday defended the new farm laws, saying accusations such as the new laws will lead to the scrapping of the minimum support price (MSP) for crops were blatant lies. Addressing farmers of Madhya Pradesh through virtual mode, the PM said his government implemented the Swaminathan commission report and gave MSP of 1.5 times the cost of production. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bku-leader-tikait-junks-pms-claim-on-msp-186164

Having said this, the troop withdrawal would happen. The problem is we (the USA) are handing over Afghanistan to Pakistan,” added Fair, while pointing out flawed US policy for the last 20 years in the region where no serious effort was made to curtail Pakistan has been made. She also pointed out the issue of funding for Afghanistan. Singh said that once the USSR broke down and couldn’t fund Afghanistan, the government fell down.“India could play a role here. Earlier, India and Iran had supported the Northern Alliance. Emirates and Saudis are upset with Pakistan. The US has to work with Iran but elections are coming up there. These fractures are working in favour of the Taliban,” he said, while highlighting that the Chinese presence in Ladakh would close some options for India.  Dr Fair said that a civil war could break out in Afghanistan.“America is delegitimising democracy in Afghanistan. They want a puppet democracy. They are pushing Ghani (Ashraf Ghani) to give up the election. The Taliban is getting what they want. Pakistan is playing clever. They think that delegitimising democracy would create chaos in Afghanistan. Pakistan is maestro of chaos.”  On the role of media, Dr Fair said over the years the traditional media lost a lot of money.“In the USA, the watchdog media shifted to access journalism. Access is money in India,” she said. Singh pointed out that newspapers run by trusts in India still have credibility.  Dr Fair said a lot of terrorist groups have presence over social media like facebook and Twitter including Taliban through proxies.  On deep state, Dr Fair said that Pakistan did have a deep state but in India military leadership has little say.   But Singh pointed out that Indian intelligence agencies were being used for political ends by the people in power.“In case of the RAW, the oversight is missing. The ED and CBI are being used to go after people which the government doesn’t like,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/civil-war-could-break-out-in-afghanistan-as-it-is-being-handed-over-back-to-pakistan-christine-fair-186160

Taking as given the published data for all other countries, China’s global ranking in Doing Business 2018 would have been 85, a decline of 7 places relative to the previous year,” said the World Bank’s review of data irregularities in doing business.The review examined all data changes that occurred between circulation of the data for Bank-wide review and final publication in the Doing Business 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 report cycles, said a World Bank press release.In addition to China, the World Bank has readjusted the Doing Business rankings of three other countries—Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan.The review kept the ranking of UAE unchanged at 16 in Doing Business 2020, while it marginally lowered the ranking of Saudi Arabia to 63 from 62.The ranking of Azerbaijan has been improved to 28 from 34.It said these irregularities were reported to DEC management by Doing Business team members and triggered the pause of the Doing Business report announced on August 27, 2020, as well as the review.The review process did not identify any further specific data irregularities beyond those affecting these four countries as described in this document.While unrelated to the specific data irregularities, the World Bank said it is also launching an external review of the Doing Business methodology with the goal of strengthening the product and its usefulness to stakeholders worldwide, with findings expected in mid-2021.“We will be completing the arrangements for the publication of the Doing Business 2021 report in the coming months, incorporating the data corrections noted above. We will address the findings of these various reviews in this and future Doing Business reports,” it said.It also said over the past 17 years, the Doing Business report has been a valuable tool for many countries seeking to benchmark the business regulatory environment. The Doing Business indicators and methodology are designed to help countries to generate reform momentum to improve the overall business climate.In a statement of August 27, it said irregularities were reported regarding changes to the data in the Doing Business 2018 and Doing Business 2020 reports, published in October 2017 and 2019.“Management immediately called for a systematic review and assessment of data changes that occurred subsequent to the institutional data review process for the last five Doing Business reports,” it had said.Management also requested the World Bank Group Internal Audit (GIA) perform an assurance review of data integrity in the production process of the Doing Business Report and verify management’s review of data irregularities in the Doing Business Reports from 2016 to 2020.As per the ‘Doing Business’ 2020 report, India had jumped 14 places to the 63rd position on the ease of doing business ranking. India has improved its rank by 79 positions in five years (2014-19). --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wb-comes-out-with-corrected-doing-business-rankings-lowers-china-place-by-7-notches-186159

18-12-2020||Mumbai||Why Kangana Ranaut not called for drugs probe, asks Maharashtra Congress||A day after filmmaker Karan Johar was served summons by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for questioning in connection with the drugs-Bollywood links probe, the Maharashtra Congress on Friday demanded to know why a "self-confessed drug abuser" and actress Kangana Ranaut was not yet called for quizzing."Though the NCB has taken note of an old video of Karan Johar's home party, why is similar cognisance not taken of Kangana Ranaut's videos in which she confessed to drug addiction?" Congress Spokesperson Sachin Sawant questioned here."Moreover, that purported video is of 2019, when Devendra Fadnavis was the Chief Minister and handling the Home Department. Then, what prevented him from ordering a probe into that incident by the Mumbai Police's Narcotics Cell?" Sawant asked in a statement.Slamming the NCB for "miserably failing" in finding the drugs angle in the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, Sawant accused the agency of probing issues that have no relation to the case for which they were called by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).He pointed out that it was now over six months since Sushant's death on June 14, but the CBI had kept mum on the probe in the case, despite demands by the Maha Vikas Aghadi government to make public the details."Hence, the real motive was to defame Maharashtra. The defamation of Mumbai Police and Bollywood started after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath decided to have a new film industry in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP used national investigation agencies and Sushant's death for its dirty politics," Sawant said.In the past few months, the ruling allies, Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress, have raised the issue several times and sought to know the status of the Sushant death probe, even as the NCB continued its own lines of investigation pertaining to the Bollywood-drugs mafia nexus.

The calf has been attached to us since its birth. Laltu's love for us is true and unconditional," Vijaypal said.He said that Laltu's mother (cow) had been reared by his father and he was very attached to the cow."After the cow died, the calf was left orphaned, so we decided to adopt him as our son. If a cow can be revered as a mother, why can't a calf be loved as a son?" he asked.The local villagers, however, were excited as well as amused, when they received the invitation for this unique 'mundan'."A lot of people attended. We were all excited and happy for the couple and the calf.

18-12-2020||New Delhi||SC directs West Bengal police not to take coercive action against BJP leaders in criminal cases||The Supreme Court Friday granted interim protection from any coercive action to five BJP leaders, including Mukul Roy and MPs Kailash Vijayvargiya and Arjun Singh, in criminal cases lodged against them in West Bengal.The relief came to two other BJP leaders---Sourav Singh and Pawan Kumar---as the apex court directed the state police not to take any coercive action till it hears their pleas next in January.“There should not be any coercive steps in cases registered against the petitioners till next date,” said a bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and sought response from the West Bengal’s Home Secretary and others.READIt was alleged by the lawyers, appearing for BJP leaders, that criminal cases are being foisted on party leaders at the instance of ruling All India Trinamool Congress Party.All the leaders have filed separate pleas seeking protection in cases lodged against them in the state and alleged that criminal cases have been foisted against them to deter them from undertaking political activities in the state ahead of assembly polls.The bench also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, which heard the matter through video conferencing, posted the batch of pleas for further hearing in the second week of January.       The BJP leaders have also sought investigation by an independent agency into the cases registered against them in West Bengal.The bench, dealing with the sixth petition filed by West Bengal BJP leader Kabir Shankar Bose, sought a report in a sealed cover from the CISF on an alleged scuffle between the TMC workers and his security staff.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Bose, said the leader was assaulted and attacked while travelling in the state despite having CISF protection and besides this, a criminal case was lodged against him.During the hearing, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Arjun Singh, said that as many as 64 criminal cases have been filed against him in 2019 after he had joined Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) leaving Trinamool Congress party.“I am an MP and these cases have been filed after I left TMC,” Rohatgi said, adding, “The first case against Arjun Singh was registered on March 24, 2019 after he left the TMC”.Vijayvargiya’s counsel told the bench that the BJP leader is an MP from Madhya Pradesh and false cases have been lodged against him in West Bengal.“I am an MP from Madhya Pradesh and just because I am going to West Bengal for party works, false cases have been filed against me,” Vijayvargiya’s counsel said.Arjun Singh’s plea said “Initiation of 64 criminal cases against the petitioner (Arjun Singh), immediately upon him leaving the membership of TMC in March 2019, to join the BJP is glaring example as to how the state machineries and the criminal justice system are being misused in furtherance of the political vendetta that a political party (TMC) has against the petitioner.”         The plea said that “the degree of animosity”, can be be easily be gauged as many as 11 to 12 cases have been instituted against Arjun Singh in one month and “with a view to multiply the number of criminal cases against the petitioner multiple FIRs have been lodged in relation to same cause of action.”  Arjun Singh, a member of 17th Lok Sabha and one of the Vice-Presidents of the West Bengal unit of BJP since June 1, 2020, also alleged that his house has also been attacked with bombs and his car was also damaged by a TMC worker who threw stones, a bomb and bricks.He has made the state government, the All India Trinamool Congress, state’s DGP, CBI and Union Ministry of Home Affairs as parties to his plea.“The plea seeks an order directing the transfer of investigation of all cases annexed to the petition to an investigating agency not within the control of the Respondent number 1 to 3 (West Bengal and its police)  in as much as the criminal proceedings instituted against the petitioner are manifestly attended with malafides and has been maliciously instituted at the instituted at the instance of the Respondent number 2 (TMC) with an ulterior motive of wrecking vengeance on the petitioner and with a view to spite him and harass him,” Singh said in the plea. Pleas on similar lines have been filed by others as well. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-directs-west-bengal-police-not-to-take-coercive-action-against-bjp-leaders-in-criminal-cases-186149

18-12-2020||New Delhi||Music teacher held for harassing, molesting student in Delhi||A music teacher has been arrested for allegedly harassing and molesting his 23-year-old student, police said on Friday.The arrest was made after the victim, who was doing her Diploma Honour in Kathak at a centre in Chanakyapuri, accused the 52-year-old teacher of harassing her, they said.According to the complainant, the accused—a ‘pakhawaj (rhythm instrument) teacher at the centre—molested the victim by touching her inappropriately and also harassed her by sending obscene messages on WhatsApp.The matter came to light on December 14 when the girl along with her mother approached officials of the Chanakyapuri police station to register a complaint against him, police said.In her complaint, the victim stated that the accused touched her inappropriately during a training session and sent her obscene messages.On December 14, he again molested her by putting his hands on the waist and kissing her on the forehead. He also tried to kiss on her face, she alleged.Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said based on the statement of the victim, a case was registered under Section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354 A (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code and the accused has been arrested.The accused, a resident of Dilshad Garden, is currently in judicial custody.

18-12-2020||Jaipur||Kafeel Khan expresses satisfaction at SC verdict in his favour||Dr Kafeel Khan, a suspended paediatrician under the Uttar Pradesh government who got relief from the Supreme Court on Thursday, expressed deep satisfaction over the development on Friday, saying December 17 turned out to be an occasion of dual celebrations for him.The Supreme Court refused to interfere with an Allahabad High Court verdict quashing the detention of Khan under the National Security Act (NSA) and ordering his immediate release, saying it is “a good judgment”.Khan’s brother got married on Thursday and the hearing in the apex court was also scheduled on the same day, which caused a stressful situation for everyone in the family, he said.However, celebrations broke out as soon as the SC relief came his way.“I do not know whether it was a coincidence or a deliberate act that the hearing was fixed on December 17, the day my brother was going to get married. The Uttar Pradesh government knew about my brother’s marriage. We were all under stress during the pre-wedding events,” Khan told PTI from Delhi.He said he was not able to sleep on Wednesday night and on Thursday morning, wore the sherwani he had bought for the wedding and went to the court.“I did not know whether the petition will be dismissed or I will be sent behind bars straight from the court. I hugged my mother and left for the court. As soon as the petition was dismissed, I became emotional but controlled myself.“Moments later, I placed a video call to my mother, wife and other family members, who were waiting impatiently. All of them started crying out of joy,” Khan said.He said it was an amazing day that brought dual happiness—the wedding of his brother and the Supreme Court order in his favour.Khan said it was the first occasion in three-and-a-half years when there was a celebration in the family.“My family, be it my wife or my brother, has gone through a lot all this while. My brother was shot at in Gorakhpur in June 2018 while my wife remained engaged in handling matters related to me and taking care of our two kids,” he added.Khan said now, he is fighting for reinstatement in the service.“I have written several letters to the government to reinstate me in service because I have been given clean chits in all nine inquiries against me and now, a 10th inquiry is going on. The government is also not accepting my resignation. I hold camps for people and will remain available to whoever needs me,” he said.Asked whether he has a plan to join politics, Khan, who is temporarily living in Delhi and Jaipur, said, “A doctor is always a doctor. What will happen in the future is not known.”   Khan had hit the headlines after the 2017 tragedy at Gorakhpur’s Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College, in which several children died due to a lack of oxygen cylinders.Initially, he was hailed as a saviour for arranging emergency oxygen cylinders but later, faced action along with nine other doctors and staff members of the hospital, all of whom were released on bail subsequently.A probe by the Uttar Pradesh government cleared Khan of all major charges, prompting him to seek an apology from the state. Khan had alleged that an institutional failure had led to the deaths of the children.In its September 1 verdict, the Allahabad High Court quashed Khan’s detention under the NSA and ordered his immediate release, saying his speech at the Aligarh Muslim University during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests did not promote hatred or violence and gave a call for national integrity. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kafeel-khan-expresses-satisfaction-at-sc-verdict-in-his-favour-186141
18-12-2020||Belthangady (Karnataka)||8-year-old abducted in Karnataka, kidnappers seek ransom in bitcoins||An eight-year-old boy, the son of a hardware shopkeeper, was kidnapped by a four-member gang of criminals on Thursday evening and the kidnappers have demanded ransom in "bitcoins", which is believed to be the first-ever such case in Karnataka.Since Thursday evening the kidnappers were negotiating with the parents and wanted money in bitcoins, a kind of cryptocurrency. Initially they demanded 100 bitcoins, valued around Rs 17 crore and then renegotiated the amount to Rs 10 crore which had by Friday afternoon, reached a stage where the ransom amount came down to Rs 25 lakh, a police officer told IANS.Belthangady, a sleepy town with population less than 20,000 is situated 60 km from harbour city Mangaluru.Another senior police officer said that the four-member gang, yet to be identified, abducted the boy when he was playing along with his grandfather.The officer added that though the family has no history of enmity, but the boy's father is known to be an investor in bitcoins among his close circles."We suspect that someone close to him is behind this kidnapping," claimed the police."Tracking Bitcoins would be really difficult once these parents chose to release the ransom amount. This trade is conducted in the most dubious manner. Hence, it is difficult to track it down," said a police officer.The police officer added that the gang is intentionally negotiating terms in Hindi, in order to mislead the police and parents."The kidnappers' Hindi is not as fluent as North Indians would speak. The gang members appear to be from Karnataka itself. We've got some leads, and we hope to nab them soon," the officer said and added that the police have formed four teams to nab the gang.The police have registered a case and investigations are underway. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/8-year-old-abducted-in-karnataka-kidnappers-seek-ransom-in-bitcoins-186138

But they conveyed they were not in a position to travel to the national capital in the present circumstances and offered to attend the meeting through video conference.CRPF seeks West Bengal DGP support for Amit Shah’s visitAmid standoff between the Centre and the West Bengal government, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) wrote to the Director General of Police (DGP) seeking adequate arrangement of police support in view of Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s two-day visit to the state beginning tomorrow.Meanwhile, Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has accorded “Z” category VIP security cover to Suvendu Adhikari, a former minister in the Mamata Banerjee government, who has recently resigned from the assembly and is likely to join BJP.Sources in the security establishment said Shah is a Z plus protectee and the CRPF requires the support of the state police for Advance Security Liaison (ASL) facility.Under ASL category, an advance team coordinates with security stakeholders for well coordinated arrangement during the protectee’s visit to the concerned areas, they added.In the letter, the CRPF has also mentioned about the security lapses during the recent visit of BJP president JP Nadda to the state on December 10.Sources said, the CRPF has written that during the incident of attack on Nadda adequate police deployment was not available.Nadda has been accorded “Z” category of security of the CRPF, but on December 10 his convoy was allegedly attacked by the TMC workers in Diamond Harbour area of Kolkata in which he escaped but party general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh were hurt.Taking a stern view of the incident, Centre sought a report from the state government and the governor and transferred the three IPS officers, who were responsible for BJP president’s security, on Central deputation.According to sources, Adhikari, 50, would be secured by armed commandos of the CRPF whenever he moves in West Bengal under “Z” category of security cover.At all places except West Bengal, they said, he will have a “Y+” cover by the central paramilitary force.Under the “Z” category, Adhikari will have a mobile team of about 6-7 armed CRPF commandos and a pilot and escort vehicle. A report of the central security agencies on probable threats against Adhikari was analysed before the security was granted to him, the sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-home-secretary-holds-virtual-meeting-with-west-bengal-top-officials-over-security-arrangements-of-high-dignitaries-186133
18-12-2020||New Delhi||Farm protests: Agriculture Minister Tomar says informal talks on, hoping to reach solution before year ends||The government is hopeful of resolving farmers’ agitation against three new farm laws before the new year and is continuing its informal dialogue with various groups to defuse the crisis, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has said amid formal talks remaining deadlocked with protesting unions refusing to accept anything less than the repeal of the Acts.The minister said the Modi government is committed to addressing all genuine concerns of the farming community and it is willing to resume formal talks anytime, but asserted that there was no point talking to those “shooting from peasants’ shoulders”.He put the blame on opposition parties for misleading the farmers and accused them of changing their stance on the reform process and politicising the issue.In an interview with PTI, Tomar—who is leading the negotiation with about 40 farmer unions along with Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash—asserted that the three new farm laws are beneficial for farmers and the government is ready to give a written assurance that the minimum support price (MSP) and mandi system will continue.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders for more than three weeks. At least five rounds of formal talks have been held between the three Union Ministers and 40 farmer unions to break the deadlock, but the unions are demanding complete rollback of the central laws.“We have constantly been holding discussions with farmers’ unions... Overall, our effort is to reach a solution through dialogue with them. We are still open for talks. We are holding discussions with unions. I hope through dialogue we can move towards reaching a solution,” Tomar said while replying to a query about the stalemate and way forward.“Informal talks are going on. I am hopeful of some way out,” he added.Whether the Supreme Court constituted committee will take over talks and find a solution or the government will continue its efforts, Tomar said the government has kept its door open for negotiations with farm leaders and would wait for the Supreme Court’s order for the next course of action. “The matter is sub-judice. After the court’s order, we will study and take a call... We will wait for the court’s direction.”      Farmer unions, who are concerned about peasants, should raise problems of the farming community so that the government can find a solution, the minister said and asked unions not to stress upon repealing these legislations which have been enacted for the benefit of farmers.On farmers’ unions asking the government not to hold “parallel talks” with other groups and “malign” the protesting farmers, he said, “Farm leaders, who are concerned about the welfare of farmers, should discuss peasants’ problems.”“Why should it matter if the acts are repealed or not,” he asked.The government can consider changes to the laws if they convince successfully the clause by clause objections, he said.When asked on his recent remark that he would engage with “genuine” farm leaders, the minister said: “When I say genuine, I mean those who are really concerned about farmers. There is no point talking with those who want to shoot from the shoulders of farmers”.The government is there to resolve the farmers’ problems but unless the specific problems are not told, how can the government offer solutions, he said.Asked how the government plans to give minimum support price assurance, Tomar said: “We will give in writing that till date the way MSP was continuing will continue in future as well. No one should have doubt on this”.The MSP system is an administrative decision and there cannot be a law for everything, he said.“To run the entire country, there are laws. Under laws, there are rules. There are also administrative decisions. Can there be doubt on the government’s decisions? Till date, MSP was in operation. Was it under any law?” he added.Noting that when intentions are right, solutions will definitely emerge, Tomar said the Modi government has enacted the three farm laws with clear intention and the outcome will also be good.Asked if the farmers’ issue will be resolved before 2020, he said: “Yes. I have full hope... Everyone has their own agenda. My agenda is ‘Kisan’. Tell me which provision of the farm laws are hurting farmers and convince me. We are ready for discussion”.Several protesting leaders have threatened to step up their agitation and have said they are prepared to celebrate the Republic Day next year with their own tractor rally on Delhi borders.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be the Chief Guest at the Republic Day function at Rajpath in the national capital on January 26, 2021.On Akali Dal’s charge that was real ‘Tukde-Tukde gang’ and wanted to divide Hindu-Muslim and now Hindu-Sikh, he said: “The political parties should not do politics in the name of farmers. These are the same parties which supported these reforms during elections”. “In the Congress election manifesto for the 2019 general election, in Punjab’s assembly poll manifesto, be it Congress, Akali Dal or AAP, all have talked about reforms. Now they are changing their stand,” he said.Asked if the protest is anti-Modi or there are genuine concerns of farmers with the laws, Tomar said: “In the protest, there are farmers. As agriculture minister, I am looking at them as farmers. We are holding discussions from an agricultural point of view. My effort is to speak to farmers’ leaders so that we are able to resolve their problems”.In the previous five rounds of talks, he said the government asked the unions’ leaders to share their objections on provisions of the acts, but they could not share clause by clause concerns and therefore the Centre sent a draft proposal suggesting few amendments.On Thursday, Tomar wrote an eight-page open letter to farmers, accusing the Congress and other opposition parties of spreading falsehood about the new farm laws. He appealed to the agitating farmers not to fall prey to these “white lies” and said the Centre was ready to address all their concerns. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-protests-agriculture-minister-tomar-says-informal-talks-on-hoping-to-reach-solution-before-year-ends-186128

18-12-2020||New Delhi||Indian doctors' group from USA delays return to help protesting farmers||A group comprising 20 Indian doctors from the USA has delayed its return to provide medical services at Tikri border, where thousands of farmers have been protesting against the new farm laws for over three weeks now.Svaiman Singh, one of the doctors in the team, said they set up medical camps at Tikri nearly 20 days back and have been attending to the sick farmers since then."Every year we come to India to set up free medical camps to help those in need. This year the people who were most in need are these farmers, so we are here," the cardiologist said."We came to India about three months back for our annual medical camp trip and were scheduled to return in a month's time, but stayed back to offer facilities to the farmers,” he said.Hailing from a farmers' family himself, the doctor said they plan to stay back as long as the farmers need them.He also said they are being helped by doctors in India with all kinds of medical supplies.According to Singh, who has been practising as a doctor in the USA for the last four years, they have been attending to at least 1,500-2,000 patients every day, and the most common ailment bothering the protestors is "stress".“The problem with being stressed is that it reduces your immunity, which is why people in large numbers here are suffering from fever, diarrhoea, and are highly prone to catching the coronavirus,” he said.When asked if they are advising the farmers to wear masks as a preventive measure against COVID-19, Singh explained that most farmers were refusing to wear masks, partly due to ignorance and partly to avoid disruption by miscreants."There is of course ignorance, but most of them are afraid that once they start wearing masks, miscreants will enter the protest wearing similar masks, disrupt it, and escape unidentified."In fact we saw it ourselves that towards the beginning, there was an incident where a person wearing a mask had broken a toilet here,” he said.Currently, Singh and his team from the USA are funding these medical camps from their own pockets, but he is not complaining."We will worry about money when we run out of it, but I am sure ‘humaari jeben kabhi khali nahi hongi' (Our pockets will never be empty). We are here to do 'sewa', and we will do it as long as it is required," he said.Besides the medical camps, Singh's team is also providing cleaning and sanitation services, food supplies, and books for the farmers' children."We are trying to ensure that the protest site is cleaned regularly because inadequate sanitation can cause many diseases," he said.While their main camp is located at the Tikri border, they also have a volunteer team at the Singhu border and are trying to arrange similar provisions at the Ghazipur border as well.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been staying put at several Delhi border points for the last 22 days demanding repeal of three new farm laws introduced by the Central government.Enacted in September, the three laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-doctors-group-from-usa-delays-return-to-help-protesting-farmers-186126
18-12-2020||Lucknow||Police attach property of slain gangster Vikas Dubey's brother in UP||Police on Friday attached property of Deep Prakash Dubey, brother of slain gangster Vikas Dubey, in the Krishna Nagar area here, officials said.Deep Prakash is absconding since the Kanpur ambush and a reward of Rs 50,000 has been declared on his arrest, Station House Officer of Krishna Nagar Mahesh Kumar said."After the permission of the court, we completed formalities of attaching the property (of Deep) in Krishna Nagar on Friday,” Kumar told PTI.Eight policemen were killed in an ambush by gangster Vikas Dubey and his associates on July 3 in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur.

18-12-2020||New Delhi||India, China resolve to work towards complete disengagement||India and China held the 20th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) by video conferencing on Friday after a gap of over two and a half months.  At the meeting, both sides decided that they would continue to work towards ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector at the earliest.They also agreed to hold the next (9th) round of Senior Army Commanders meeting at an early date so that both sides can work towards early and complete disengagement of troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols, and fully restore peace and tranquillity, said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).The Chinese readout said the two sides had “candid and in-depth exchange of views” and agreed on the need to focus on the disengagement of front-line troops and take “concrete measures to deal with the issues on the ground” to further deescalate the border situation.The Chinese side also welcomed the prospects of an early meeting of Senior Army Commanders to “properly deal with the outstanding issues on the ground”, and jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.In an indication of the stalemate that had crept in over resolving the stand-off in eastern Ladakh, there was no meeting of the WMCC all through October and November although in between, two rounds of Senior Army Commanders’ meetings were held on October 12 and November 6.This was further indicative of the fact that in-person meetings between foreign ministers and defence ministers of both countries in Moscow in September did not immediately impact the situation though the Jaishankar-Wang meeting had arrived at a five-point consensus.The Chinese readout referred to this consensus and said both sides agreed to “earnestly implement” it.On Thursday, MEA official spokesperson had said “it is our expectation that the further discussions will help both sides to achieve an agreement on a mutually acceptable solution for ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector and full restoration of peace and tranquillity as early as possible”.Joint Secretary of the East Asia Division of MEA Naveen Srivastava and Director-General of the Department of Boundary and Oceanic Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Hong Liang co-chaired the meeting.Representatives from both countries’ departments related to diplomacy, national defence and interior security attended the meeting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-resolve-to-work-towards-complete-disengagement-186123

18-12-2020||New Delhi||Man held for misappropriating Rs 300 crore loan amount||A 31-year-old man was arrested for allegedly misappropriating funds to the tune of Rs 300 crore availed as loans and credit facilities from various banks and financial institutions, police said on Friday.Vaibhav Sharma, Chief Finance Officer (CFO) of a Gurgaon-based company engaged in car dealership, was arrested on Thursday in connection with a 2018 case registered against him and the other directors of the firm for misappropriation of bank money, they said.An action was taken by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police after an authorised representative of one of the banks alleged that the directors of the alleged company—Rashpal Singh Todd and Mandhir Singh Todd and its CFO Vaibhav Sharma—duped their bank to the tune of Rs 102 crore, police said.In view of sufficient incriminating evidence on record, accused Rashpal Singh Todd and Mandhir Singh Todd were already arrested in this case and charge-sheeted, they added.According to the complainant bank, the accused persons had approached their branch at Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, Delhi, for financial assistance in 2007. The alleged company engaged in dealership of Audi cars had been availing cash credit facility, trade advances etc for demo cars from the bank since 2007. It had also availed term loan, cash credit facility and bank guarantee since 2013 onwards, police said.As per the terms and conditions executed between the bank and the alleged company, the accused persons had to furnish the details pertaining to the utilisation of the funds along with details of the stock which were hypothecated with the bank. The trade advances availed by the alleged company had to be returned within 90 days. Till March 2018, the alleged company had been performing as per the terms and conditions but defaulted later. In June 2018, during an inspection at the showroom of the alleged company, only 29 cars were found against 200 cars, said O P Mishra, Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW).“During the investigation, it further emerged that the accused persons had submitted that their company had availed the financial assistance of Rs 130 crore from other financial institutions including the complainant bank. Vaibhav Sharma had submitted a forged bank statement of J-K Bank for the period between June 1, 2018, to June 19, 2018, wherein the alleged company had availed the OD of Rs 11.64 crore. During investigation of the bank records, it was found that the alleged company had actually availed the OD of Rs 49.51 crore,” he said.The officials of the alleged company have misappropriated the amount to the tune of Rs about 102 crore and accused Sharma had told the complainant bank that the company was in losses during the past four years while the balance sheet of the company showed profits, Mishra said.During further investigation, it emerged that the alleged company has duped other banks and financial institutions to the tune of Rs 300 crore and obtained the credit facilities, trade advances and loans for demo cars, he said, adding the cars were sold without NOCs and the loan amount was misappropriated. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-held-for-misappropriating-rs-300-crore-loan-amount-186111
18-12-2020||New Delhi||Over 4.5 crore people in India will be forced to migrate from homes by 2050 due to climate disasters||Over 4.5 crore people will be forced to migrate from their homes in India by 2050 due to climate disasters including floods, droughts and cyclones, three times more than the present figures, according to a new report.In 2020, the number of people displaced in India is 1.4 crore, it said.The report  ‘Costs of climate inaction: displacement and distress migration’ assessed climate-fuelled displacement and migration across five South Asian countries—Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka—and calculates a devastating likelihood of over 6 crore people being homeless and displaced by 2050 in South Asia alone.It is based on a study conducted by International agencies ActionAid International and Climate Action Network South Asia.Quoting figures, the report claimed that 4.5 crore from India will be forced to migrate from their homes by 2050 due to climate disasters. “Political failure to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius as per the Paris agreement goal is already driving 18 million climate migrants from their homes in 2020,” the report said.The report released on Friday, estimates that climate migration will treble in South Asia alone, a region badly affected by climate disasters, including floods, droughts, typhoons and cyclones.The research was undertaken by Bryan Jones, one of the authors of the inaugural Groundswell Report on internal climate migration in 2018.The report called for strong leadership and ambition from developed countries to cut emissions and support for developing countries to adapt to climate change and recover from climate disasters.      It recommended a holistic approach that places the onus on rich countries to provide support and urges developing countries to scale up efforts to protect people from climate impacts.Harjeet Singh, Global Climate Lead at ActionAid, said, “We are facing melting glaciers in Nepal, rising seas in India and Bangladesh, cyclones and inhospitable temperatures. Climate change is increasingly forcing people to flee their homes in search of safety and new means to provide for their families.”“Rich countries need to take greater responsibility to reduce their emissions and support South Asian countries in cutting emissions and dealing with climate impacts. The human cost of inaction is too high,” he said.The research reveals that in all five countries, women are left dealing with the negative fallout from climate migration. “They are left behind to take care of household chores, agricultural activities, look after children and elderly and manage livestock. Women who migrate to urban settlements are often then forced to take up work in precarious settings where workers’ rights violations are rife,” it said.Sanjay Vashist, Director, Climate Action Network South Asia said, “South Asia is geographically vulnerable to climate disasters and is regularly lashed with floods and cyclones, but poverty and environmental injustice are also determining factors in this climate migration crisis.“South Asian leaders must join forces and prepare plans for the protection of displaced people. They must step up and invest in universal and effective social protection measures, resilience plans and green infrastructure to respond to the climate crisis and help those who have been forced to move,” he said.

18-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Laws not introduced overnight; if farmers have doubt, govt will dispel it: Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 18In his strongest attack against the Opposition parties on the farmers’ agitation to date, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday strongly defended the farm laws, which are at the core of ongoing farmer protests, and slammed his rivals for “spreading lies” about them “because his government had done what they had been promising to farmers for years but never gave”.“These laws were not made overnight. Over the last 20 to 30 years, every government and state has discussed these in detail. Farmer groups, agricultural experts, economists, scientists and progressive farmers have called for these reforms. Parties opposing these laws today promised these reforms in their manifestos,” he said addressing the Kisan Kalyan event in Madhya Pradesh, a part of the government’s outreach to farmers amid protests on Delhi borders.Urging the political parties to “stop telling lies and misguiding farmers”, the PM said it had been six to seven months since the laws were implemented but now suddenly his rivals were trying to plough political land through a web of lies.“I request all political parties with folded hands, please keep all the credit. I don’t want it. I am giving credit to all your old election manifestos. I just want ease in the life of farmers…I want their progress and want progress in the agriculture sector.”Talking of the various benefits, including the increased MSP on various foodgrain and the number of beneficiaries, the Prime Minister said: “There is no scope for lies in the laws and the intentions of his government were as pure as Gangajal and the waters of Narmada”.“Those who do could not give farmers MSP properly, are today spreading lies about MSP, the APMC mandis and contract farming. No ‘mandi’ has been closed for past six months, then why are they spreading lies? There is no connection of land in the contract then why are they misleading the farmers?” Modi said.“Beware of these who are trying to mislead you on what has not happened nor is going to happen. I want to tell the farmers with all humility and with folded hands that if still they have issues, we can call them.  The Swaminathan Commission report is the biggest proof of how ruthless these people can be. These people sat on the Swaminathan Commission report recommendations for eight long years. They ensured that their government does not have to spend much on farmers, so they kept report under wraps,” he said.“If we had to remove the MSP, why would we implement the Swaminathan Commission report,” he questioned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/laws-not-introduced-overnight-if-farmers-have-doubt-govt-will-dispel-it-modi-186101

The men came to us again and this time one of them had the audacity to talk to me and my sister," she said."Trying to get closer as he spoke, he wanted to know the names of the movies I have been a part of. We told him to mind his own business and leave. When my mom walked towards us they left," she said.The Women's Commission chairperson M C Josephine condemned the incident.Taking the case up on its own, the Commission said it would meet the actress on Saturday to take her statement.Launching a probe into the incident, Kochi city police said they have collected the CCTV footage.

18-12-2020||New Delhi||IIM Ahmedabad not just had founding fathers but a founding mother too||That the premier Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) had three founding fathers—nuclear scientist Vikram Sarabhai, industrial Kasturbhai Lalbhai and former Gujarat chief minister Jivraj Mehta—is well-documented.What was not known until today is that the institute also had a founding mother, who, new research now shows, could not become the Director due to “sexism.”Kamla Chowdhry was IIMA’s first faculty member and a coordinator of programmes at the school between 1962 and 1965.Her colleagues remember how she was the de-facto director of IIMA as Sarabhai, the Honorary Director, was rarely around for routine matters.“But sexism played a defining role in Kamla Chowdhry’s professional life almost certainly barring her from becoming the first director of the institute she helped found. Now new archival evidence is showing that she was more central to the IIMA project than has ever been publicly acknowledged,” says Chinmay Tumbe, economics faculty at IIMA, whose extensive work, published on Chowdhry’s birth centenary yesterday resurrects the obscure scholar.Born in Lahore to a Punjabi Khatri family, Chowdhry studied MA in Philosophy from Punjab University in 1943, later pursuing a doctorate in social psychology at the Michigan University in 1949.After IIMA was founded in December 1961 as a public-private partnership between the government of India, Gujarat government, local industrialists and the Ford Foundation, Sarabhai helped Chowdhry bag a research position at Harvard Business School (HBS) which was to later become a collaborative institute for IIM A.Chowdhry went on to practically run the IIMA for years, recruiting faculty, convening faculty meetings and even selecting furniture.What’s stark is this — in 1962, the year IIMA's administrative office started functioning, its institutional partner Harvard Business School didn’t even admit women into its MBA programme.And yet Kamla Chowdhry’s wings remained clipped beyond a point.“In spite of the full backing of Sarabhai and Prakash Tandon, chairman of IIMA’s board of governors at the time, Dr. Kamla Chowdhry never became full-time Director of IIMA. As de facto director and senior-most faculty, she was the top contender for the post. But a peculiar circumstance put paid to that prospect,” Tumbe says.His researcher reveals how over 1963 and 1964, a doctoral student from HBS, deputed to IIMA, wrote a series of letters against Kamla to Harry Hansen, then director of the IIMA project in Boston, saying, “Only if it becomes absolutely necessary should we talk about blocking Dr. Chowdhry, but whatever we do, we must see to it that she does not become Director, or for that matter Deputy-Director, or any other high administrative position.”Tumbe says it is very likely that this correspondence added to the misgivings HBS faculty may have had about Kamla Chowdhry’s leadership abilities.“Chowdhry was widely (and accurately) seen to be close to Sarabhai, and all communication to him tended to be routed through her. But Sarabhai himself was rarely around, and his absence, in effect, gave Chowdhry powers that were often misconstrued. HBS effectively vetoed Chowdhry out of contention,” reveals the author.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iim-ahmedabad-not-just-had-founding-fathers-but-a-founding-mother-too-186097

18-12-2020||Chandigarh||Kargil veteran speaks about his book on war experience||The stories of the men who have fought wars must be recorded for posterity so that the new generation of officers learn from their experiences, do not repeat the mistakes and write history with more blood, said Kargil war veteran Brig US Bawa (retd) on Friday.Stating this while speaking about his recently published book, 'Mashkoh – Kargil As I Saw It', Brig Bawa (retd) said that the focus of the book is on identifying the mistakes committed during the conflict.“Each and every citizen should know about how the war was fought and the sacrifices made by the soldiers,” he said.“Generally battalion histories are relegated to the museums and archives, but everyone should know about it. The book also details the problems faced by soldiers and their families after the war,” he added.Brig Bawa had commanded 17 Jat during the Kargil conflict. He was decorated with the Vir Chakra for gallantry. His unit had been tasked to capture Pimple Complex, part of Point 4875 in Mashkoh Valley adjoining Dras.On why he chose to write the book, he said, “There is a very eventful point in everyone’s life and in my life, it was the Kargil war. Though it gave me and by uint a lot of awards and fame, it also made me sad on losing my men.”The book tells the stories of bravery, humour, emotions, tragic losses and hard-won victories in extremely challenging high-altitude terrain of the Kargil sector along the Line of Control in northern Jammu and Kashmir, he said.Maj Gen Amarjit Singh (retd) said that very few books on military operations have been written by men who have fought a battle and faced bullets.Brig Bawa said the book is based on first hand, experience, emotions and ground incidents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kargil-veteran-speaks-about-his-book-on-war-experience-186092
18-12-2020||Satya Prakash||SC issues notice to Mamata govt against petitions alleging foisting of false FIRs against BJP workers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 18The Supreme Court on Friday issued a notice to the West Bengal government on petitions filed by BJP leaders Arjun Singh, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Pawan Singh, Sourav Singh and Mukul Roy challenging filing of “false FIRs” against the saffron party’s workers by the state police in the run up to assembly elections early next year.A Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul orders that no coercive steps should be taken against the petitioners till next date of hearing.The petitioners alleged that as many as 64 false criminal cases had been filed against the BJP leaders and workers in West Bengal. Many of them faced FIRs after they left the ruling TMC and joined the BJP.The order came after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi submitted that BJP leaders were being prevented from entering West Bengal and they feared being arrested.“I will not be able to do election duty. The election is in February or March,” Rohatgi argued.The top court directed the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to submit a copy of the report on the alleged scuffle between the TMC workers and the CISF Special Security Group security personnel given to advocate and BJP spokesperson Kabir Shankar Bose.Asking the MHA submit the report in a sealed cover, the top court posted the case for further hearing in January 2021.On behalf of Bose, Jethmalani submitted: “I am a person with the CISF (SSG) protection which is granted only after IB inputs of threat. I have been attacked and assaulted. I was attacked in the face of the CISF (SSG) protection.”Accusing the West Bengal police of filing dozens of false FIRs against the BJP leaders in the state due to political vendetta, the petitioners demanded transfer of probe from the state police to any other investigating agency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-mamata-govt-against-petitions-alleging-foisting-of-false-firs-against-bjp-workers-186091
18-12-2020||New Delhi||SC rejects challenge to election of Dhiraj Prasad Sahu as Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand||The Supreme Court on Friday rejected the challenge to the election of Congress leader Dhiraj Prasad Sahu as a Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand in 2018.The apex court dismissed the appeal filed by the BJP candidate, who had lost the poll from the state, challenging the verdict of the Jharkhand High Court which had rejected the plea against Sahu's election.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde said the vote cast by then MLA Amit Kumar Mahto, who was convicted by a trial court on the date of voting for Rajya Sabha poll on March 23, 2018, was valid.The top court said Mahto had cast the vote before the trial court's verdict.The high court had delivered its judgement on January 17 this year and dismissed the election petition filed by Pradeep Kumar Sonthalia, who was a BJP candidate in the 2018 Rajya Sabha poll from Jharkhand, challenging Sahu's election as a member of the upper house.The BJP leader, in his appeal filed in the apex court, had challenged the part of high court's verdict which had rejected his plea and observed that he had neither made a prayer for recounting of votes nor the Election Commission of India was made a party."The high court has gravely erred in denying the relief to the appellant (Sonthalia) on the premises that no prayer has been made for recounting of the votes and Election Commission of India has not been made party in the case," the plea had said.The plea had said that a notification was issued by Election Commission in February 2018 for Rajya Sabha election on two seats in Jharkhand and on March 12, Sonthalia had filed his nomination as a BJP candidate.Besides Sonthalia, two others -- Samir Oraon from BJP and Dheeraj Prasad Sahu from Congress -- also filed their nominations for the two seats.The plea had said that Mahto was convicted on March 23, 2018 by a trial court in a criminal case and order on sentence was pronounced on the same day in the second half and he was sentenced to two years.It said that before declaration of result of Rajya Sabha poll, Sonthalia had made an objection in writing that Mahto was convicted and sentenced for two years so his vote should be declared invalid.The plea said the returning officer declared Samir Oraon and Dheeraj Prasad Sahu to be elected as Rajya Sabha members from Jharkhand on March 24.Sonthalia had said that the returning officer had rejected his objection with regard to validity of Mahto's vote on grounds that he had not received the judgement of conviction till the declaration of result.He had filed an election petition before the high court on March 28, 2018 and submitted that if Mahto's vote was held to be invalid as a result of his disqualification, then he would have been elected.

I wil not want to be party to death by committee," he said.The operative part of the APMC or the farming contract laws, he said, was barely of four pages. "When the government says it is willing to make amendments to 12 of the 14 or 15 points of criticism the farmers have levelled against them, it is accepting how seriously flawed these laws are. It seems pointless to amend 80-90 per cent of such fatally flawed documents (which many, including serious legal minds, are calling unconstitutional). These are sweeping bits of legislation by the Centre on what is, under the Constitution, a state subject. Can you amend unconstitutional laws--no, you withdraw them," he said.The greatest panel ever set up on farming, the one that produced the closest thing to a blueprint for Indian agriculture for coming decades, was the Swaminathan Commission (or more accurately, the National Commission on Farmers) report. The kind of expertise, talent and understanding that panel had remains unrivalled and it worked for years not only in its research, but also on the basis of wide and massive consultation. "And yet its reports are lying untouched and undiscussed in Parliament for 16 years. It would be an excellent step if the court advises the government to have that report discussed in Parliament and set up a panel to oversee its speedy implementation," he said.Sainath also asked to call for special session of Parliament on agrarian crisis. "From 2018, some of us have been saying the crisis has gone beyond the agrarian and run berserk. We need a special session of Parliament to discuss the agrarian crisis and related issues. I believe that the need for this is now greater than ever before. And note that the farmers of this country have also been calling for a special session."If that happens, I believe India should inaugurate a practice in our Parliament that is quite common in the legislatures of some democracies--a system of public hearings. Let those who have suffered the crisis most also speak for themselves on the floor of Parliament in such public hearings," he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/p-sainath-calls-agri-laws-unconstitutional-says-farmers-right-in-demanding-their-repeal-186078
18-12-2020||New Delhi||Vaccination for COVID-19 will be voluntary: Health ministry||Getting vaccinated for COVID-19 will be voluntary, the Union Health Ministry has said while underlining that the vaccine introduced in India will be as effective as any vaccine developed by other countries.The ministry further stated that it was advisable to receive a complete schedule of the anti-coronavirus vaccine irrespective of the past history of infection with COVID-19 as this will help in developing a strong immune response against the disease. It also said that a protective level of antibodies generally develops two weeks after receiving the second dose. The ministry listed a series of frequently asked questions (FAQs) on COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday night and responded to questions like if taking a vaccine was mandatory, how long does it take for the antibodies to develop and if it was necessary for a COVID recovered person to take the vaccine."Vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of the vaccine for protecting oneself against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the close contacts including family members, friends, relatives and co-workers," the ministry said in response to a question on if it is mandatory to take the shot.The ministry said that vaccine trials are under different stages of finalisation. The government is geared to launch a vaccine for COVID-19 soon, it said. Six vaccines- one developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR, second one developed by Zydus Cadila, the third one by Gennova,  Oxford vaccine, the trial of which is conducted by Serum Institute of India,  Sputnik V vaccine which is being manufactured by Dr Reddy's Lab, Hyderabad, in collaboration with Russia's Gamaleya National Centre and the sixth one manufactured by Biological E Ltd, Hyderabad, in collaboration with MIT, USA are undergoing clinical trials in India.On whether a vaccine will be safe as it is being tested and introduced in a short span of time and what can be the possible side-effects, the ministry said vaccines will be introduced in the country only after the regulatory bodies clear it based on its safety and efficacy.   "COVID-19 vaccine will be introduced only when the safety is proven. As is true for other vaccines, the common side effects in some individuals could be a mild fever, pain, etc. at the site of injection," the ministry said in the FAQs.It said states have been asked to start making arrangements to deal with any vaccine-related side-effects as one of the measures towards safe vaccine delivery.Two doses of vaccine, 28 days apart, need to be taken by an individual to complete the vaccination schedule, it stated.  The ministry said anyone taking medicines for illnesses like cancer, diabetes, hypertension etc, can take the COVID-19 vaccine as persons with one or more of these comorbid conditions are considered high-risk category and they need to get the vaccination.In response to a question on whether the vaccine will be given to everyone simultaneously, the ministry said that based on the potential availability of vaccines, the government has selected priority groups to be vaccinated as they are at higher risk. In the initial phase, COVID 19 vaccine will be provided to the priority group- health care and front-line workers. The 50 plus age group may also begin early based on vaccine availability. The eligible beneficiaries will be informed through their registered mobile number regarding the health facility where the vaccination will be provided and the scheduled time. This will be done to avoid any inconvenience in registration and vaccination of beneficiaries, the ministry said in the FAQs.On why healthcare providers and frontline workers are being chosen for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, the ministry said the government has prioritised the most at-risk/high risk groups which will get the vaccine first. Healthcare providers have led the battle against COVID-19 from the front. The government wants them to be able to continue your work, without the fear of risk associated with the virus. "Therefore, healthcare and frontline workers are among the first group of people to be vaccinated,"' it said.The ministry said registration of a beneficiary is mandatory for vaccination for COVID-19. Only after registration the information on the session site to visit and time will be shared.Following online registration, the beneficiary will receive SMS on their registered mobile number on the due date, place and time of vaccination. ID with Photo such as driving license, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) job card, PAN Card, passbooks issued by Bank/Post Office, passport • Pension Document, service identity card issued to employees by Central/ State Govt./ Public Limited Companies and voter ID may be produced at the time of registration.On getting a due dose of vaccine, the beneficiary will receive SMS on their registered mobile number. After all doses of vaccine are administered, a QR code-based certificate will also be sent to the registered mobile number of the beneficiary, the ministry said.On preventive measures and precautions, the ministry said, "We request you to rest at the vaccination centre for at least half an hour after taking the COVID-19 vaccine. "Inform the nearest health authorities/ANM/ASHA in case you feel any discomfort or uneasiness subsequently. Remember to continue following key COVID Appropriate Behaviours like wearing of a mask, maintaining hand sanitization and physical distance," it added.

18-12-2020||---||Allow access to war histories and records, says former J&K Governor Vohra||New Delhi, Dec 18Former Governor of Jammu and Kashmir NN Vohra on Friday made a strong pitch to make public the histories of war fought by the Indian armed forces, saying reading these would help the younger generation of soldiers.Vohra, a former Punjab cadre IAS officer who was Defence Secretary (March 1990 to April 1993) of the country, was speaking at the inaugural session of the fourth Military Literature Festival. The annual event was conducted virtually from Chandigarh this year.Vohra said we had unfortunately not allowed access to documents, and had been secretive and confidential. He gave the example of his three-year tenure as Defence Secretary, saying, “We finalised the military histories of wars in 1948, 1962, and 1971; when we tried to get them published, there was enormous opposition and could not be published.”Experience of war and combat if not recorded well in time, and was not made available to cadets in military academies, or in institutes such as the National Defence College, the younger generation would not be able to learn from it.The nation, he said, had been guilty of not allowing certain reports such as the one by Henderson Brookes on the 1962 India-China war to be made available. These could at least be used for military for learning. He suggested that after 30 years a document could be made available in an archival repository and scholars be allowed to go and examine those with prior permission. This could be done in case putting the document in public domain was not okay.Vohra went on to commend the plethora of writings in newspapers and journals, saying it showed commendable insight of officers of the services. There was an intertwining in matters civil and military; it would lead towards national strength and strong foundations.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who was also present at the virtual session, commended the forces for the 1971 war victory, saying we were celebrating the golden jubilee of the victory.He lavished praise on the experience of the veterans, asking young people to learn from retired soldiers, instead of playing ‘war linked’ games on mobiles. The veterans were like living institutions.(Also read: Salute to reservoir of military might)He asked the organisers to devote the next year’s theme to cyber war and tackling misinformation campaigns. The enemy, he said, could reach our people through mobile phones.The Governor of Punjab and Administrator of Chandigarh, VP Singh Badnore, said the festival was unique in its fabric. Chandigarh, he said, was the most appropriate venue to conduct the festival.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allow-access-to-war-histories-and-records-says-former-jk-governor-vohra-186072

18-12-2020||New Delhi||SC directs states to carry out fire safety audit of dedicated Covid hospitals||The Supreme Court on Friday asked all states and union territories to constitute a committee in each district to carry out a monthly fire audit of each COVID hospital, inform the deficiency to the hospital management and report to the Government for taking follow up action.“All States/Union Territories should appoint one nodal officer for each COVID hospital, if not already appointed, who shall be made responsible for ensuring the compliance of all fire safety measures, said a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan---which had earlier taken suo motu cognisance of a Rajkot hospital fire accident that claimed six lives. “The COVID hospitals which have not obtained NOC from the fire department of the State should be asked to immediately apply for NOC and after carrying necessary inspection, a decision shall be taken,” the court said.It said COVID hospitals which have not renewed their NOC should immediately take steps for renewal and those found not having NOC or not having obtained renewal will face appropriate action. The top court asked the government to devise a mechanism to give rotational breaks to doctors and healthcare professionals working continuously since April.  “They (doctors, nurses etc.) are already exhausted physically and mentally due to tireless work for eight months. Some mechanism may be required to give them intermittent rest,” it said.The top court also asked states and UTs to issue necessary directions to ensure compliance of the Election Commission’s guidelines for conduct of General Elections/Bye-Elections during Covid-19 to ensure safety of people in general from the pandemic.Noting that despite the Guidelines and SOPs issued, the pandemic has spread like wildfire for lack of proper implementation, the court reiterated that its directions on Covid norms must be implemented. "A strict and stern action should be taken against those who are violating the Guidelines and SOPs, whoever he may be and whatever position the violator is occupying," it said. Asking states to act vigilantly and to work with the Centre harmoniously, the court said, "It is the time to rise to the occasion. Safety and health of the citizens must be the first priority, rather than any other considerations." It said, "People should understand their duty and follow rules very strictly. It is the duty of every citizen to perform their fundamental duties as guaranteed under the Constitution." "Due to unprecedented pandemic, everybody in the world is suffering, one way or the other. It is a world war against COVID-19. Therefore, there shall be Government Public Partnership to avoid world war against COVID-19," the Bench said. Those not following Covid Guidelines/SOPs cannot be permitted to play with the lives of the others and to infringe the rights (such as right to health) of other citizens, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-directs-states-to-carry-out-fire-safety-audit-of-dedicated-covid-hospitals-186069
18-12-2020||New Delhi||SC issues contempt notices to comedian Kunal Kamra, Rachita Taneja||The Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra and comic artist Rachita Taneja on separate petitions seeking initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against them for scandalising the judiciary.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan asked them to respond to the petitions in six weeks and explain why criminal contempt proceedings shouldn't be initiated against them.The petitions against Kamra and Taneja were filed after attorney General KK Venugopal gave his consent to initiate criminal contempt of court proceedings against both the comic artists.They had allegedly insinuated the Supreme Court after it gave bail to Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami in an abetment to suicide case.Terming Kamra's tweets as "highly objectionable", Venugopal had said in his opinion it "constitutes criminal contempt of court."The tweets were not only in bad taste but clearly crossed the line between humour and contempt of court, the Attorney General had noted.In one of his tweets, Kamra showed the Supreme Court in saffron colour with a BJP flag in place of the Tricolour. He tweeted that honour had left the building (Supreme Court) long back and it was "the most supreme joke of the country". He also made nasty comments about a sitting Supreme Court judge.Taneja had circulated a caricature that allegedly depicted a quid pro quo relationship between the judiciary and the government with regard to the Ayodhya verdict. She had also allegedly insinuated the top court for giving bail to TV journalist Arnab Goswami.The consent of either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General is necessary, under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, for initiating contempt proceedings against a person in the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-contempt-notices-to-comedian-kunal-kamra-rachita-taneja-186064

Encroaching on the rights of states by attempting to transfer police officers to Centre just before elections, is an assault on federalism and an attempt to destabilize," Kejriwal tweeted.The three IPS officers were responsible for the security of Nadda whose convoy was attacked during his recent visit to the state scheduled for Assembly polls in 2021.The Centre wants them shifted on account of alleged dereliction of duty that led to the attack on Nadda's convoy in Diamond Harbour constituency of TMC MP and Banerjee's nephew Abhishek Banerjee.       The West Bengal Chief Minister has slammed the Centre saying the move, particularly before the elections is against the basic tenets of the federal structure. It's "unconstitutional" and completely unacceptable, she has said.

18-12-2020||Mau (Uttar Pradesh)||Ancient Buddha, coins found in expressway digging in UP||A mound being dug up for the Purvanchal Expressway near the Mahpur village in Mau district has thrown up a Buddha's head and a coin board, reportedly dating back to the Kushan period.State archaeology directorate's Varanasi regional officer, Subhash Chandra, who paid a visit to the site on Thursday, told reporters, "On inspecting the site and after taking a look at the material unearthed including pottery, terracotta pieces, bricks and coins, the antiquity can be pegged from third Century BC to 12 Century AD. This means that the historical landscape of the place covers layers of Maurya, Sunga, Kushan, Gupta and subsequent rulers."Chandra has recommended in his report to the state culture department, that the material be handed over to a museum while a part of it may be used for scientifically establishing its age. He has also urged the government to commission a detailed project for the area.Apart from Buddha head and coins, terracotta artefacts including pottery were also found during digging on December 13.A local Buddhist committee, Buddhankur Bhimjyoti Samiti, has also written to the state government and Archaeological Survey of India to save the place.A member of the Samiti said, "About 15 years ago some coins and figurines were recovered from another side of the mound. We had sought the government's protection for the heritage site but nothing happened. Now this second incident has strengthened the belief that the place is archaeologically important. Thus, we have reiterated our demand." Asked to comment on the antiquity of the place, Chandra said, "The place has been excavated several times. The initial work was undertaken by the British. Thereafter, Rahul Sankritayan drew inspiration from the site. Several research papers and doctorates may also be linked to the place. In short, the place is an archaeologically rich site without a doubt." Meanwhile, District Magistrate Amit Bansal has stopped the digging work and has asked officials to demarcate the place.He also instructed preparation of an inventory of the material obtained and place it in safe custody.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ancient-buddha-coins-found-in-expressway-digging-in-up-186049

We have been extending our support to them through various protests but today's hunger strike has been undertaken to express solidarity on behalf of the Secular Progressive Alliance," Stalin, also Tamil Nadu Leader of Opposition, said in his address.The DMK-led coalition in the state is known as the Secular Progressive Alliance and had faced the 2019 Lok Sabha polls under this banner.Lashing out at the BJP-led Centre, Stalin questioned the “haste” in enacting the laws during the COVID-19 pandemic and also hit out at the union government over its labour reforms and the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) among others.The government was not standing by the people but corporates, he alleged, and charged the Centre with offering a slew of sops to big private firms."Today, the entire country is in a boil against these three (farm) laws...farmers are staying put in Delhi with their families despite the harsh winter and are opposing the legislations as these are totally against agriculture," he said.The government should have consulted stakeholders, including farmers, before enacting the laws or had discussions in Parliament to “safeguard democracy”, he said."The Central government did not do any of these. What is the haste? To protect whom have they brought these laws? They should clarify these before people," the DMK chief demanded.Stalin termed as "drama" the Centre's talks with representatives of the protesting farmers and pointed out that the farmers wanted nothing less than a repeal of the laws and not any amendments to the acts.He also took objection to the protesters being "branded by the government as anti-nationals, foreign agents, Maoists..."The DMK and its allies supported the farmers' demand for repealing of the laws, he said and asserted, "Our protests will continue till then."Besides Stalin, party MP Kanimozhi, alliance party leaders - Vaiko of MDMK, former TNCC president KV Thangkabalu and those from the CPI, CPI (M) and VCK participated in the protest here.A two-minute silence was observed at the protest site for farmers who have died so far during the protests near Delhi.Meanwhile, in neighbouring Puducherry, Chief Minister Naryanasamy, leaders from Congress, the Left parties and VCK observed a fast at Odiansalai.The Chief Minister told reporters that the Centre had brought in the controversial laws which would "harm farmers and help corporates".He appealed to the Centre to immediately repeal the laws and protect agriculture.Separately, DMK legislators R Siva, K Venkatesan and former education minister SP Sivakumar and members of different wings of the party went on a hunger strike at Tirukanoor village.

The satellite is functioning “very well”, ISRO Chairman K Sivan said.The solar panels of the satellite, a crucial operation, have been deployed, he said, addressing scientists from the Mission Control Centre.“I am extremely happy to declare that PSLV-C50 successfully injected CMS-01 communication satellite precisely into the predefined sub-Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). In another four days from now, the satellite will be placed into the specified slot into the GTO,” he said.Sivan said the satellite was going to function as a replacement for communication satellite GSAT-12, which was launched 11 years ago. CMS-01 will have a lifespan of over seven years, according to ISRO. Congratulating the space agency's launch and satellite vehicle teams, the chairman said, “I am sure that this satellite will be doing all the functions as planned successfully.”Outlining ISRO'S future missions — Chandrayaan-3, flagship mission Aditya L-1 and Gaganyaan — he said they were planning to have missions at the earliest.These included the much awaited GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle) and SSLV (Small Satellite Launch Vehicle) missions.“Series of missions are on hand and as usual team ISRO will rise to the occasion..,” he said. PSLV-C50 is the 22nd flight of PSLV in ‘XL’ configuration (equipped with six strap-on motors), and it was the 77th launch vehicle mission from Sriharikota, about 120 km from Chennai. It follows the successful launch of PSLV-C49 (EOS-01) earth observation satellite and nine customer spacecraft on November 7 which was ISRO's first mission of the year amid Covid. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/42nd-communication-satellite-cms-01-placed-in-orbit-by-isro-185816

The panel can disagree but the fact that the chairman does not permit a member to speak is a sad comment on how the government handles military affairs. I urge you to intervene and ensure discussions held in the defence committee are in consonance with the role and objective of the institution and that the right of elected MPs to speak freely is protected.”Information Minister Prakash Javadekar earlier today hit out at Rahul saying committees are not sites of protest. “Rahul Gandhi has attended only two of the 14 meetings of the parliamentary standing committee on defence in the last year and a half. He is himself absent and then blames the government and procedures and walks out of the meeting in protest. Standing committee isn’t a protest site,” said Javadekar.Rahul and others had left a meeting where a presentation was made on the rank structure, uniforms, badges and honours of the Armed Forces – an agenda finalised in the last committee meeting to help panel members appreciate rank structures and equivalence.Amarinder Singh defended Rahul saying “I feel ashamed that committees have reached this level. I am shocked that the committee was discussing the type of polish to be used for buttons on the armed forces uniform instead of finding ways to counter the joint China-Pakistan threat. Rahul Gandhi rightly walked out of this mockery.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-slams-cong-mps-for-walkout-capt-amarinder-defends-rahul-185817

18-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers have the right to protest peacefully: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to interfere with the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the recent farm laws, saying it was their fundamental right.“We are of the view that at this stage the farmers’ protest should be allowed to continue without impediment and without any breach of peace by either the protesters or the police,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said during a hearing on petitions seeking removal of protesting farmers from Delhi roads.Read also:Babaji was upset since his first visit to Singhu, says close associate Tomar’s 8-page open letter to farmersAgriculture Minister NS Tomar on Thursday wrote an eight-page open letter to farmers, reiterating benefits of the three farm laws, urging them “with folded hands” to consider the facts. He said the govt was ready to give a written assurance on MSP.“We clarify that this court will not interfere with the protest in question. Indeed, the right to protest is part of a fundamental right and can as a matter of fact be exercised subject to public order. There can certainly be no impediment in the exercise of such rights as long as it is non-violent and does not result in damage to the life and properties of other citizens..,” the Bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, noted.Harish Salve, who represented one of the petitioners, argued that no right was absolute, “not even the right to free speech... One can’t hold a city to ransom...” He wanted the court to direct the police to ensure that life in Delhi was not affected by the farmers’ blockade. However, the Bench said it could not pass such an order without hearing the farm organisations. To end the stalemate between the farmers and the government, the Bench decided to constitute a committee of independent and impartial persons, including agriculture experts. However, it said, “This may not be possible without hearing all the necessary parties. Till the parties come before us, it would be advisable to obtain suggestions about the constitution of the said committee from all the parties.” Posting the matter for hearing after the winter vacation, the Bench gave liberty to the parties to move the vacation Bench, if necessary. It also posted petitions challenging the validity of the farm laws after the winter break. The top court sought to know from the Centre if it was ready to defer implementation of the farm laws.“Can the Union say no executive action will be taken under the laws in order to facilitate negotiations”, it asked Attorney General KK Venugopal, who said he would seek instructions even as Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta remarked: “It will be tough.”On behalf of the Punjab Government, senior advocateP Chidambaram said the farmers wanted to march to Delhi were stopped. “The farmers didn’t block any road. The police did it... We want Parliament to convene and MPs to discuss the issue. The state has no objection to court’s suggestion that a group of people can facilitate a dialogue between farmers and the Centre,” he said. Venugopal expressed concern over violation of Covid-19 guidelines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-have-the-right-to-protest-peacefully-supreme-court-185766
18-12-2020||New Delhi||Repeal farm laws: Economists to Tomar||Several economists in a letter to Union Agriculture Minister NS Tomar have expressed serious concern over the recent farm Acts. They agreed with the need for improvement in the agri marketing system but claimed these Acts did not serve that purpose as the laws were based on wrong assumptions.The economists gave five reasons why the three Acts were fundamentally harmful for the small farmers. First, they said, overriding states’ role in regulating agricultural markets was a flawed approach because the local machinery was more accessible and accountable to the farmers. Second, the Acts created a practically unregulated market in the ‘trade area’ parallel with the APMC market yards. While there were mechanisms in regulated APMC markets to prevent market manipulation, there was none in the unregulated ‘trade areas’.Third, daily auctions at the APMC market yards set the benchmark prices. Without these, fragmented markets could pave the way for local monopolies, as in Bihar after the repeal of its APMC Act in 2006.Fourth, the huge asymmetry between the small farmers and companies would lead to unwritten arrangements with no recourse for farmers. Fifth, the consolidation of agri value chains would lead to the “get-big-or-get-out’’ dynamic as in other countries, pushing out the small farmers, small traders and local agri-businesses. Therefore, amending a few clauses would not be enough to address farmers’ concerns.Among the signatories are Prof Rajinder Chaudhary and Prof Surinder Kumar (ex MDU, Rohtak), Prof RS Ghuman (Prof of Eminence, GNDU, Amritsar), Prof Kamal Nayan Kabra (ex Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi), Prof D Narasimha Reddy (ex Univ of Hyderabad), Prof KN Harilal, (Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram,) Prof Arun Kumar (Institute of Social Sciences), ProfR Ramakumar (Tata Institute of Social Sciences) and Prof Vikas Rawal and Prof Himanshu (JNU). — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/repeal-farm-laws-economists-to-tomar-185767
