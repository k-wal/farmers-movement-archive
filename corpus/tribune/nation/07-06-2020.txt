07-06-2020||New Delhi||CBSE exam results by Aug 15, govt to consider opening schools after August||Union Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank has said CBSE board results can be declared by August 15. The results of both class 10 and 12 will be declared at an interval of just a few days.However, the decision to open schools will be taken after August keeping in mind the current COVID-19 situation. At present, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has not set any date for reopening schools.Nishank said during a discussion: “We hope that the results of both 10th and 12th classes will be declared by August 15. These include the results of previous exams and the results of examinations in July.”On the issue of reopening of schools, Nishank said “after August the process of opening schools will be started.” A final decision in this regard will be taken only after assessing the prevailing conditions. According to the HRD ministry, after August, new sessions will also start in universities.Meanwhile, the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi has also written to the HRD ministry on the subject of reopening schools. Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia said in the letter, “Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said some time ago that we have to learn to live with coronavirus. So it would be better to open schools with proper safety measures.”Sisodia said: "First of all, we have to assure every child that they are important to us. Everyone has equal rights over the physical and intellectual environment of his school. Education cannot progress beyond online classes only. It would be impossible to pursue education only by calling older children to school and keeping younger children at home."Several private schools have also suggested measures to the HRD ministry to open schools and safety in schools during this period. However, the ministry is not in a hurry to reopen schools at present. According to senior officials of the ministry, at present, preparations are being made to conduct the remaining board exams of class 10 and 12 between July 1 and 15.After the examinations, the first priority is to declare the results. Only then can the process of reopening school colleges begin. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-exam-results-by-aug-15-govt-to-consider-opening-schools-after-august-95905
07-06-2020||New Delhi||Malls, hotels, religious places set to reopen on Monday amid uptick in COVID-19 cases||A token system for regulated entry and no physical offerings like ‘prasad’ will be some of the norms as shopping malls, religious places, hotels and restaurants are set to reopen in most states from Monday after over two months that could pose new challenges to check the spread of the coronavirus.As India prepares for a calibrated exit from the lockdown by easing more restrictions, ‘Unlock-1 -- the first of the three-phase plan for reopening of prohibited activities in non-containment zones with a stringent set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) -- kicks in at a time when the country recorded a daily jump of COVID-19 cases by over 9,000 for the fifth straight day on Sunday. The SOPs will be in place till June 30.India registered its highest single-day spike of 9,971 new infections taking the total to 2,46,628 and 287 deaths in the 24 hours since Saturday morning, the Union Health Ministry said. The death toll stood at 6,929, it said.The number of active COVID-19 cases stands at 1,20,406 while a total of 1,19,292 people had recovered and one patient has migrated, the ministry added. Around 48.37 per cent of the patients have recovered so far, a senior ministry official said.The new phase is especially challenging for the five worst affected states, accounting for nearly 70 per cent of the total confirmed coronavirus cases, and nearly 78 per cent of the deaths.Maharashtra(85,975 cases),Tamil Nadu(30,152), Delhi(27,654), Gujarat (20,097) and Rajasthan (10,331) were the five worst affected states while Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh inched towards the 10,000 mark.There also has been an uptick in cases in states like West Bengal which recorded the highest single-day spike for the third day in a row with 449 cases taking the tally to 8,187. Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir also registered a record daily rise.A visit to the shopping malls, hotels and restaurants and religious places will no longer be the same like before the lockdown imposed on March 25 after the Union Health Ministry issued the SOPs for strict adherence to contain the spread of COVID-19.In the malls, cinema halls, gaming arcades and children play areas will continue to be in the prohibited segment.The SOPs are advisory in nature and the Centre has left it to the states to finetune the details.The Punjab government for example provides for a token-based entry to malls as part of its guidelines.In Gujarat, some of the religious places have decided to organise prayers in shifts and even start a token system to specify time slots to devotees for visits in a bid to maintain social distancing and avoid crowding.Malls in Delhi will be focussing on hourly disinfection of the common areas, contact-less shopping and physical distancing, according to some of the mall owners. There are around 100 big and small shopping malls in the national capital.Several malls have set up ultraviolet (UV) sterilisation chambers for the patrons to disinfect their belongings.“We have asked our staff to report an hour before the malls are opened for the public. After the mandatory screening, the employees will be given face-shields, gloves and sanitiser,” said Harsh Vardhan Bansal, the director of Vegas Mall in Dwarka.In line with the central guidelines, the Karnataka government has specified conditions such as social distancing, no distribution of ‘teertha’ (holy water) or ‘prasada’, no ringing of temple bells for devotees and a bar on special ‘pooja’ or ‘archana’.In Goa, churches and mosques in Goa have decided to remain closed for some more time.The Maharashtra government is yet to take a decision on opening religious places for devotees in the state as part of lockdown relaxations, Maharashtra’s law and judiciary department secretary Rajendra Bhagwat told PTI.An archdiocese of Catholic Church in Kerala said churches under it would not conduct service like mass but they would be opened for the devotees to go and offer individual prayers.The Shahi Imam of Delhi’s Jama Masjid Syed Ahmed Bukhari said all the safety measures have been taken at the historic mosque that will reopen on Monday for prayers.Bukhari said people have been advised to perform ‘wuzu’ (ablution) at home before coming to offer namaz. People will bring their own mats and to maintain social distancing floor markings have been made so that there is adequate space between rows of people, he said.The general SOPs issued by the Centre included measures like allowing only asymptomatic staff, guests, customers and devotees on the premises, proper crowd management and maintaining effective and frequent sanitation, with a particular focus on lavatories, drinking and hand washing stations/areas.Frequently touched surfaces like door knobs, elevator buttons, hand rails, benches and washroom fixtures among othes are be cleaned and regularly disinfected.Hand hygiene (sanitizer dispenser) and thermal screening provisions should be in place mandatorily at the entrance and everyone should maintain respiratory etiquettes and follow the prescribed ‘do’s and dont’s’, the Health Ministry stated.The SOPs also recommended installation and use of the Aarogya Setu app.For air-conditioning and ventilation, the ministry said the guidelines of the CPWD shall be followed which emphasises that the temperature setting of all air conditioning devices should be in the range of 24-30 degrees Celsius, relative humidity in the range of 40-70 per cent and intake of fresh air be allowed as much as possible besides adequate cross ventilation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/malls-hotels-religious-places-set-to-reopen-on-monday-amid-uptick-in-covid-19-cases-95903
07-06-2020||New Delhi||Confident NDA will get two-third majority in Bihar polls under Nitish Kumar: Amit Shah||Setting the tone for Bihar assembly polls, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, on Sunday, said the state moved from “jungle raj to janta raj” during the NDA rule and expressed confidence that the alliance would get a two-third majority in the state elections under Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s leadership.Shah’s statement at a first of its kind ‘virtual rally’, in which he addressed the people of the state from the national capital using internet and broadcast mediums, will scotch whatever speculation there might have been over Kumar’s stewardship as a section of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance leaders had been questioning his leadership.Also read: Amit Shah addresses ‘first virtual rally in history’, insists it is not ‘election’ rally“Elections are around the corner in Bihar. I am confident that the NDA will form the government under Nitish Kumar’s leadership with a two-third majority,” the senior BJP leader said in the address.With the Opposition parties attacking the BJP for holding the rally at a time when COVID-19 infection numbers continue to surge, Shah took pains to delink the exercise with Bihar poll campaign, saying it is one of the 75 virtual public meetings that the party had organised for ‘Jan Samvad’ (public dialogue) after the completion of the first year of the Modi government's second term.His speech was interspersed with digs at Opposition leaders, including RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, over his absence from Bihar after the COVID-19 outbreak and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as he highlighted the Modi government’s achievements and strongly defended its handling of the migrants’ issue.Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked Chief Ministers to cater to the needs of the migrant workers and also released Rs 11,000 crore for this, he said, adding that the railways had transported over 1.25 crore people to their homes safely after health infrastructure was ramped up to take care of them in their respective states.With Bihar home to millions of migrant workers and their concern likely to be a key poll issue in the state polls, which are due in October-November, Shah heaped praise on their contribution to the nation’s development and said their hard work is imprinted everywhere.Some people are doing politics over the issue, Shah said and acknowledged the hardship the migrants have gone through, before taking an apparent swipe at Yadav without naming him. Shah asked if he was in Bihar or “enjoying himself” in Delhi during that period.Praising Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi, who is from the BJP, he said Bihar’s growth rate had reached 11.3 per cent under the NDA rule while it was just 3.9 per cent when former chief minister Lalu Prasad’s RJD was in power.“Bihar has travelled from ‘lalten raj’ to ‘LED raj’, from loot and order to law and order, from ‘bahubal’ (muscle power) to power of development and from ‘jungle raj to janata raj’,” Amit Shah said.Listing out several measures, including cash transfer, taken by the Bihar government, Shah said in a lighter vein that while Kumar and Modi had done a lot of work quietly, they lack in doing its publicity.The Rs 1.25-lakh crore package that Modi had announced for Bihar in 2015 had been executed on the ground, he said, giving details of works in different sectors, such as highways and agriculture.Targeting Rahul Gandhi, who has frequently questioned the efficacy of the Modi government’s measures, including the lockdown, Shah said somebody sitting here interviewed people in the US while the Prime Minister united the entire country in the fight against COVID-19.The former BJP president said Opposition leaders dismissed as “political propaganda” Modi’s efforts, be it his call for ‘janata curfew’ or appeal to citizens to beat utensils or light lamps during the COVID-19 crisis to underscore the national resolve and to unite the country, but the nation stood with him and followed him.Narendra Modi had become the only prime minister after Lal Bahadur Shastri to draw such support from the masses to his appeals, Shah said.With Gandhi often accusing the government of not doing much for farmers, Shah hit back, saying some NGO had told the Congress leader that speaking loudly would get him more votes.“Rahul Gandhi claims that the UPA government in 10 years waived loans of Rs 60,000 crore of over three crore farmers. Modi has ensured that over Rs 72,000 crore is given to 9.5 crore farmers every year,” he said.Highlighting a number of pro-people measures such as free cooking gas and housing schemes of the Modi government, he said the biggest work that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had done was to enhance India’s prestige in the world “to the skies”.He asserted that Modi has secured the country’s borders.“There used to be a time when anybody would infiltrate, make light of our borders and behead our soldiers, and nothing happened in Delhi durbar,” he said, adding that the Modi government launched surgical and air strikes after terror attacks in Uri and Pulwama as punitive measures.Shah’s comments came at a time when the Indian and Chinese armies were involved in a stand-off in Ladakh, with military and diplomatic channels being used to defuse the situation. He, however, made no mention of the issue.The Modi government also walked out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership as it would have destroyed India’s small farmers, traders and fishermen among others, he said.Amit Shah said issues which none dared to touch in 70 years were resolved in the first year of the Modi government’s second term and referred to the scrapping of Article 370 provisions and the law against triple talaq.While previous governments worked to ensure that the Ayodhya issue remained unresolved, the government’s handling of the matter has paved the way for the construction of Ram temple following a Supreme Court judgment, he said.Citing various steps for the welfare of the poor and the needy taken by the Modi government amidst the fight against the pandemic, Shah asked the Opposition what it did in the states where it is in power besides doing politics.The BJP claimed that more than 14 lakh internet users joined the first of its kind digital political rally.The Congress criticised Shah for holding a rally “with politics in mind at a time when people of Bihar were dying due to coronavirus and many were stranded in various parts of the country”.

07-06-2020||New Delhi||Centre says ‘fine-tuning’ Covid strategy, slams reports claiming experts not consulted||Asserting that coronavirus is a “new agent” about which not everything is known, the government on Sunday defended the timing of imposition of the lockdown and rejected as “baseless” media reports expressing concerns that it did not take inputs from technical experts while drawing up its COVID-19 strategy.The government also said it is “fine-tuning” its strategy based on emerging knowledge and experience on the ground.In a statement, the Health Ministry said a section of the media is reporting on the decisions regarding India’s approach to the pandemic and asserted that the decision on the lockdown was taken in the background of rapid escalation of COVID-19 cases.“The doubling rate of cases had dropped to a low level, pointing toward a dangerous trajectory of high case load and high mortality, as experienced by many western countries. The possibility that our health systems could soon be overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients seemed to be real,” the ministry said.There was all-round consensus on the lockdown among all state governments, it said.The government has already shared information on the impact of the lockdown and other restrictions to avert lakhs of infections and thousands of deaths, as also enormous gains in the health system and people’s preparedness, the ministry said.It said policies and strategies need to be calibrated to keep pace with the rapidly evolving situation the nation is faced with.“This virus is a new agent, not everything is known about it as yet. Government is fine-tuning the strategy based on emerging knowledge and experience on the ground,” the statement said.“As is well known in public health, different stages of epidemic demand different responses, and the nuanced, step-wise response is known to be a positive characteristic of a resilient health system,” it said.The ministry also said there are some reports in a section of the media expressing concern about the government’s efforts towards containment and management of COVID-19 to have excluded the larger wisdom of technical experts.“These apprehensions and allegations are unfounded and baseless. The government is constantly in consultation with experts for technical and strategic inputs, scientific ideas and domain-specific guidance to address the COVID-19 pandemic,” the statement said.A National Task Force (NTF) for COVID-19 is constituted by Secretary DHR-cum-DG- ICMR with Member (Health) NITI Aayog as Chairperson and Secretary (DoHFW) and Secretary (DHR) as co-chairs, it said.The NTF comprises 21 members, including technical or domain experts from the government and outside the government, the ministry said.Predominant expertise in the Task Force is from public health and/or epidemiology, it noted.Given the complexity and implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, the group has experts from medicine, virology, pharmacology and programme implementation domains as well, it highlighted.The task force has constituted four expert groups and the groups on Epidemiology and Surveillance (13 members) and on Operations Research (15 members) almost entirely comprise of public health and epidemiology experts from the government and non-government arena.The task force has held over 20 meetings and has systematically contributed towards the scientific and technical response to the pandemic, it said.Among other contributions, the Task Force has issued guidelines on testing, prevention, treatment and surveillance.In addition to the NTF, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has also constituted a group of experts with public health experts as members, the statement said.The people, the WHO and the global health community have appreciated India’s proactive and pre-emptive approach to COVID-19, it stated.Compared to countries that have eased lockdowns such as UK, Italy, Spain and Germany, India has reported the lowest number of cases per lakh population, at 17.23 cases per lakh population and 0.49 deaths per lakh population, it said, citing a WHO Situation Report.The various policy decisions, interventions and strategies for containment and management of COVID-19 have been placed in the public domain and its impact has been shared with people through various media platforms, regular media briefings, daily press releases from various ministries and departments, panel discussions on electronic and social media, the statement said.The nationwide curbs were first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.The lockdown was first extended till May 3 and then again till May 17. It was further extended till May 31 and now has been extended in containment zones till June 30. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-says-fine-tuning-covid-strategy-slams-reports-claiming-experts-not-consulted-95885

07-06-2020||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel price hiked by 60 paisa per litre after 82-day hiatus||Petrol and diesel price was on Sunday hiked by 60 paisa per litre, as the state-owned oil firms restarted daily price revisions after a 82-day hiatus.Petrol price in Delhi was hiked to Rs 71.86 per litre from Rs 71.26 a litre till Saturday, while diesel rates were increased to Rs 69.99 per litre from Rs 69.39, according to a price notification of state oil marketing companies.Daily price revision has restarted, an oil company official said.While oil PSUs have regularly revised ATF and LPG prices, they had since March 16 kept petrol and diesel prices on hold, ostensibly on account of extreme volatility in the international oil markets.Auto fuel prices were frozen soon after the government raised excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 3 per litre each to mop up gains arising from falling international rates.The government on May 6 again raised excise duties by Rs 10 per litre on petrol and Rs 13 per litre on diesel.Oil companies, instead of passing on the excise hike to consumers, decided to adjust them against the reduction required because of the drop in international oil prices. They used the same tool and did not pass on the Re 1 per litre hike required for switching over to ultra-clean BS-VI grade fuel from April 1.Petrol price in Mumbai and Kolkata was hiked by 59 paisa each to Rs 78.91 and Rs 73.89 per litre, respectively. In Chennai, the hike was 53 paisa to Rs 76.07, according to the price notification.For diesel, price was hiked by 58 paisa in Mumbai to Rs 68.79 and in Kolkata by 55 paisa to Rs 66.17. In Chennai, the price was hiked from Rs 68.22 to Rs 68.74.While petrol and diesel prices had been kept on hold for nearly three months, they are regularly revised for ATF and LPG despite the fact that the same volatility was witnessed in their prices as well.More importantly, no airline operated between mid-March to May 25 in view of the restrictions placed to check the spread of coronavirus, yet oil companies have continued to revise downward jet fuel prices.In fact, oil companies used to revise ATF prices on the 1st of every month, but adopted fortnightly revisions on March 21 to pass on the benefit of falling international oil prices to airlines.Though the government has deregulated petrol and diesel prices, rate changes have been in the past put on hold by public sector oil companies—Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) -- for reasons that appear to be non-commercial.There was a 19-day price freeze on petrol and diesel ahead of Karnataka polls in May 2018, despite international fuel prices going up by nearly USD 5 per barrel. However, no sooner were the elections over, they rapidly passed on to customers the desired increase—over 16-straight days post-May 14, 2018, petrol price climbed by Rs 3.8 per litre and diesel by Rs 3.38 per litre.Similarly, they had stopped revising fuel prices for almost 14 days ahead of the assembly elections in Gujarat in December 2017.These companies had also imposed a freeze on petrol and diesel prices between January 16, 2017 and April 1, 2017, when assembly elections in five states—Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur—were held.During the 2019 general elections, they moderated the revision by not passing on all of the desired increase in rates to consumers, industry sources said.The rates began to rise a day after the final phase of polling for the Lok Sabha elections ended.

07-06-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Nepal takes umbrage to India-China border talks||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 7India’s army commander-level talks with China on June 6 have hardened positions in Nepal which plans to approve a constitutional amendment on June 9 for a new political map that includes areas Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura.Several foreign policy experts close to the current government in Kathmandu have questioned why India has fobbed off talks with Nepal on the three disputed areas to the end of Covid pandemic? On the other hand during this pandemic, India held premier-level talks with Australia and a face-to-face army commanders’ meeting on the Ladakh border with China.Nepal had a few weeks back taken umbrage to India suggesting that talks to sort out their differences be held after the battle against Covid is won.At that time, many in Nepal Parliament and outside had wanted to know that if Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh could inaugurate a road via Kalapani during a raging epidemic, there should not be any problems with holding talks as well.After the India-China border meeting, ruling Nepal Communist Party’s Central Committee member Bishnu Rijal noted that the military commanders discussed the border dispute. On June 4, Indian and Australian PMs held a virtual summit and signed seven agreements. “But, India is extending the condition of the end of Covid and creating the right atmosphere for talks with Nepal,” he observed.The Constitutional amendment, once passed, will be difficult to reverse as it will have the backing of two-thirds of Parliament. At the moment the proposal has the backing of both main parties, the Nepali Congress and Nepal Communist Party.

07-06-2020||New Delhi||SC to take up pleas seeking review of verdict upholding validity of Aadhaar scheme on June 9||The Supreme Court will take up on June 9 the pleas seeking review of a verdict upholding the Centre’s flagship Aadhaar scheme as constitutionally valid but striking down some of its provisions, including its linking with bank accounts, mobile phones and school admissions.A five-judge bench, comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and L Nageswara Rao, will take up a batch of review pleas in-chambers by which they have challenged the September 26, 2018 verdict.The written submissions filed by senior advocate Shyam Divan on behalf of petitioners sought open court hearing of the review pleas and said they had challenged the correctness of the judgment on the ground that the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other subsidies, benefits and services) Act, 2016, was incorrectly certified as a Money Bill by the Speaker of Lok Sabha.“It is submitted that Aadhaar failed to meet the strict standard laid out in Article 110 (1). For legislation that has serious implications on the rights of citizens to be passed without consideration of Rajya Sabha is nothing but a fraud on the Constitution, as the minority judgement notes,” the written submission filed through advocate Vipin Nair said.The petitioners have referred to two verdicts of the Apex Court, including one of November 13 last year, by which the top court had struck down in entirety the rules formulated by the Centre on appointment and service conditions for members of various tribunals, and referred to a larger bench the issue of examining the validity of the passage of the Finance Act 2017 as Money Bill.The other verdict, which has been cited by the petitioners, is of November 14 last year in which the top court had referred to a larger bench the pleas seeking review of its the historic 2018 judgement allowing women and girls of all ages to enter Kerala’s Sabarimala temple, along with other contentious issues of alleged discrimination against Muslim and Parsi women.“In view of the same it is humbly requested that this court may be pleased to allow the IA No. 6225/2019, and grant the petitioners an opportunity to make an oral submission before an open court, so as to enable them to explain and justify their reasons for reconsideration of the judgment under review,” the written submission of Divan said.Observing that ‘Aadhaar’ neither tends to create a “surveillance state” nor it infringed the Right to Privacy, the Supreme Court had on September 26, 2018, declared that the Centre’s biometric identity project was constitutionally valid but limited the scope, ruling it was not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions.A five-judge Constitution bench headed by the then Chief Justice Dipak Misra held that while Aadhaar would remain mandatory for filing of Income Tax Return and allotment of the permanent account number (PAN), it would not be mandatory to link Aadhaar to bank accounts and the telecom service providers cannot seek its linking for mobile connections.In a 4-1 verdict that also quashed some contentious provisions of the Aadhaar Act, the top court, however, had held Aadhaar would remain compulsory for filing of the Income Tax Return (ITR) and allotment of a permanent account number (PAN) and for availing facilities of welfare schemes and government subsidies.“It is better to be unique than the best. Because being the best makes you the number one but being unique makes you the only one,” the Supreme Court had said after a long-drawn bruising legal battle against the government's ambitious project — the world's largest biometric ID database.Ruling that seeding of Aadhaar would not be required for opening bank accounts, availing mobile services, by the CBSE, the NEET, the JEE, the UGC and for admissions in schools and free education for children, the Supreme Court had observed that Aadhaar had also become a household name and that its use has spread like a “wildfire”.It had struck down as unconstitutional the portion of Section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporates to avail of the biometric Aadhaar data.Justice DY Chandrachud, who was part of the bench, had given a dissenting judgement in which he ruled the Aadhaar Act should not have been passed as Money Bill as it amounts to fraud on the Constitution and is liable to be struck down.But the majority verdict by other four judges, including the then CJI, upheld the passage of the Aadhaar Bill as Money Bill by Lok Sabha.Observing that Aadhaar was meant to help the benefits reach the marginalised sections of the society, it had said the scheme takes into account the dignity of people not only from personal but also from the community point of view as well and served the much bigger public interest.

Staff members had been asked to remain under home-quarantine and work from home, sources added.Samples of those who came in direct contact with the staff member have also been collected, for which the results are awaited.At the same time, the journalistic fraternity in the state suffered a setback when a young journalist, Manoj, who worked for a local Telugu TV channel, succumbed to COVID-19 on Sunday.He was admitted to a hospital on June 4 after he tested positive.Sources said the Telangana-cum-Andhra Bhawans in New Delhi were also sealed after an IAS officer posted there tested positive.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/metro-office-sealed-after-telengana-cm-staff-tests-positive-95873
07-06-2020||Naveen S Garewal||Telangana doctors bear the brunt of Covid-19||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, June 7Telangana’s true COVID-19 warriors, the doctors treating coronavirus patients have become the single largest group that has been affected by the deadly virus.Government said that by the weekend 71 doctors, many working in state run hospitals had contracted positive and many more reports were still due. This includes some medical interns and house doctors who have shouldered responsibility to treat the sick along with the specialists.It is estimated that in total about 150 health care professionals have been affected by COVID-19. Two interns and one postgraduate doctor of the Government Dental College have tested positive. The government dental hospitals are performing all procedures, while the private dental clinics have generally remained close, but even those that have opened are not doing any procedures that make droplets from patients mouth fly in air.From the prestigious Osmania Medical College in Hyderabad, three more post-graduate students have tested positive, taking the total number from this institution to 41. For the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences located on Road Number 1, Banjara Hills, seven new cases from among the doctors have been reported taking the total number here to 26. Two professors in Gandhi Medical College also tested positive on Friday.Five departments of NIMS were ordered to close from Sunday to June 9 as sanitisation is to be carried out in the specialty block. About 20 doctors from private hospitals who treated COVID-19 patients have been home quarantined. The most affected are small and medium hospitals which do not have a dedicated isolation ward.The out-patient and in-patient services for medical and surgical gastroenterology, urology, cardiology and surgical oncology have been affected. Doctors can opt for tele-counselling and rotational basis duties have been allotted.With reports of much lower testing than desired, the Telangana Junior Doctors Association has been pushing for more testing of medical personnel. So far, only those who have developed symptoms and those who have come in contact with Covid-positive persons are being tested.In the absence of aggressive testing the vice president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Dr Narsinga Reddy says scarring lungs is an indication of the virus and we are taking that as the first option and clinical evaluation of patients. Those whose lungs are affected are being isolated.However, a junior doctor said, “The government has told us that there are limitations and all of us cannot be tested at one go. Hence, phase-wise testing is going to be carried out.”Concerned with growing number of cases among doctors and other health staff, state Health minister Etala Rajendar visited the Gandhi Hospital and other places where all such persons are admitted. There is a fear if more doctors get affected by the virus, it may have an adverse impact on the health care system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-doctors-bear-the-brunt-of-covid-19-95870
07-06-2020||New Delhi||CAIT to launch campaign to boycott Chinese goods||Traders’ body CAIT on Sunday said it would launch a nationwide campaign to boycott Chinese goods across the country from June 10.The campaign call by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which claims to represent 7 crore traders and 40,000 trade associations, comes amid border tensions between India and China.            Under the campaign, CAIT will not only motivate traders to not sell Chinese goods but also urge Indian consumers to buy indigenous products in place of Chinese goods, and in this way Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call ‘Vocal for Local’ will also be fructified, the traders’ body said in a statement.        CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said the traders’ body has been continuously campaigning from time to time for boycotting Chinese products for the last four years on the back of government’s strong push for ‘Make in India’ programme.        “As a result of these initiatives, imports from China have dropped from USD 76 billion in 2017-18 to USD 70 billion at present. This USD 6 billion import decline tells the true story of the use of indigenous goods and changing consumer sentiments,” Khandelwal said. He said through efforts like these, CAIT is eyeing reduction in India’s imports of Chinese goods by about USD 13 billion (around Rs 1 lakh crore) by December 2021, and has prepared a comprehensive list of about 3,000 products imported from China for which Indian substitutes and alternatives are easily available.

07-06-2020||New Delhi||Kerala elephant death: Plea in SC seeks probe by CBI or SIT||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking probe by the CBI or a special investigation team (SIT) into the recent death of a pregnant wild elephant after it ate a fruit containing firecrackers in Kerala’s Silent Valley Forest.The 15-year-old elephant fell victim to an act of human cruelty after the fruit filled with powerful crackers, offered allegedly by locals, exploded in her mouth when she chomped it. The elephant died in the Velliyar River on May 27. The plea filed in the apex court has alleged that prima facie it appeared to be a “calculated and organised” racket to kill elephants and that the authorities have failed to prevent such killings of protected animals. Referring to media reports, the plea filed by Delhi-based advocate Avadh Bihari Kaushik has said in April this year a similar incident had come to light in which an elephant, which was found with mouth injuries in Pathanapuram forest range in Kerala’s Kollam district, had died.The plea has also urged the apex court to call for the entire record of these cases along with similar incidents, if any, regarding killing of elephants in Kerala and in other states.It has sought a direction for transferring the case of killing of the pregnant elephant and similar incidents to the CBI “under the constant monitoring” of the top court.The plea has said that alternatively, the court should direct setting up of an SIT, headed by a former judge of the apex court, to probe into the cases of repeated killings of elephants in various parts of the country.It said the SIT should examine the issue at a larger scale and also suggest proper mechanism to curb the menace and to nab and punish the culprits to avoid such incidents in future.“No fair, impartial and uninfluenced investigation and prosecution at the hands of the local state police is possible inasmuch as the matter involves political and money powers and therefore, the investigation is required to be conducted from an impartial, independent central agency in a fair and transparent manner under the monitoring of this court or by an SIT...,” the plea said.The plea said the Government of India had launched Project Elephant in 1992 to support the states in protecting the animal, their habitats and migration corridors.“However, all the efforts made by the central and state governments are  failing for the simple reason that the poachers and killers are more committed to their job as compared to the agencies appointed to nab them and therefore, the incidents like the present one are repeatedly occurring,” the plea said. The National Green Tribunal has taken cognisance on the death of the pregnant elephant and has formed a committee and directed it to submit an action-taken report in the matter.According to a preliminary post-mortem report, the elephant had major wounds in its oral cavity, most likely following an explosive blast due to which she could not eat for nearly two weeks leading to her collapse in a river and drowning.Drowning followed by inhalation of water leading to lung failure was the immediate cause of the animal’s death, said the report prepared on May 28. —  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-elephant-death-plea-in-sc-seeks-probe-by-cbi-or-sit-95864

07-06-2020||---||Amit Shah addresses ‘first virtual rally in history’, insists it is not ‘election’ rally||New Delhi, June 7Home Minister and former BJP president Amit Shah, on Sunday, addressed a virtual rally amid the COVID-19 crisis to mark one year of Narendra Modi government 2.0 and said the Narendra Modi government had sent 1.25 crore migrants home safely during the lockdown.Amit Shah, addressing ‘Bihar Jan-Samwaad’, called it the first virtual rally in the history of the country and insisted that it had nothing to do with the forthcoming elections in the state.“My rally has nothing to do with elections. It is a rally to bring together the people of the county fighting against the COVID-19 crisis,” Amit Shah said while enlisting pro-poor, pro-women, pro-farmers and pro-migrants decisions announced by the Narendra Modi government during the crisis. He also lambasted the BJP’s political rivals in the state, including the RJD and the Congress.Also read: Confident NDA will get two-third majority in Bihar polls under Nitish Kumar: Amit Shah“Who has stopped you from holding virtual rallies?” he asked.The RJD held a protest with the family of its supremo, Lalu Prasad, leading it.The Home Minister thanked the people of the state for reposing faith in the Narendra Modi government.“Bihar has always supported Narendra Modi,” he said.The biggest benefit of the Narendra Modi government had been for the people from ‘poorvanchal’, West Bengal and the Eastern parts of the country, he said.Calling it a fight for development and progress, Deputy CM Sushil Modi thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the timely imposition of the lockdown and saving thousands of lives.Amit Shah was called “shaurya purush” for uniting the nation.Leaders from the state in the Central Government and the organisation were also present at the virtual rally.The rally, held ahead of the assembly elections, marks the beginning of the BJP campaign in Bihar, where elections are due later this year. It remains to be seen whether the elections would be held as per the schedule. The party leadership says it is prepared whenever they are held.The party has received criticism over plight and sufferings of migrants following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s three-hour notice for a country-wide lockdown.In a world struggling with the new challenge of COVID-19 pandemic, the digital/virtual saffron rally marked the commencement of the new form of electioneering and its campaign for the crucial polls.Senior BJP leaders, including party president JP Nadda, will be using the virtual platform to reach out to the voters in days to come.While the BJP appears well prepared to handle the new situation and challenges it brings, rivals fear digital/virtual campaigns could end up favouring the saffron party given its well-oiled IT cell, social media teams and experience of high-tech electioneering in past. Going virtual and digital for the month-long activities to mark the completion of one year of Narendra Modi government 2.0, the BJP will be relying majorly on new forms of ‘samvaad’ (communication) in its campaign for the Bihar elections.Sources indicate that the party had already started identifying prominent persons in the constituencies, who can spread the message to the grassroots in times when large gatherings, rallies and corner meetings may no longer be the order of the day.“‘Mandals’ have been asked to identify people who can act as a bridge and influence voters and with whom the leadership from the state and the national-level can directly communicate to ascertain the ground situation,” the sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-addresses-first-virtual-rally-in-history-insists-it-is-not-election-rally-95861
07-06-2020||Mumbai||Sonu Sood enacting a political script: Sena on actor helping migrants||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday wondered whether the BJP propped up Bollywood actor Sonu Sood to “offer help” to migrant workers from north India stranded in Maharashtra amidst the lockdown, with the political motive to show the Uddhav Thackeray government in poor light.In his weekly column ‘Rokhthok’ in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, Raut questioned the sudden rise of “Mahatma” Sood on the social scene of Maharashtra during the lockdown.Raut also referred to a “sting operation” against Sood ahead of the 2019 general elections, saying he had agreed to promote the BJP-led government at various platforms through his official social media accounts.The Sena’s attack came against the backdrop of reports that Sood had arranged buses for migrant workers stuck in Mumbai.“Sood is an actor whose profession is to deliver dialogues scripted by someone else and make a living out of it.There are many people like Sood who would promote any political party if paid well,” Raut said.He said no wise man would believe in Sood suddenly developing sympathy for labourers and sending them back in large numbers.Raut, who is the chief whip of the Sena in Parliament and executive editor of ‘Saamana’, said, “The BJP has (politically) adopted Sonu Sood and tried to create an influence among the North Indian migrant workers.”During the coronavirus crisis, the BJP was struggling to stay politically relevant but faced a severe backlash from people as they did not like frequent criticism of the Thackeray government by leaders of the BJP, he stated.“The plight of migrant workers also turned many people against the Modi government for its handling of the coronavirus crisis,” Raut stated.He said it was necessary to find out whether the BJP put a mask of a social worker on Sonu Sood and used him to further its political designs.“There is a person called Shankar Pawar, who is the head of Rashtriya Banjara Seva Sangh and seen frequently standing behind Sood in various photographs. He has the huge system and network to send people home,” Raut said.Raut strongly defended the state government, which also comprises the NCP and the Congress, over its handling of the migrant crisis.“No other state could have treated migrant workers the way they have been taken care of by the Maharashtra government,” he stated.The government has set up a special unit to streamline the process to transport migrant workers to their native states.“However, to show the state government’s work in poor light, Sood has been deliberately promoted. ‘If anyone wants to go home, please contact me’ was the appeal of the actor,” Raut wrote.The senior Sena leader also claimed that Sood had even received an invitation from Maharashtra Governor B S Koshyari to laud his work.“Maharashtra chief secretary Ajoy Mehta should send a detailed list of people and organisations who served relentlessly and selflessly during the coronavirus crisis.Unfortunately, they do not have any political backing to promote their work,” Raut said.In a swipe at the BJP, Raut said people might soon here Sood’s name in ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme and him meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi.“Sood might even visit Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi as a star campaigner for the BJP. When most of the actors were sitting at home, Sonu Sood’s acting skills were flourishing,” he stated.You do not need a screen all the time to show your acting skills as has been demonstrated by “Mahatma Sood”, Raut said.“Sood’s political directors are experts in their field. We will come to know soon about his next political move,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonu-sood-enacting-a-political-script-sena-on-actor-helping-migrants-95860
07-06-2020||New Delhi||Disclose preliminary enquiries into corruption complaints closed without FIRs: CIC to CBI||In a major decision to promote transparency in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Central Information Commission (CIC) has ordered disclosure of preliminary enquiries into corruption complaints which have been closed by the probe agency without registering any FIRs during the period 2014-18.The Commission, while delivering the order, agreed with the views of an RTI applicant that the CBI, which is otherwise exempted from the ambit of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, does not have immunity from disclosing records related to “allegations” of corruption and human rights violation held by it.The preliminary enquiries, being “records” held by the agency carrying “allegations” of corruption, cannot be denied under the exemption from the RTI Act enjoyed by the agency and should be judged in conformity to its provisions, the applicant said.“...Commission directs the CPIO to provide the preliminary enquiry number, summary of allegations, date of registration and date of closure of the preliminary enquiries pertaining to allegations of corruption which have been closed by the agency without registering regular cases between 2014-2018,” Information Commissioner Divya Prakash Sinha said.The case pertained to the RTI application filed by correspondent Abhishek Shukla on May 2, 2018, seeking from the CBI the copies of all the PEs having allegations of corruption which have been closed by the agency without registering an FIR during the period 2014-18, along with the details about the date of registration, date of closure and reasons behind the closure.A Preliminary Enquiry (PE) is the first step initiated by the CBI to assess criminality in prima facie allegations levelled by a complainant. If the allegations appear to be serious enough, the agency proceeds with an FIR or else PE is closed.The PE remains an internal document as no closure reports are filed in the court thereby not allowing any public scrutiny of reasons behind not initiating full-scale investigation with an FIR in a particular complaint or input.In case of the FIRs, the CBI has to file a final report in the form of charge sheet or a closure report in a special court after the conclusion of the probe leaving it to the court whether to accept or reject the probe document.After a Supreme Court order, all FIRs are placed in the public domain within 24 hours but the contents of PEs and their findings are not disclosed by the agency.When the details of the PEs were sought under the RTI Act, the CBI rejected the application within seven days on two grounds — Section 24(1) for its exemption from the RTI Act and Section 8(1)(g) related to the protection of information the disclosure of which can affect life and physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement.While Section 24(1) completely exempts the CBI and other security and intelligence agencies from the RTI Act but a proviso says this exemption will not apply to the information pertaining to allegations of corruption and human rights violations.“The appellant has highlighted the issue of lack of transparency and probity in the domain of preliminary enquiries, as these remain distant from public scrutiny and he has sought for this information in the capacity of an ordinary citizen, without whatsoever ostensible personal interest,” Sinha said.Asserting that the disclosure would strengthen the structure of the CBI, Sinha said there was an overriding public interest in the disclosure of this information as envisaged under Section 8(2) of the RTI Act as it concerned allegations of corruption against public servants that were inquired into by the premier investigating agency for a period of five years.“Such disclosure will strengthen the structure of this vital law enforcement arm of the government, per contra, the opacity will only add to casting aspersions on its working,” Sinha said.Citing his previous order in a separate case, Sinha said the cases referred to, investigated or enquired by the anti-corruption branch of the CBI invariably pertain to allegations of corruption only and the CBI and the Commission cannot be oblivious to the imperativeness of applying a judicious rationale while assessing the applicability of the proviso to Section 24(1) of the RTI Act in such cases pertaining to the anti-corruption branch.“In the instant case also, the above paradox holds true, in as much as the appellant specifically sought information regarding preliminary enquiries made into allegations of corruption. Yet, the CPIO (Central Public Information Officer) and FAA (First Appellate Authority) failed to appreciate the same and rather denied the information in almost what seems like mechanical disposal of the RTI applications and first appeals,” he said in the present order.He said the Commission was by and large convinced with the primary averment of the appellant that the information sought pertains to allegations of corruption.Sinha said the appellant had sought for the information of cases pertaining to a period of five years, it was difficult to imagine how one would narrow down these many cases to pose endangerment to life and physical safety of the suspects or the concerned officer(s).“Neither the material on record nor the disposition of the appellant during hearing suggest any perceivable threat that he can pose to the said individuals,” Sinha said and allowed inspection of preliminary enquiries in the event it is not being made available in the form requested for by the RTI applicant.

07-06-2020||New Delhi||Kashmiri woman held for planning terror acts tests positive for COVID-19 in NIA custody||A Kashmiri woman, who was arrested earlier this year for allegedly planning a terror attack in the country during the anti-CAA protests here, has tested positive for COVID-19 while in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The judge directed the NIA to admit Hina Bashir Beigh to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital with immediate effect.The court sent her husband, Jahanzaib Sami, and another accused Abdul Basith to judicial custody in the case after the agency did not seek their further remand.Her lawyer advocate, MS Khan, has filed an application seeking interim bail for two months for her, saying “Delhi is struggling to cope with the rising number of COVID-19 positive cases” and that there was “lack of proper treatment facilities in government hospitals”.The accused were arrested for allegedly promoting the Islamic State’s ideology and instigating protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the agency had alleged.The COVID-19 tests of accused persons were conducted on June 6 on the directions of the court, while their 10-day custodial interrogation ended on Sunday.The report of COVID-19 test of accused persons, namely Jahanzaib Sami and Mohd Abdullah Basith, is negative, but report of Hina Bashir Beigh is found positive,” the NIA informed the court.In the bail application, which is likely to come up for hearing in the coming days, advocate Khan said: “Delhi is struggling to cope with the rising number of COVID-19 positive cases that have gone up to 27,000 as of now and due to lack of proper treatment facilities in government hospitals, which has also been highlighted in the media, the Delhi government has been compelled to issue a list of 56 private hospitals for corona treatment.”The three accused, allegedly having links with the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), were arrested by the special cell of the Delhi Police in March and later sent to judicial custody on March 23.Basith was already lodged in jail in another case being probed by the NIA when the Delhi Police arrested him in the present matter.The case was later transferred to the NIA, which lodged a case on March 20 under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 124-A (sedition) and 153-A (provocation for causing riot) of the IPC and Sections 13 (punishment for unlawful activities) and 20 (being member of terrorist gang or organisation) of stringent the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).The NIA later approached a special court here seeking custodial interrogation of three accused, which was allowed for 10 days by the judge on May 20, with a direction to the Tihar jail authorities to hand over their custody to the NIA “after conducting their COVID-19 test and ensure that it is found negative”.The NIA took their remand on May 29 after the test result had come negative. The custody ended on Sunday.The agency said the accused were following the ideology of the ISIS and planning for a terror strike in India and were also recruiting cadres for the ISKP.“In one audio message, Abdul Basith told Jahanzaib to motivate and prepare some guys, who may be used for a lone-wolf attack and kill people through a truck or lorry by running them over on people,” the Delhi Police had earlier said.The police said the trio was in contact with Abu Ushman al Kashmiri — the head of Indian affairs of the ISKP.

A perusal of the report of the registrar general, in fact, confirms the analysis which has been placed on record by the petitioner in respect of 122 cases, to the effect that complainants/ informants are not being heard prior to hearing in bail applications to accused under the provisions of the POCSO Act,” it said, adding that, issuance of notice is the mandate of law.The court added there was also no doubt that most sessions courts are not issuing notices to the complainant before entertaining or hearing bail applications of accused, including those for interim bail.In fact, even if compromise is the ground for seeking bail, there is a greater need that the same ought to be verified or confirmed from the complainant/victim, it said.The plea was filed by the girl’s mother, through advocate Tara Narula, challenging the interim bail granted to the accused on May 5 on the ground that the order was passed in routine manner and was not only bad in law but also suffered from procedural lapse on the part of the sessions court.The victim’s counsel submitted that with effect from April 21, 2018, there was an amendment in the law by which it has been mandated that the presence of the informant or any person authorised shall be obligatory at the time of hearing of the application for bail to the person accused of sexual offences.The period for which the interim bail was granted to the accused expired on June 5, the day the high court passed its verdict.As the accused has filed a fresh bail application before the sessions court, the high court said it be decided in accordance with law after hearing the complainant and the prosecution and also the grounds raised by the man in the plea.The court said non-issuance of notice to the complainants or victims is not merely a procedural lapse, but is clearly contrary to the unequivocal legislative mandate and settled law.It said the lockdown period has thrown up several challenges to the judicial system which courts are bracing for an everyday basis and issuance of notice to the complainant is such a fundamental precondition, that the requirement of law cannot be bypassed, ignored or neglected.

07-06-2020||Ahmedabad||FIR filed for lockdown violation against resort housing Congress MLAs||A police complaint was on Sunday filed for alleged violation of lockdown norms against a resort in Gujarat’s Rajkot district, where the Congress has lodged some of its MLAs to thwart any ‘poaching’ bid, an official said.Except for five-six MLAs, most the 65 Congress legislators have reached various resorts in Gujarat after the party summoned them to protect them “from poaching” by the ruling BJP, ahead of the June 19 Rajya Sabha elections for four seats from the state, a Congress leader said.Police registered an FIR against the owner and manager of Neelcity Resort in Rajkot under Indian Penal Code Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) for opening the resort for Congress MLAs, in alleged violation of the lockdown notification which does not allow hotels and restaurants to open till Monday.“We have lodged the first information report (FIR) against the owner and manager of the Neelcity Resort where Congress MLAs are staying. They have been booked for flouting the lockdown notification by opening the resort,” University Road police station inspector R S Thakar said.As per Central and state government guidelines, hotels and restaurants can start operations from June 8, while Congress MLAs from Saurashtra region were lodged in the Rajkot resort on Saturday.After the resignations of three Congress MLAs, the party has shifted most of its legislators to three resorts in Rajkot, Ambaji in Banaskantha district and Anand.The Congress’ strength in the 182-member Gujarat Assembly has been reduced to 65 MLAs.Most of these MLAs have reached the resorts in Rajkot, Anand and Ambaji where they will stay until the Rajya Sabha election day, Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said.“Five to seven MLAs who have not reached will do so by today. They might be held up due to personal reasons,” Doshi said.Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Paresh Dhanani and former LoP Arjun Modhwadiya are staying with some other MLAs at the resort in Rajkot.Besides, senior Congress leaders Jagdish Thakor and Siddharth Patel are with the MLAs at Ambaji, and party’s Rajya Sabha poll candidate Bharatsinh Solanki and state unit president Amit Chavda are at Anand, Doshi said.The Congress had in March also taken its MLAs to a resort in Jaipur after five party legislators resigned before the March 26 Rajya Sabha polls, which were subsequently postponed due to the lockdown.Over the last few days, Congress’ Akshay Patel, Jitu Chaudhary and Brijesh Merja resigned as legislators.Earlier, Pravin Maru, Pradyumnasinh Jadeja, Soman Patel, JV Kakidia, and Mangal Gavit resigned in March.With the reduced strength of 65, the Congress may find it difficult to win two Rajya Sabha seats for which it has fielded Bharatsinh Solanki and Shaktisinh Gohil.The Congress leaders have accused the ruling BJP of adopting means like “blackmailing, threatening or using money to poach its MLAs”, a charge refuted by the ruling party.The BJP, having 103 MLAs in the Assembly, has fielded Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramilaben Bara, and Narhari Amin for the election to four seats of the Rajya Sabha on June 19.Besides the BJP and Congress, the 182-member Assembly also comprises two MLAs of the Bharatiya Tribal Party, one MLA of the NCP and an Independent legislator, Jignesh Mevani.The effective strength of the House, however, stands at 172 as of now as 10 seats are currently vacant - two due to court cases and the rest because of resignations.

Reena's son is Lockdown Yadav.The two babies share nothing in common, except the extraordinary situation they were born in: on-board Shramik Special trains during a devastating pandemic, that has a bearing on all aspects of human lives, including the names they got."Compassion, 'seva bhav'," says Karuna's father Rajendra Yadav, explaining the name of his child when asked if 'corona', or 'coronavirus', had any influence on them while deciding the name."People told me to name her after the disease. How can I name her Corona when it has killed so many people and destroyed lives?" he told PTI over the phone from his village in Dharampura in Chhattisgarh."We have named her Karuna, meaning compassion, seva bhav, which we all need during these difficult times."Karuna was born on-board a Shramik Special train at perhaps the most difficult times that the country has seen in decades—the COVID-19 pandemic has killed close to 7,000 people, infected nearly 2.5 lakh and upended business activities, leading to people losing their jobs and families their livelihoods.Describing the troubled times the duo had to face back in Bhopal, where Yadav worked as a mason, he said he had no job or money on him, and they were going hungry."I thought if I leave Bhopal then, I will be able to make it in time for her to deliver the baby at our native place. If my wife had delivered the baby in Bhopal, how would I have fed her and the child? Now, thanks to the Railways, both my wife and daughter are healthy and fine," he said.Ishwari is one among more than three dozen women who battled hunger and unemployment in advance stages of their pregnancy and gave birth in unfamiliar conditions—on-board a train, their babies handled by unknown co-travellers who shared their joy.Reena, who gave birth on-board a Shramik Special train from Mumbai to Uttar Pradesh, has named her son Lockdown Yadav to forever remember the tough times he was born in."He was born in such a difficult situation. We want to name him Lockdown Yadav," she said.Another woman, Mamata Yadav, boarded the Jamnagar-Muzaffarpur Shramik Special train on May 8. Alone. She wanted to give birth with her mother by her side at her village in Chhapra district of Bihar. But, by the time her destination station in Bihar arrived she had a companion in her arms.Mamta's compartment was turned into a labour-room-of-sorts with other passengers moving out. A team of doctors along with railway staff supervised Mamta's condition as she delivered a healthy baby girl, the official said."We have a system to deal with medical emergencies,” said railway spokesperson RD Bajpai."Whenever a passenger needs help, our on-board staff alerts the next station where medical aid is available and the doctors who live in railway colonies around the station are always there to deal with any emergency,” he said."We are happy that we managed to provide help in time every time and in each case, the baby and the mother have been healthy."Mamta and her little one were allowed to continue their journey, officials said.Meena Kumbhar, 19, delivered a baby boy on an Odisha-bound train on June 5. The baby, the 37th child to be born on the migrant special trains, got a surprise a day later when the general manager of the East Coast Railway gave gifted him Rs 5,000."We want to continue this tradition. Many of our officials have come together and decided that whenever a child is born on these trains in our zone, we will give them a gift as a token of our sharing their joy," a spokesperson for the ECoR said.On May 18, nine-month pregnant Sangeeta boarded a Shramik Special train from Bengaluru for her hometown in Uttar Pradesh.Onboard, she delivered a healthy baby boy with the help of her co-passengers. Soon after, she was provided with medicines and when she reached a team of doctors awaited her with supplies.The Bangalore Police shared a photo of the baby sent to them by the couple.On May 22, Madhu Kumari (27) delivered a baby during her journey home to Uttar Pradesh.

07-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi opens borders from Monday, reserves hospitals for City residents||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced that the hospitals run by the Delhi Government and private entities will only treat Delhiites during the coronavirus crisis, while the City’s borders will be reopened from Monday.Addressing an online media briefing, Kejriwal said hospitals run by the Centre will have no such restriction, and if people from other states come to the National Capital for specific surgeries, they can get medical treatment at private hospitals.The announcement comes a day after a five-member panel constituted by the AAP government suggested that the health infrastructure of the city should be used only for treating Delhiites in view of the raging COVID-19 crisis.“Over 90 per cent of people want Delhi hospitals to treat patients from the national capital during the coronavirus pandemic. Hence, it has been decided that government and private hospitals in Delhi will only treat patients from the National Capital,” Kejriwal said.The Chief Minister had last week sought views of the people in Delhi on the issue, while announcing the decision to close the City’s borders.Also read: As COVID-19 cases surge, Delhi govt strengthens surveillance system at district-level“Delhi’s health infrastructure is needed to tackle the coronavirus crisis at the moment,” Kejriwal said on Sunday.There are around 40 Delhi government-run hospitals in the National Capital, including LNJP Hospital, GTB Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.Among the major Centre-run hospitals in the City are RML Hospital, AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital.Delhi government hospitals have around 10,000 beds, while the Centre-run hospitals have almost the same beds, Kejriwal said, adding that it will strike a balance and protect the interest of those belonging to the national capital and other states as well.He said that the Centre-run hospitals will continue to treat people belonging to other states and his government has not issued any separate order for the same.“We are going to reopen Delhi’s borders tomorrow. Malls, restaurants and religious places will open but hotels and banquets will remain closed as we might need to convert them into hospitals in the coming time,” Kejriwal also said.In its report, the panel had pointed out that Delhi will need 15,000 beds by the end of June and if people of other states are allowed to get treatment, all beds here will be occupied within just three days, Kejriwal said during the online conference.“Till March, Delhi used to treat all people of the country, but at the time of this crisis, Delhi hospitals need to be reserved for the people of Delhi,” he said.The panel, headed by Indraprastha University vice-chancellor Dr Mahesh Verma, had on Saturday submitted its report to the government.The Delhi government had asked the panel to guide it on healthcare infrastructure augmentation and overall preparedness of hospitals to battle COVID-19 in the national capital.The panel was also asked to guide the government on any other area where the strengthening of infrastructure is required to better manage the pandemic in Delhi.On Saturday, Delhi recorded 1,320 fresh coronavirus cases, taking the COVID-19 tally in the city to over 27,500 while the death toll due to the disease mounted to 761.The highest single-day spike in fresh cases — 1,513 — was recorded on June 3.

We succeeded in making people adhere to the lockdown for 75 days. We managed to have zero cases in Daman and Diu because people followed the lockdown with full commitment," Patel said.However, authorities remain alert as the Union Territory lies close to Gujarat and Maharashtra.According to the data provided by the health department of the Union Territory, as many as 17,965 samples have been tested so far for COVID-19, including 12,130 in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, 4,723 in Daman and 1,112 in Diu.Of these, 19 samples from Dadra and Nagar Haveli have so far tested positive for coronavirus, but none from Daman and Diu, a health official said, adding that results of 1,039 samples are awaited.As many as 6,026 people, including 3,444 in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, 977 in Daman, and 1,605 in Diu, were kept under quarantine and completed the mandatory period, he said.As of now, 2,290 people are still under quarantine, the official added."We have collected samples of people with travel history, those showing symptoms, and also random samples as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines," the Union Territory's programme officer for communicable diseases Meghal Shah said."Travels were restricted during the lockdown, and we screened and collected samples of each and every person travelling to Daman, Diu or Silvassa.

07-06-2020||---||Talks alone will resolve LAC stand-off: MEA||New Delhi, June 7India and China would persist with military and diplomatic engagements to resolve the situation and to ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas, said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) after the latest round of border talks on June 6 between the army commanders ended in a stalemate.“Talks took place in a cordial and positive atmosphere. Both sides agreed to peacefully resolve the situation in the border areas in accordance with various bilateral agreements,” it said in a statement released on Sunday.The MEA indicated that both sides were in for a long haul and that despite bringing in military reinforcements, the accent would be on dialogue. In this respect, it reiterated its earlier stand of May 21 that “peace and tranquillity in the India-China border regions are essential for the overall development of bilateral relations”.Also read: Nepal takes umbrage to India-China border talksIndo-China talks hold promise for LadakhisIt said the four hours of talks between the army commanders also noted that this year marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and agreed that an early resolution would contribute to the further development of the relationship.While the Indian media has prominently highlighted the stand-off, its Chinese counterparts have refrained from highlighting it. Beijing had, a fortnight back, leaked a video of a May 5 scuffle between the troops of both sides which had garnered over three crore views from the Chinese netizens.But apart from that, respected media outlets, such as Xinhua, People’s Daily and CGTN, mentioned India in their commentaries in the global fight against the pandemic but kept the border stand-off away from their web pages.Global Times, which has the external audience in mind, maintained its psy-ops by uploading a video that supposedly showed a Chinese airborne brigade taking just a few hours to manoeuvre from Central China to “northwestern, high-altitude region amid China-India border tensions”.Otherwise, as is the case with the MEA here, the Chinese officials have maintained a low profile on the border tension.Statements by the Chinese Foreign Office have rejected the US mediation offers and reiterated bilateralism as the fulcrum to resolve the situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/talks-alone-will-resolve-lac-stand-off-mea-95802

Several activities, including false claims, publicising so-called approvals of research or product manufacturing about Covid control from the Ministry of AYUSH and writing Covid-related claims and name of the ministry on the labels and containers of products tantamount to contravention of law,” the Centre has written to states.It has also asked the State Licensing Authority for AYUSH and state drug controllers to take action against the spread of wrong information, fake claims and misbranding happening under their jurisdiction under Section 7 of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Remedies) Act, 1954, and Section 33 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.“A warning may be issued and if not complied with, an FIR will be filed in cases brought to the notice of the licensing authority and drug controller directly or forwarded by the ministry,” the Government of India order states.Assistant Drug Controller, Haryana, Manmohan Taneja said the markets in the state were full of AYUSH products making false claims.“Our markets are flooded with AYUSH hand sanitisers and disinfectants labelled with false claims that they have anti-Covid properties. Oral ayurvedic capsules and tablets are also being sold with labels like Covid Ayush Kwath, which claims to boost immunity. All these products are licensed by the AYUSH Licensing Authority, but drug controllers can also take action against such product makers,” Taneja said.Former Haryana State Drug Controller GL Singla said several such hand sanitisers being sold in markets containing 80 per cent alcohol did not fit into the definition of ayurvedic drugs. “We can’t even imagine that an AYUSH product is using 80 per cent alcohol as excipient or stabiliser for neem, tulsi or other such herbal products in the ayurvedic drug. All such hand sanitisers being sold by AYUSH makers are illegal,” Singla said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ayush-manufacturers-in-spot-over-false-covid-cure-claims-95710

On a live TV programme aired a few days ago, an anchor called up a hospital saying he needs a bed for a Covid patient in his family. First, he was denied and later he was told to submit Rs 8 lakh for the admission.”“Private hospitals play an important role in the development of the health infrastructure of Delhi. However, certain private hospitals are indulging in malpractices even in these distressing times,” he added.He said testing of coronavirus had not been stopped and currently 36 government and private labs were doing the tests.Ganga Ram Hospital booked for violationsNew Delhi: A case was registered against Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here on the charge of violating the ICMR guidelines on coronavirus testing following a state government complaint.

This could change with greater understanding. He said: “Australia advocates a free-and-open Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and for economic prosperity according to rules and not pursuing ‘might is right’ as is being seen.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/strategic-engagement-cornerstone-of-india-australia-ties-envoy-95717

07-06-2020||Roopinder Singh||An officer and a gentleman||Ved Prakash Marwah was a leader of uncommon grace and courage. He tackled various challenges, thrown his way during his long and distinguished career, with aplomb. Gentle in demeanour and firm in convictions, he served as a police officer, an administrator, adviser and Governor of three states.His family moved from Peshawar in 1947 and was allotted a place in Delhi’s Khan Market. He studied economics at St Stephen’s College and joined the police in late 1950s. Marwah shot into news after the 1984 riots in Delhi when he headed an inquiry commission to investigate reports of alleged police connivance in the violence. He was then Additional Commissioner of Police, Delhi.His diligence in pursuing his assignment made many people uncomfortable. He seized police diaries and sent notices to various police officials who, in turn, slapped defamation cases against him. In mid-1985, he was abruptly asked not to proceed further and his files were taken from him. He, however, kept his handwritten notes and handed these over to the Ranganath Mishra Commission set up by the government.Regarded highly for his professionalism and courage, Marwah was not popular with the government of the day at that stage of his career. However, the Punjabi community and Sikhs held him in high esteem.Given his seniority and record, he became Commissioner of Police in Delhi (1985-1988) and helped introduce police reforms. However, there was an incident involving breach of security of the motorcade of a visiting Russian dignitary on his watch. He took the fall.He was later awarded the Padma Shri and served as the Governor of Manipur and Jharkhand with the additional charge of Mizoram and Bihar. He was Adviser to the Government of Jammu and Kashmir during Jagmohan’s tenure. He held several senior positions, including Convener, Internal Security, National Security Council Advisory Board; Special Secretary, Internal Security, Union Ministry of Home Affairs; Director-General, National Security Guard; Commissioner of Police Delhi; Joint Secretary, National Police Commission; First Secretary, High Commission of India, London; and Deputy Commissioner of Police, Calcutta (now Kolkata).His integrity and no-airs demeanour impressed many. While Commissioner of Police in Delhi, his wife Kamal, a former Miranda House student, who taught at the Polytechnic in South Delhi, would take a DTC bus to reach home. He and his family often had a security cover, but it was discreetly done. In later years, it was withdrawn at his request.Besides his seminal “India in Turmoil — J&K, Left Extremism and Northeast, and Uncivil Wars —Pathology of Terrorism in India”, Marwah wrote extensively on security issues. He wrote a prescient article in the special series that The Tribune published to mark 55 years of Independence, titled: “Using, misusing police for partisan ends: Law enforcer, yes; law unto itself, no” (March 13, 1998).He was a well-rounded, grounded individual who will be remembered for his accomplishments during his appointments as well as for his writing and personality. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, Deepali and Shefali, and his son, Amitabh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/an-officer-and-a-gentleman-95722

While the legal age of marriage for women is 18 years, for men it is 21 years.The health argument behind raising the age of marriage among women is that child bearing at lower ages leads to complications thereby increasing infant and maternal mortality. The fertility argument behind the move is—higher age of marriage means lesser number of reproductive years for women. The taskforce has been asked to also suggest legislative amendments to support its recommendations besides laying down timelines by when the recommendations must be implemented.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had, during the Budget Speech 2020-21, announced, “Women’s age of marriage was increased from 15 years 18 eighteen years in 1978 by amending erstwhile Sharda Act of 1929. As India progresses further, opportunities open up for women to pursue higher education and careers. There are imperatives of lowering MMR as well as improvement of nutrition levels. Entire issue about the age of a girl entering motherhood needs to be seen in this light. I propose to appoint a task force that will present its recommendations in six months’ time.”The ten-member taskforce will have as members Secretaries Health, Women and Child Development, Law and School Education. Three independent members are Najma Akhtar (New Delhi); Vasudha Kamath (Maharashtra); and Dipti Shah (Gujarat).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-set-to-revise-womens-legal-age-for-marriage-95664
