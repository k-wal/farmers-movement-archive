To counter the low volume of blood going into the apheresis machine, we filled the dead spaces with compatible RBC, and to reduce the fluid overload, we determined and monitored the volume of the fluid going into the body of the child,” said Dr C. Shivaram, consultant, transfusion medicine.However, the allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was successful and Ahmed has now recovered from the sickle-cell disease.“He did have few complications after transplantation like mucositis, febrile neutropenia, and viral reactivation, which were successfully managed,” Dr Kalashetty said.He further added that Ahmed’s quality of life has improved significantly and his parents are overjoyed to see their son doing so well after suffering from the illness for several years.

13-09-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus genomes in India have 5.39 pc mutation similarity with 72 nations||Coronavirus genomes in India have 5.39 per cent mutation similarity with 72 nations, found a study by a group of researchers trying to identify the genetic variability and potential molecular targets in the virus and humans to find the best possible answer for combating COVID-19.Mutations in an organism’s genetic material are natural ‘errors’ in the cell replication process that may give the virus new ‘powers’ of survival, infectivity, and virulence. It can affect the ability of vaccines and drugs to bind the virus, or to create a specific immune response against it.The study also reveals that the US, the UK and India are the top three nations with a geometric mean of 3.27 per cent, 3.59 per cent, and 5.39 per cent, respectively, of mutation similarity score with other 72 countries.Indrajit Saha, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of National Institute of Technical Teachers’ Training and Research, Kolkata, and his team have also developed a web-based COVID-Predictor to predict the sequence of viruses online on the basis of machine learning.The scientists are on track to identify the number of virus strains using single nucleotide polymorphism, spot the potential target proteins of the virus and human host based on protein-protein interactions, recognise candidate of synthetic vaccines based on conserved genomic regions that are highly immunogenic and antigenic and detect the virus miRNAs that are also involved in regulating human mRNA.They analysed 566 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes separately to find the genetic variability in terms of point mutation and single nucleotide polymorphism.The scientists have mainly found that 57 out of 64 SNPs are present in six coding regions of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and all are nonsynonymous in nature. This work has already been published in Infection, Genetics, and Evolution journal.They have extended this research for more than 10,000 sequences around the globe and found 20,260, 18,997, and 3514 unique mutation points globally, including India, excluding India and only for India, respectively with the similarity score as mentioned above. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-genomes-in-india-have-5-39-pc-mutation-similarity-with-72-nations-140780

13-09-2020||New Delhi||10 held, 2 juveniles apprehended by Delhi Police for defrauding people through e-comm platforms||The Delhi Police have arrested 10 people and apprehended two juveniles for allegedly cheating hundreds of people through e-commerce apps by posing as Army or paramilitary personnel, officials said on Sunday.The accused exploited the trustworthiness associated with the armed forces to cheat potential buyers or sellers. They also shared fake screenshots to lure their targets into scanning malicious Quick Response (QR) codes, they said.The accused, during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, had also cheated several people after putting advertisements on various social media platforms regarding home delivery of liquor.On being approached, they would request the potential buyer to pay in advance and would stop responding to their calls once the money was received, police said.“During investigation, the location of the accused was identified and raids were conducted, following which 10 of them were arrested,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber) Anyesh Roy said.Those arrested were identified as Husban (22), Hasib (24), Faisal (19), Sajid (27) Sabir (25) Shezad Khan (26), Aziz Akhtar (25) and Sakir (29), all residents of Nuh district in Haryana, Yashvir (26), a resident of Faridabad, and Salim (35) from Rajasthan, they said.Of the juveniles who were apprehended, one is from Rajasthan and the other belongs to Nuh, police said.The accused used two modes to dupe people of their money.Posing as Army or paramilitary personnel, they would post advertisements on e-commerce websites for sale of their goods, mostly cars and bikes. They would even post photographs of vehicles, mostly taken from the internet, that have either Indian Army or the name of a paramilitary force written on them, the DCP said.After striking a deal with the prospective buyer, they would tell the victim that the vehicle they have chosen cannot be released unless the “release amount” is paid, which they claimed is a rule in the Army or paramilitary force, police said.Once that amount is paid, they asked the victim to shell out more money on the pretext of transport and handling charges, GST, etc. After receiving the money, they cut off contact with the victim. The money was deposited either in a bank account or e-wallet account, Roy said.In the second mode, the accused impersonated Army or paramilitary personnel while contacting the seller of any second-hand good on e-commerce sites.Once the initial contact was established, they would agree to pay for the selected item. They would tell the target that the money is being transferred via e-wallet to their account and send them a fake screenshot generated with the help of a spoofing app, he said.When the victim complains of not receiving the amount, the accused would site some technical problem and request him/her to scan another QR code to get the money credited into the account, Roy said.Once the target scans the malicious QR code sent on his mobile, instead of getting the amount credited, it gets debited from their account, the DCP said.After the victim complains of the debit, the accused would apologise saying it was a mistake and ask the target that they would send a new QR code by scanning which they can get twice the amount to make up for the money that was erroneously transferred from the victim’s account, police said.  As soon as the victim scans that QR code, the amount gets debited from their account again. After that, they would stop responding to the victim, they said.SIM cards used in the crime were procured from Assam and Telangana.The inability of the fraudsters to communicate in English has resulted in their impact being mostly limited to the Hindi-speaking states, the DCP said.

So, the withdrawal of monsoon from west Rajasthan is unlikely to happen until September 24,” IMD director general Mrutunjay Mohapatra said.A low-pressure area has formed off the coast of Andhra Pradesh, while another one is expected to form by September 20, Mohapatra added.The IMD has also issued an orange colour alert for peninsular India.“A low-pressure area lies over the west-central Bay of Bengal off north Andhra Pradesh coast,” the IMD said.“It is likely to move west-northwestwards towards central India across Telangana during the next 2-3 days. The monsoon trough lies south of its normal position. An off-shore trough lies off south Gujarat coast to north Karnataka coast,” it said.Due to this, widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy showers are very likely over coastal Andhra Pradesh, Yanam and Telangana on September 13 and 14, over Vidarbha on September 15 and over Marathwada on September 16, the IMD added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-withdrawal-from-west-rajasthan-to-be-delayed-imd-140777

The states were advised to ensure facility wise/hospital wise oxygen inventory management and advance planning for replenishment so that there are no stockout, the health ministry said in a statement.They were urged to ensure that no restriction is imposed on the movement of medical oxygen between states and UTs, and provision of “green corridor” for Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) Tankers within the cities.Hospitals and institutions have long-term tender/contract agreement for supply of oxygen with manufacturers, which need to be honoured. Hence, states must not impose restrictions on free movement of oxygen, the statement underlined.Timely payment of dues to the manufacturers and suppliers to maintain uninterrupted supply of oxygen was stressed.States were urged to improve power supply infrastructure and ensure uninterrupted supply to Oxygen Manufacturing Units, ensure proper disinfection of oxygen cylinders as per protocols while sending cylinders to fillers of oxygen.They were also urged to ensure effective coordination with steel plants for oxygen procurement since steel plants provide approximately 550 MT/day oxygen in addition to oxygen manufacturers who provide 6,400 MT/day. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/7-big-states-urged-to-ensure-adequate-oxygen-availability-in-all-healthcare-facilities-140761
13-09-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Ahead of Hyderabad Liberation Day, BJP seeks memorial||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, September 13 There has been a growing demand to set up a Liberation Day memorial in Hyderabad to remember the merger of Hyderabad State into India in 1948. The demand was reiterated by the Union Minister G Kishan Reddy, who is also a BJP MP from Secundrabad by asking the Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) to make the memorial a reality. As the Liberation Day falls this week, Reddy has written a letter to KCR and released to the media where the Union Minister has asked the chief minister to allot land to build a memorial to commemorate the Telangana liberation struggle. He has written that present and future generations should know about the struggle and take inspiration.  It may be mentioned that the idea of observing and celebrating the Liberation Day does not go well with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Party, which is a friendly party for the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). The TRS has been evading responding to this demand in the past. The Union Minister has said people of Telangana wish to see a special memorial centre, highlighting the history of the state’s freedom fighter. Reddy has said he has discussed the matter with the Union Tourism Minister, who agreed to provide funds for the memorial.  The Liberation Day is a low-key affair in Hyderabad and is observed on September 17 by some political parties like the BJP. The Union Minister has also said the Centre was ready to establish a grand memorial centre, which would be an inspiration for future generations, if the land is allocated in Hyderabad. This is not for the first time that the demand for highlighting the Liberation Day has arisen. In 2016 to the TRS had rejected Vice President (then Union Minister) M Venkaiah Naidu’s suggestion to officially celebrate ‘Hyderabad Liberation Day’ on September 17. The TRS termed the move as an attempt at “divisive politics”.  The TRS stand on the issue has remained that “Telangana people do not believe in the Liberation Day. We believe in a day where Telangana state came into being”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-hyderabad-liberation-day-bjp-seeks-memorial-140758

13-09-2020||New Delhi||Expect Covid vaccine by early next year, will take first shot if any trust deficit: Vardhan||A COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be available by early next year and the government is considering its emergency authorisation for high-risk settings, Union Minister Harsh Vardhan Sunday said, asserting he will take the first dosage if there is any concern over its safety.According to a Health Ministry statement, he said while no date has been fixed for the launch of a vaccine, it may be ready by the first quarter of 2021, and made available first to those who need it the most, irrespective of their paying capacity. The minister made these remarks during interaction with his social media followers on the ‘Sunday Samvad’ platform.He covered a multitude of queries concerning not only the current COVID-19 situation, but also the government’s approach to it, the changes expected in the post COVID world and the steps taken by the Modi dispensation.Vardhan stated the government is taking full precautions in human trials of vaccines and the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 under the Chairmanship of Dr V K Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, is drawing up a detailed strategy on how to immunize the majority of the population.“Issues like vaccine security, cost, equity, cold-chain requirements, production timelines etc., are also been discussed intensely,” he stated.Further, he said the government is considering emergency authorisation of COVID-19 vaccination especially for senior citizens and people working in high-risk settings.“This shall be done after a consensus has been reached,” he was quoted as saying the statement.To allay any fear regarding the safety aspect of vaccines, he said he would be happy to take the first dosage “if people have a trust deficit”.On vaccine candidates and their development in the country, he said India is actively partnering with Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and trials of several vaccines at different phases are underway at laboratories (private or public) and hospitals.The Department of Biotechnology and the Indian Council of Medical Research have been proactive in responding to the emerging situation, he said.It is hoped that a consensus will emerge in the next few months over the desired level of protective herd immunity in any community, he said.The minister, however, also noted that a safe and effective vaccine will help in establishing immunity to COVID-19 at a much faster pace as compared to the natural infection, the statement said.Vardhan highlighted how the pandemic became a turning point for Indian manufacturing.“From the time when there were no indigenous manufacturers of PPEs with requisite standards, now there are nearly 110 indigenous manufacturers of PPE with requisite standards. The country is in a position to not only meet its own demands but also export to help out fellow nations,” Vardhan said.Vardhan said the government has directed all states and UTs to fix a reasonable price for COVID-19 treatment in private hospitals for making it affordable for the common man.Free coverage up to Rs 5 lakh for COVID-19 patients for those who are eligible under the Ayushman Bharat PMJAY package was announced, the statement said.He added that the Central government has also asked states and UTs to proactively engage with the private sector health providers and consider pooling in public and private healthcare facilities, as this will help in providing prompt, good quality and reasonable health care to COVID-19 patients.He has himself appealed to the private hospitals to refrain from overcharging COVID patients, the statement stated.The minister said measures have been taken to ensure accessibility and affordability of all drugs and other therapeutics to all, irrespective of their paying capacities.The government has taken cognisance of reports of alleged black-marketing of drugs like Remdesivir and has asked the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to take suitable action along with their state counterparts.Vardhan stated the government is seized of the evolving nature of the infection and emerging evidence of the systemic health complications in those who have been infected.AIIMS and other research institutions have been asked to undertake research to study the long-term impact of COVID-19, he stressed.The ICMR is establishing a National Clinical Registry on COVID-19 that will provide insights into clinical course of COVID-19 disease, its spectrum and outcome of patients.Expert group consultations are already going on to review the emerging evidence and generate own data on organ system specific (respiratory system, renal system, cardiovascular and gastro-intestinal) sequela of COVID-19, he stated.Allays fears on digital health missionOn the recently-launched National Digital Health Mission, he said it is one of the most ambitious missions of the government and is set to catapult India as a global leader in the field of digital health.“However, there are vested interests that do not want India to succeed and are spearheading a disinformation campaign against NDHM,” he said.He said it is an “utter lie” that those who do not become part of this system shall not be allowed to access hospitals.“Those persons or institutions who are not a part of this system shall continue to enjoy access to the healthcare system in exactly the same manner as they are doing now. Participation in the digital health ecosystem shall be totally optional and shall never be made mandatory for individuals,” he underscored. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/expect-covid-vaccine-by-early-next-year-will-take-first-shot-if-any-trust-deficit-vardhan-140750
13-09-2020||New Delhi||DGCA: Flyers can take photos, videos in flights but can’t use recording gadgets leading to ‘chaos’||Clarifying further on its Saturday order relating to in-flight photography, the aviation regulator DGCA on Sunday said passengers can take photos and videos inside aircraft but can’t use any recording equipment that “creates chaos, disrupts flight operations, violates safety norms or is banned by the crew members”.On last Friday, the aviation regulator had asked IndiGo to take “appropriate action” after it found alleged violation of safety and social-distancing protocols by media persons in the airline’s Chandigarh-Mumbai flight that had actor Kangana Ranaut as a passenger.The DGCA order today “clarified that a bona fide passenger travelling in an aircraft engaged in scheduled air transport services may do still and video photography from inside such an aircraft while in flight; take off and landing” as per its circular dated December 9, 2004.“However, this permission does not include use of any recording equipment which imperils or compromises air safety; violates prevalent norms; creates chaos or disruption during operation of flight or expressly prohibited by crew,” the DGCA order said, adding that action may be “initiated against those persons found in violation of above guidelines”.Today’s order is a clarification on top of the yesterday’s order which had said, “It has been decided that from now on, in case any violation (photography) occurs on any scheduled passenger aircraft - the schedule of flight for that particular route shall be suspended for a period of two weeks from the next day (of the incident).”Yesterday’s order stated that as per Rule 13 of the Aircraft Rules 1937, no person is allowed to take any photographs inside a flight except when permission is granted by the DGCA or the Civil Aviation Ministry.As per the DGCA rules, an airline can put an “unruly passenger” on its “no-fly list” for a certain period of time after an internal enquiry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-flyers-can-take-photos-videos-in-flights-but-cant-use-recording-gadgets-leading-to-chaos-140749
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Kangana meets Maharashtra Guv, talks about ‘injustice’ done to her||Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut, who is locked in a bitter battle with the ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, on Sunday met state Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari here and told him about the “injustice” done to her.The meeting came days after the Shiv Sena-ruled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished alleged illegal alterations at Kangana’s bungalow at Pali Hill in suburban Bandra.Read also: Raut slams BJP for backing actorTalking to reporters after the meeting that took place at the Raj Bhavan, the actor said, “I met the governor. He heard me as a daughter. I came to meet him as a citizen. I have nothing to do with politics.”“I told him about the injustice meted out to me and what happened was improper. It was indecent behaviour,” she said.The trouble between the Sena and Kangana started after the actor recently said she feared the Mumbai police more than the “movie mafia” and likened the Maharashtra capital to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).The 33-year-old actor, who returned to Mumbai on Wednesday from her home state Himachal Pradesh the same day as her house was partially demolished by the civic body, had alleged that the Maharashtra government was targeting her because of her clash with the Sena.On Friday, the “Queen” actor had urged Congress president Sonia Gandhi to intervene and stop the “harassment of women”. In a tweet, she had asked Gandhi if she was not anguished by the treatment given by the Maharashtra government, in which the Congress is also a part. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kangana-meets-maharashtra-guv-talks-about-injustice-done-to-her-140746
13-09-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury                                                                                       ||No Rajya Sabha poll this time to spoil Adhir Ranjan’s party||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, September 13Newly-elected WBPCC chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, whose appointment to the important post has made the CPI(M) visibly happy,  is said to be glad that no Rajya Sabha election is slated to take place in the state before next year’s assembly general elections.The next round of elections for Rajya Sabha vacancies from West Bengal will take place only in August 2023 and that is good news for Chowdhury who is keen on striking up an alliance with the CPI(M)-led Left parties for the assembly elections.Rajya Sabha elections held in the state in August 2017 (six seats) and then in April 2018 (five vacancies) had both left a sour taste for Chowdhury who was then in his first stint as the WBPPC chief.  Congress candidates P Bhattacharya and Abhishek Manu Singhvi got elected to the Rajya Sabha from West Bengal in 2017 and 2018, respectively, with support from the ruling TMC.On both occasions there was talk about the two largest opposition parties in the state coming together with the Congress supporting a CPI(M) candidate. However, the Congress high command had other ideas and ultimately candidates put up by the Congress, the largest opposition party in the state, won the polls with the ruling TMC transferring its spare votes in favour of the Congress candidate. In the latest Rajya Sabha elections in the state held earlier this year, Congress MLAs did vote for CPI(M) candidate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and ensured his victory. Ironically, late Somen Mitra, whose opposition to the TMC was considered more muted compared to Adhir, was the WBPCC chief then.“The naming of Adhir Chowdhury as the state Congress president has given a ray of hope to all those in the state who are looking forward for an alliance between Congress and CPI(M) for deliverance from the BJP government at the Centre and the TMC-led state government,” CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Mohhamed Salim said.Sujan Chakraborty, leader of the CPI(M) in West Bengal Assembly, said the BJP has been growing in strength in the state because of the policies followed by the ruling Trinamool Congress. “With Adhir Chowdhury at the helm at WBPCC, Congress party and the Left parties together will throw a befitting challenge to the communal BJP and autocratic TMC,” Chakraborty said.CPI(M) and Congress party had agreed for seat adjustment in the 2016 Assembly general elections also. This time the two parties want to go one step further and form an alliance before the assembly polls.Left and Congress, however, failed to arrive at an understanding in the 2019 parliament general elections following disagreement over some of the constituencies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-rajya-sabha-poll-this-time-to-spoil-adhir-ranjans-party-140742
13-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi slum eviction: COVID pandemic took away everything, now roof being taken away, say residents||The COVID-19 pandemic took away her family’s livelihood and now 48-year-old Veeramma fears she will lose her roof in the wake of the Supreme Court ordering the removal of 48,000 slum dwellings along railway tracks in Delhi.“My husband was born here. My son was born here. My in-laws breathed their last in this house. This is all we have,” said Veeramma as she sat on crushed stones outside her home at a slum cluster alongside a railway track near Jal Vihar in Lajpat Nagar.The 48-year-old, who works as a domestic help, said her employers haven’t called her back to work yet.“My husband cannot move. My son is a daily wager, he doesn’t have much work, too. We don’t have enough ration to feed the family for another week,” said Veeramma looking at her two-year-old granddaughter, a third generation to be born in the slum cluster.“We don’t have the money for my granddaughter’s milk. Even if we beg, we won’t get anything. The times were never so bad,” she said.The Supreme Court had on August 31 ordered the removal of 48,000 slum dwellings along railway tracks in Delhi within three months. As per rough estimates, there are around 2,40,000 people living in slums in Naraina Vihar, Azadpur, Vihar, Shakur Basti, Mayapuri, Sriniwaspuri, Anand Parbat and Okhla among others.The Northern Railways had submitted a report to the apex court which said that mushrooming of slums along railway tracks is acting as hindrance towards keeping them clean.Panchavarna, 55, said her family had moved to Delhi from Chennai.“We know the land belongs to the government, but where will we go? Who will take our responsibility,” she asked.Elumalai, 35, reminded the government’s promise of “jahan jhuggi wahin makan” made before the elections.“We do not say we won’t accept the court’s order. This land belongs to the railways and they will take it one day, but where will we go? No one cares for us,” Elumalai, whose father came to Delhi from Chennai in 1978, said.Interestingly, each household in the slum has got electricity connection, Aadhaar card, voter ID, and ration card.   The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had built community toilets for the slum dwellers last year, so that no one defecates in the open or on the tracks, said 45-year-old Shankar Sarangam, a driver who did not get a salary for three months during the COVID-19-induced lockdown.“The salary has been reduced by half. I have a family to feed. We were thankful to god that we have a roof over our head,” he said.“Now the jhuggi will be gone, too. The railways should have at least considered the timing of the move. The impact of the pandemic will linger on for another three years,” Sarangam said.In another slum along the railway tracks in Sriniwaspuri, Ramnadhar Mandal, 40, asks, “Why do politicians ask for votes if they cannot rehabilitate us?”“Where do we go – to the footpath?” Mandal, who hails from Bihar’s Katihar district, has two baby girls who are learning to walk.“Think of these children. We will have to spend nights in the open, in rains and winters,” he said, clasping his hands together, as if making a request to the government.  Gunodhar Mandal, 60, who came to Delhi from West Bengal’s Malda district 25 years ago is not very hopeful of a “proper rehabilitation”.“I am afraid we will be asked to leave the city and go back to the village. We have nothing left there,” he said.AAP, BJP attack each otherThe matter has taken a political tone with the Aam Aadmi Party targeting the Bharatiya Janata Party for eviction notices being issued by the railways.AAP spokesperson and MLA Raghav Chadha on Friday tore eviction notices sent to the residents and said no one could raze their shanties “till Kejriwal is alive”.The Delhi BJP has alleged that despite being in power for over five years, the AAP has done little to rehabilitate people living in slums in the city.The Arvind Kejriwal government says the railways cannot demolish the slum clusters along the train tracks without providing alternative accommodation to its inhabitants in accordance with the provisions of Delhi Slum and JJ Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015.On its part, Railways said it was working in line with the orders of the Supreme Court, but refused to elaborate further on the issue.In a letter to the railways on Thursday, the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), headed by Chief Minister Kejriwal, said that according to the 2015 policy, the rehabilitation work has to be undertaken by the agency which owns the encroached land.However, DUSIB also said it can undertake rehabilitation work but the railways will have to pay for the cost of land and construction as well as relocation charges ranging from Rs 7.55 Lakh to Rs 11.30 Lakh per flat.The agency also provided a list of over 29,000 completed housing units and another 16,600 under construction ones available with the Delhi government.These houses were constructed in different parts of the city, including Narela, Bawana, Baprola, Sultanpuri and other places, under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) between 2007 and 2019.The DUSIB has said the 29,257 completed flats will be ready to move in by March-April 2021, while the under construction 16,600 flats at Tikri and Pooth Khurd will be ready by December 2021. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-slum-eviction-covid-pandemic-took-away-everything-now-roof-being-taken-away-say-residents-140741

13-09-2020||New Delhi||PIL in SC to for steps to improve India’s global ranking on Corruption Perception Index||A PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Centre, states and union territories to set up expert committees to suggest steps for improving India’s “pathetic” ranking on the global Corruption Perception Index.India has been ranked at the 80th position among 180 countries and territories in the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) prepared by Transparency International. It is based on perceived levels of public sector corruption in these countries, according to experts and business people.The public interest litigation filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Upadhyay sought the constitution of expert committees to examine good practices of the countries, ranked among the top 20 in the Corruption Perception Index, and take steps to weed out bribery, black money generation, etc.Besides all states and the UTs, Upadhyay, in his PIL filed through lawyer Ashwani Kumar Dubey, has made the Law Commission of India and the ministries of Home Affairs and Law and Justice as parties.The plea has also sought a direction to the Law Commission to suggest steps to remove the menace of corruption, black money generation and ‘benami’ transaction, and improve India’s ranking in Corruption Perception Index.“The injury caused to people is extremely large because corruption is an insidious plague, having a wide range of corrosive effects on the country.“It undermines democracy and rule of law, leads to violations of human rights, distorts markets, erodes the quality of life and allows organised crime like separatism, terrorism, naxalism, radicalism, gambling, smuggling, kidnapping, money laundering and extortion and other threats to human security to flourish,” the plea said.It said corruption hurts the poor disproportionately by diverting funds intended for development, undermines the government’s ability to provide basic services, seeds inequality and injustice and discourages foreign aids & investment.The petition said that due to massive corruption, even after 73 years of independence, 50 per cent population is in distress and facing hardships in livelihood.The PIL contended that the “rule of law” guaranteed under the Constitution can’t be secured without curbing corruption but the Centre and the states are “not taking appropriate steps” to weed-out the menace.“India’s poor ranking in Corruption Perception Index confirms the Centre and states’ poor performance on many fronts viz. absence of corruption, violation of fundamental rights, lack of transparency, serious threat public order and security, pathetic regulatory enforcement and ineffective civil and criminal justice system,” the plea said.

13-09-2020||New Delhi||‘Criminalising peaceful protests’: CPI (M) on supplementary Delhi riots chargesheet||The CPI(M) on Sunday criticised the government over the reference to its leader Sitaram Yechury and some civil society members in a supplementary chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police which cites statements from some accused to say that they mobilised anti-CAA protestors.“The CPI(M) condemns this obnoxious action by the Delhi Police to further the narrative of its political masters and urges the government to desist from such acts of criminalising peaceful political protests,” the Communist Party of India (Marxist) Politburo said in a statement.The reaction came a day after it was reported that the names of CPI(M) general secretary Yechury, Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav, economist Jayati Ghosh and Delhi University professor Apoorvanand figure in the supplementary chargesheet in the February riots cases, allegedly for “provoking and mobilising” anti-CAA protesters.The Sunday statement by the Politburo said it was “shocked by the brazenness with which the Delhi Police, acting under Home Minister Amit Shah, has tried to implicate prominent political leadership, academics, cultural personalities and activists in connection with the horrific communal violence in North East Delhi in February”.“No condemnation is strong enough for this act of crude partisanship and vengeance,” the statement said.It also alleged that it was clear “the BJP-RSS has gone about portraying Delhi riots being a deep-rooted conspiracy” by anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters.“This is in line with the growing pattern of the most blatant abuse of the police and other central agencies like CBI, NIA, ED to frame prominent opponents and demonise them.“The pattern includes slapping of provisions of draconian NSA, UAPA and Sedition Act to harass and incarcerate those who vigorously oppose such blatant misuse of powers by the government contrary to that as ordained by the Constitution,¨ it said. The CPI (M) also demanded unconditional release of “political prisoners who are incarcerating in cases under trumped up charges”.“The Politburo urges its units all over the country and appeals to all the parties, organisations and individuals who are committed to democracy and values of the Constitution, to protest this dastardly attack on democracy,” the statement said.Delhi Police sources had on Saturday downplayed the entire matter, saying one of accused had disclosed these names in their disclosure statement.The Delhi Police has not filed a chargesheet “against” them, the sources had said.“The disclosure statement has been truthfully recorded as narrated by the accused person. A person is not arraigned as an accused only on the basis of disclosure statement,” a police PRO had said.

13-09-2020||Patna||Raghuvansh Prasad Singh: A blend of rustic aggression and learning||Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, the veteran socialist leader, who announced his decision to quit the RJD from his hospital bed just four days before his death, was an inimitable blend of rustic aggression and learning, qualities that helped him carve a niche for himself in Bihar politics.For years he lived under the shadow of his alter ego, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, while they together negotiated the choppy waters of state and national politics, but was not quite overshadowed by his leader.Also read: Former Union minister and RJD stalwart Raghuvansh Prasad Singh dies at 74An astute lawmaker, Singh would fish out 'Practice and Procedure of Parliament written by M N Kaul and S L Shakdher whenever a tricky situation arose, almost instinctively open the relevant page that would have the answer to end a logjam, and begin reading out in his quirky Hinglish that many found hilarious.No amount of interruption by fellow parliamentarians would deter him from completing what he had set out to say.Behind the rough and ready visage lay the analytical mind of a mathematics professor who always had his leader’s ears.Singh, however, died a disillusioned man and put in his papers from his hospital bed at AIIMS, New Delhi, on Thursday.“Since the death of Jannayak Karpoori Thakur, I stood behind you for 32 years, but not now,” he said in his brief one-line resignation letter to Prasad, who is serving sentences in four fodder scam cases in Ranchi.In the footnote, the once staunch Prasad loyalist, added,” I got the affection of party leaders and workers, besides common people. Please forgive me.”    Thakur was a prominent socialist leader and former state chief minister.Hours later, Prasad wrote back from jail in complete disbelief.“I don’t believe....a letter purportedly written by you is on social media. I, my family, and the RJD family that have nursed the party want you to get well soon and be amongst us,” Prasad wrote back.“For four decades, we have together discussed political, social and even family matters. You get well soon and we will discuss again. You are not going anywhere, you understand,” Prasad wrote in a handwritten letter that had the stamp of the prison authority.Prasad apparently rejected his resignation, but no discussion could take place between them, and Singh indeed left forever.The same day he also wrote to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar about the projects in his constituency Vaishali, the first republic in the world, which he represented five sucessive times till 2014, when he was defeated by LJP’s Rama Singh. He again lost in 2019.In a moving tribute to the departed leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who received the news of his death when he was inaugurating a string of petroleum sector schemes for Bihar, called him a grassroots leader with deep understanding of poverty and problems of the poor.“I will request Nitish Kumar to execute the development projects he wrote about in the letter. Let’s together—the state and the Centre—fulfil his wishes,” Modi said, while referring to Singh’s letter to the chief minister.Singh cut his teeth in politics in Samyukta Socialist Party, before he became a member of the Bihar assembly in 1977.He represented Belsand assembly seat multiple times and was also the chairman of the Bihar Legislative Council before making his Lok Sabha debut in 1996.It was under his stewardship of the Union Rural Development Ministry that NREGA, the flagship rural livelihood scheme was implemented.Notwithstanding his political successes, he kept himself away from the trappings of power.He would love to have a chat with his constituents reclining on a charpoy sipping tea, and pronouncing ticket as ‘tikas’, like an obscure, unlettered villager from Bihar.Not that he did not know. He just like it that way. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/raghuvansh-prasad-singh-a-blend-of-rustic-aggression-and-learning-140724

Poly-therapy is to be avoided due to potential for unknown drug-drug interaction, which may lead to Serious Adverse Events or Adverse Effects,” the protocol says.The patients who had undergone home isolation, if they complain of persisting symptoms, have been told to visit the nearest health facility.Severe cases requiring critical care support will need more stringent follow-up, the protocol says.The ministry acknowledged it has been observed that after acute COVID-19 illness, recovered patients may continue to report wide variety of signs and symptoms, including fatigue, body ache, cough, sore throat and difficulty in breathing, saying the recovery period is likely to be longer for patients who suffered from more severe form of the disease and those with pre-existing illness.A holistic approach is required for follow-up care, says the protocol which is not to be used as a preventive or curative therapy.At the individual level, the protocol asks people to continue COVID appropriate behaviour (use of mask, hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing); drink adequate amount of warm water (if not contra-indicated); take immunity promoting AYUSH medicine on the prescription of a qualified AYUSH practitioner; if health permits, regular household work to be done and mild and moderate exercise including walk as comfortable.Daily practice of yogasana, pranayama; balanced nutritious diet, preferably easy to digest freshly cooked soft diet; adequate sleep and rest; avoidance of smoking and alcohol have also been advised.The protocol further asks recovered patients to take regular medications and advises self-health monitoring vitals at home, including temperature, blood sugar and oxygen levels.

The external affairs minister, however, had written this book before the military standoff in eastern Ladakh began in early May."If there is a common approach, it is of them simultaneously strengthening capacities internally, assessing the external landscape and seeking understandings with China. In this overall exercise, India will occupy a special place by virtue of its size, location, potential, history and culture," Jaishankar writes.He says this book, published by HarperCollins India, was developed in the course of the last two years through a series of events and lectures given at think tanks, conferences or business forums form its core. According to Jaishankar, much has changed, mostly to India's disadvantage, since November 1950, when Sardar Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru had a famous exchange of views on how to approach China. "The key issues -- realism versus optimism and bilateralism versus globalism -- remain as relevant today as then. Striking a judicious balance is not necessarily easier with the passage of time. But the past also tells us that there is always room for strategy and vision if we are to go beyond politics and constraints. More than on any other relationship in the world today, the long view must prevail," he writes.He is of the view that the India-China relationship will always take into account the larger context as they establish an equilibrium. "World events determine not just China's overall attitude but its specific demeanour towards India. Currently, this context is dominated by global frictions and systemic differences. It is, therefore, necessary for India to continuously monitor this larger picture as it calibrates its China relationship," the former diplomat suggests.He believes China's powerful rise is among the multiple factors that have led to a more uncertain world. "As the politics of this era evolves, neither country has an interest in allowing the other to become a card against them. Making sure of that will depend on their own policies. One concern is that unlike on the rest of world, India's rise has been partly lost on a China that has been growing five times faster," he says. "It is up to India to ensure that its enhanced standing is given due weight," he adds.Jaishankar also says that the future of the Indo-Pacific lies in a complex range of forces interacting on a continuous basis. "For India, it will be an important element of its relationship with China and its partnership with the West. New possibilities could be opened up with Russia, whose maritime interests may grow with the viability of Arctic commerce. The importance of the Indo-Pacific to ties with Japan, ASEAN and Australia clearly cannot be underestimated," he writes.On life after COVID-19, he says India too will be shaped by the broad trends in the global environment that the coronavirus will intensify. "But more than that, it needs to take into account the more direct consequences of the pandemic. Its destructive impact naturally demands a strategy of national revival. And that, in turn, warrants a fundamental rethink about our growth model," Jaishankar says.

I understand it is the most important event of anyone's life, but I could not imagine going away from my district where the average positive cases is about 100 and I am fighting to save lives," Jalli told PTI over phone.Her family, in-laws, especially the groom, appreciated her decision.The groom, Aditya Shashikant, who is from Pune, came to Silchar well in advance so that he could remain in mandatory quarantine, following the local COVID-19 protocols.The wedding took place on Wednesday, an Assam government holiday, with no pandal or decorative lights but only Carnatic music playing in the background.About 800 family members and friends watched the wedding through Zoom video app from different parts of the country as well as abroad."My parents could not come from Hyderabad as they were recuperating from COVID after both of them tested positive. Only my younger sister was on my side at the wedding," Jalli said.All friends and families, who attended the marriage through Zoom app, dressed up like they were at the venue, just to cheer up the couple.The young DC invited a few colleagues and friends from her district Cachar and Hailakandi, where she was posted earlier till May.All of the guests were given staggered timing and at no point of time, more than 20 people were present at her bungalow as per the existing COVID protocol.Interestingly, most of Jalli's colleagues did not know that she was getting married and they were invited to her bungalow on the pretext of a 'Ganesh Puja' and all of them realised about the wedding only after they arrived at her residence.Jalli attended office on Tuesday and again on Thursday, a day after the marriage, when she visited the Silchar Medical College Hospital to take stock of the hospital infrastructure amid the spike in COVID cases in the Barak valley.In between, on the wedding day too, she was attending official phone calls and kept giving several administrative instructions.Ever since she has joined Cachar, Jalli has been working for capacity enhancement of the Silchar Medical College, other hospitals in the district and improving critical health infrastructure.In her earlier posting in neighbouring Hailakandi, Jalli was known for her commendable work related to healthcare, women welfare and bringing harmony between communities, after a few incidents of communal strife."I had received phenomenal love and respect for my work in Hailakandi," she said.Hailakandi, bordering Bangladesh, was lacking in different development parameters and considered to be a socially sensitive district.In her previous posting as the Sub Divisional Officer at Titabor in Jorhat, Jalli had undertaken an innovative scheme, 'Bhoni' (younger sister) to enhance women participation in election for which she was honoured by the then President Pranab Mukherjee in 2016. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assams-cachar-dc-refuses-to-go-on-leave-for-wedding-as-covid-19-cases-spike-instead-groom-flies-in-140718
13-09-2020||New Delhi||Around 85 to 90% students appear for NEET examination: Pokhriyal||Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Sunday said that “around 85 to 90 per cent” students who registered themselves for the NEET UG examination appeared today.“NTA informed me that around 85-90%  students appeared in NEET exam today. I sincerely thank all Chief Ministers and DG NTA for proper arrangements made to facilitate student participation. NEET participation reflects the tenacity and grit of young AtmaNirbharBharat,” Pokhriyal said.The National Testing Agency had implemented a comprehensive plan to hold NEET UG examination amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Over 15 lakh candidates had registered for the examination conducted today.NTA informed me that around 85-90% students appeared in #NEET exam today. I sincerely thank all Chief Ministers and @DG_NTA for proper arrangements made to facilitate student participation. #NEET participation reflects the tenacity and grit of young #AtmaNirbharBharat .NEET was held on Sunday amid strict precautions in view of the COVID-19 pandemic at over 3,800 centres across the country with students queuing up as per their designated time slots, adhering to social distancing norms. The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) began at 2 pm, but entry to centres started at 11 am. Students were allotted different slots for entry to ensure there is staggered movement and social distancing is maintained.Over 15 lakh candidates have registered for NEET, which was earlier postponed twice in view of the pandemic.Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' wished luck to the candidates appearing for the exam and assured that arrangements are in place for their safety."I wish luck to candidates appearing for NEET today. I am confident that students will appear for the exam with confidence and follow all guidelines. All states have made required arrangements to ensure hygiene and safety of students as per guidelines," he tweeted.Mohammad Ovais, who came from Moradabad to his exam centre in Dilshad Garden here, said his entry slot was at 11 am."I left from Moradabad at 5 am. It is not that risky if everybody follows all precautions, the problem arises when people take it casually. There was no crowding at the centres as everybody had designated slots," he said.Vanhika Chaurasia, a resident of Rohini said, "Online exam would have been a better option than a pen and paper-based test but we have no option. More delay in exams would have caused the loss of a year".For Yuvraj Kumar, the bigger concern was travelling by public transport."Thankfully metro services resumed before the exam because I was concerned about that and other modes of public transport are not as safe. We were given separate masks at the centre and we had to dispose of the one we were wearing before," he said.Ajmal Ismail, who is appearing for the exam at a Mayur Vihar centre said, "More than the coronavirus it was the anxiety whether exams are happening or will still be postponed, that caused me more stress. I have done my preparation well and taken all precautions." Till Saturday 5 pm more than 15 lakh of the 15.97 lakh registered candidates downloaded their admit cards. Various state governments had announced free transportation and accommodation, including West Bengal that ran special metro service for candidates. The exam has been postponed twice due to the pandemic and the government decided to go ahead with the exams, despite opposition, to mitigate any further academic loss.The National Testing Agency (NTA) has set in place strict standard operating procedures (SOPs) in view of the pandemic, including measures like reducing the number of candidates per room from the earlier 24 to 12. The NTA has also increased the number of centres from 2,546 in 2019 to 3,862 this year to ensure crowd management and staggered entry and exit protocols. Unlike the engineering entrance (JEE), NEET-UG, the medical admission test, is a pen and paper exam and held once a year.Accordingly, the NTA has changed centres for a few candidates this week in compliance with social distancing norms and COVID restrictions. However, the city of the exam centre hasn't been changed for any candidate. The centres which had more than 900 candidates are distributed into two centres.While all the candidates were asked to go to the exam centres with masks and sanitisers, once they entered the centre, they were asked to use the three-ply masks provided by the examination authority.The NEET-UG was originally scheduled for May 3, but was pushed to July 26 and then scheduled for September 13. -- With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/around-85-to-90-students-appear-for-neet-examination-pokhriyal-140714

Road projects were frowned upon and people used to ask what do these have to offer those who walk on foot and do not have vehicles,” Modi said in a veiled reference to Prasad, who used to project himself as a luddite in what was viewed as a wily attempt to endear himself to the masses.“Such indifference to progress also took its toll on higher education. But the last 15 years have been of ‘sushasan’. Infrastructure has improved. New medical and engineering colleges, law institutes and polytechnics have come up. Nitish Kumar has a very important role to play in ensuring that the process continues,” Modi added.The BJP has declared it will contest the assembly polls in Bihar with Kumar as the coalition’s chief ministerial face.Referring to the coronavirus pandemic and the large-scale return of migrants that took place during the lockdown, Bihar accounting for a large part of them, Modi said, this crisis had also presented us with opportunities. We can think of new employment generation avenues by setting in motion rapid economic activity.Modi inaugurated the 193 km extension of the LPG pipeline from Durgapur in West Bengal to Banka in Bihar, and two LPG bottling plants in Banka and in East Champaran’s Harsiddhi.

It should also not be seen as a contest between two individuals.”He added: “In view of the great Parliamentary tradition, this election is about two different versions of our Parliamentary democracy: one, which only sees it as a numbers game, and the other, which places importance on critique, discussion, and consensus building in the interest of our country and its people.”He told The Tribune that he was “very hopeful that some of the parties outside opposition grouping will support me”. He went on to add: “I am requesting MPs support not simply to win an election, but to make a strong statement in favour of an accountable system of governance.”Jha said that the election for the post of deputy chairperson scheduled for September 14 — the first day of business in the COVID-affected session of the Parliament — is a chance for MPs to “stand up and be counted in front of the people of this country”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contesting-for-rajya-sabha-dy-chairpersons-post-to-keep-federalism-alive-manoj-jha-140705

But we will launch a strong resistance. TMC is scared of the growing support for the BJP,” he said.The Trinamool Congress said their party members were not involved in the death of Roy.Hooghly’s BJP MP Locket Chatterjee said, “This brutality needs to stop. Where are the champions of democracy and why are they silent on these never ending killing of BJP workers in West Bengal?”BJP workers blocked the Goghat-Arambagh Road for some time in protest against the incident before being dispersed by police.On July 28, a BJP booth president’s body was found hanging in Haldia in East Midnapore district.Before that incident, the body of BJP leader and Hemtabad MLA Debendra Nath Ray was also found hanging near his home in North Dinajpur district, amid allegations by his family and the party that it was a “cold-blooded murder by TMC”, a charge again denied by the ruling party which said that he had died by suicide, citing the post mortem report.Over the last few years, bodies of several BJP workers have been found hanging in different parts of the state.

The village is around 80 km from Gaya city, surrounded by forest area.Since there were no job avenues except agriculture, a large number of village’s youths migrated to bigger cities in search of livelihood. Bhuiya was unhappy that mostly women and children were left behind in his village.Bihar: A man has carved out a 3-km-long canal to take rainwater coming down from nearby hills to fields of his village, Kothilawa in Lahthua area of Gaya. Laungi Bhuiyan says, "It took me 30 years to dig this canal which takes the water to a pond in the village." (12.09.2020) pic.twitter.com/gFKffXOd8Y  Village headman Vishnupat Bhokta said: “In August 2001, he decided to dig a canal (Paain in local language) from a natural water source in Bagetha Sahwasi forest to the village. The villagers took their cattle generally to that source for watering, which also provided sustenance to the animals living in the forest area. Loungi knew that the water source was enough to irrigate the agricultural land of the villagers. However, it was a great challenge to bring water into the village.”“Loungi did a survey of the land and earmarked the canal route. After working relentlessly for 20 years, he managed to dig the canal that is four feet wide and three feet deep,” Bhokta added.“Just like Dashrath Manjhi, the villagers called him ‘mad’ when he went daily to dig the canal with traditional digging equipment,” the headman said.“Keeping in view of his herculean efforts, the district administration also came forward with aid. The administration has now named it Loungi Canal. He also dug up a small pond (Aahar in local language) to store water in the summers for irrigation and domestic consumption.”Dashrath Manjhi had cut out a road in the middle of the mountain in his native village Gehlaur with just a hammer and chisel in 22 years from 1960 to 1982. Due to his untiring efforts, the distance between Gahlaur and Wazirganj was reduced from 55 km to just 15 km.

Two of these are on agri-marketing and the third is on essential commodities. The Chief Ministers of agriculture-dominated namely Punjab and Chhattisgarh have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi against these ordinances and the Punjab Assembly had even passed a resolution against these.”Jairam said these three ordinances were not in favour of farmers and the farmer organisations were also opposing them.“Revenues of agri-dominant states will be negatively affected by these three ordinances. Private companies will benefit through corporate farming. The MSP regime is sought to be eliminated and also the public procurement system. We will not allow this attack on our food security pillars,” said Jairam, adding that Opposition parties had a broad understanding on opposing the four ordinances, which the Congress has decided to question vehemently.The three farm-related ordinances are based on the report by a committee headed by BJP’s Shanta Kumar in January 2015.“Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are already witnessing public demonstrations against these ordinances. Food security pillars will be finished if these are carried. Remunerative farm price structures will be adversely affected. Moreover, the Centre did not talk to the states about these ordinances when agriculture, we all know, is a state subject. No consultations took place and suddenly these ordinances came,” Jairam added.The fourth Bill replacing the ordinance the Congress will oppose is the Banking Regulation Act Amendment Bill, which Jairam said sought to undermine cooperative banks.This is against the states and the constitution, he said.The Congress said it would support the rest of the ordinances with some riders.While backing the Bill that seeks to cut salaries of the Member of Parliaments by 30 per cent for a year as a COVID austerity measure, the Congress said it would question the “wasteful Central Vista” project and oppose the suspension of the MPLADS funding for two years.“So many works of public importance are hanging fire. The MPLADS must be restored,” Jairam said.The Congress said while it would support the Taxation Amendment Bill, it would strongly oppose one provision in this bill whereby the PM CARES is sought to be exempted from the tax net.“We are against this. PM CARES is non-transparent. No CAG audit, no RTI is allowed for it. Many industrialists have given money to this fund and so have some Chinese firms as we learn from some reports. We will demand that if PM CARES has to stay it must be made transparent,” said the Congress leader.The Congress has also declared support to the bill replacing the Epidemic Diseases Amendment Ordinance, 2020, to make assault of health workers punishable and non-bailable and said it would seek answers from the government on COVID mismanagement.Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha business advisory committee met today and allocated time for important business.Rahul Gandhi not to attend sessionRahul Gandhi will not attend the Monsoon session for the initial few days and is away to the US with his mother Sonia Gandhi for her health check-up.

The veteran leader of Bihar, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, is no longer with us. I bow to him," Modi said at the outset of the inauguration of three metro projects in Bihar.Modi said that Raghuvansh 'Babu's' demise had created a void in the politics of Bihar and the country. "A person associated with land, a person who understood poverty, spent his entire life in the struggle of Bihar," the PM said.Union Home Minister Amit Shah said SIngh's dedication towards the welfare of the poor and deprived classes will be remembered forever."I am deeply saddened by the death of senior Bihar politician Raghuvansh Babu. His entire life was devoted to the ideas of Lohia ji and Karpoori Thakur ji. "His dedication to the welfare of the poor and deprived class will always be remembered. I express my condolences to his family.

What did you do?”Singh is credited with energising UPA’s landmark flagship scheme MGNREGA as the rural development minister, under the Congress-led dispensation headed by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.He also wrote a letter recently to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar asking him to pay attention to Vaishali and also to prominently displayed in public places the Vaishali relates verses of national poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar.The passing of Singh on the eve of Bihar elections is a body blow to RJD’s morale with senior leaders lamenting the loss.--with Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-union-minister-and-rjd-stalwart-raghuvansh-prasad-singh-dies-at-74-140690

The country’s supreme legislative body would convene in an unusual manner — staggered and separate — on account of the raging health pandemic.Three challengesThe Monsoon session comes in the backdrop of three challenges the country is facing at present — Covid-19, economic downslide and LAC stand-off.Since the unlock process commenced in early June, members from the Opposition sought meetings of the House in some form or the other with many suggesting virtual or hybrid sessions as many Parliaments elsewhere convened. Come September 14, the sittings start.The session, to be held on the 175th day after the sudden adjournment of the Budget session on March 23, would see members occupying seats in both the chambers while only one of the Houses will be in session and several measures are underway to secure the well-being of MPs, Secretariat, support staff and media personnel, with restricted access.Besides fulfilling the constitutional obligation of a Parliament session within 180 days, it comes in the backdrop of three serious challenges the country is in the grip of — Covid-19, economic downslide and continuing stand-off with China in Ladakh. The combined effect of all these remain a cause for concern.Notwithstanding, the controversy over the decision in this session to do away with the Question Hour, which provides an opportunity for every MP to elicit a response from the executive on its action, policies and programmes, there are any number of parliamentary devices for members to flag hot-button issues.By Sunday, the Business Advisory Committee of either House should have determined priority to be accorded to issues. This accommodative exercise permits the government to push forward its legislative agenda while the Opposition identifies issues it would like to debate and discuss.The session, which will run its course till October 1, affords an opportunity to the Opposition to get the best possible deal from the government on the issues it raised during the past five months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opportunity-for-oppn-as-session-reconvenes-140426

The litmus test for the Congress, however, is to accurately assess the public mood and catch the people’s imagination through transformative leadership. - Ashwani Kumar, Former Law MinisterThe restructuring lays the ground for the return of former party president Rahul Gandhi, as and when he chooses, with the majority of new appointees owning allegiance to him.Though three of the 23 leaders who recently wrote to Sonia on party overhaul have been accommodated in the revamp, their key demands have not been met.Dissenters had sought election to the powerful Congress Working Committee (CWC), but Sonia chose to go by the past convention of nominations for each of the 57 members of the reconstituted panel, which has 22 regular and 26 permanent members and nine special invitees. Second, the ginger group wanted the defunct Congress Parliamentary Board reconstituted, but it has not happened. Sonia has instead formed a special six-member committee for assistance till the next AICC session. Mukul Wasnik, one of the letter signatories, has been named in the panel, which is otherwise dominated by Sonia loyalists Ahmed Patel, AK Antony, Ambika Soni, Randeep Surjewala and KC Venugopal. The return of former Railway Minister Pawan Bansal to key roles is being seen as a signal to Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari, who has always coveted the Chandigarh LS nomination and has been Bansal’s rival in the Chandigarh politics.In a fine balancing act, Sonia has also ensured a fair mix of veterans and youngsters across party structures, so that the generational shift happens under the watch of experienced hands. Younger leaders have been preferred for strenuous party positions, including those of general secretaries and in charges where the expectation is to connect with the masses and the rank and file.

13-09-2020||---||Prashant Bhushan moves SC for right to appeal||New Delhi, September 12Activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on Saturday moved the Supreme Court (SC) seeking right to intra-court appeal to be heard by a larger and different Bench in contempt of court cases decided by the top court, saying the absence of appeal provision violated the principles of natural justice.Alternatively, the court should issue a direction declaring that review petitions filed against SC’s conviction orders in criminal contempt cases would be heard in open court by a different Bench, Bhushan submitted in his petition. “Contempt proceedings are one in which the injured party (Supreme Court) acts as the prosecutor, the witness and the judge, thereby raising fear of inherent bias. As a judge the power of the Supreme Court to convict and sentence the accused is unlimited and arbitrary… No one can be at once a suitor and a judge.Thus, there is a need for an intra-court appeal,” Bhushan submitted. The petition comes less than two weeks after the Supreme Court imposed a token fine of Re 1 on Bhushan, who was convicted for criminal contempt for his two tweets against the judiciary, saying he had attempted to “denigrate the reputation of the institution of administration of justice”.The conviction and sentence had come after Bhushan refused to apologise to the court. After the sentence was pronounced, he had announced that he would pay the fine and file a review petition.Bhushan is facing another criminal contempt case initiated in the top court 2009 for his statement in Tehelka magazine that half the 16 former CJIs were “corrupt”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prashant-bhushan-moves-sc-for-right-to-appeal-140422
