Registering his party’s “strong opposition” to what he called “open licence to stockholders and black marketers”, Mann said: “I am surprised he (Badal) is objecting to the Ordinances while his party is enjoying the powers of the ministry in the Centre. They (Akalis) should have sacrificed the ministry if they were so against the Ordinances, which they initially called ‘kamaal ka faisla’ and also invited Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar to speak in favour of.” Sukhbir Badal’s wife Harsimrat Kaur is Food Processing Industries Minister in the Narendra Modi Cabinet. Badal, who sought to establish the credentials of the Akali Dal as a party representing farmers, said when the government brought the three Ordinances in June “his party’s representative in the Union Cabinet expressed reservations”. “The government said the Ordinances were for benefit of farmers. In that case, these Ordinances should not have been brought in this way…they should have been brought after discussions.  As a farmers’ party, we have always spoken for the community,” he said, also invoking the contributions of his father Parkash Singh Badal as a farmers’ leader to press his claim. “Before bringing the Ordinances, parties and groups representing farmers should have been consulted. We were not asked before the Ordinances were brought in the Cabinet. Our representative in Cabinet said existing fears must be cleared. In the past two months I have talked to many farmers and arthtiyas and listened to their fears and suspicions regarding the Ordinances.”Badal added that the three Ordinances will affect farmers in Punjab and Haryana where ‘mandi system’ exists. “I don’t know about others but our fears have not been addressed,” he said, urging the government, of which Akali Dal is a part, to reconsider. “We are not under any pressure, this is our belief that these fears should be addressed first,” he asserted. In his reply, Minister of State Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Raosaheb Patil Danve said the legislation will help farmers progress, encourage those associated with the supply-chain and minimise processing and storage losses. “It will help in making of Atmanirbhar Bharat and ease of doing business,” he said. The minister also said changes in the Act conformed with recommendations of the high-level committee of which States like Punjab and Haryana was a part. “Members are saying States were not consulted. Let me inform that before bringing the Ordinances a high-power committee of Chief Ministers was formed. The committee included States like Punjab, Odisha, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh.  The CMs, after taking into consideration all issues decided such a bill should be brought,” he said, adding that Punjab was represented by the Agriculture Minister in the Amarinder Singh government.Earlier, several Opposition MPs, including Congress’ Fatehgarh Sahib MP Amar Singh insisted that the Bill will benefit big corporates and traders. “It is another attempt at coercive federalism to benefit to MNCs so that they can enter food trade,” they said. “The Ordinances are all connected, which is why farmers are protesting in Punjab and Haryana. The Punjab government and political parties have passed a resolution against Ordinances,” Amar Singh said registering strong opposition to the legislation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-consulted-before-3-agri-ordinances-bjp-ally-akali-dal-govt-says-states-were-in-the-loop-141638
15-09-2020||London||UK restores 3 idols stolen from Tamil Nadu temple back to India||A set of three idols of Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, stolen from a temple in Tamil Nadu decades ago, were restored to the Indian government on Tuesday after a collector voluntarily offered to hand it back on discovering their true history.The theft dates back to 1978 and led to an investigation by the Idol Wing of the Tamil Nadu Police working along with colleagues in the Metropolitan Police in London.The unnamed collector, who had acquired the statues in good faith, was informed about their dubious provenance by the Met Police.After matching them up with archival photographs from the 1950s held at the French School in Pondicherry, it was proved that the idols in his possession were those belonging to the Vijayanagara period and stolen from Sri Rajagopalaswami Temple at Ananthamangalam in Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu.In a ceremony streamed from India House in London in keeping with the limit on gatherings due to the COVID-19 restrictions, priests from Sri Murugan Temple in London conducted a short religious ceremony for their handover to India.“Today marks the successful completion of the search and rescue operation of these very beautiful idols, which were consecrated and worshipped side by side for years. We wanted to ensure these deities were handled with due reverence and propriety before they are shipped back to India,” said Indian High Commissioner to the UK Gaitri Issar Kumar.“On behalf of the government of India, I hope this will inspire museums and collectors to carefully look and check their collections and help us restore deities that belong to the people of India and have been worshipped for centuries,” she said.The UK-based collector behind the handover, who has chosen to stay anonymous, was described as a lover of Indian art and culture.Addressing the virtual event, officials from the state government of Tamil Nadu praised his voluntary intervention and expressed the hope that no further action will be taken against him.“The voluntary handover of these idols highlight two enforcement issues: the need for effective communication and dialogue, and the proper documentation of all cultural heritage, which would not only act as a deterrent to thefts but also help as evidence without which the outcome of this case may have been very different,” said Tim Wright, from the Metropolitan Police.Minister of Culture and Tourism Prahlad Singh Patel, connecting virtually to the event from Delhi, welcomed the repatriation of the statues, which he said was among over 40 “priceless” stolen artefacts restored to India since 2014.He also revealed that documentation from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and other experts has been collated for the British Museum as part of efforts to seek the repatriation of another idol which belongs in India.

15-09-2020||Washington||India, US sign statement of intent to strengthen dialogue on defence tech cooperation||India and the United States on Tuesday signed a statement of intent to strengthen the bilateral dialogue on defence technology co-operation.The statement was signed by Raj Kumar, Secretary, Defence Production, Ministry of Defence, and Ellen Lord, US Under Secretary of Defence for Acquisition and Sustainment, during the 10th Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) Group Meeting that was held virtually on Tuesday.Kumar and Lord co-chaired the meeting, during which the groups reported to the co-chairs on ongoing activities and collaborative opportunities, including a number of near-term projects targeted for completion on priority.As evidence of their commitment to demonstrating the success of DTTI, the co-chairs signed a statement of intent (SOI) that declared “to strengthen our dialogue on defence technology cooperation by pursuing detailed planning and making measurable progress” on several specific DTTI projects, the Pentagon said in a release.The aim of the DTTI Group is to bring sustained leadership focus to the bilateral defence trade relationship and create opportunities for co-production and co-development of defense equipment. Four joint working groups focused on land, naval, air and aircraft carrier technologies have been established under DTTI to promote mutually-agreed projects within their domains.During the meeting, the co-chairs noted that since the last DTTI Group meeting in October 2019, a DTTI Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the identification and development of cooperative projects under DTTI has been completed.The SOP will serve as the framework for DTTI and allow both sides to reach and document a mutual understanding on how to define and achieve success.A publicly releasable extract of key elements of the SOP was also published in July as the DTTI Initial Guidance for Industry, and distributed through Indian and US industry associations, it said.“Further efforts to encourage US and Indian industry to cooperatively develop next-generation technologies under the DTTI Group were highlighted by the 1st DTTI Industry Collaboration Forum (DICF), which took place virtually on September 10,” the Pentagon said.The DICF was convened by Sanjay Jaju, Joint Secretary (Defence Industries Production), Michael Vaccaro, Director, International Armaments Cooperation, and Amy Murray, Director, Small Business Programs.“This forum offers an opportunity for Indian and US industry to be directly involved in DTTI and facilitates dialogue between government and industry on issues that impact industrial collaboration.

15-09-2020||New Delhi||Over 200 cases against lawmakers under special laws pending in different states||More than 200 cases are pending against lawmakers under special laws such as the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, in different states, the Supreme Court was informed on Tuesday. The apex court was also told that over a dozen cases are also pending against Members of Parliament or Members of Legislative Assembly (both former and sitting) for offences under the Income Tax Act, Companies Act, Prevention of Arms Act, Excise Act and NDPS Act.“The reports submitted to the High Courts’ pursuant to orders dated March 5, 2020 and September 10, 2020 show that 175 cases are pending under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and 14 cases are pending under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002,” senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, who has been appointed as amicus curiae, told the top court.The report, compiled by Hansaria in assistance with lawyer Sneha Kalita, said that the analysis of cases pending also show that there is no uniformity as to the setting up of Special Courts for MPs/MLAs throughout the country.On September 10, the top court had asked the high courts to give details through e-mails by September 12 about the other pending criminal cases against politicians under special laws such as the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the Black Money law.“In the States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal there is one Special Court for all cases against MPs/MLAs. In the State of Telangana apart from Special Court for MPs/MLAs cases are also pending before Special Court, CBI. In all other States, these cases are pending in respective jurisdictional courts,” the report said.It said that there is also no clarity as to the courts which are trying offences under PCA and referred to the examples of Madhya Pradesh (21 cases pending) and Karnataka (20 cases pending) where all these special statute cases are pending before a Special Judge (MP/ MLA) at Bhopal and Bangaluru respectively.The report which gave the data of pending cases state-wise said that in Telangana, these cases are before Special Judge, CBI at Hyderabad while in Delhi, cases under PCA registered by both Delhi Police and CBI are before the Special Court (MP/MLA).Hansaria suggested that each High Court may be directed to assign/allocate criminal cases involving former and sitting legislators to one judicial officer in each district both for Sessions Courts and Magisterial Courts as Special Court MP/MLA.              “The High Courts may be directed to prepare a blueprint for expeditious disposal of the cases not later than 1 year for conclusion of trial. Chief Justice of each High Court may be requested to personally look into the matter and submit an action plan within such time as this Court may deem fit and proper,” his report said.He suggested that the High Court reports will also include mechanism for expeditious trial of criminal cases against MPs/ MLAs under special statutes including PCA, PMLA, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, (POCSO), Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Companies Act, 2013, Negotiable Instrument Act.                      Hansaria suggested that the High Courts would designate a judicial officer for all such cases, who shall try these cases on priority basis and the judicial officer can be allotted other work depending on the workload, number and nature of criminal cases against MPs/ MLAs.                “The judicial officer so designated shall have continuity of tenure for a minimum period of two years,” he said in his report.The senior lawyer said that cases involving sitting legislators be given priority over former legislators and no adjournment shall be granted except in rare and exceptional circumstances on a written application stating the ground of adjournment and for reasons to be recorded.He suggested several other measures for speedy trial of cases against the lawmakers including appointment of nodal prosecution officer and public prosecutor in each district.On September 10, the top court had termed as “shocking” the fact that a trial court in Punjab framed charges against a politician in a criminal case of 1983 after the lapse of 36 years and said that it was the duty of the prosecution to conduct trials “expeditiously”.The Punjab case was related to the murder of Dr Sudarshan Kumar Trehan in 1983. Former Shiromani Akali Dal MLA Virsa Singh Voltoha was named as accused in the confession of a co-accused. The top court was earlier told that the politicians are facing criminal trials in 4,442 cases across the nation and out of these, sitting MPs and MLAs are undertrials in as many as 2,556 such matters, sought further information from all high courts about other pending cases against sitting and former lawmakers.It had said that after perusing the details about the pendency of cases against the former and serving MLAs and MPs and may pass directions to the Chief Justices of the high courts about their fast-tracking on September 16.              The plea filed by advocate Ashiwini Upadhyay has also sought a direction to the Centre to take appropriate steps to debar the person convicted for the offences specified under some provisions of the Representation of the People Act (RPA) from contesting “MLA or MP election, forming a political party or becoming office bearer of political party”.

15-09-2020||Lucknow||UP creates special force with power to arrest without warrant||The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday notified the creation of a special force empowered to search any premises or arrest any person without any warrant or orders of a court, said an official.The move prompted a strong reaction from the Congress, with its state unit chief Ajay Kumar Lallu equating it with the 1919 Rowlatt Act or Black Act and saying that the party will explore legal options to challenge it.The new force, named UP Special Security Force, will cater to the security of metro railways, courts, airports, banks and other vital installations in the state.The UP SSF will work on the lines of the Central Industrial Security Force, said Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi in a statement.The force has been created under the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Vishesh Surakash Bal Adhiniyam (Uttar Pradesh Special Security Force Act), 2020, said Awasthi, adding the Force has been vested with powers akin to those of the CISF.“Under the Act, any member of the Force can arrest a person without any warrant or orders of a magistrate if there is an attack to members of the Force, the threat of, the use of criminal force or obstruction in the discharge of duty,” said the additional chief secretary.“If a crime is committed, the members of the Force can frisk any suspect without any search warrant without giving him any chance to escape or hide the evidence. On being convinced that the person has committed the crime, the person can be arrested,” Awasthi said, adding, the Force will also be empowered to search any suspect’s premises without any search warrant.Briefing reporters on Sunday, Awasthi had said, “The state government has given orders for the constitution of a special security force. A roadmap in this regard has been sought from the UP DGP.”“This is a dream project of the UP chief minister. The basis of this force is an order of the High Court, which had directed for creation of a specialised force for civil courts. In all, there will be 9,919 personnel in the Force,” he had said.Later, 1,913 additional posts will be created for it, he had said.Awasthi said five battalions would be constituted in the first phase and it will be headed by an ADG-rank officer.“Expenses incurred in the first phase will be around Rs 1,747 crore,” Awasthi had said.The force was constituted on the order of the Allahabad High Court, which had expressed displeasure last December over the lack of security at civil courts, said Awasthi.On December 18, 2019, the Allahabad High Court had pulled up the Uttar Pradesh government over a shootout in a Bijnor courtroom.Three assailants had opened fire in the court of the Bijnor chief judicial magistrate on December 17, 2019, killing a murder accused and injuring three others—two policemen and a court employee.The Muzaffarnagar court had witnessed a similar incident in 2015, when an armed man entered the courtroom masquerading as a lawyer and shot dead Vicky Tyagi, an alleged gangster.In another incident, Uttar Pradesh Bar Council chairperson Darvesh Kumari Yadav, 36, was shot dead by a colleague in her chamber on the civil court premises in Agra on June 13, 2019.A two-judge HC bench had said that most incompetent police personnel are being posted at the courts, adding that it will seek the deployment of central forces if the state government is not up to the task.Meanwhile, reacting to the constitution of the UP SSF, state Congress chief Lallu told PTI, “It is like the Rowlatt Act. It is unconstitutional, illegal and black law. There will be no ‘daleel’ (arguments), no ‘vakeel’ (advocate) against this new force.”“The Government wants to stifle the voices of democratic forces, including those of politicians, social activists and media through this black law. We will protest against this on the streets and also inside the assembly,” he said.Asked if the Congress will move the court to challenge this law, Lallu said, “We will explore the legal options too.”The Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919, popularly known as the Rowlatt Act or Black Act, was a legislative council act passed by the Imperial Legislative Council in Delhi on March 18, 1919.The law had indefinitely extended the emergency measures of preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without trial and judicial review enacted in the Defence of India Act 1915 during the First World War.It was the Rowlatt Act which brought Gandhi to the mainstream of Indian struggle for independence and ushered in the Gandhi Era of Indian politics.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-creates-special-force-with-power-to-arrest-without-warrant-141620
15-09-2020||New Delhi||Absolutely ‘no shortage’ of medical oxygen at national level: Health secretary||There is absolutely “no shortage” of medical oxygen, vital in the treatment of coronavirus, at the national level, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday, while urging states to ensure a proper inventory management at hospital-level and advance planning for timely replenishment so that there is no stockout.Asked if there was an acute shortage of oxygen in different states and there had been deaths due to it, Health Ministry Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the country’s current daily capacity of oxygen production as on date is slightly more than 6,900 metric tonne.Referring to morning figures, Bhushan at a press briefing said that 3.69 per cent of the COVID-19 patients were on oxygen support, 2.17 per cent were in ICU beds which are with oxygen and 0.36 per cent of the patients were on ventilator support which is again with oxygen. This, he said, amounts roughly to around 6 per cent people in total.“So what was the oxygen which was being consumed by these people plus that is consumed by non-COVID health services, if that is again taken (as per morning figure) that is 2,800 metric tonnes on a daily basis.                “So if we look at the industries production and their requirement for oxygen it is 2,200 metric tonne which gives a total of 5,000 metric tonne consumption per day and a headroom of 1,900 metric tonne. So speaking at the national level there is absolutely no shortage of oxygen, in fact there is a surplus today morning of 1,900 metric tonnes,” he said.The problem, the official said, happens when there is no inventory management at facility-level.Bhushan stressed that every state should ensure that there is oxygen inventory management at hospital-level and possible stockout alerts are generated so that it can be replenished on time.“If a shortage is likely then immediate action should be taken to replenish it on time and help should be sought from the Centre,” Bhushan said.He further said that meetings have been held with states and they have also been asked to set up a control room for monitoring the situation of oxygen stock, and a virtual control room has also been set at the central level.“States should monitor the oxygen availability and use it rationally,” he said.The Union Health Ministry on Monday held a virtual meeting with 29 states and UTs, including Assam, Bihar, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Kerala, Ladakh, Meghalaya,  Nagaland, Delhi, Odisha, Punjab, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and urged them to ensure adequate oxygen availability in all healthcare facilities and unrestricted intra as well as inter-state movement of oxygen.Union Health Secretary, Secretary DPIIT Secretary Pharmaceuticals and Secretary Textiles also participated in the meeting.It was noted that 11 tankers in the state of Assam supply oxygen to most of the northeastern states.The states were asked to assess the need and then to press more tankers into action, repurpose similar vehicles for carrying oxygen, and take steps to reduce their turnaround time so that patients do not face any lack of oxygen, the ministry had said in a statement on Monday.The states were specifically advised to ensure facility wise/hospital-wise oxygen inventory management and advance planning for timely replenishment so that there is no stockout.

15-09-2020||New Delhi||Lok Sabha passes Bill to cut salaries of MPs by 30 per cent||“Take away all our salary but restore MPLADS funds” was the general sense among Opposition MPs who supported the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill, 2020, brought by the Narendra Modi government in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday to replace the Ordinance on 30 per cent cut in salaries of sitting MPs to mobilise money to fight against COVID-19.In fact NCP MP Supriya Sule, questioning “the logic behind increasing petrol and diesel prices” while people in the country were reeling under the impact of Covid-hit economy, advised the Narendra Modi government to reduce its expenditure. “We are all together on this (the Bill) but why are you not reducing your expenditure,” she said.Alleging “lack of transparency” in PM CARES fund, she said: “What are you hiding? We will be happy to give up our entire salaries but the Rs 20,000-cr Central Vista project must also be cancelled”. She added that she would rather prefer a hospital with all facilities like ventilators.Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme is a scheme that enables MPs to recommend developmental work in their constituencies with an emphasis on creating durable community assets based on locally felt needs.In April, the Cabinet gave its nod to the government's decision to suspend MPLADS scheme for two years, along with a 30 per cent cut in salaries of sitting MPs to mobilise money to fight against COVID-19. The suspension of the MPLADS scheme, especially during a pandemic has invited much criticism from several MPs who asked the government to “give back people their rightful money”.Congress’s Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury questioned if any BJP MP can say he or she does not need MPLADS.“No one from ruling side said anything about MPLADS. We should pass a unanimous decision for restoring the funds, “said Chowdhary, adding that an MP belonging to the middle class he “cannot give anything from my pocket”.   “As much as 50 per cent of the MPLAD funds go for welfare of SC and 7.5 per cent for ST. The maximum expenditure from the funds is down for rural areas,” he said.Chowdhary also claimed that Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, during the BAC, said he will respond on the MPLADS issue in the Parliament. To this Joshi said: “I said we will convey the feeling of the House”. AAP MP Bhagwant Mann also said that the government should take away the salary but give them the public funds money with “guidelines on expenditure”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-passes-bill-to-cut-salaries-of-mps-by-30-per-cent-141615

Are you feeling ok?“Because, as we watch your witch-hunt of Rhea Chakraborty, we cannot understand why you have abandoned every professional ethic of journalism, every tenet of human decency and dignity and chosen instead to physically assault a young woman with your camera crews, endlessly violate her privacy and work overtime on false accusations and moralistic innuendo for a drama of ‘Rhea ko phasao’,” the letter reads.The letter calls out the media for being “obsessed” with creating the narrative of a young woman as a “morally dubious character” because she speaks up for herself instead of “acting like a damsel in distress”.Drawing parallels about the coverage of cases of actors Salman Khan and Sanjay Dutt, the letter urged the media to show the same kindness and respect to Chakraborty that it had shown to these actors.“We know you can be different — because we have seen you be kind and respectful to the Salman Khans and Sanjay Dutts of this world, urging us to think of their families, fans and careers,” the letter said asking why the media had “assassinated” Chakraborty’s character and egged an online mob against her and her family.“It is easy to victimise a young woman because there are so many people who already disbelieve, slut-shame and abuse women, for their smallest freedoms. It is certainly cheaper than doing actual stories about a host of issues from GDP to health, currently confronting us,” the letter further said.Citing the disturbing rise in domestic violence during the pandemic, the letter condemned the media for promoting damaging stereotypes of “vishkanyas” and “dayans” while trivialising depression and perpetuating regressive stereotypes about mental health.“We write to ask you, the news media, to stop this unfair witch-hunt of Rhea Chakraborty and to stop fuelling moral polarities of good women to be deified and bad women to be crucified which endangers all women. We write to ask you to do the right and responsible thing. Your jobs. Hunt news, not women,” the letter added.

As tensions between the armies of India and China at the LAC show no sign of ebbing, both sides have significantly ramped up the presence of their troops.Accordingly, India’s Army has been beefing up its stocks of food, ammunition, fuel and more importantly the winter gear.Major General Arvind Kapoor, Chief of Staff of the Fire and Fury Corps --- also known as the XIV Corps which has the mandate of securing the frontiers along the China and Pakistan borders from Kargil to Ladakh --- said the unit takes pride in its advance winter stocking.“Our stocking levels, be it rations, fuel, oils and lubricants, tentage and heating appliances which includes bukhari (heaters) or kero-heaters, or be it ammunition, are in good numbers,” Kapoor told reporters here.    “Wherever these things need to be supplied, they have already been supplied. We are confident that the system has become so well-oiled that in the coming days, it will give an excellent result,” he said.Kapoor said the entire Ladakh region has been connected to two main highways—the Manali-Leh axis and the Jammu-Srinagar-Leh axis.“These axes are shut for nearly six months. But in the last few months, we have brought this down to 120 days. In the coming days, the Atal Tunnel will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Darcha-Nimu-Padam link is also ready and in the immediate future, the Ladakh region will get round-the-year connectivity,” he said.Fuel also plays a critical role for the armed forces, especially in the Ladakh region where it is used by soldiers in forward areas to keep themselves warm in low temperatures.The corps also operates one of the highest altitude fuel, oil and lubricants depot.“We supply fuel both for our vehicles as also for our men, for the bukharis to keep them warm in the bitterly cold weather on the frontline,” said Brigadier Rakesh Manocha, in-charge of the logistics.On tentage, officials said the indigenously developed Arctic tents can sustain temperatures up to minus 20 degrees, while the high-altitude tents have the capacity to sustain temperatures anywhere between minus 40 to minus 50 degrees.“Both tentages and adequate winter clothing have also been supplied to the forward areas,” an official said.The ration too has been stocked adequately, ranging from pre-cooked, packaged and canned items to food grains, they added.Brigadier A S Rathore said, “We hold complete requirements of supplies for all troops which are deployed in the Ladakh sector. All warehouses are completely full to the brim.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-tensions-at-lac-army-prepares-for-long-winter-in-ladakh-141607

15-09-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Education Ministry launches schools’ alternative academic calendar for next 8 weeks||Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ on Tuesday released an alternative academic calendar for secondary classes for the next eight weeks as schools continue to be closed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.“The calendar contains week-wise plan consisting of interesting and challenging activities, with reference to theme or chapter taken from syllabus or textbook. Most importantly, it maps the themes with the learning outcomes,” the minister said.The purpose of mapping of themes with learning outcomes is to facilitate teachers and parents to assess the progress in the learning of children and also to go beyond textbooks, Nishank said.“The activities given in the calendar focus on learning outcomes and can thus be achieved through any resource including the textbooks children are using in their state or Union Territory. It also covers experiential learning activities such as arts education, physical exercises, yoga, pre-vocational skills,” he added.This calendar contains class-wise and subject-wise activities in tabular forms. The activities are related to four languages as subject areas—Hindi, English, Urdu and Sanskrit. The calendar also gives space to the strategies of reducing stress and anxiety among teachers, students and parents.The minister said the calendar has taken into account, the varying levels of access to such tools-mobile phone, radio, television, SMS and various social media.“Many of us may not have Internet facility in mobile phones, or may not be able to use different social media tools such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Google. The calendar guides teachers to further help parents and students through SMS on mobile phones or through voice call. Parents are expected to help elementary stage students to implement this calendar,” Nishank said.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of the measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.While several restrictions have been eased in different phases of “unlock”, educational institutions continue to be closed and teaching process has shifted online.Partial resumption of activities in schools for students of classes 9-12 will be allowed from September 21 for which Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been announced by the Health Ministry.

Later, the Ministry of External Affairs said the display of the map was “a blatant disregard to the advisory by the host against it and in violation of the norms of the meeting”.“After consultation with the host, the Indian side left the meeting in protest at that juncture,” admitted MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava. It was claimed that India had also raised objections to the display of Pakistan’s new political map in the background during a test call three days back.After Doval walked out, the meeting carried on with the “new map” of Pakistan which was a constant feature behind its NSA at the videoconference.The MEA said the Pakistani NSA had “deliberately projected a fictitious map” that Pakistan has recently been propagating.  “As was to be expected, Pakistan then went on to present a misleading view of this meeting,” added Srivastava.In Geneva, UN Human Right Council chief Michelle Bachelet’s observations on Kashmir were sought to be rebutted by diplomat Indramani Pandey who claimed people in the UT of J&K have been enjoying the same fundamental rights as people in rest of country ever since changes were rung in on August 5 last year.He also sought a sympathetic view because of the “enormity of the challenges that India faces due to a large and very diverse population of 1.3 billion” and wanted the HRC to act “as our partner in a cooperative and constructive spirit in our endeavour to secure all basic human rights for our people”.Bachelot, a two-time President of Chile and a victim of torture by its army, had expressed concerns over continued arbitrary detention of many persons.Saudi Arabia and Pakistan seems to have made up as Pakistan delivered the statement on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC). Its envoy Khalil Hashmi promptly raised the issue of J&K on behalf of OIC."This is a blatant violation of the SCO Charter and the Russian side, as the Chair, tried very hard to persuade Pakistan not to do so. Russian NSA Nikolai Patrushev has conveyed that Russia does not support what Pakistan has done. It hopes that Pakistan’s provocative act will not affect India’s participation in SCO and not cast a shadow on Patrushev’s warm personal relationship for Doval," government sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doval-walks-out-of-sco-nsas-meet-over-new-pakistan-map-141596
15-09-2020||New Delhi||Controversy surrounding drug abuse in Bollywood echoes in Parliament||The controversy surrounding drug and substance abuse in Bollywood echoed for the second successive day in Parliament on Tuesday with Samajwadi Party member Jaya Bachchan in Rajya Sabha slamming those defaming the film industry.BJP member in Lok Sabha and Mumbai-based Bhojpuri film actor Ravi Kishan had raised the issue in the House (Lok Sabha) yesterday, saying there was a drug cartel active in the industry which needed to be acted upon.Raising the issue in the Upper House during Zero Hour, Bachchan flayed those trying to bring the film and entertainment industry in dispute.“Those who have made a name in this industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree and dissociate with it,” Bachchan said without naming Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut, who had kicked up a storm by raising the drug-abuse and other corrupt issues plaguing the film industry after actor Sushant Rajput’s mysterious death.Also, without naming Ravi Kishan, Bachchan referred to him yesterday raising the drug abuse in Bollywood.“I am really embarrassed and ashamed at someone from the film industry demeaning the industry,” she said.“Jis thali mein khate hai usme chhed karte hai,” she said, which, to paraphrase in English, means he chops the very same branch on which he sits.She said the government was silent in the face of constant calumny unleashed, including by the social media, against the industry to defame it.She urged the government to support and protect the industry and not let it to be attenuated.It always stands with the government, and at times of national emergencies helps with money and service, she said.“Just because of a few persons, the entire industry cannot be given a bad name.”Bachchan further said that some of the members of the industry are highest tax payers. It brings name and recognition to the country, she said.On the other hand, Ravi Kishan reacted to Bachchan’s utterance against him saying it was unwarranted.In Lok Sabha he had raised the malaise of drug abuse in Bollywood and urged the government to eradicate the malady.He said that China and Pakistan were pushing drugs through Punjab and Nepal routes in India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/controversy-surrounding-drug-abuse-in-bollywood-echoes-in-parliament-141595

During this time, dedicated isolation beds recorded a 22 times increase and dedicated ICU beds expanded by 14 times in comparison to the numbers in March 2020.Similarly, he said, laboratory capacity for testing COVID-19 was increased by nearly 10 times during the lockdown.While there was no indigenous manufacturing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) with the requisite standards at the time when the lockdown was imposed, the country is now self-sufficient and in a position to export the same, he said.Rai said similarly, very limited indigenous manufacturing capacity was available for masks, ventilators, etc., at the time of lockdown, which was also enhanced to attain self-reliance in this regard.During this period, requirement of various cadres of personnel and volunteers across sectors and departments for COVID-related works and maintenance of other essential medical services were worked out and they were trained through resources made available on the website of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and iGOT, an online platform (https://igot.gov.in/igot/), he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/14-29-lakh-covid-19-cases-37-78k-deaths-prevented-by-lockdown-lok-sabha-told-141591

There are many other couples serving together in the forces, but not at the rank of Colonel so far.In a petition that came up for hearing before the Delhi High Court today, the officer, Colonel Amit has averred that the posting orders issued by Army Headquarters was arbitrary and in complete violation of the standard operating procedure on the subject.A Division Bench comprising Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Justice Asha Menon today stayed the posting orders till further directions and sought a detailed response from the Army in this regard. The matter was heard through video conferencing.The petitioner has contended that the basic criteria of spouse posting, especially in case where both husband and wife happen to be serving officers, was not taken into consideration which was not in violation of service norms but is also in contravention of Supreme Court directives.Further, while issuing the posting order for officers of the rank of selection grade colonel and above the order of preference of station submitted by the officer concerned ought to be considered, but no such recommendation was sought from him. He has also stated that certain events transpired during the course of their present posting due to which he had filed a statutory complaint against senior department officers.Pointing out that they had been granted a spouse coordinated posting at Jodhpur after about three years, the petitioner added that they had remained separated for long durations in the past due to various factors that prevented spouse coordinated postings.The petitioner has also averred that despite an unblemished record and having received several commendations, he has been posted to an appointment with substantially low workload despite vacancies being available in heavy workload appointments earmarked for selection grade Colonels. He had raised the issue with the hierarchy but on being told that his posting was in organizational interest.However, when he requested for leave and additional joining time to cater to family commitments, needs of aged parents, relocation issues amidst the ongoing pandemic and for attending his wife’s piping ceremony, the same was denied.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-stays-transfers-of-armys-first-colonel-couple-as-they-aver-violation-of-norms-141572

Smuggling of drugs from Pakistan and China is done every year...it is brought via Punjab and Nepal,” Ravi Kishan alleged.Veteran actor Jaya Bachchan responded to that on Tuesday saying that the film industry was being defamed by some people from the entertainment industry.Although she took no names, her remarks come a day after Ravi Kishan remarks about drug addiction in the film industry and  actor Kangana’s repeated statements against Bollywood , including calling it a “gutter”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mandi-bjp-mp-ram-swaroop-accuses-shiv-sena-of-ill-treating-kangana-ranaut-141564

15-09-2020||New Delhi||India's role in production of Covid vaccine critical in containing pandemic: Bill Gates||Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates has said India's willingness to play a "big role" in manufacturing COVID-19 vaccine and allow it to supply to other developing countries will be a critical part in containing the pandemic globally. In an exclusive interview to PTI, Gates, whose foundation is focusing on fighting the pandemic, called it the "next biggest thing" the world has been confronted with after the World War.The Microsoft co-founder said the world is looking to India for large scale production of COVID-19 vaccine once it is rolled out."Obviously, all of us want to get a vaccine out in India as fast as we can, once we know that it's very effective and very safe, and so the plans are coming into focus that sometime next year, it's very likely that roll-out will take place and take place in fairly big volume," he said."The world is also looking to India for some of that capacity to be available to other developing countries. Exactly what that allocation formula looks like will have to be figured out," Gates added.Scientists and pharmaceutical companies globally are racing against time to find a vaccine for the coronavirus pandemic which has killed about 9,32,000 people and infected around 24 million. Some of the vaccine candidates have entered the third and final phase of testing."This is not like a world war, but it's the next biggest thing after that that we've ever had," he said. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world's largest charities, has been involved in global efforts to contain the pandemic. In India, the foundation has entered into a partnership with the Serum Institute to accelerate the manufacturing and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines."India's willingness to play a big role in the manufacturing and to allow some of those vaccines to go to other developing countries will be an absolutely critical part of that," said Gates."India will be helping to make sure we have equity. We have a model that shows that getting the vaccine out to those who need it the most will save half the lives that you'd lose if you only send it out to the rich countries," he said.In the telephonic interview,  the Microsoft co-founder who has donated billions of dollars to fight poverty and diseases talked extensively about India's strength in production of vaccines and referred to companies like Serum Institute, Bio E and Bharat Biotech."We've been brokering the idea of taking a vaccine and manufacturing it in India, even if it comes from AstraZeneca, Oxford or Novavax or Johnson & Johnson. We've publicly talked about the arrangement where a Serum will be able to make very high volume of the AstraZeneca and the Novavax vaccine," said Gates. "There's discussions with Bio E, their connection with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and whether they'll be able to ramp that up," he said. Gates also said that the foundation has been having "great discussions" with India's NITI-Aayog, adding the ICMR is looking at the regulatory aspects of the COVID-19 vaccines."I'm actually very impressed with how our discussions with the government on these issues and the companies, including the Western companies collaborating with these new companies, that's all gone very well," Gates said.The American business magnate said he was optimistic that by the first quarter of next year, several of these vaccines will reach the phase three emergency licence approval. "We still could be disappointed in that. But we have a variety of constructs and the early data from the phase one and phase two, for example the antibody levels, looks pretty promising for quite a few of these vaccines," he said. He said the focus should be to keep the cost of the vaccines low and it should be ensured that they can be made in very high volume. "We have to remember that even once a vaccine is approved, the bar for that vaccine in terms of the effectiveness was set as 50 per cent, and so we still may want to continue with other vaccines to get higher effectiveness," he said. Gates also complimented India's digital cash transfer scheme."Getting payments out through digital cash transfers, that has been a fantastic thing, and obviously, India has done that at a scale that no other country ever has," he said."The whole Aadhaar digital financial system in India has proven to be once again a huge asset," he said, adding it can be extended to all the countries of the world.The philanthropist also referred to the foundation's annual Goalkeepers report saying it normally takes stock of the ongoing progress on things like economic growth, literacy, child survival and average lifespan."This year's report, unfortunately, we're unable to say that there's been progress. In fact, we talk about the setback, and one way we dimensionalise that for like vaccine coverage globally, which went from 84 per cent to 70 per cent, is we say that's a 25-year setback," he said. Asked whether India's economic downturn will impact the implementation of social welfare schemes, Gates said the foundation is a huge believer that investments in health pay off very strongly. "It's tragic that all health activities have been so disrupted, and that will lead to increased deaths from other diseases, not just COVID," he said. "In fact, in many places, and I'm not sure if India will be included in this, but there's a chance that there would be more deaths from other diseases because of the health disruption than from COVID itself," he said.--PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-role-in-production-of-covid-vaccine-critical-in-containing-pandemic-bill-gates-141557
15-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Assembly panel to issue 'final notice' to FB after representative skips proceedings||A Delhi Assembly panel decided on Tuesday to issue a "final notice" to Facebook after no representative appeared before the committee that is hearing allegations against the social media giant.During proceedings, Peace and Harmony Committee Chairman and AAP MLA Raghav Chadha said non-appearance of any Facebook representative before the panel was not only "contempt" of Assembly, but also an "insult" of the 2-crore people of Delhi.The panel had issued a notice to Facebook India vice president and managing director Ajit Mohan last week, asking him to appear before it on September 15 in connection with complaints about the social media giant's alleged deliberate inaction to curb hateful content in the country.The Facebook lawyer, in a reply to the committee's notice, said the matter was under consideration of the Parliament, which is "untenable", Chadha said. "The failure of Facebook to appear before the committee shows that it is trying to hide its role in the Delhi riots."                 After consulting other members of the committee, Chadha decided to issue a final notice to Facebook."As per principle of natural justice, we should give a last chance to Facebook vice president and managing director to appear before the committee. Still, if he does not come, the committee will not desist from using all its powers including coercive steps," he said.The hearing by the assembly panel follows a Wall Street Journal report that claimed that one of Facebook's senior India policy executives intervened in internal communication to stop a permanent ban on a BJP lawmaker from Telangana after he allegedly shared communally-charged posts.Last month, Facebook had said its social media platform prohibits hate speech and content that incites violence, and these policies were enforced globally without regard to political affiliation."While we know there is more to do, we're making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits of our process to ensure fairness and accuracy," a Facebook spokesperson had said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-assembly-panel-to-issue-final-notice-to-fb-after-representative-skips-proceedings-141556
15-09-2020||Satya Prakash||SC restrains Sudarshan TV from telecasting further episodes of ‘UPSC Jihad’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 15The Supreme Court on Tuesday restrained Sudarshan TV from telecasting further episodes of its controversial programme ‘UPSC Jihad’ that alleged Muslims were “infiltrating” civil services in a planned manner.“Episodes broadcast till now show nature and objective of the program...Pending further orders of this court Sudarshan News stands injuncted from making any more broadcasts on this subject in any other name too,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.“Edifice of a stable democratic society and observance of constitutional rights and duties are based on co-existence of communities. Any attempt to vilify a community must be viewed with disfavour,” it said.Earlier, the SC had refused to ban the show and had issued notice to the Centre and Sudarshan TV on a petition filed by Firoz Iqbal Khan who alleged that the content of the programme would lead to communal tensions in India.On Tuesday, the Bench said, “We are of the view that there is a change in circumstance.”Senior advocate Anoop George Chaudhari pointed out on behalf of the petitioner that prima facie the programme violated laws and the Delhi High Court had already issued notice on the petition challenging the Information and Broadcasting Ministry’s decision to allow its telecast.Chaudhari said out of the nine episodes, only two had been telecast so far.“This is so insidious. Can this be tolerated in a free society?” the court wondered.The Bench—which also included Justice KM Joseph—said it wanted to appoint a committee of five distinguished citizens who can come up with certain standards for the electronic media.“We don’t want anybody of politically divisive nature...we need members who are of commendable stature,” it added.During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta asserted, “Freedom of the journalist is supreme...It would be disastrous for any democracy to control the Press.”Mehta, however, said the concerns raised by the top court had to be addressed.The Bench pointed out that journalistic freedom was not absolute in India. “He (a Journalist) shares the same freedom as other citizens... We need journalists who are fair in their debates,” it said.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, representing Sudarshan TV, wanted time to file reply to the petition.At one stage, the Bench talked about transparency in funding of media outlets.“I run a YouTube channel. How can my funding be ascertained?” Mehta wondered.Describing the programme as “rabid” and “insinuating”, the Bench pointed out that Rule 6 of the Programme Code said cable TV channels can’t show anything that targeted a particular community.“Your Lordships must have seen the programmes where “Hindu Terror” was highlighted. The question is to what extent can courts control the publication of content,” Mehta submitted. The Bench said the problem with electronic media was TRP which was leading to sensationalism. It underlined the need to have enforceable standards to be followed by the media.Amid raging controversy over Sudarshan TV programme “UPSC Jihad”, a group of former bureaucrats had on Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the programme that alleged Muslims have “infiltrated” civil services in a planned manner.‘Constitutional Conduct Group’, which included Amitabha Pande and six others, urged the court to give an authoritative ruling on hate speech.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-restrains-sudarshan-tv-from-telecasting-further-episodes-of-upsc-jihad-141555
15-09-2020||Islamabad||Pakistan parliament extends ordinance on Jadhav by 4 months||Pakistan's Parliament has extended by four months an ordinance that allowed Indian death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav to file an appeal against his conviction in a high court as required by the International Court of Justice.The International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance promulgated in May was set to expire on September 17 but the National Assembly or the lower house on Monday through a voice vote extended it by four months, the Dawn News reported.The ordinance was launched to implement the verdict of the ICJ which asked Pakistan to provide effective review of the sentence given to Jadhav by a military court.Jadhav, the 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of "espionage and terrorism" in April 2017.The Pakistan government has approached the Islamabad High Court to appoint a defence lawyer to represent Jadhav in the court.The court on September 3 heard the case for the second time and directed the federal government to give India “another opportunity” to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav. Now the case will be heard next month.Pakistan last week said that it had conveyed the judicial orders to India for appointing a lawyer to represent Jadhav in the court but New Delhi had not responded yet.On July 16, Pakistan provided consular access to Jadhav, but the Indian government said the access was "neither meaningful nor credible" and he appeared visibly under stress.The Ministry of External Affairs said Pakistan is not only in violation of the judgment of the ICJ, but also of its own ordinance.India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July last year that Pakistan must undertake an "effective review and reconsideration" of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.Pakistan claims that its security forces arrested Jadhav from the restive Balochistan province on March 3, 2016 after he reportedly entered Pakistan from Iran. India maintains that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy.

15-09-2020||New Delhi||Speculations rife about changes in Bihar, BJP leadership after MoS Nityanand Rai given new responsibility||While the "new BJP" under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah is rarely expected to conform to "market" speculations, the new role of Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai in the state elections has resulted in massive conjectures over "changes in party's Bihar dynamics", including deputy CM Sushil Modi being assigned a role in the Centre.The BJP recently announced a 70-member election steering committee headed by Nityanand Rai for the upcoming Assembly polls in Bihar.The minister of state for home affairs is the chairman-cum-convenor of the committee with the state unit general secretary Devesh Kumar as the co-convenor.This has led to huge possibilities, one being the projection of Rai, Shah's deputy, as the BJP's next-gen in Bihar and senior leader Sushil Modi landing a berth in the Narendra Modi CabinetThat the BJP lacks "sufficient in-house talent" at the Centre is no secret. This is one reason that it had to scout for ex-bureaucrats like Hardeep Puri and S Jaishankar to join the party and the government. Sushil Modi is someone who is an "in-house talent" on the lines of the party's top-notch leaders like late Arun Jaitley.At the same time, he is also someone who is not considered as "close" to Modi-Shah duo. In that sense, Nityanand Rai is someone who is believed to be "close" to Amit Shah. The Home Minister trusts him enough to include him as a deputy in the important ministry.It is also said that the BJP wants its own Chief Minister in the State and that much of it has been happening, including the ongoing tussle for political space between allies JD-U and LJP, falls in that realmHowever, though, BJP leaders pooh-pooh the speculations. Reaffirming support to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of the JD-U, who has been projected as the NDA's CM face, they call the tussle between allies as the "expected posturing" in a poll season. So far as Rai's new role in State is concerned, they call it "optimisation" of senior state leaders for the benefit of the party in the coming Assembly elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/speculations-rife-about-changes-in-bihar-bjp-leadership-after-mos-nityanand-rai-given-new-responsibility-141551
15-09-2020||Mumbai||HC notice to Centre on plea over Sushant case media coverage||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday   issued a notice to the Union government over a petition filed by an NGO seeking that the media be restrained from reporting on issues related to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and subsequent probe into the case.This is the third such plea filed before the Bombay High Court.A bench led by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta is already hearing two pleas, one filed by Pune-based filmmaker Nilesh Navlakha and two others, and another by eight former police officials from the state.The court has now tagged all the three pleas together for a joint hearing on October 8.The latest plea, filed by NGO 'In Pursuit of Justice', sought that the court widen the scope of the Contempt of the Court Act to include any obstructions that could hamper the administration of justice from the time an FIR is registered in a case.It also sought that the "media be restrained from publishing or broadcasting" anything related to the case till the plea is decided finally by the high court."The recent spate of media reporting in the case of the untimely demise of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the extent of media frenzy concerning all issues and non-issues involving the incident is quite disturbing," the plea said."It has given rise to an urgent need of finding an acceptable constitutional balance between free press and administration of justice," it said.The plea also said the press has published Rajputs personal chats, statements of accused and hospital staff, and it has already "tried and convicted" the accused persons, called them names such as "murderer, gold digger and abettor".Such reportage has transgressed rights of the parties concerned and is likely to prejudice the probe into the case, it said.The court issued a notice to the Centre over the plea and said, "We'll hear all related matters together."

15-09-2020||Bengaluru||Sasikala may be released on Jan 27, 2021, says Karnataka Prison dept||Late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa's aide V K Sasikala, serving a four year-term in a corruption case here, may be released from jail next January provided she paid the fine amount of Rs 10 crore, Karnataka Prison department has said.Sasikala, lodged at the Parappana Agrahara Prison here, was convicted and sentenced in February 2017 in the Rs 66 crore disporportionate assets case."As per prison records, convict prisoner number 9234 Sasikala's 'probable date of release' is January 27, 2021, provided in-default fine amount is paid as awarded by the honourable court," Superintendent of Central Prison at Parappana Agrahara, R Latha said in response to an RTI query.The reply was to the query by activist T Narasimha Murthy on September 11.Latha added Sasikala's "probable date of release" would be February 27, 2022 if the fine is not paid.The officer explained the probable date of release may vary if Sasikala utilises a parole facility.She will have to pay Rs 10 crore to walk out of prison on January 27, 2021, else spend another 13 months behind bars.After the Supreme Court restored the trial court judgement in toto against Sasikala and two of her close relatives in the disproportionate assets case,(V N Sudhakaran and J Elavarasi), she surrendered before the court in Karnataka on February 15, 2017 and has been lodged in Parappana Agrahara Central Jail.Her two relatives are also undergoing four years simple imprisonment and all three of them were slapped with a fine of Rs 10 crore each.With the death of Jayalalithaa in 2016, who was the first accused in the case, the appeal by Karnataka against her stood abated.Last week, Sasikala's counsel had expressed hope of her early release, possibly by the end of this month, citing remission for good conduct.As per norms, three days of remission for good conduct is available for every month in jail and so far, she has completed 43 months, making her eligible for a reduction of 129 days in prison,"The Karnataka Prison Manual does not have any provision barring remission to those convicted for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act."As per the manual, I strongly believe that she will be released by the month end," her advocate N Raja Senthoor Pandian had said.When the remission of 129 days is applied, the release will be during the month end and not the previously expected date of January 2021, he had said.Sasikala has already spent a total of 35 days in jail in 1997 and 2014 and availed a 17 day parole in 2017, which is deducted from the period she already served, he had said.

The reflection of the body had necessitated an amendment to the Aircraft Act, 1934.The Act regulates the manufacture, possession, use, operation, sale, import and export of civil aircraft and licensing of aerodromes.Taking part in the discussion, Puri rebutted charge of Members of opposition parties that the government was promoting crony capitalism through the route of privatisation of airports.Awarding management of airports to private parties was started by the UPA regime in 2006 in the form of Mumbai and Delhi airports.He supported the participation of private parties to manage airports saying it helped to raise revenues which are ploughed back in the development of other airports.With regard privatisation of Air India, the national carrier, Puri said that with it being in debt of Rs 60,000 crore, the choice was between running it or halting it for good."The choice is not between privatisation or no-privatisation," Puri said.Opening the debate KC Venugopal said that the government was trying to promote the interest of one Corporate house by awarding management of six airports to it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-passes-aircraft-amendment-bill-141529

15-09-2020||Ajay Banerjee||LAC standoff: India blames China for breach of all agreements||Tribune news ServiceNew Delhi, September 15India on Tuesday blamed China for being in breach of all agreements and for causing the resultant military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh made a statement in Lok Sabha at 3 pm saying India was ready to resolve the issue through dialogue but added “the House can be assured that we remain prepared to deal with all contingencies... No one should doubt our determination to safeguard our borders”.He referred to the Galwan incident of June 15 saying, “Our brave soldiers inflicted costs, including casualties on the Chinese side.”Chinese actions reflect a disregard of our various bilateral agreements, said Rajnath Singh and apportioned blame on China. “The amassing of the troops by China goes against the 1993 and 1996 Agreements. Respecting and strictly observing the LAC is the basis for peace and tranquillity in the border areas and explicitly recognised in both 1993 and 1996 agreements.”“Indian armed forces abide by it; this has not been reciprocated by the Chinese side. Their actions have led to face-offs and frictions from time to time along the LAC,” the Minister told the Lok Sabha.The agreements have procedures and norms to deal with the situation of face-offs.  However, in the recent incidents, this year, the violent conduct of Chinese forces has been in complete violation of all mutually agreed norms, he said.As of now, the Chinese side has mobilised a large number of troops and armaments along the LAC as well as in the depth areas. There are several friction areas in Eastern Ladakh, including Gogra, Kongka La and North and South Banks of the Pangong Tso. In response to China’s actions, Indian armed forces have also made appropriate counter deployments, he said.Referring to his meeting with his counterpart General Wei Fenghe in Moscow on September 4 and the subsequent meeting between the foreign Ministers of India and China, Rajnath Singh said “we want to resolve the current situation through dialogue, we have maintained diplomatic and military engagement with the Chinese side”.In these discussions, India has maintained the three key principles that, determine our approach: Firstly, both sides should strictly respect and observe the LAC; secondly, neither side should attempt to alter the status quo of the LAC unilaterally; and thirdly, all agreements and understandings between the two sides much be fully abided by in their entirety. The Chinese side also conveyed that the issue be handled in a responsible manner to ensure peace and tranquillity as per bilateral agreements and protocol.The two sides have reached an agreement that, if implemented sincerely and faithfully by the Chinese side, could lead to complete disengagement and restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Referring to the recent incidents along the southern bank of the Pangong Tso, a 135 km glacial-melt lake, Rajnath Singh said the Chinese side engaged in provocative military manoeuvers on the night of August 29 and 30 in an attempt to change the status quo. “Timely and firm action by our armed forces along the LAC prevented such attempts from succeeding.”Our armed forces have maintained “restraint” in the face of provocative actions, they have also equally displayed “bravery” when required to.Differentiating from past such stand-offs, Rajnath Singh said in the past too “we have had situations of prolonged stand-offs in our border areas with China which have been resolved peacefully. Even though the situation this year is very different both in terms of scale of troops involved and the number of friction points, we do remain committed to the peaceful resolution of the current situation”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-standoff-india-blames-china-for-breach-of-all-agreements-141525
15-09-2020||New Delhi||In a first, Covid breaks barriers between 2 houses of Parliament||The shadow of Covid pandemic loomed large over Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on Monday as Parliament met for the first time in six months since March when the early surge in infections began.Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the unprecedented gathering of masked Lok Sabha MPs who sat separated by glass partitions at alternate seats.Monday was the first time in nearly 100 years of Parliament’s history that artificial structures in the form of glass shields were mounted inside the heritage chamber of Lok Sabha and members of one House were allowed to cross over and sit in the other as the pandemic broke the barriers between the House of People and the House of Elders.The Parliament building work started in 1921 and concluded in 1927.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu both made a mention of the Covid-induced shift whereby MPs from Rajya Sabha could freely park themselves in Lok Sabha and vice versa.“I am sure this would be a dream come true for many Rajya Sabha MPs who may have wanted to enter the Lok Sabha but could not,” Birla said smilingly to a thunderous applause.Lok Sabha looked new and strange for many reasons, foremost being MPs speaking from their seats. Covid safety protocols turned the house rules upside down with the Speaker, who would normally be heard urging members to show respect to the chair, requesting them to “sit and speak”.Medical experts have advised MPs to speak while seated lest respiratory droplets travel around carrying potential infection.Also, in a first, several Lok Sabha MPs looked lost and in unfamiliar territory as their seats were taken and they were forced to find accommodation in visitors’ galleries or Rajya Sabha chambers.To ensure physical distancing, the House seating stands drastically truncated, with the Lok Sabha Speaker ordering additional seating in new places.The disrupted seating even left ex-minister Maneka Gandhi stranded in the last row on the treasury side as the front seats were taken.The opposition benches, meanwhile, looked lonely with heavyweights Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi and SP’s Mulayam Singh Yadav missing from the inaugural day of the session.The treasury had greater heft with the PM and most ministers including Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman, Narendra Tomar and Harsh Vardhan present. Home Minister Amit Shah was not there as he is hospitalised.Overall, the house chambers looked dreary with trademark bonhomie among MPs missing except when the houses adjourned briefly post obituary references.This short spell saw some Lok Sabha members break Covid norms to catch up on old times and breathe freely again.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-a-first-covid-breaks-barriers-between-2-houses-of-parliament-141523
15-09-2020||United Nations||India beats China to win crucial election to UN commission on women||In a significant victory, India got elected as Member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women, the principal global body focused on gender equality and women empowerment, beating China in a hotly-contested election.The Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is a functional commission of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The 54-member ECOSOC, holding the first plenary meeting of its 2021 session in the General Assembly Hall on Monday, held elections for two seats in the Asia-Pacific States category with Afghanistan, India and China in the fray.Afghanistan, which is led by Ambassador Adela Raz at the UN, garnered 39 votes and India got 38 votes of the 54 ballots cast.China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, got only 27 votes and could not even cross the half-way mark and also failed to get the required majority of 28 votes. “India wins seat in prestigious #ECOSOC body! India elected Member of Commission on Status of Women #CSW. It's a ringing endorsement of our commitment to promote gender equality and women's empowerment in all our endeavours. We thank member states for their support,” India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti tweeted.India beat China in the hotly-contested election to the prestigious UN body in the year when the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, that was held in Beijing in 1995, is being commemorated around the world.It is highly notable and telling that China lost the election to the UN's principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and women empowerment when the silver jubilee anniversary of the landmark Beijing conference on women is being commemorated and of which China takes a lot of ownership on.The election result is being seen as sending a strong signal about China's own record of women's equality and empowerment.India's Permanent Mission to the UN worked tirelessly for the hard-fought election, reaching out and sensitising all Member States, sources said.India and Afghanistan will join Argentina, Austria, Dominican Republic, Israel, Latvia, Nigeria, Turkey and Zambia, which were elected by acclamation, to the Commission on the Status of Women for a four-year term beginning from 2021-2025.India's election win at the CSW is highly significant as it comes on the eve of India gearing up to sit at the UN Security Council high table as non-permanent member for a two-year term beginning January 1, 2021.Former UN Assistant Secretary-General and Deputy Executive Director of UN Women Lakshmi Puri congratulated the Indian Mission and Ambassador Tirumurti on the election win. “Victory Earned! #CSW is an important normsetting organ for #Gender #Equality & #WomenEmpowerment & #India has made a significant contribution to evolving global women's human rights standards in UN including #SDG5 in Agenda 2030!,” she tweeted, referring to the Sustainable Development Goal of achieving gender equality and empower all women and girls.The Commission on the Status of Women is instrumental in promoting women's rights, documenting the reality of women's lives throughout the world, and shaping global standards on gender equality and the empowerment of women.In 1996, ECOSOC expanded the Commission's mandate and decided that it should take a leading role in monitoring and reviewing progress and problems in the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, and in mainstreaming a gender perspective in UN activities.

Allaying their fears, Tomar said the measures on the contrary would enable barrier-free trade and empower farmers to engage with investors of their choice. The session, which stretched beyond four hours, was adjourned for an hour following obituary references to Pranab Mukherjee, vocalist Pandit Jasraj, sitting MP Vasanth Kumar and 13 ex-MPs who passed away recently. The LS also cleared two Bills —- the National Commission for Homeopathy Bill, 2020, and the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine Bill, 2020.To empower farmersIt (agri trade Bill) will actually empower farmers to decide the price of their produce.

It said there shall not be any kind of political interference in execution of the plan. The apex court, which posted the matter for hearing after four weeks, was hearing the applications, including the one filed by Congress leader Ajay Maken, who has sought rehabilitation of slum dwellers.After recording Mehta’s assurance, the Bench posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks.The court is seized of several applications, including the one by Delhi Congress leader Ajay Maken, seeking rehabilitation of the affected slum-dwellers before they were dislodged.A Bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra (since retired), had on August 31 ordered the removal of around 48,000 jhuggis along the railway tracks in Delhi in a phased manner in three months, saying there should not be any kind of political interference in the implementation of its order.Restraining courts from granting any kind of stay with respect to removal of these encroachments along the railway tracks, the top court had said 70 per cent of the requisite amount should be borne by the Railways and 30 per cent by the state government, and the manpower be provided by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), the Railways and agencies available with the government, free of cost, and they would not charge it from each other.On behalf of Maken, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi wanted the Bench to order status quo but the court didn’t oblige him.

15-09-2020||New Delhi||Centre: Same sex marriage against our society, values||The Centre on Monday told the Delhi High Court that marriage between same sex couples was “not permissible” as it is not recognised by “our laws, legal system, society and our values”.The submission was made before a Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan by Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta during the hearing of a PIL seeking a declaration that same sex marriages be recognised under the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) and Special Marriage Act. Mehta opposed the relief sought in the petition saying “our laws, our legal system, our society and our values do not recognise a marriage, which is a sacrament, between same sex couples”.He said the plea to grant recognition to or permit registration of such marriages was “not permissible” for two reasons — firstly, the petition was asking the court to legislate and secondly, any relief granted “would run contrary to various statutory provisions”. “Unless court does violence to various laws, this cannot be done,” he added. The counsel for the petitioner stated that the affected people were not coming forward as they feared reprisals and therefore a PIL was preferred. The Bench listed the matter for further hearing on October 21. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-same-sex-marriage-against-our-society-values-141358
