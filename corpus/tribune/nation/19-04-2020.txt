There is no reason to be worried about. The data may be used in extreme case in future,” M Patnaik, the Drugs Controller of Odisha, told PTI.An order by Chandigarh Deputy Commissioner Mandip Singh Brar said that all medical stores, chemists shops, including Jan Aushdhi shops and doctors particularly general physicians running private clinics too would maintain the record - name, mobile number and address - of the buyers or patients of medicines for fever, cold, throat infection, flu and similar symptoms and provide it to the Director Health Services on daily basis.The Director Health services would formulate and execute a plan to collect the data from such medical shops and general physicians on a daily basis and then track the patients for COVID-19 symptoms and take all necessary actions to control the outbreak of COVID-19, as per order.Any violation of this order would invite action under section 188 of the IPC, said the order which will come into effect from April 20.In Bihar, Health Minister Mangal Pandey told PTI-Bhasha: “No such direction has been issued from our department. Though district-level officials may be taking steps keeping in view the situation in their area.”Reports suggest that a large number of people are buying medicines like paracetamol.The missive issued by Vishwajit Dasgupta, Assistant Drug Controller, Patna Nagar Nigam region, asks medicine retailers to politely ask for mobile numbers of those purchasing medicines used in treatment of cough and cold and fever.The mobile numbers should be entered in the respective cash memos and chemists and druggists should keep a spare copy of these to be shared as and when required.The counterpart of Biswas in Kaimur district directed medical store owners to provide name, address and mobile phone numbers of all such purchasers every day by 3 PM.In Bhojpur, the direction has come from the district administration which has asked shop owners, as also private clinics and hospitals, to provide full details of buyers/patients with the symptoms the concerned government hospitals incharge or Medical Officer.'Lack of uniformity in directions'Chemists and druggists in the state, while not averse to the exercise, are dismayed over lack of uniformity in directions.“At one place information is sought every evening. At another place no particular time is stated. It would have been better had there been guidelines applicable to the entire state,” said Prasann Kumar Singh, president of the Bihar Chemists and Druggists Association.The assistant drug controller of Rohtas provided druggists and chemists in the district with a pro forma wherein the details are to be filled up and sent to the drug inspector of the sub division concerned twice daily, via WhatsApp, at 10 am and again at 4 pm.Odisha Drug Controller said the Drug Controller Administration has already restricted sale of certain medicines like Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin.The chemist outlets are directed not to sell such medicines without doctors prescription, she said.Coronavirus infections crossed 16,000 with 1,324 cases being reported in the last 24 hours and the death toll surpassed 500, according to the Union Health ministry data on Sunday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-chemists-asked-to-keep-record-of-people-seeking-medicines-for-fever-cough-73359
19-04-2020||New Delhi||DGCA directs airlines to stop taking bookings||Aviation regulator DGCA directed airlines on Sunday to stop taking bookings for travel after May 3, assuring them that they would be given sufficient time to restart flight operations.The regulator’s direction came in the evening as private Indian airlines were taking bookings during the day, ignoring Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri’s “advice” on Saturday to open bookings only after the government takes a decision on resumption of flights.Air India heeded to the minister’s advice and stopped all bookings on Sunday before the regulator issued the order.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued a circular stating: “All airlines are hereby directed to refrain from booking tickets... Further, the airlines may note that they shall be given sufficient notice and time for restarting operations.”Several passengers have complained on social media against Indian airlines that they are not giving refunds for flights cancelled due to the coronavirus-forced lockdown and instead issuing credit vouchers for future travel.On April 16, the Aviation ministry said passengers can ask airlines for full refund if the bookings were done during the first phase of lockdown for travel up to May 3.However, the government has not taken any decision till now on whether full refund should be given to passengers who booked their tickets before the lockdown for travel during the March 25-May 3 period.The first phase of the lockdown was from March 25 to April 14. The second phase began on April 15 and would end on May 3.All domestic and international commercial passenger flights have been suspended for the lockdown period. However, cargo and special flights permitted by the DGCA can fly in this period.Vistara and Air Asia India told PTI on Sunday afternoon that they had not received any notice from the Civil Aviation Ministry on the issue of stopping bookings.The other three major private Indian airlines—SpiceJet, IndiGo and GoAir—did not respond to queries by PTI about what action would they take on Puri’s advice to cease bookings currently.As all private carriers continued taking bookings through the day, the DGCA stepped in on Sunday evening, stating that previous circulars of the government or the regulator did not give “any direction which allows” the airlines to start taking ticket bookings for travel May 4 onwards.The regulator reiterated what Puri had said on Saturday—no decision to start domestic or international flight operations from May 4 has been taken yet. The DGCA stated that the direction to the stop taking bookings is for “strict compliance by all airlines”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-directs-airlines-to-stop-taking-bookings-73354

Pakistan is a founder-member of the OIC and sources said it must have been disappointed that the statement did not come from its more influential organs such as the Contact Group of Foreign Ministers or the OIC itself.The Commission also spoke against the alleged negative profiling of Muslim in the Indian media and subjecting them to discrimination and violence.This particular department of OIC had also weighed on the change in domicile status in J&K by terming it as an attempt to alter its demographic and geographic status.It had also commented on the Delhi riots in February which it described as “organised violence” and had last year invited the “PoK President” Sardar Masood Khan to attend its regular session.However, in this case, the Commission may be reflecting the growing number of voices on the social media from the Gulf countries expressing concern over the repeated cornering of Muslims in India with some hotheads threatening expatriate Hindus working in Arab countries with expulsion if Muslim targeting continued.Princess Hend Al Qassimi from UAE has been especially vocal, sharply putting down Indian expatriates taking to Islamophobia. In a social media post today, she welcomed India sending HCQ tablets. But she also quoted Gandhi in another social media post and said, “he won my heart and I believe in his peaceful approach to handling hatred”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oic-body-condemns-targeting-of-muslims-over-spread-of-covid-73353
19-04-2020||New Delhi||India must be ahead of the curve in post-COVID world: PM||Rather than playing catch-up, India must be ahead of the curve in the post-COVID world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday and exhorted people to use their innovative zeal to chart a new business and work culture redefined by its “adaptability, efficiency, inclusivity, opportunity and universalism”.Calling them “vowels of the new normal”, Modi said like vowels in the English language, these would become essential ingredients of any business model in the post-COVID world.“Today, the world is in pursuit of new business models. India, a youthful nation known for its innovative zeal, can take the lead in providing a new work culture,” the prime minister wrote on LinkedIn.He also said the next big ideas from India should find global relevance and application.“They should have the ability to drive a positive change not merely for India but for the entire humankind,” he said.Titled “Life in the era of COVID-19”, in the write-up, the prime minister also reminded that COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking.“Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together,” he said.Unlike previous moments in history, when countries or societies faced off against each other, “today we are together facing a common challenge. The future will be about togetherness and resilience,” he said.Referring to the post-coronavirus world, Modi said we should evaluate what might be the new opportunities or growth areas that would emerge now.“Rather than playing catch up, India must be ahead of the curve in the post-COVID world. Let us think about how our people, our skills sets, our core capabilities can be used in doing so,” he said.Today, the world is in pursuit of new business models, he said adding that India, a youthful nation known for its innovative zeal, can take the lead in providing a new work culture.Logistics was previously only seen through the prism of physical infrastructure – roads, warehouses, ports.But logistical experts these days can control global supply chains through the comfort of their own homes, he pointed out.“India, with the right blend of the physical and the virtual can emerge as the global nerve centre of complex modern multinational supply chains in the post COVID-19 world,” he said.“Let us rise to that occasion and seize this opportunity,” the prime minister stressed.Modi said he envisions the new business and work culture being redefined on the vowels of the new normal.“...because like vowels in the English language, these would become essential ingredients of any business model in the post-COVID world,” he said.These are: Adaptability, Efficiency,  Inclusivity, Opportunity and Universalism.The need of the hour is to think of business and lifestyle models that are easily adaptable, he said.“Doing so would mean that even in a time of crisis, our offices, businesses and commerce could get moving faster, ensuring loss of life does not occur,” he explained.Embracing digital payments is a prime example of adaptability.India is already witnessing an encouraging surge in digital transactions, he said.The prime minister also sought ideas on business models to further help telemedicine across the world.Efficiency cannot only be about -- how much time was spent in the office, he said, adding that people should think of models where productivity and efficiency matter more than appearance of effort.On the issue of inclusivity, he said business models that attach primacy to care for the poor, the most vulnerable as well as our planet should be developed. “COVID-19 has made us realise the need to work on health solutions at low cost and large scale. We can become a guiding light for global efforts to ensure the health and well being of humanity,” the prime minister opined.He said there was a need to invest in innovations to make sure the farmers have access to information, machinery, and markets no matter what the situation, “that our citizens have access to essential goods”.The novel coronavirus outbreak has significantly changed the contours of professional life and these days home is the new office and internet is the new meeting room, Modi said.“I have also been adapting to these changes. Most meetings, be it with ministerial colleagues, officials and world leaders, are now via video conferencing,” Modi wrote.The need of the hour is to think of business and lifestyle models that are easily adaptable.The work place is getting “Digital First”, he said.“And, why not? After all, the most transformational impact of technology often happens in the lives of the poor,” he said.It is technology that demolishes bureaucratic hierarchies, eliminates middlemen and accelerates welfare measures, the prime minister said.He also recommended practising yoga and urged people to download the Arogya Setu app as tool to check the spread the deadly virus.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 519 and the number of cases climbed to 16,116 in the country on Sunday, registering an increase of 31 deaths and 1,324 cases since Saturday evening, according to the Union health ministry.The worldwide death toll from the novel coronavirus pandemic rose to 160,685 on Sunday, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-must-be-ahead-of-the-curve-in-post-covid-world-pm-73351

The allegations against police are false and baseless,” he said.But, the viscera will be sent for a medical examination and the body will be handed over to his relatives for last ties, the official said.Last month also, relatives of labourer Raju Velu Devendra alleged that he was beaten to death by police personnel enforcing the lockdown in Nehru Nagar area.However, police refuted the allegations and claimed the deceased was lynched by residents of the area while he was attempting a robbery.The police had then registered a case against eight people for murder and rioting.

19-04-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Army tests ability of new beyond-visual-range drone||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 19In an important development, the Indian Army has successfully tested an indigenous UAV for autonomous delivery of load over Punjab.The test was carried out for delivery of Covid-19 items.Crucially, the test proved an ability to operate at far-off ranges, at beyond visual line of sight, meaning the drone was remotely controlled either by a radar or another bigger UAV above it, and possibly the payload the drone could carry.On the morning of April 16, three such ‘Made in India’ drones were tested over three villages of Abohar in Fazilka district in South-western part of Punjab. The task was ‘anti-Covid’ operations and to deliver essential supplies, including masks, liquid-sanitiser and medical canisters, sources from the area have confirmed.Sources said the Army coordinated these tests with the district administration, it is clear such operations can be on a large scale by increasing the number of drones and enhancing the endurance and payload of each drone. The Army uses a few bigger drones for surveillance.The villages of Gobindgarh, Balluana and Malukpura are located at distance of up to 25 km from the launch point and fall beyond visual line of sight range from base. These tests would probably have been one of the first-of-its-kind in India with a large medical delivery cargo carried by autonomous drones.As per sources, the crucial part was releasing the payload with pinpoint accuracy. It was made to fly over the earmarked dropping zone, made to descend to a suitable height and release its payloads. Sources from the ground confirm that the payloads were received in good order.Entire operation did not involve any human contact at the village zone, meaning the coordinates were fed into the drone to drop the payload and return to its base. Such a drone could be used to send supplies to small locality or a village without exposing the relief workers to people infected with the virus.It can also transport back crucial blood samples and other supplies from isolated places. The civil administration which included the Tehsildar and the DSP of Abohar and elected members of the three villages participated in the trials. Load carriage UAVs operating at beyond visual line of sight ranges will prove very beneficial not only under the Covid-19 operations, but also to support humanitarian disasters all across India in the years ahead.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-tests-ability-of-new-beyond-visual-range-drone-73344
19-04-2020||New Delhi||Selective relaxation in non-containment areas from April 20: Centre||Selective relaxation will be given in non-containment areas from April 20, but strict restrictions will continue in districts declared COVID-19 hotspots, the government said on Sunday.Addressing a daily media briefing to give updates on the novel coronavirus situation in the country, Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said some activities in agricultural sector and rural economy would be permitted as part of ensuring “Jaan bhi hai jahan bhi hai (life and wellbeing)”.He also said a high-level task force to work on frontiers of science related to vaccines and drug testing was formed on Sunday.“The co-chair of the task force are member of the Niti Aayog and the principal scientific adviser to the government. Besides them, AYUSH, ICMR, Department of Science and Technology, Biotechnology, CSIR, DRDO, DG Health Services and Drug Controller are also its members,” Agarwal said.An ICMR official said 3,86,791 tests for coronavirus tests have been conducted so far with 37,173 tests done on SaturdayHe said 1,334 fresh COVID-19 cases were reported since Saturday with 27 deaths in the last 24 hours. Total cases stand at 15,712 and deaths at 507. As many as 2,231 COVID-19 patients, which is around 14.19 per cent, have been cured, Agarwal said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that from April 20 selective relaxation will be given in some areas. In accordance to that, there will be some relaxations in non-containment zones from midnight, Agarwal said.The joint secretary in the health ministry, however, said containment areas in coronavirus hotspots will not get the relaxations.States and Union Territories may impose measures which are even more stringent than Centre’s guidelines, according to local requirements, he said.Hotspots or red zones are those areas where either there are large number of COVID-19 cases or the doubling rate of infection is less than four days, Agarwal explained.“In these hotspots, local administrations delineate containment zones and buffer zones to control spread of the disease. No relaxations are permitted in these containment zones,” he said, adding strict perimeter control will be continue and nothing except essential services will be allowed there.“We will give selective relaxation in non-containment zones, but states and districts have to ensure that existing lockdown measures are strictly complied with.”“Activities to be prohibited till May 3, even in cases of relaxation, are primarily passenger traffic movement by air, rail and road, educational institutions, industrial commercial activities and hospitality services unless they are specifically exempted,” the health ministry official said.Along with these, cinema halls, malls, shopping complexes, entertainment parks will be closed while social, political, cultural, religious or academic and sports gatherings continue to remain prohibited, he said.Relaxation will be there for agricultural activities, daily-wage earners and employment opportunities for some to be monitored, health services to be functional and supply of essential goods to continue, Agarwal said.An ICMR official said 3,86,791 tests for coronavirus tests have been conducted so far with 37,173 tests done on Saturday. Agarwal also said 755 dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and 1,389 dedicated healthcare centres have been set up in country. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/selective-relaxation-in-non-containment-areas-from-april-20-centre-73343

19-04-2020||New Delhi||Shah asks officials to discuss lockdown relaxation norms with states||Union Home Minister Amit Shah has directed senior ministry officials to remain in constant touch with state authorities and discuss with them on issues relating to lockdown relaxations, which are going to be implemented tomorrow.During a review meeting on the situation of the COVID-19 epidemic in the country with the senior officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Shah said, the country is still fighting a battle with coronavirus under the leadership of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and therefore “the applicable lockdown restrictions as well as national directives should be followed scrupulously”.According to an official release from the MHA, Shah said, “While certain activities are being permitted in those areas which do not fall within hot-spots/clusters/containment zones, due caution has to be exercised to ensure that only genuine exemptions/relaxations are given.”In order to give a boost to the rural economy, certain economic activities have been permitted in rural areas.“Accordingly, DMs/DCs, in collaboration with industries, should make arrangements to transfer labourers to their place of work within the state. Modi government believes that on one hand, this will give a fillip to economic activity and on the other, provide employment to the labourers,” the minister said.Shah asked the officials to impress upon states to give attention to start big industrial units, industrial estates and industrial complexes, especially where the labourers can be accommodated within the complex.“Such activities can help in triggering economic revival, while ensuring that the labourers are provided gainful employment. Modi government is committed to protect the rights of every section of the society in these difficult times,” he said, adding that district administration should also explore the possibility of providing employment through agriculture as well as MGNREGA activities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shah-asks-officials-to-discuss-lockdown-relaxation-norms-with-states-73341

19-04-2020||New Delhi||Lockdown: CBSE to assess loss of time for students, rationalise syllabus for classes 9-12||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is considering rationalising the syllabus for classes 9 to 12 for the next academic year to make up for lost time due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The board is presently in the process of assessing the situation, as well as the loss and a call in this regard will be taken accordingly.           The National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) had last week announced an alternative academic calendar for students enrolled in classes 1 to 5 to be followed as they study at home due to the lockdown.The council is in the process of developing similar plans for higher classes as well. "NCERT has come out with revised activities calendar for classes 1-8, the CBSE is assessing the situation and loss time to rationalise syllabus for classes 9-12 and inform in due course of time," a senior board official said.On April 14, Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the 21-day nationwide lockdown till May 3. All schools were closed and exams postponed at least a week before the lockdown on March 25 was announced.The annual academic schedule has been thrown out of gear due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), as well as many other state boards, had to either postpone or cancel board exams.Several schools were conducting teaching and learning activities online but there were no uniform guidelines for the purpose before the calendar was announced.  "The alternate calendar contains week-wise plan consisting of interesting and challenging activities, with reference to theme or chapter taken from syllabus or textbook. "Most importantly, it maps the themes with the learning outcomes.

19-04-2020||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeking action against landlords pressuring students, labourers for rent during lockdown||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking action against the “arbitrary and unlawful action” of landlords demanding rent from students and labourers during the lockdown despite a government order to the contrary.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had issued an order on March 29 which stops landlords from demanding rent from students, workers and migrant labourers for a month. Those landlords who force people to vacate their houses will face action, the MHA statement warns.The order, issued under the Disaster Management Act, had said employers will pay their workers’ wages on due dates without any deduction.The petition filed by advocate Pawan Prakash Pathak and others, has sought implementation of the home ministry’s March 29 order that no landlord will collect rent from the labour class and students for a month during COVID-19 period and those who violate it would be punished.“Petition is being filled against the arbitrary and unlawful action of landlords in the state of Delhi amid COVID-19 where there is clear instruction issued by the Ministry of Home affairs that in order to maintain the lockdown situation and law and order during COVID-19, order dated March 29, 2020 ‘restraining all landlord to forcing labours and students to vacate their premises’, in case they fail to pay rent during this period,” the plea said.The PIL said irrespective of the MHA order, various landlords were forcing tenant students to pay full rent, failing which they will be thrown out of premises.“Many landlords are continuously putting pressure on students to pay their rent and the students are living in constant fear and depressions. They are feeling helpless in this situation as they can’t demand money from their parents because their parents are also suffering from financial crisis due to the lockdown. In such a situation one is left with one option i.e opportunity cost of money, either one can pay rent out of same amount or one can buy essential ration and food for family during this period,” the plea said.The petition said that in a situation like this, the students who are staying in rented accommodations have limited resources at their disposal.“Most of the students stuck are from humble background and they supplement their expenses by working part time—for instance by taking up tuition. But in situations like this, they are struck in dire straits. If they will not be helped by the government concerned then they have to live in constant fear and depression caused by the financial crisis,” the plea said.

We have suspended operations and sales until May 3, following the last circular," Vistara spokesperson said."Once there is clarity on steps to be taken beyond that date, we will comply accordingly," the spokesperson added.AirAsia India spokesperson told PTI that the lockdown issued by the government is till May 3 and hence flights are available for bookings May 4 onwards.Flight bookings have been made available as passengers need to make travel and associated purchase decisions in advance. This also helps them get cheaper fares, the Air Asia India spokesperson clarified."We have not received any formal notification from MoCA (Ministry of Civil Aviation)/ DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) specifying any future period beyond May 3 for which airlines need to stop accepting bookings," the spokesperson stated.The spokesperson also noted that as there is uncertainty following the coronavirus pandemic, travellers are cognisant of the possibility of the lockdown getting extended in which case they can always reschedule their flights for free.On Saturday night, Civil Aviation Minister Puri said on Twitter the government has not taken any decision to open domestic or international flight operations so far. "Airlines are advised to open their bookings only after a decision in this regard has been taken by the government," he said.Several passengers have complained on social media that Indian airlines are not giving refunds for flights cancelled due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown and instead issuing credit vouchers for future travel.On April 16, the Ministry of Civil Aviation stated that travellers can ask airlines for full refunds if the bookings were done during the first phase of the lockdown for travel up to May 3.The first phase of the lockdown imposed in the country in view of the coronavirus outbreak was from March 25 to April 14. The second phase started on April 15 and will end on May 3.All domestic and international commercial passenger flight operations have been suspended during the lockdown period. However, cargo flights and special flights authorised by aviation regulator DGCA have been permitted during this period.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 507 and the number of cases to 15,712 in the country on Sunday, according to the Union Health Ministry.

19-04-2020||Mumbai||Anurag Kashyap, Vishal Bhardwaj, 20 others release statement against 'witch-hunt' of students by Delhi Police||Over 20 film personalities, including Anurag Kashyap, Vishal Bhardwaj, Mahesh Bhatt, Ratna Pathak Shah, on Sunday released a statement raising their voice against the arrest of students and activists by Delhi Police for protesting against CAA and also demanded their release.A Delhi court on Wednesday sent a student of Jamia Millia Islamia, arrested for allegedly hatching a conspiracy to incite communal riots in northeast Delhi, to judicial custody for 14 days.Another student, who was arrested by the local police last week in connection with protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Delhi's Jaffrabad in February, was sent to two-day police custody.In a statement released on Twitter, the signatories said they are "shocked" to know that even as the country battles through a grave crisis of the coronavirus, the Delhi Police have arrested two students and several activists "who had participated in peaceful protests against the CAA"."To fight this pandemic the citizens and authorities need to stand by each other. By targeting activists taking advantage of the lockdown, when there is hardly even any media coverage of its actions, the Delhi Police is betraying the civic rights of the citizens."We urge the Delhi Police to stop abusing the lockdown, respect the human rights of our fellow citizens and put an end to this witch-hunt. We demand the release of these students and activists," the statement read.The signatories said many more students and activists are being called for questioning and interrogation by the police on a daily basis and dubbed the action a "twisted fairy tale"."These activists are now being implicated in cases related to the communal violence in Delhi that took place in February. A riot in which the minorities suffered the maximum damage, both in terms of lives and livelihoods, has now become a pretext for the Delhi Police to further witch-hunt activists. Most of whom also come from the minority community," they further said in a statement.Calling the actions of Delhi Police as "inhuman", the personalities said the lockdown "cannot be a lockdown of the rights of citizens" and must not be "abused by the authorities in this manner"."These actions of the Delhi Police are utterly inhuman and undemocratic. Making several people travel to police stations every day and then throwing some of them to jails also defeats the purpose of the lockdown and makes a mockery of social distancing."At a time when various governments are releasing under-trials from jail to relieve the pressure from the prisons and restrict chances of contamination. The Delhi Police is pushing students and activists into jail." The signatories include directors Aparna Sen, Hansal Mehta, Ashwini Chaudhary, Onir, Vinta Nanda, Neeraj Ghaywan, actor-director Nandita Das, Konkona Sen Sharma, actors Sushant Singh, Zeeshan Ayyub, Sandhya Mridul, music composer Vishal Dadlani, among others."In a democratic country such as ours, the Constitution gives us the right to protest and express our views against the government and its policies. Many people in the country and the world had condemned the draconian Citizenship Amendment Act."Our opposition to the CAA continues, as we see it as a bigoted law that strikes at the secular fabric of our country. We condemn this witch-hunt of students and activists because they exercised their constitutional right to protest against CAA/NRC/NPR," the statement read.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between the citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

Top public health experts say the district braved several odds to come out on top on COVID management.To start with, the third confirmed Covid case India saw on February 3 was in Kasargod and had travel history to Wuhan, China.“Active disease surveillance was launched and contact tracing of the patient done to ensure the disease did not lead to clusters across the city. It was a tough task considering 15.38 per cent of the district population had returned from abroad. So the burden of disease from recent travelers was very high. Contact tracing, surveillance and early social distancing campaign by the name “break the chain” helped Kasargod fight Covid-19,” the Health Ministry’s review of the district containment plan says.After the early infection imported from Wuhan, which led to the first wave of Covid in Kasargod, the second wave came in the form of locals who came back from West Asia.As many as 17, 373 contacts of primary cases were traced by the district authorities who built 709 Covid care centres and launched door-to-door surveys for detection.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/keralas-kasargod-leads-the-way-in-covid-containment-73186

The highest mortality rate of 42.20 per cent is among 75 plus persons followed by 33.10 per cent in 60 to 75 year olds, 14.40 per cent in people up to 45 years and 10.30 per cent in the age group 45 to 60 years. Covid-19 Cases indiaDeaths 488WorldAs of Saturday night, the country had seen 14,792 cases and 488 deaths, marking a single-day increase of 1,405 cases and 51 deaths. Of the 14,792 cases, 4,291 (or 29.8 per cent) are associated to Tablighi Jamaat’s Nizamuddin cluster.Recoveries also continue to improve with 2,014 of all confirmed cases cured so far, signalling a national cure rate of 13.85 per cent.Health Ministry data analysis of mortality numbers further cements another global trend: a phenomenal death rate among people with pre-existing diseases such as cardiac and renal conditions, diabetes and hypertension.“Almost 83 per cent of all deaths have occurred in persons with co-morbid condition,” government data suggests.In two other trends that signal the importance of efficient enforcement of lockdown, the government has found that while on the one hand defiance of social distancing norms led to the creation of country’s biggest disease cluster in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, which now accounts for 29.80 per cent of total cases in India, proper adherence to lockdown helped 45 previously affected districts remain free of new cases for 14 days.The analysis shows that two districts — Mahe in Puducherry and Kodagu in Karnataka — have seen no new case in 28 days, putting these firmly in the green zone.Likewise, 22 new districts in 12 states today made it to the list of areas that haven’t reported a new case in 14 days. These include Hoshiarpur in Punjab; Rohtak and Charkhi Dadri in Haryana; Pulwama in J&K; Udaipur and Dholpur in Rajasthan and five districts in Assam. Prior to this, 23 districts had reported zero new cases for 14 days. This takes the total number of improving districts to 45.Three districts previously in the segment have fallen behind and reported new cases. These are Panipat in Haryana; Patna in Bihar and Nadia in Bengal.“Our field action is yielding positive results. On the other hand, the contribution of Nizamuddin cluster to overall disease burden remains disproportionate. This we are reiterating because we want to stress that even if one person violates lockdown conditions, the whole country will suffer the consequences,” Health Ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said today.A-I opens bookings on select routesNew Delhi: Air India on Saturday announced it has opened bookings on select domestic and international routes from May 4 and June 1, respectively.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi immediately thanked the government for “taking note of my warning” and amending the FDI norms, making government approval mandatory in specific cases.Restrictions expandedUnder the revised norm, curbs on Bangladesh and Pakistan have been expanded to include all neighbours who share land border with IndiaThe tightening of FDI norms to keep out China, which is flush with foreign exchange reserves of over $3 trillion, is a global trend. Germany, Italy and Australia are changing their FDI laws to safeguard their industries which are tottering under the impact of the Covid pandemic and are ripe takeover targets.The GoI has sought to keep out Chinese companies by a minor tweak in para 3 of the FDI policy. The new addition reads: “An entity of a country, which shares land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the government route.” This means all countries that share borders with India must take government’s approval for investing.The import is clear. Barring China, no other neighbouring country has the ability to make large investments.The People’s Bank of China bought 1.75 crore shares or 1.01 per cent of HDFC’s shareholding during January-March. The matter came to light after the HDFC submitted the information to regulators. From 2,500 per share, Covid impact led to HDFC shares losing 30 per cent of value. This saw Rahul Gandhi taking to the social media on April 12.“The economic slowdown has weakened many Indian corporates, making them targets for takeovers. The government must not allow foreign interests to take control of any Indian corporate at this time of crisis,” he had posted..||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fdi-policy-tweaked-to-keep-out-china-73091
