In some states, the list of persons who are under quarantine have been made public in the guise of public monitoring. This is excessive and a disproportionate invasion into the privacy of the individuals under quarantine, SFLC said in a statement.Karnataka and Tamil Nadu governments have developed GPS-based monitoring of people under self-quarantine to check spread of deadly coronavirus. The details are shared with direct and secondary contact of the person in home quarantine for them to remain alert and keep watch on their health.SFLC voluntary legal director Prasanth Sugathan said that although this is an extraordinary situation, care should be taken to ensure that the personal information of individuals are handled securely and with due care respecting their privacy rights.“Any measure adopted for public health purpose should be the least intrusive and should not violate the privacy rights of individuals. Publishing of route maps and contact tracing should be done without publishing the personal details of patients,” he said.The number of coronavirus cases climbed to 1,397 on Tuesday after 146 new infections were reported in the past 24 hours across the country, while the death toll rose to 35, according to the Union Health Ministry.SFLC said the personal data collected for the purpose of public health should only be retained during the response to the pandemic and deleted automatically without maintaining any copies, once the pandemic has been declared to be over.It said that the security protections for data processing during the covid-19 pandemic should not be compromised and the data must be maintained securely and must be exchanged only through secure platforms and hardware.“Any apps related to covid-19 promoted by the Government should be secure and their data collection should be in tune with the principles mentioned herein. Any surveillance required to respond to the pandemic should be temporary and only to the extent and degree allowed by provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the rules notified under these statutes,” the letter said.The organisations who have signed are CCAOI, Digital Empowerment Foundation, Free Software Movement of India, Internet Democracy Project, Internet Freedom Foundation, Internet Society-Delhi Chapter, IT For Change, SFLC.in and Swathanthra Malayalam Computing.The active COVID-19 cases stands at 1,238, while 123 people were either cured or discharged and one had migrated.Government imposed a 21 day lockdown in the country starting March 24 to contain the deadly disease for which there is no vaccine at present.Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba on Friday asked all the states to effectively monitor 15 lakh international air passengers who came from January 18 to March 23. He said that there appears to be a gap between the actual monitoring for covid-19 and the total arrivals.

31-03-2020||New Delhi||Centre asks states to comply with SC order on sale, registration of BS-IV vehicles||The Centre on Tuesday asked states to ensure compliance of the Supreme Court’s order on registration and sale of BS-IV vehicles.The apex court had last week allowed the sale of BS-IV vehicles for 10 days, except in Delhi-NCR, after the ongoing countrywide lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic is lifted.The court, which had earlier fixed the deadline of March 31, 2020 for sale of BS-IV vehicles across the country, had passed the order on a plea by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) seeking extension of time for clearing inventory amid the coronavirus outbreak and economic slowdown.“The respective Transport Department of the concerned state/UTs would ensure meticulous compliance of the Supreme Court order,” the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said in a letter to states.A Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta, which heard the matter on Friday through video-conferencing, made it clear that no BS-IV vehicles will be sold in Delhi-NCR from April 1, 2020.It had said that only 10 per cent of the unsold inventory of BS-IV vehicles can be permitted to be sold during this 10-day period after the lockdown, which has been enforced since March 24.Bharat Stage (BS) emission norms are standards instituted by the government to regulate output of air pollutants from motor vehicles. The BS-IV norms have been enforced across the country since April 2017.India has decided to switch to the world’s cleanest petrol and diesel from April 1 as it leapfrogs straight to Euro-VI emission compliant fuels from Euro-IV grades now—a feat achieved in just three years and not seen in any of the large economies around the globe.The top court also said BS-IV vehicles which have already been sold but not registered due to the lockdown can be registered after the restrictions are lifted.

31-03-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: FIR registered against Tablighi Maulana, others for violation of govt order||The Crime Branch of Delhi Police on Tuesday lodged an FIR against Maulana Saad and others of Tablighi Jamaat for violation of government order issued in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.The case was filed under three sections of Epidemic Disease Act 1897-- Section 269, 270, 271, and 120-B of Indian Penal Code (IPC) -- for violation of directions given to the management of Markaz of Basti Nizamuddin, police sources said.The action against Maulana apparently came after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had yesterday ordered the registration of an FIR against him for leading the congregation that led to several people, who attended it, to show symptoms of coronavirus.The order was issued for restriction of social/political/religious gathering and for taking safety measures, including social distancing, for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection.Meanwhile, Markaz Nizamuddin of Tablighi Jamaat in a statement claimed that turn of events was so sudden that it could not manage to vacate the premises.It said in a statement that people from across the globe and the country come to it for 3-5 days and all programmes are decided a year in advance in order to facilitate visitors from far-off places to plan their participation.“When honourable prime minister announced the ‘Janata curfew’, for 22 March, the ongoing programme in Markaz Nizamuddin was discontinued immediately, however, due to sudden cancelation of rail services across the country on 21 March, a large group of visitors who had to depart by way of railways got stuck in the Markaz premises,” it clarified.“Before the Janata curfew could be lifted at 9 pm, the honourable chief minister of Delhi announced lockdown of Delhi beginning at 6 am on 23 March till 31 March, thereby further diminishing any chances of these visitors availing road transport for their journey back home,” it said adding that despite this challenging situation, with the help of Markaz administration, around fifteen hundred visitors left Markaz Nizamuddin by availing whatever meagre transport was available.Markaz Nizamuddin would like to humbly offer the entire premises as a quarantine facility to help the authorities tide-over the challenge of current pandemic, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-fir-registered-against-tablighi-maulana-others-for-violation-of-govt-order-63697

Situation warrants that we present a united front instead of a divided one. I urge the intellectuals and others to hold back issues, if any till we overcome the crisis, while exercising their right to seek answers. I call upon them to come forward with suggestions for effectively tackling the menace," Naidu said in a statement summing up the first week of lockdown in the country.The Vice President also said netizens should make proper and effective use of social media. Instead of disseminating unauthenticated and frivolous information about the coronavirus, it should be used to spread right awareness about the problem, preventive and post-infection measures to be taken. Instead of creating a scare, people should be empowered to face the challenge, he said.Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha Secretariat with 1,300 employees decided to contribute minimum of one-day salary to PM-CARES amounting to minimum of Rs 33 lakh. The Secretariat said as of date over 250 House Members consented to contribute Rs 1 crore each from MPLADSs for the purpose.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/intellectuals-should-hold-back-from-raising-issues-face-challenge-unitedly-vice-president-63696

Regular cargo flights for transporting critical medical equipment and supplies between the two countries are likely to be operated by Air India from April 3, 2020 onwards,” the ministry said.The Lifeline Udan flights are being operated using the hub-and-spoke model, with New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata serving as the four hubs.Of the 62 flights, as many as 45 flights have been operated by the flag carrier Air India and its regional arm, Alliance Air, while the rest 17 by the Indian Air Force and private carriers IndiGo and SpiceJet, the release said.It also said Air India and IAF collaborated for operating Lifeline Udan services to Ladakh.Private carriers like IndiGo, Spicejet and BlueDart are operating medical cargo flights on a commercial basis, it stated.The lifeline cargo includes COVID-19-related reagents, enzymes, medical equipment, testing kits, personal protective equipment (PPE), masks, gloves and other accessories required by “Corona Warriors” across the country.The carriers involved in Lifeline Udan operations include Air India, Alliance Air, Indian Air Force (IAF) and Pawan Hans, the release said adding that it is also getting support from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and its cargo and logistics subsidiary AAICLAS, AI Airports Services (AIASL), PPP airports and private ground handling entities, among others.The Civil Aviation Ministry and all aviation stakeholders are determined to support India’s war against COVID-19 by transporting essential medical supplies by air in the most efficient, seamless and cost-effective manner, it said.

31-03-2020||New Delhi||Amid coronavirus outbreak, G-20 trade chiefs pledge to keep global supply chains open||Trade chiefs of Group of 20 nations have promised to “guard against profiteering and unjustified price increases” as they attempt delicate balancing between catering to national interests and keeping open the global supply lines of medical equipment and medicines.The need for such balancing was reflected in a short-lived controversy here over the export of medical protective equipment to Serbia.Netizens questioned the need to sell 35 lakhs pairs of sterile latex surgical gloves to Serbia when doctors in India were making video-posts addressed to the prime minister to highlight the shortage of personal protective equipment to frontline health workers.Russia has come under fire for the opposite reason – for limiting shipments of its grain abroad.India has also imposed restrictions such as on N-95 masks and banned the export of Hydroxychloroquine, whose effects are unproven but has been touted by US President Donald Trump as a miracle cure for Covid.However, it has allowed exports of Hydroxychloroquine where irrevocable Letter of Credit have been issued and on case-to-case basis as recommended by Ministry of External Affairs.The sentiment at the virtual meeting of commerce ministers was to work together to deliver a non-discriminatory and stable trade and investment environment and to keep the markets open.“We will explore ways for logistics networks via air, sea and land freight to remain open,” they said in a joint statement released by Saudi Arabia.The World Bank and the EU spoke against new export restrictions on “critical medical supplies, food or other key products” since there is no global supply shortage.EU itself has put exports of personal protective equipment on a case to case basis but the G-20 seemed inclined to offer a leeway to countries to prioritise their national requirements.“We agree that emergency measures designed to tackle Covid-19, if deemed necessary, must be targeted, proportionate, transparent, and temporary, and that they do not create unnecessary barriers to trade or disruption to global supply chains, and are consistent with WTO rules,” noted the joint statement.The US too wanted the restrictive actions to be temporary, transparent and appropriate.  “We should do as little as possible to disrupt supply chains and be cognisant of the effects on our neighbours,” said USTR chief Robert Lighthizer.He also appeared to negate Iran’s appeal to lift the sanctions by observing that the G-20’s current focus must be on immediate measures instead of inserting long-term agendas into its action plan to battle Covid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-coronavirus-outbreak-g-20-trade-chiefs-pledge-to-keep-global-supply-chains-open-63691
31-03-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus: China pulls up media for urging Taiwan's inclusion in fight against Covid||The Chinese embassy here took strong umbrage to media reporting in India on Taiwan’s aggressive stand on seeking inclusion in the World Health Organisation (WHO) meet from which it was thrown out after an Independence-minded president took office three years ago.Even before the epidemic broke out, then Head of Taiwan’s Indian Centre Chung-kwang Tien had made the case for Taiwan’s inclusion in a WHO conference on grounds that no country should be excluded from such a critical sector where his country had much to contribute.After it emerged that a December 31 advisory from the Taiwan Foreign Affairs Ministry had raised the flag on an unusual virus outbreak in Wuhan city, the Indian media has been questioning China’s continued efforts to exclude the island from an issue like an epidemic that brooks no borders.Taiwan had participated in the World Health Assembly as an observer under the name of "Chinese Taipei" for eight years from 2008 to 2016. While Taiwan seeks re-admittance, Beijing claims that was a special arrangement made at a time when the ruling party was keen on building bridges with the Chinese mainland.Dr Anamika, a Taiwan expert, says the WHO chief should extend a personal invite to Taiwan if its participation as an “Observer non-member state” is problematic because of lack of agreement on whether it is a state or not.Sources seized on an angry statement from Chinese embassy media spokesperson Ji Rong to point out that even Beijing admits that politics had dictated the exclusion of Taiwan. Ji has said: “The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), since taking power (in Taiwan) in 2016, has been stubbornly adhering to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist stance, constantly challenging the One-China principle, thus undermining the political foundation for the region's participation in the WHA”. This political change in government in Taiwan also changed the Chinese government's stand on a health issue, pointed sources here Ji went on to launch a broadside against the Indian media for making suggestions of politics dictating the sidelining of Taiwan. Ji made a “solemn statement” refuting some Indian media articles advocating so-called “Taiwan’s participation in WHO”.The spokesperson pointed out that the articles “seriously violated the One-China principle and sent wrong signals to Indian people”, and the Chinese Embassy in India “expresses its strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition”.The Chinese explanation is that WHO is a specialised agency of the UN restricted to only sovereign states and Taiwan has no right to join WHO as a part of China.At the same time, Beijing said no one cares more about the health and well-being of people in Taiwan than China's Central Government. “It assists Taiwan in obtaining information on public health events, ensures that information channels are unblocked, and makes proper arrangements for Taiwan's participation in global health affairs in accordance with the One-China principle,” said the spokesperson.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-china-pulls-up-media-for-urging-taiwans-inclusion-in-fight-against-covid-63689

Only fresh pass holders will be allowed to enter the area and all vehicles going in and out from the areas would be sanitised, he directed.Since the houses are wall to wall, people should keep distance while going on rooftop or balconies, he advised. Grocery, cooked food and milk would be provided to needy at the doorstep, he claimed. Of these 24 coronavirus positive cases, 10 were Indians evacuated from Iran to Jodhpur and Jaisalmer, State Medical and Health Secretary (ACS) Rohit Kumar Singh said in a bulletin here. Seven were admitted to the SN Medical College and three to AIIMS Jodhpur. While one each COVID positive case was reported from Jaipur, Jhunjhunu, Dungarpur and Ajmer.Bhilwara city reported a maximum of 26 positive cases, followed by Jaipur 21, Jhunjhunu 8, Jodhpur 7 — local plus 17 evacuees, Ajmer 5, Dungarpur 3, Pratapgarh 2, and Pali, Sikar, Churu and Alwar one each. Bhilwara, said to be an epicentre of the disease outbreak with 26 positive cases and two deaths, would also under go confinement from April 3-13, and no one would be allowed to step out of the house, an official said here. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who is holding two Covid strategy and review meetings twice a day, has directed the officials to keep a track of pregnant women in all districts and make proper arrangements for them. Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot has sanctioned a grant of Rs 50,000 each to about 11,000 Gram Panchayats, Rs 1 lakh to 295 Panchayat Samitis, and Rs 1.5 lakh to 33 Zila Parishads to distribute masks, sanitisers and gloves in rural areas with immediate effect.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaipurs-walled-city-sealed-%C2%A0coronavirus-cases-rise-to-93-in-rajasthan-63686
31-03-2020||Thiruvananthapuram/Hyderabad||Tipplers in Kerala with withdrawal symptoms to get special passes to buy liquor||Special passes will be issued for tipplers in Kerala to buy liquor but on doctor’s prescription that they are showing withdrawal symptoms due to non-availability of alcohol in view of the coronavirus lockdown.A decision allowing the purchase of liquor from the Excise department in a “controlled manner” was taken by the state government to “resolve” what it called many social issues, including suicidal tendencies and frustration among people who consumed alcohol regularly.However, the medical fraternity was up in arms on Tuesday against the government order.The Kerala Government Medical Officer’s Association (KGMOA) has decided to observe April 1 as ‘black day’ in protest against the order issued late on Monday night.Dr Vijayakrishnan G S, General Secretary of the KGMOA, called the decision a medical blunder.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) also flayed the Left government’s plan to supply liquor to addicts based on prescription, saying it was not “scientific”.Three men in Kerala have committed suicide after allegedly showing alcohol withdrawal symptoms within days after liquor stores shut the doors following the 21-day national lockdown that came into force last Wednesday to try halt the spread of COVID-19.Similar incidents have been reported in other parts of the country, including in neighbouring Telangana and Karnataka.Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in the country. The sale of liquor in the state has continued on an upward spiral despite the prohibitive tax on legal alcohol and the many dry days.The state had a record Rs 14,508 crore liquor sales in 2018-19 sold through the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco), the state-owned liquor retail monopoly, compared to around Rs 11,000 crore in the previous year, according to official data.The amount of liquor sold in bars and hotels remained unquantified. Bootleg liquor, hooch and moonshine also appropriated a sizeable segment of the market for cheap and hard spirits on holidays.“Following the lockdown and the closure of liquor outlets in the state, there were many instances of social issues including the frustration and suicide tendencies shown by those who used to consume liquor regularly and the state government has decided to initiate steps to resolve the matter,” the order said.The order said those who have physical and mental issues due to withdrawal symptoms could be given liquor in a “controlled” and “prescribed” manner.It also said such persons with withdrawal symptoms should approach the Public Health Centres, Taluk hospitals, district hospitals, general hospitals or the medical college hospitals and get themselves examined by the doctor.“If such a person gets a prescription from the doctors saying he has withdrawal symptoms, he could be provided with liquor in a controlled manner,” the order read.It said the prescription could be produced at the nearby Excise office along with a government issued identity card of the person carrying the prescription and receive a liquor pass.The pass can be produced before the office of the Beverages Cooperation Managing Director, who will take necessary steps to distribute liquor, the order said.The order also said the liquor outlets need not be kept opened for this purpose.“Those showing withdrawal symptoms should be provided scientific treatment which can be given at homes or by giving medicines after admitting them at hospitals,” said IMA’s Abraham Varghese.Dr Vijayakrishnan said at a time when the doctors are fighting the pandemic the move by the government will affect the morale of medical practitioners.“The duty of the doctor is to treat the patient who approaches him with withdrawal symptoms. The medicines given to during treatment do have side-effects and it’s not possible to provide liquor with that,” he told reporters.In neighbouring Telangana, cases of people suffering from alcohol withdrawal have also shown a rise.Nearly 250 cases have been reported so far at the Institute of Mental Health in Erragadda in Hyderabad.“Due to non-availability of toddy or liquor in local markets in view of ongoing coronavirus lockdown for the past one week, tipplers are experiencing mild, moderate and severe withdrawal symptoms such as sleeplessness and restlessness. Those complaining of moderate and severe symptoms are admitted to hospitals,” doctors at the institute said.According to the doctors, severe withdrawal symptoms include seizure, epilepsy, behaving in an anti-social manner, injuring themselves or harming others also.Doctors also warned that sometimes the withdrawal symptoms would be so severe that such patients would develop suicidal symptoms.On Friday last, a 50-year-old daily wage worker in Hyderabad allegedly committed suicide by jumping off a building as he was upset at not being able to get liquor.One person died and several others were in a critical condition in Assam’s Jorhat district on Monday after consuming raw spirit as a substitute for liquor, police said.In Karnataka, a man apparently frustrated at not being able to get liquor due to the lockdown attempted to end his life on Sunday, police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tipplers-in-kerala-with-withdrawal-symptoms-to-get-special-passes-to-buy-liquor-63682
31-03-2020||New Delhi||Elderly Kerala couple recovers from coronavirus; experts see ray of hope||The recovery of an elderly couple, aged 93 and 88, in Kerala from coronavirus in the face of high mortality rate in the older population globally due to the infection has brought a ray of hope to other patients, with some experts describing it as “rarest of the rare” case.Thomas and his wife Mariyamma, hailing from Ranni locality in Pathanamthitta municipality in Central Travancore region, tested positive and remained critical for days, before recovering completely from the infection.While some experts are calling it “one of the rarest of the rare case”, others attributed their recovery to good patient care system in the southern state. Globally, the death rate due to coronavirus was overwhelmingly weighted against the elderly and those suffering from various ailments.“It is one of the rarest of rare cases in the light of reported high mortality in the higher age groups, especially in the age bracket of above 70 years. It is nothing short of a miracle,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor in the Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi.“It is giving a ray of hope to the healthcare workers and the elderly fighting against this dreaded disease that recovery is always possible,” he said.Gupta, also part of the team which is treating COVID-19 patients admitted at Safdarjung Hospital, said probably this couple’s immune system was able to sustain the fight to such an extent that they were able to recover and “this gives us hope”.A large number of older people above aged 60 have died in China, Italy, the US and the Spain, the countries which have been hit hardest by the virus.India has recorded over 1,250 positive cases of coronavirus and at least 32 deaths so far. Globally, the virus has infected more than 700,000 people and claimed around 35,000 lives.The tale of survival from India is expected to lift the spirits of both patients and doctors fighting against the monumental global crisis, said an official.The couple’s son had travelled to Italy along with his wife and son and tested positive for the disease earlier this month.The elderly had contracted the disease after coming in contact with them and had been admitted to the Kottayam Medical College and Hospital, according to health officials in Kerala.They were already suffering from various age-related diseases and their condition was very critical in one phase of the treatment, they said adding both Thomas and Mariyamma completely recovered from the infection.In an advisory, the Union Health Minister on Sunday said the virus infection tends to be more severe in the case of the elderly population, resulting in higher mortality. It listed some “dos and don’ts” for reducing the transmission of the virus among the aged section.“Elderly people are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection due to their decreased immunity and body reserves, as well as multiple associated comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,” the advisory said.Dr Arvind Kumar, lung surgeon at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here, said elderly people are in high mortality risk bracket as far as coronavirus infection is concerned, but “I wouldn’t call it a rare case”.“Rather, it should be attributed to the excellent healthcare they received in Kerala. Survival rate increases if the health care system is not good and not burdened.“In Italy too, the morality rate of people above 80 is about 14 per cent. So, healthcare system makes all the difference and how burdened they are,” he told PTI.In New York, the healthcare system has got overwhelmed by rising number of cases, and medical camps have been set up in the Central Park and a US Navy hospital ship ‘Comfort’ has arrived in that city to provide help, he said.Associate Professor of Geriatrics at AIIMS, and consultant of WHO, SEARO, Dr Prasun Chatterjee said not all aged people are immuno-compromised and the severity of COVID-19 depends on one’s immune system, biological reserve and the severity of manifestation.Considering this example what can be understood is this that these two elderly persons had a good amount of immunity to fight against the viral load, he added.The elderly are at the risk of mortality due to the fading immune system and multi-morbidity and geriatric syndrome (fall frailty and dementia and impaired mobility). And, this couple’s survival story gives a positive message that the elderly can survive this dreaded disease, Chatterjee said.Dr Nevin Kishore, head of bronchology & senior consultant, respiratory medicine, Max Healthcare, also said that the Kerala couple surviving COVID-19 is “not rare” but it is less likely than in younger people.“Survival rate is 95 per cent in 20 and above; 70 per cent in 40-60 age group and 20-25 per cent in 90 and above,” he said.It is also true that 80 per cent of patients who are infected with coronavirus will have mild or almost no symptoms. This section would also include some elderly people, specially those who are otherwise fit and have none of the medical conditions mentioned, he added.Dr Udgeath Dhir, Director and Head, Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, said high mortality of the elderly to COVID-19 does not mean that older patients won’t recover.“Some of them will. That is what has happened in this (Kerala couple) case. It is not a miracle. It is just a simple case of some surviving the virus.“If adequate care is given, if properly treated, detected before it becomes too severe, there is a good chance anyone can recover from this virus,” he said. Dr Neeraj Gupta of Safdarjung Hospital, who calls this a rare case, noted that in Italy a 102-year-old woman surviving the onsalught of COVID-19 proves the point and there can be several more such cases across the world, which come as a “glimmer of hope in this dark hour”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/elderly-kerala-couple-recovers-from-coronavirus-experts-see-ray-of-hope-63681

Let us not compare India with the US where the Centre for Diseases Control has advised people to wear masks. The level of disease outbreak in India is not the same as in the US. The US today is the second most COVID-affected country after Italy. Indian outbreak is at a very different level. The probability of exposure to COVID in India is low. So, only sick people should wear masks. The better way to prevent COVID spread is social distancing which India is following," Gangakhedkar said.Ministry representative Lav Agarwal also said people should wear masks only when needed and when they are suffering from cough and need to wear a mask to prevent the infection from spreading."Masks are a scarce commodity which we must use judiciously," he said.To specific queries on PSA's manual on homemade masks, Agarwal said the issue was being technically examined by the experts and guidance will be issued in time.WHO has not specifically advised countries on the use of homemade masks. WHO has, however, clearly said masks should only be worn by people experiencing COVID19 like symptoms and cough and sneezing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/healthy-people-do-not-need-masks-reiterates-govt-63679

Pawar added that he has written a letter to the centre for the expeditious clearance of the amount.Maharashtra govt clarifies Hours after the Maharashtra government said it would cut the salaries of employees in the Class I, II and III categories, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar clarified that March salaries would be paid in two instalments in April."The salaries of government officials and employees are paid in one go. However the state government hasn't received the outstanding amount of Rs 16,654 crore even on the last day of the financial year from the Centre. If this amount had been received the government would have paid the salaries at once," Pawar said in a statement.Consequently, Class I and II employees would be paid 50 per cent of their emoluments in the first phase while Class III employees will be paid 75 per cent of their salaries. However, employees of 'D' class and the retirees will get the full salaries, Pawar said.He added that salaries of officials and employees of the state's public health department, medical education department, police department, urban development department, rural development department, revenue department, local self-government institutes will be paid in full.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-maharashtra-cm-ministers-officials-to-see-pay-cut-class-4-staff-exempted-63677
31-03-2020||Jaipur/Gurugram||‘10 deaf & mute people stuck in lockdown, make video call to sign language experts for help’||Knowing no other way to communicate except the sign language, ten deaf and dumb persons from various states have got stuck in Gurugram amid the coronavirus-triggered nationwide lockdown, finding it hard to access essentials and often sleeping on empty stomach.But, not to be deterred by their handicaps, a group of four Madhya Pradesh natives first made video calls to two of their acquaintances in Indore, who knew sign language, and explained their plight to them on phone in sign language.Working for various private firms in Gurugram, the ten got stuck since the day of ‘Janata curfew’ on March 22 entailing lockdown in the district from the same night.Gurugram was one of the first seven districts in Haryana, where the state government had ordered shutdown, before imposition of the 21-day lockdown on March 25.The ten include six from Madhya Pradesh, two from Uttar Pradesh and one each from Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.After the four MP natives contacted sign language experts, Gyanendra and Monica Purohit, they in turn, contacted this correspondent in Jaipur and arranged a video conference with the four.“We are stuck. We have very little ration with us, barely enough for one or two days. We have no adequate food nor sufficient money and this is an unprecedented ordeal for us because we are unable to communicate without sign language,” they told PTI on video calls in sign language, deciphered by the two Indore experts.They said they have survived the ordeal till now on doles by their neighbours, but are unable to do anything for themselves on their own because of the communication barrier.“Someone arranged us food packets a day before yesterday but there is nothing after that. We do not know what will happen because the communication is a major hurdle. We cannot survive for many more days in such situation,” the four MP natives said.The four MP residents are Amit Kumar Pandey from Rewa, Nitin Singh Rajput and Sandeep Soni from Jabalpur and Rakesh Kumar Navdev Katni.Four of them are living in rented rooms near Geetanjali Hospital on Rampur Road in Gurugram. They knew no one in their neighbourhood who know sign language and could be of some help to them.“Shops are not nearby and we do not know what will happen to our jobs. We are totally uncertain. We have little money and in this situation, we want to return home in Madhya Pradesh as soon as possible,” they said.After contacting PTI, the two sign language experts circulated the story of the four MP men’s plight on social media, which resulted in the message reaching six more similar persons in Gurugram and they too, in turn, contacted the sign-language experts in Indore.The six include Devraj Raghuvasnhi and Shailendra from MP, Madan Mohan and Robins from UP, Ramchandra from Rajasthan and Ajay from Uttarakhand. The six are living in different places in Gurugram.“We are running short of ration. We are helpless and want ration urgently,” said Devraj.Sign language expert Purohit said there could be more such persons stuck in Gurugram and elsewhere in the country and the district administration should reach such persons pro-actively to provide them much-needed succour.

31-03-2020||---||‘Coronavirus outbreak can be stopped if 80 pc population wears masks’||New Delhi, March 31Marking a major shift in strategy from the existing rules on masks, a government guidance on masks on Tuesday said once 80 per cent of population wears masks outbreak of coronavirus can be stopped immediately. However, as per ICMR, non-sick people need not wear masks as of now. Current Health Ministry guidelines clearly state healthy people don’t need masks, social distancing better strategy to prevent COVID spread.The detailed manual on homemade masks: “Masks for Curbing the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus” issued by the Ofﬁce of the Principal Scientiﬁc Adviser to the Prime Minister says “analyses show if 50% of the population were to wear masks, only 50% of the population would be infected by the virus. Once 80% of the population wears a mask, the outbreak can be stopped immediately”.Quoting the World Health Organisation, the manual states that “masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly”.On Principal Scientific Adviser’s manual on use of homemade masks, the Health Ministry says: “There is no current WHO guidance on use of homemade masks. Government is studying the issue of use of homemade masks and appropriate guidance will be issued in time.”‘On Why Wear a Mask’, the manual says “COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person to person contact. Virus carrying droplets dry fast enough to form droplet nuclei and remain airborne eventually landing on different surfaces. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been detected in aerosols for up to three hours and on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to three days”.The manual says that masks lower the chances of coronavirus entering the respiratory system through droplets still in the air from an infected person.It says reducing the chances of inhaling the virus by wearing a protective mask that is cleaned thoroughly using a combination of approaches that use Heat, UV light, water, soap and alcohol, will be vital to stopping its spread.The proposed guide is meant to provide a simple outline of best practices to make, use and reuse masks to enable NGOs and individuals to self-create such masks and accelerate widespread adoption of masks across India, according to the government statement.The key criteria for proposed designs are Ease of Access to Materials, Easy of Making at Home, Ease of Use and Reuse. Wearing of masks is especially recommended for people living in densely populated areas across India.Earlier in its update on Science, Technology and Innovation response to COVID-19, the PSA stated the Science and Technology Empowered Committee for COVID-19 response has rapidly worked towards implementation of scientific solutions. Actions are in place keeping in view the critical need to increase the testing facilities for COVID-19 include an office memorandum allowing institutes under DST, DBT, CSIR, DAE, DRDO and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to self-assess and prepare their labs for research and testing through the standard and rigorous protocol. Testing will be stratified according to priorities set by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and ICMR. Research will also be stratified into short and mid-term returns. The S&T Empowered Committee was constituted on March 19.The committee is chaired by Prof. Vinod Paul, Member, NITI Aayog and Prof. K Vijay Raghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, and is responsible for coordination amongst science agencies, scientists, industries and regulatory bodies, and to take speedy decisions on research and development to implementation related to the Sars-Cov-2 virus and the COVID-19 disease.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-outbreak-can-be-stopped-if-80-pc-population-wears-masks-63668

The MHA said instructions were also issued to chief secretaries and Director Generals of Police (DGsP) of all states as well as Commissioner of Police, Delhi. The advisories were also reiterated by the Director Intelligence Bureau (DIB) to all the State DGsP on March 28 and 29.Meanwhile, TJ workers staying in the Markaz in Nizamuddin, Delhi, were also persuaded for medical screening by state authorities and police, MHA said. By March 29, nearly 162 TJ workers were medically screened and shifted to quarantine facilities. So far, over 1,500 TJ workers have been moved to Narela, Sultanpuri and Bakkarwala quarantine facilities and 303, who have been found having Covid-19 symptoms, were referred to different government hospitals in the national capital including LNJP, RGSS, GTB, DDU Hospitals and AllMS, Jhajjar.Tabligh Jamaat workers, both foreigners as well Indians, participate in Tabligh activities (Chilla) across the country throughout the year. These events also see participation of foreign nationals, particularly from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Kyrgyzstan.Foreigners coming to India for tabligh events first report to Tabligh Markaz at Banglewali Mosque at Hazrat Nizamuddin. From here, they are detailed for Tabligh activities (Chilla) to different parts of the country, the MHA said.Chilla activities in all states are coordinated by district coordinators, who, in turn, in some States are supervised by state Amirs.As of March 21, 2020, some 1,746 people were staying at the Nizamuddin Markaz--- 216 foreigners and 1,530 Indians---the MHA said. Additionally, about 824 foreigners had been, as on March 21, doing Chilla activities in various parts of the country. Also, a large number of Indian Tabligh Jamaat workers were also engaged in different parts of the country.Details of these 824 foreigners had been shared on March 21 with various state police departments for identifying them, getting them medically screened and quarantining them. Since February 1, Bureau of Immigration has been sharing details of all international arrivals from affected countries based on “Self-Declaration Form” they filled on arrival with state authorities.In addition, since March 6, Bureau of Immigration had also been sharing details of all the international arrivals (both Indians and foreigners) at all the international airports in the country to the concerned State, based on the permanent address mentioned in their passport, in case of Indians, and hotel address, in case of foreigners.BlacklistMeanwhile, sources in the MHA said earlier in the day that the central government would soon blacklist the 281 identified foreign nationals.Officials said they had a list of 1,549  Indians from 19 states who had participated in the event as well. “We have prepared a state-wise list of these Indians, as maximum 501 came from Tamil Nadu, 216 from Assam, 156 from Uttar Pradesh, 109 from Maharashtra and 107 from Madhya Pradesh,” officials said.The MHA officials said as many as 30 of these foreign nationals, who attended the Tabligh-e-Jamaat at Nizamuddin Markaz facility in March, had shown symptoms of COVID-19 and as per information available at least three had succumbed to the infection in the last few days.A senior MHA official said, “Those foreign nationals, who came on tourist visas and ended up attending the religious event at Nizamuddin, have violated the visa conditions and thus the government has no option but to put them under the blacklist. Tourist visa holders can’t attend a religious function.” He said the blacklist norm is such that once a foreigner is put in it, he or she can’t travel to India in future.Of the total 281 foreigners identified by the police at the Nizamuddin campus in the last two days, 19 are from Nepal, 20 from Malaysia, one from Afghanistan, 33 from Myanmar, one from Algeria, one from Djibouti, 28 from Kyrgystan, 72 from Indonesia, seven from Thailand, 34 from Sri Lanka, 19 from Bangladesh, three from England, one from Singapore, four from Fiji, one from France and one from Kuwait.

There is also this certain lack of trust in the urban community which is causing them to want to get home,” adds Awasthy.Another researcher, who did not want to be named, said the fear was stemming from uncertainty and not knowing how long the lockdown or this situation would continue. “It is possible that their employers have asked them to leave. Lack of communication regarding government plans may also be the problem,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/migrants-scared-experts-63436

Developed countries such as the US, Italy, Germany and Spain, which used strategies other than lockdown and are the worst hit, witnessed several thousand cases at a much faster rate than India.Need 100% complianceWe can’t afford to reduce our level of alertness just yet. We need 100 per cent compliance, not 99 per cent. — Lav Agarwal, Joint secy, Health MinistryAmid fears that shutdown of businesses across the country may trigger severe economic and social distress, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba clarified there was no immediate plan to extend the 21-day lockdown. This came after thousands of migrant labourers undertook long journeys from major urban centres on foot to their homes reflecting their struggle for survival due to job losses.On the efficacy of lockdown, Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said: “India took 12 days to move from 100 cases to 1,000. Many developed countries with significantly smaller populations jumped from 100 to 3,500, 5,000, 6,000 and even 7,800 cases over the same period. It is clear, practising social distancing and lockdown is giving us relatively positive results. He refused to comment on Cabinet Secretary Rajeev Gauba’s statement that lockdown will not be extended beyond the 21-day period.The government clarified India was still not at community transmission stage and it would announce publicly once that stage was reached. In the past 24 hours, India saw 92 new cases (up from 979 to 1,071) and two new deaths, with toll touching 29.Major efforts are now on to ramp up medical supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), masks and ventilators. India has only 14,000 ventilators in its hospitals as of now; 3.34 lakh PPEs for doctors and 11.95 lakh N95 masks.Automobile makers were asked to produce ventilators and orders placed with international firms.No community spread so far, clarifies govtThe Health Ministry denied India was in community transmission stage after questions were raised on Covid-19 patient transportation protocol document which mentions “limited community transmission stage”.

They have also said India needs much more than the amount especially allocated to strengthen the country’s health care system to combat the epidemic.Actor Akshay Kumar, the Board of Cricket Control of India (BCCI) and PayTM are among individuals, institutions and corporates that have announced contributions to the fund. Separately, billionaire-philanthropists like Ratan Tata and Azim Premji plan to set aside hefty amounts for the battle against coronavirus, though not through the PM-CARES fund.The PM’s signal to accept contributions from abroad would immediately open the window for a US grant of over Rs 20 crore to prepare laboratory systems and technical experts for response and preparedness. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also offered to his counterpart S Jaishankar his country’s experience of combating the epidemic as well as diagnostic and other medical equipment.During the video-conference, the PM complimented the Heads of Missions for their efforts to evacuate Indians stranded abroad in some of the epicentres of the crisis while providing them a five-point to-do list for the coming days.They must first ensure their own health and safety, and that of their teams and families; and then attend to stranded Indians. They must stay alert to picking up the best practices, innovations, scientific breakthroughs and sources to procure medical equipment.Since this crisis also impacts upon the economy, the Heads of Mission must also focus on ensuring that commerce in essential supplies, logistics chains and remittances are unaffected. The envoys were also asked to pay close attention to the evolving international political and economic situation, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.In response, 10 Heads of Mission in Beijing, Washington DC, Tehran, Rome, Berlin, Kathmandu, Abu Dhabi, Kabul, Male and Seoul offered their perspectives to the Prime Minister and the rest of the audience.They shared feedback regarding appreciation in these countries of the resolute measures taken by India to combat this pandemic.The Prime Minister said India had taken early steps in response to this pandemic from mid-January this year to reduce the risk of importing the infection, and thereafter to prevent a large outbreak.
