They have also said India needs much more than the amount especially allocated to strengthen the country’s health care system to combat the epidemic.Actor Akshay Kumar, the Board of Cricket Control of India (BCCI) and PayTM are among individuals, institutions and corporates that have announced contributions to the fund. Separately, billionaire-philanthropists like Ratan Tata and Azim Premji plan to set aside hefty amounts for the battle against coronavirus, though not through the PM-CARES fund.The PM’s signal to accept contributions from abroad would immediately open the window for a US grant of over Rs 20 crore to prepare laboratory systems and technical experts for response and preparedness. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also offered to his counterpart S Jaishankar his country’s experience of combating the epidemic as well as diagnostic and other medical equipment.During the video-conference, the PM complimented the Heads of Missions for their efforts to evacuate Indians stranded abroad in some of the epicentres of the crisis while providing them a five-point to-do list for the coming days. They must first ensure their own health and safety, and that of their teams and families; and then attend to stranded Indians.They must stay alert to picking up the best practices, innovations, scientific breakthroughs and sources to procure medical equipment.Since this crisis also impacts upon the economy, the Heads of Mission must also focus on ensuring that commerce in essential supplies, logistics chains and remittances are unaffected. The envoys were also asked to pay close attention to the evolving international political and economic situation, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.In response, 10 Heads of Mission in Beijing, Washington DC, Tehran, Rome, Berlin, Kathmandu, Abu Dhabi, Kabul, Male and Seoul offered their perspectives to the PM and the rest of the audience.The Prime Minister said India had taken early steps in response to this pandemic from mid-January this year to reduce the risk of importing the infection, and thereafter to prevent a large outbreak. This included the world’s largest quarantine and lock-down.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-asks-envoys-to-mobilise-funds-equipment-in-war-against-coronavirus-63223

No one would be allowed to enter the area as well, health department officials said.Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray, who represents the constituency, confirmed the news on Twitter. “Late last night 2 am onwards, Koliwada and Janta Colony have been sealed off further.Disinfection and fumigation is on along with contact tracing,” Thackeray tweeted.It is not clear how many people have tested positive for coronavirus in the two congested colonies. Health department officials refused to confirm or deny reports that four people have tested positive and they had mingled with a lot of people in the two colonies.In addition, one colony in Sangli’s Islampur tehsil has been turned into a ‘containment zone’ after 25 members of a family tested positive for the coronavirus. Some members of the family who had returned from a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus and subsequently transmitted it to their relatives as well, according to officials.As part of the safety measures, houses and properties in a one kilometre radius have been marked as part of the ‘containment zone,’ officials said.However, no one other than members of the family have tested positive for the virus so far, according to officials. More than 325 people have been quarantined within the ‘containment zone’ in Sangli, according to district officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-turns-corona-clusters-into-containment-zones-63212

He was in the kitchen area when at the same time his wife was cooking food. Suddenly, he spilled some sanitiser on his ‘kurta’. The fumes from the sanitiser reached the cooking gas source and before anybody could react his ‘kurta’ caught fire,” the hospital said in a statement.Hand sanitiser is being used at regular intervals by people on recommendation of doctors to ward-off infection from coronavirus that has wreaked havoc globally.The man was brought to the hospital with 35 per cent burn injuries. The patient suffered burn injuries on his face, neck, front of chest, abdomen and both hands, the doctors said.The man is being treated in the department of plastic and cosmetic surgery and his condition is “stable”, hospital authorities said.According to Mahesh Mangal, Chairman, Department of Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery, “Although hand sanitiser is absolutely essential, we strongly advise that alcohol-based sanitiser must be used very carefully.”“The high ethyl alcohol content in the product—up to 62 per cent in some cases—makes hand sanitiser highly inflammable and prone to lead to burns. One should never use sanitiser near fire area or any heating place. It should be used in sufficient quantity and allowed to dry,” he added.Demand for hand sanitiser has grown significantly in the market with the spread of COVID-19 that has affected more than 1,000 people across India.

30-03-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Fear and panic becoming bigger problem than coronavirus, observes SC||As thousands of migrant workers walking back to their native places after being rendered jobless due to the coronavirus lockdown, the Supreme Court on Monday observed that the panic and fear is becoming a “bigger problem than coronavirus”, and sought a status report from the Centre by Tuesday on the measures taken to prevent the exodus.The court said it would not create more confusion by issuing directions on measures which the government is already taking.Hearing two separate petitions through video-conferencing, Chief Justice Bobde and Justice L Nageswara Rao said before passing any direction, it would like to wait for the status report from the Centre.The PILs, filed by advocates Alakh Alok Srivastava and Rashmi Bansal, sought relief, including food, water, medicines and proper medical facilities, for thousands of migrant workers who are leaving for their native places after being rendered homeless and jobless due to the 21-day coronavirus lockdown.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre said the migration needs to be stopped to prevent the spread of virus and the Centre as well as concerned states have taken requisite steps to deal with it.Referring to various news stories, Srivastava, petitioner in-person, said there is lack of cohesion and cooperation between states on the issue of migration of labourers.The Uttar Pradesh Government initially provided buses for movement of migrant labourers for two days and now they have stopped the service, he added.Reacting to Mehta’s submission that Centre would like to file the status report on affidavit on the steps taken, the Bench said, “We would not deal with the things, which the government is already doing. We would like to wait for the report of Centre.”Bansal, another petitioner in-person, said medical and safety measures are required for these migrant labourers. She also suggested that sanitisers can be sprinkled on the groups of migrant labourers to disinfect them, and mid-day meal providers should be roped in to provide food.To Bansal’s remarks, the Bench said, “you are assuming that government is not doing anything. It is advising us on what steps to be taken. Let us see what they are doing. Let them file a common reply on both these petitions”.Bansal said counsellors could be deployed for these migrant workers, who are trying to leave cities due to fear and panic.“This fear and panic is a bigger problem than this virus”, the Bench observed, adding, “We are not going to add to the confusion by issuing directions which are already being taken care of by the government.”The Bench posted the matters for further hearing on Tuesday.Srivastava in his plea had sought direction to the Centre to redress the plight of thousands of migrant workers who along with their families are “walking on foot” to reach their native places amid the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide lockdown.The plea has also sought a direction to the authorities to identify such stranded migrant workers and provide them with food, water, medicines and proper medical facilities.

Hence there is a need for educating them about the importance of social distancing to check the spread of the deadly virus, he also said.Addressing organisations involved in social work via video conferencing here, Modi said they can play a huge role in arranging basic necessities for the poor and can also dedicate their medical facilities and volunteers to serve patients and the needy.The nation is facing an “unprecedented crisis” and “needs the service of these organisations and their resources like never before”, the prime minister was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the PMO.Highlighting that the nation needs both short-term measures and a long-term vision to overcome the challenge posed by the outbreak of the viral infection, Modi observed that “these organisations have three distinct specialities: humane approach, massive reach and connect with people and a service mindset”.“This is why they are trusted implicitly”, he said.  Recalling that Mahatma Gandhi used to say that serving the poor and the downtrodden is the best way to serve the nation, the prime minister praised the dedication and commitment of the participating organisation towards serving humanity, the statement said.The organisations also talked about the work being done by them currently to meet the challenge through awareness campaigns by digital means, distribution of essentials, food packets, sanitisers, medicines and provision of medical help to those in need.

30-03-2020||Lucknow||Migrants sprayed with disinfectants after arrival at Bareilly bus stand||A team of sanitization workers on Sunday sprayed chemicals at migrants at the Bareilly bus stand after forcing them to sit on the street.The migrants reportedly had trudged down from Gautama Buddha Nagar and Delhi. Local officials asked them to sit on a street near the bus stand and assured them food and transport. But before this, the migrants were liberally spraying with a disinfectant.READ | Corona politics: BJP says conspiracy against UP govt which is doing a good jobMohd Afzal, who was among them said, “About 50 of us were sitting waiting for food and the bus at the satellite bus station when some men in protective suits came and began spraying water on us. They said that they were from the sanitization team and were sanitizing us, and that it was for our good. The children began crying as the chemical entered their eyes and women were shocked at the manner in which they were sprayed upon, as if we were crops.”यूपी सरकार से गुजारिश है कि हम सब मिलकर इस आपदा के खिलाफ लड़ रहे हैं लेकिन कृपा करके ऐसे अमानवीय काम मत करिए। मजदूरों ने पहले से ही बहुत दुख झेल लिए हैं। उनको केमिकल डाल कर इस तरह नहलाइए मत। इससे उनका बचाव नहीं होगा बल्कि उनकी सेहत के लिए और खतरे पैदा हो जाएंगे। pic.twitter.com/ftovaFHR5q  According to sources, the sanitizing team sprayed the group with a diluted mixture of sodium hypochlorite.Sodium Hypochlorite is the main ingredient in laundry bleach. It is extensively used as a bleaching agent in textile, detergent, paper and pulp industries. It is also used as a disinfectant.Afzal alleged that after the spray some children complained of itching in their eyes while some women developed rashes.“The chemical had a strange smell and after this incident, most of us left Bareilly and decided to continue our journey on foot instead of waiting for the promised bus,” he said.Mohd Afzal works as a courier boy in a company in G B Nagar and is on his way home to Shahjahanpur.Neither the Bareilly District Magistrate Nitish Kumar responded to the calls nor was any other official in either Bareilly or Lucknow forthcoming to comment on the incident.Reacting to the development Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in a tweet said: I am requesting the UP government that we will unitedly fight against this epidemic. Please do not display such inhuman behaviour. The migrant labourers are already very harassed. Do not bath them in chemicals. This will not protect them but make them sick.”Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav also questioned the spraying.He asked: “Use of chemicals to sanitize travellers raises some questions – Did WHO issue instructions for this? Is there an antidote for the itching due to chemicals?  Had any arrangement been made for the people on the streets to change their clothes? Were any alternate arrangements made for the food they may be carrying which may have also drenched in chemicals?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/migrants-sprayed-with-disinfectants-after-arrival-at-bareilly-bus-stand-63196
30-03-2020||Vibha Sharma||Coronavirus: During adverse circumstances, most natural instinct is to return home, say experts||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 30As the government struggles to convince migrant workers to adhere to the lockdown and stay put where they are, and reports emerge of many also trying to return to far-off native places, experts say the most natural instinct when the going gets tough and there is uncertainty in the air is to "get home"."This is something which was perhaps not anticipated either by us as a community and also the administration," says Richa Awasthy from the School of Business, Public Policy and Social Entrepreneurship (SBPPSE) in Ambedkar University and a specialist  in organisational behaviour."They (migrant labourers) are feeling scared and vulnerable, which is natural. Alongside, there is also this certain lack of trust in the urban community which is causing them to want to get home," adds Awasthy.So while unemployment and fear of survival, food, etc, is a major concern in the times of corona crisis, learning about the volatile power of nature is adding to the anxiety and the desire/need to get home."We are in strict lockdown due to the coronavirus anxiety. At the same time, we are learning about social dynamics which is acting against the law of land.”Despite lockdown thousands of labourers are leaving metro cities. Are they not scared of the coronavirus? Is there some other anxiety operating on their minds?"In a time of social distancing they are coming together as a social group, they seem to suffer from fear and hopelessness, especially from urban strata, that is causing them to take these risks," she says.Meanwhile, according to another researcher from a Delhi-based management institute, who did not want to be identified, the fear stems from uncertainty and not knowing how long the lockdown would continue."How will they survive without food? It may a possibility that their employers are asking them to leave, so they are left with no choice. A major problem seems to be lack of proper communication regarding initiatives planned by the government," he adds.In such a situation it is safer to be "home".A resident of Patparganj and as someone who has the experience of working with the segment in her printing unit in nearby Ghaziabad, Deepa has an interesting take on the issue.According to her, daily wage workers do not have a sense of belonging towards metros. "Mostly from UP and Bihar, they address their place of work here as a ‘dera’, a temporary settlement," she says.Which is why they, like those abroad who are doing everything to return to India, are also desperate to get to the comfort of their real homes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-during-adverse-circumstances-most-natural-instinct-is-to-return-home-say-experts-63194

30-03-2020||New Delhi||No plan to extend 21-day lockdown: Govt||The government on Monday said that there was no immediate plan to extend the 21-day lockdown amid fears that shutdown of businesses across the country to counter the spread of coronavirus might trigger severe economic and social distress.The clarification by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba came after hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers undertook long journeys from major urban centres on foot to their homes in the last five days, reflecting their struggle for survival due to job losses following the lockdown.The central government has already directed states to make arrangements for shelter and food for the migrant workers.In a tweet, the government's Press Information Bureau said: "There are rumours & media reports, claiming that the Government will extend the #Lockdown21 when it expires. The Cabinet Secretary has denied these reports, and stated that they are baseless."A Group of Minister (GoM) headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday carried out a comprehensive review of the situation arising out of the lockdown, including movement of the migrant labourers.There have been fears that the lockdown may spark severe economic and social distress.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said the sudden lockdown had created immense "panic" and "confusion". He called for steps other than a total lockdown announced by some developed nations to tackle the deadly disease.Gandhi said the number of poor people in India who are dependent on a daily income is too large to unilaterally shut down all economic activities in the wake of the pandemic.According to the latest officials figures, a total of 1,071 people have been infected by the virus and the death toll is 29.
