But a political row ensued with parties in the opposition accused that the government took this decision unilaterally, as there happened no consultation on the matter.The Bihar assembly elections are expected to take place somewhere between October and November.On the preparedness to conduct assembly elections in Bihar the poll panel said, “The State is creating additional 34,000 (approximately) polling stations (45 per cent more), which will increase the total number of polling stations to around 1,06,000, which would entail formidable logistical challenges, including mobilisation of 1.8 lakh more polling personnel and other additional resources.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-postal-ballot-for-electorate-above-65-years-in-bihar-polls-ec-113868

Toilets are being arranged also for the families not having the facility. The construction of a public toilet has already started in the village,” the officer said.DPRO Raghvendra Dwivedi had visited the village earlier on Thursday to inspect the construction of the toilet in the village.The village head, Ram Naresh Yadav, also said toilets were not constructed in some houses as their owners’ names were not there in the list.All the women who left their respective in-laws’ places due to the lack of toilet facility were married within the last two years.As per villagers, they had demanded toilet constructions before or soon after their marriages, a condition which was not met in many cases.Due to heavy rains this year, they were facing problems in going out of their houses, so they left their husbands’ homes, they added.The story of the film, Toilet – Ek Prema Katha, too was related to a village in Gorakhpur district.The film was a satirical comedy in support of the governmental campaigns to improve sanitation conditions in India, with an emphasis on the eradication of open defecation, especially in rural areas.

16-07-2020||London||‘Clive of India’ statue in UK town saved by local council votes||A statue of Robert Clive, referred to as “Clive of India” for his role in establishing Britain’s colonial domination over India in the early years of the Raj, has been saved from removal from its pride of place in Shrewsbury town centre in western England after a local council voted against it.Shropshire Council was deliberating on the issue in line with its constitution after two petitions attracted over 23,000 signatures in favour of the “racist” statue’s removal. A counter-petition in favour of the statue had also attracted 8,000 signatures.In a vote this week, 28 councillors chose to take no action on the future of the statue, while 17 voted for action this week. Local authority’s Conservative Party leader Peter Nutting said the statue should stay in Clive’s birthplace and argued that there was also a statue of him in Kolkata.“As the leader of Shropshire Council and following careful consideration of arguments for and against its removal, I now believe that the statue of Robert Clive in the Square in Shrewsbury should remain in place,” said Councillor Nutting.“Clive is clearly a notable figure in Shrewsbury’s and Shropshire’s history. Therefore I don’t wish to be seen to be erasing him from the history books, but I do think there’s a good case for educating people about his life and enabling them to form their own opinions about his deeds or misdeeds,” he told the Shropshire Star.Nutting said an information board could be put up next to the statue in the Square to help people learn about Clive and form their own opinions.David Parton, who created one of the petitions in favour of the sculpture’s removal, said he was “shocked”.“Only the complete removal of the statue will show the council is serious about racism,” said Parton.“Clive will fall, it’s not a matter of if, but when. It beggars belief we have to argue this when his legacy resulted in millions of deaths. It’s quite demoralising, this decision,” he said.Calls for the statue to be removed were sparked last month when Black Lives Matter protesters in Bristol tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston and dumped it in a harbour.It sparked attacks on other monuments across the UK and a fierce debate on whether statues of people with links to slavery, colonialism and racism should all be removed.Clive, who served as the Governor of Bengal under the East India Company in the 18th century, is a well-known figure in colonial Indian history.The petitions against his statue highlight his role in the “looting” of Bengal in the early days of the British Empire, with many of the region’s riches finding their way back with him to Britain.“Just because a figure is historical, that doesn’t make him good. He is nothing more than a figure of oppression and white supremacy that has, whether consciously or not, been celebrated and commemorated in Shrewsbury town centre for hundreds of years,” reads one of the petitions.There is a similar life-size statue of Clive near the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) building on King Charles Street, Whitehall, in central London.The plinth records his two major career spurts in India, including the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and the Treaty of Allahabad in 1765.Clive, born in Market Drayton in Shropshire before his schooling in London, travelled to India for the East India Company in 1743 before returning to his London home later in life where he died in 1774 – believed to have committed suicide.A petition for the removal of the Whitehall statue, started by an Indian-origin Londoner Ameya Tripathi, has attracted over 85,000 signatures on Change.Org and the group is now pushing for a debate by the local Westminster Council by the end of this month. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/clive-of-india-statue-in-uk-town-saved-by-local-council-votes-113864
16-07-2020||New Delhi||SC notice to Kerala govt on petition challenging law banning animal sacrifice||The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notice to Kerala Government on a petition challenging the constitutional validity of the Kerala Animals and Bird Sacrifices (Prohibition) Act, 1968, which prohibits sacrifice of animals and birds in temples.“There seems to be a dichotomy. Killing animals and consuming it is allowed. But killing animals, offering it to a deity and then consuming it is not allowed,” a Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde said.This is the second petition on the issue that has landed in the Supreme Court which is already seized of a similar case involving prohibition on animal sacrifice for religious purpose in Tripura.Petitioners PE Gopalakrishnan alias Acharya Thrypuram, Amulraj K.K Raji V and  Babu N.K have challenged the June 16 order of the Kerala High Court dismissing a challenge to the Act.Acharya contended that he belonged to a family that has been traditionally following Shakti worship and he himself was involved in teaching and propagation of Shakti worship practices of which animal sacrifice was an inalterable part. Other petitioners are also Shakti worshippers who said due to incomplete performance of ‘bali’ (sacrifice) in view of the restrictions imposed by the impugned Act, they reasonably apprehended the wrath of their family deity.  The Kerala Animals and Bird Sacrifices Prohibition Act, 1968, prohibits propitiation of deity through sacrifice of animals and birds in temples and temple precincts. Interestingly, killing or maiming of animals for propitiating any deity alone is the core consideration for the ban under the Act. However, if the sacrifice is not for propitiating any deity, but for personal consumption even in temple premises, is not prohibited, the petitioners pointed out.Terming the law as manifestly arbitrary, the petitioners urged the top court to strike down the law under challenge as it violated their right to equality.They said the exclusion of identical practices by other religious communities, without the same being founded on any intelligible differentia justifying the classification made by the impugned legislation; and  criminalisation of animal or bird sacrifice for the purpose of propitiation of deity, while excluding  animal or bird  sacrifice for all other purposes, such as personal consumption even in or in the precincts of  temple premises went against Article 14 of the Constitution.If the object of the law were to ensure preservation and protection of animals, it would demand its uniform application across all religious communities, they submitted.The petitioners are also aggrieved by the fact that the High Court did not consider their impleadment application and went on to pronounce its verdict.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-kerala-govt-on-petition-challenging-law-banning-animal-sacrifice-113863

He said he had the proof of the former BJP CM “telling Jat MLAs from Sikar and Nagaur to keep distance from Sachin Pilot”. Beniwal said people of the state are well aware of the close association between Raje and Gehlot and how they try to cover up each other’s “corruption”.The “silence” of Raje in the ongoing political tussle in Rajasthan is the talk of the town. The senior BJP leader, who is believed to have a mind of her own on what is being read largely as a “Delhi- sponsored programme”, is yet to speak on the ongoing crisis in her home state Rajasthan, unlike other prominent BJP leaders like Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Om Mathur and Gulab Chand KatariaRaje’s hold over BJP MLAs and State unit is well known, how she held her ground in 2018 against someone as powerful as Amit Shah, the then BJP president, over the selection of the State unit chief. Shah wanted to appoint Shekhawat but after weeks-long stalemate, a middle path was adopted in the way of Madan Lal Saini.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vasundhra-helping-gehlot-claims-bjp-ally-hanuman-beniwal-says-he-has-proof-113860

They wanted the government to arrest and detain another person allegedly connected to "Karuppar Koottam."Earlier, a major row had erupted after the channel made 'denigrating' remarks about "Kandha Sashti Kavacham", a Tamil hymn sung in praise of Lord Muruga, son of Lord Shiva, with some of the videos going viral.The BJP had  filed a police complaint against the YouTube channel "Karuppar Koottam", seeking action against it for allegedly posting derogatory remarks about the Hindu deity.The Central Crime Branch (CCB) of Chennai Police, which has registered a case, had arrested M Senthilvasan from Velachery in the city on Wednesday.Earlier, the BJP and various Hindu organisations had filed a complaint against the channel with the Coimbatore Collector also, saying it had made 'denigrating' remarks about the Tamil hymn composed by Devaraya Swamigal and sought action.

16-07-2020||---||India keen on Iran projects but US sanctions a stumbling block: MEA||New Delhi, July 16India on Thursday admitted that its two strategic projects in Iran were facing turbulence but denied reports that they are in trouble. But the Chabahar port being operated by India is functional and plans are under way to increase the usage of Chabahar Port, both for Afghanistan and Central Asia.           India and Iran had held their last meeting on a railway line from Iran’s Chabahar port to the Afghan border over seven months back during which financial issues dominated, especially against the backdrop of tough sanctions imposed on Iran by the US. Since then New Delhi has been waiting to hear from Tehran on some of its technical queries, said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).However, Iran says it started work earlier this month on the rail project which India had signed on as would have provided Afghanistan its only access to the Indian Ocean that bypasses Pakistan. At the same time, Iran has said the door remains open to IRCON to join the project later.The MEA indicated that India was still interested in the proposed railway line. IRCON was working with an Iranian company and had completed the site inspection and review of the feasibility report. Detailed discussions were thereafter held on other relevant aspects of the project, which had to take into account the “financial challenges” that Iran was facing.In December 2019, these issues were reviewed in detail and Iranian side was to nominate an authorised entity to finalise outstanding technical and financial issues. “This is still awaited,” said the MEA spokesperson.India has also not given up on the Farzad-B Gas field negotiations in which ONGC was involved in the discovery stage. The MEA said follow-up bilateral cooperation was however impacted by policy changes on the Iranian side. In January, India was informed that in the immediate future, Iran would develop the field on its own and would like to involve India appropriately at a later stage. “This matter remains under discussion,” said the spokesperson.The fulcrum of the railway line project – the Chabahar Port – remains functional despite the difficulties posed by the sanctions. Operations have been scaled up and 52 vessels were handled in the last 12 months alone. The port being developed and operated by India handled 12 lakh tonnes of bulk cargo and 8,200 containers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-keen-on-iran-projects-but-us-sanctions-a-stumbling-block-mea-113845

When he was pressured to return the money, Singh had Khan Mubarak’s shooters open fire at the businessman in sector 18 of Noida,” Additional Superintendent of Police, STF, Raj Kumar Mishra said.The businessman was in his BMW car when the attack took place and he narrowly escaped, the officials said. Mishra said Singh had paid the shooters Rs 10 lakh, and the agency has cracked the money trail of the transaction.“Gajendra Singh also invested Abu Salem and Khan Mubarak’s money into properties in Delhi-NCR,” the officer said.Singh dabbled in property business in the Delhi-NCR region and had duped many people of crores of rupees by assuring them investment in real estate but when any investor would ask for their money to be returned, he would get them threatened by Salem or Mubarak, he added.Singh was also friends with Mubarak’s gangster brother Zafar Supari.The STF said it has unearthed multiple bank accounts of Singh which have shown several transactions with Salem, Mubarak, Supari and their associates over the years.Currently Salem, who worked for fugitive underworld don and 1993 Mumbai blasts key accused Dawood Ibrahim, is lodged in Tihar Jail in Delhi, while Mubarak is behind bars in Hardoi and Supari in Mumbai, according to officials.Singh was wanted in a couple of cases registered at a police station in Noida where he has been lodged now after being arrested, the STF said.Singh was wanted in two cases pertaining to fraud and forgery of documents registered at the Noida Sector 20 police station in 2018, and a local court had also issued a non-bailable warrant against him, the agency said.

And as I have already conveyed, it is an ongoing process. This should not be misrepresented. There is absolutely no change with respect to India’s position on the LAC,” said the MEA spokesperson.“We are fully committed to observing and respecting the LAC. Any unilateral attempts to change the status quo along the LAC are not acceptable,” he added.India and China have been engaged in discussions through established diplomatic and military channels to address the situation along the LAC. The process was given an impetus by two hours of talks between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese State Councillor-cum- Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi on July 5.This was followed by a meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) on July 10.Srivastava said in these meetings, the two sides have agreed on complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC for full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas in accordance with bilateral agreements and protocols. It was in this context that the Indian and Chinese Senior Army Commanders held their fourth meeting at Chushul on July 14 at which they reviewed the progress of the disengagement process and also discussed further steps to complete it at the earliest. While asking to avoid unsubstantiated and inaccurate reports on the complex process of disengagement along the LAC, the MEA said both sides remained committed to the objective of complete disengagement by continuing with their diplomatic and military engagements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-disengagement-to-prevent-face-offs-mea-113832

I sure hope the good folks at 3M take note of this legacy logo and update it,” he wrote at the end of his post.His post has collected over a thousand reactions and several comments, triggering a debate on the platform."This was an eyeopener! This is a perfect example of sublime subconscious gender stereotyping in the minds," wrote one person in the comments section."While it's an interesting observation that you make, the fact remains that majority of Indian households hire domestic help to do most of their cleaning activities. And majority of these domestic help are women. So yes a large part of the end user of Scotch-Brite products are women," another countered.Scotch-Brite, however, took note of the post and promised change.He soon received a reply from Atul Mathur, Head of Marketing – Consumer Business at 3M India, Scotch-Brite’s parent company. Mathur’s reply is winning people over."At the very outset I wish to thank you for your insightful comment on the Scotch-Brite packaging. I head marketing in 3M India for our Consumer business. You have correctly surmised that this is a legacy vector, and that it is undoubtedly time to move on from regressive beliefs," wrote Mathur."At the same time we also began to work internally on changing the brand vector. I am pleased to inform you that you will see the logo change a few months down the line," he said.Mathur also commented on Karthik's post saying that the logo was a "legacy vector" and he realised that it was "time to move on from regressive beliefs."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scotch-brite-criticised-for-gender-marker-logo-companys-marketing-head-replies-113826

The facility will only be available through Air India city booking offices.”Currently, the name change policy is restricted only to six metro cities – Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Chennai, it said, adding that the scheme would cover tickets that are bought with cash or credit card only.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-india-allows-ticket-holders-of-cancelled-flights-between-march-15-aug-24-to-transfer-to-others-113825

Reddy has since said that someone made a fake sticker with his details.Hitting out at the YSR Congress government, TDP leader Nara Lokesh in a tweet asked, "Does the government, which prides itself on seizing liquor coming from other states, have the guts to catch illicit money moving to neighbouring states?"TDP leader Bonda Uma alleged that the seized money "could have been collected from sand or liquor mafia" and demanded that a judicial enquiry should be launched in the case to bring out the facts.Uma said the AP Government owed an explanation to the people. Why it is keeping silent on such a serious matter when the whole of Tamil Nadu and national media are giving reports on the AP Minister's involvement in illegal transportation of cash, asked Uma.Meanwhile, reacting to the matter, Minister Balineni Srinivas Reddy said, "It has been brought to my notice that last night a car which had a sticker bearing my name was caught on way to Chennai with crores of cash. I have nothing do with the vehicle, the people in it or the money in the car. It has a Tamil Nadu registration. I have seen media reports which suggest that it is my car. Someone has misused a photocopy of the sticker."He said he had requested the investigating agencies to initiate a "full-fledged probe" into the matter and take strict action "against those involved in the transportation of black money".Meanwhile, a letter has also surfaced where a jeweller has claimed that the seized cash belongs to him and that he has valid documents to prove it.Uma expressed concern that lots more cash might have been already illegally transported to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana. He alleged that the ruling party mafia was hiding money in secret places in other states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-demands-dismissal-of-ap-minister-after-seizure-of-rs-5-5-crore-from-his-car-113824

There would also be no recording of the meeting.But Pakistani officials with an intimidating demeanour were present close to Jadhav. Indian consular officials detected a camera which meant the conversation was being recorded. Jadhav, too, was under visible stress and indicated that to the Consular officers.“The arrangements did not permit a free conversation between them,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava, adding that the Indian side could not engage Jadhav on his legal rights and was prevented from getting his signature for arranging his legal representation.“In the light of these circumstances, we came to the conclusion that this consular access was neither meaningful nor credible. After lodging a protest, the officers left the venue,” he said.Srivastava recalled that over the past year, India has requested Pakistan more than 12 times to provide unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav who has been in Pakistani custody since 2016.Consular access is of utmost importance, as it is the basis for an effective review and reconsideration ordered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).In May, Pakistan had passed an Ordinance, ostensibly to comply with the ICJ order. It envisaged Indian High Commission officials filing a petition before a High Court for a relevant review and reconsideration.“In that context, the contacts and conversations with Jadhav assume great importance. Any conversation with him must take place in privacy and without anyone’s presence or recording to enable Jadhav speak freely without any concerns of reprisal.“It is already evident that Jadhav has been intimidated repeatedly in the past, including in being made to express his alleged disinclination to seek a review,” said Srivastava.“It is clear that Pakistan’s approach to this matter continues to be obstructive and insincere. It has not only violated its assurance to the ICJ to fully implement the 2019 judgment, but also failed to act in accordance with its own Ordinance,” he alleged.The MEA has informed Jadhav’s family of the developments. The last consular access had taken place in September last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-officials-walk-out-of-jadhav-meeting-after-pak-reneges-on-conditions-113823

Both the documents mentioned his name as Kartikey and his date of birth as May 27, 2004.According to police, after being presented in a Faridabad court on July 9 for transit remand, Kartikey was being brought to Kanpur and on the way, the police van broke down.Taking advantage of the situation, Kartikey snatched a pistol from a policeman and fired at the personnel escorting him, police said.He was killed in retaliatory firing by police in Panki, they said.Police have claimed that two nine mm pistols looted from the policemen with 44 live rounds were recovered from Kartikey’s possession at the time of his arrest. He carried a bounty of Rs 50,000.The police, in the FIR filed against Kartikey, said that his age was 20, an official on the condition of anonymity said.“It does not matter even if a criminal is minor. He was part of the Vikas Dubey gang which was involved in the killing of eight policemen,” the official added.On the other hand, Kartikey’s sister Himanshi told mediapersons that her brother was a brilliant student and passed his high school examination from the UP board in 2018 with 79 per cent marks.He attained distinction in five out of six subjects with 78 marks in mathematics, 83 in English and 82 in Hindi, she said.Himanshi also said that Kartikey had cleared his intermediate UP board exams with first class marks on June 29, just 10 days before he was killed.Kartikey’s mother Sumanlata, also known as Geeta, said her son was “innocent” and had no criminal history.“My 16-year-old son, who could have had a bright future, lost his life so tragically,” she lamented.Narrating the events on the day of Kanpur ambush in which eight policemen, including Deputy SP Devendra Kumar Mishra, were killed, Geeta said her family members woke up after hearing the sound of gunshots.“We waited till the firing stopped and then we walked out from the house and noticed the men fleeing from there,” Geeta said, adding that she persuaded her son Kartikey to leave the house and go somewhere else for a few days.Geeta said she came to know about Kartikey’s arrest through media reports, but she did not know the two men who the police said were with him in Faridabad.Kartikey’s mother also claimed that she has no relatives in Faridabad.She said she later heard from mediapersons that police had killed her son in a pre-dawn encounter.“My son was killed in a cold-blooded manner by police,” she said.IG Kanpur Range Mohit Agarwal told mediapersons that he had no information about Kartikey’s age or his academic achievements.On July 8, the Faridabad police had arrested Kartikey and recovered pistols used in the Bikru shootout from him, the IG said.Dubey and five alleged members of his gang have so far been gunned down in separate encounters in Kanpur, Hamirpur and Etawah in UP after eight police personnel were killed at Bikru village on July 3 by the gangster and his henchmen.

This happened despite BSP's official support to the Congress government.A senior national functionary of the BSP told The Tribune that the party leadership had taken a serious view of the Congress staging an "uncalled for coup", not least against a party which was extending support to it in all earnestness to keep the BJP at bay."The party is looking into the feasibility of approaching the judiciary to prohibit the defector MLAs from taking part in voting in a floor test," said the leader.The BSP had petitioned to the Election Commission and the Speaker of Rajasthan Assembly to bar them from taking part in the recent Rajya Sabha elections. But the case remained in limbo due to technical knots and legal wrangles.Mayawati is credited with the view that Congress back-stabbed the BSP to shore up its numbers in the Assembly to ward off a challenge like the one thrown by Pilot. "Hence, the BSP would like to hit out at the Congress, should there be legal scope for it," said the BSP leader.The BSP leadership is of the firm view that even if the government in Rajasthan survives the present scare, another one would be soon coming given the fluid political situation and tenuous hold the Congress has in the numbers' game.A section in the BSP feels that there are glitches in the way the MLAs were merged with the Congress in a hurry. They are of the view that the MLAs should have formed a political party after they broke with the BSP and then merge with the Congress."Only an organisation can technically merge with another organisation. MLAs could only join the Congress in individual capacity, which is in contravention of the anti-defection law," said a BSP leader. Rajasthan BSP president Bhagwan Singh said that the Congress government led by Gehlot had pulled off a similar "trick" against his MLAs in 2008.Singh, who also was the president then, said that his party had similarly six MLAs and the BSP was supporting the government then, too.“One can be charitable enough to attribute the shenanigans of the Congress in Rajasthan against BSP to a freak chance and coincidence in 2008. But the second similar act conforms to a devious pattern, and a rapacious habit," Singh said.He added that Congress now crying hoarse of poaching of its MLAs in Rajasthan rings hollow in the backdrop of what it had been doing with BSP MLAs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mayawati-exploring-legal-options-against-bsp-mlas-who-merged-with-congress-in-rajasthan-113808
16-07-2020||New Delhi||India inks bilateral air bubbles with France, US; talks on with Germany: Puri||The government on Thursday said that international flights are set to resume under “bilateral air bubbles” with countries in the world, as Air France will be operating 28 flights between Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Paris from 18 July to 1 August while the United Airlines of the US will be flying 18 flights between July 17 and 31.These operations, however, are being allowed with certain conditions as many countries are imposing entry restrictions even now, including India in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, it said.Making these announcements at a press interaction here, Minister for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri said, “We are at very advanced stages of negotiation with three countries and it is a work-in-progress. For example, Air France will be operating 28 flights between Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Paris from 18 July to 1 August, while United Airlines of the US will be flying 18 flights between July 17 and 31. But these are interim arrangements. We have requests from German carriers to permit flights to India and we are processing it.”A travel bubble or a bilateral air bubble is travel corridors between two countries, which wish to open their borders and re-establish air connectivity. This is an exclusive partnership with a number of restrictions and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  Earlier, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had said the international passenger flight services in the country will resume in a phased manner during “Unlock 2.0”.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) earlier mentioned “international scheduled flights may be allowed on select routes on a case-to-case basis”.Talking about Vande Bharat Mission, the minister said so far under the scheme India could manage to bring in about more than 6,80,000 Indians stranded abroad due to the pandemic.“A total of 6,87,467 passengers have been evacuated under the mission till 15 July, 23:59 hours,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-inks-bilateral-air-bubbles-with-france-us-talks-on-with-germany-puri-113807

In the initial investigation, Mumbai Police had found that the actor was under medication for depression.Addressing herself as Rajput's "girlfriend" for the first time in public, Chakraborty said though she has "complete faith" in the government, a CBI inquiry would help bring justice to the case. "Respected @AmitShah sir, I'm Sushant Singh Rajput's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty. It is now over a month since his sudden demise. I have complete faith in the government, however in the interest of justice, I request you with folded hands to initiate a CBI enquiry into this matter," the 28-year-old actor wrote on Instagram alongside Rajput's photo. "I only want to understand what pressures prompted Sushant to take this step. Yours sincerely, Rhea Chakraborty. #satyamevajayate," she added. Earlier in the day, Chakraborty requested the cyber crime cell to look into rape and murder threats she was receiving ever since Rajput's death, with social media users blaming her for his suicide.The actor, known for films such as "Mere Dad Ki Maruti" and "Jalebi", eventually disabled the comments section of her Instagram page."I was called a gold digger. kept quiet I was called a murderer. I kept quiet, I was slut shamed, I kept quiet."But how does my silence give you the right to tell me that you will get me raped and murdered if I don't commit suicide @mannu_raaut?" she wrote tagging one of the accounts from which she received threat.No one should be subjected to this kind of "toxicity and harassment", she urged.Shortly after Rajput's death, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the Mumbai Police would also probe the angle of "professional rivalry", which was alleged to be the cause of the suicide.On June 18, Chakraborty was called to Bandra police station to record her statement.

However, they were stopped near Chanakyapuri police station, he said.The protestors were shouting slogans against Pakistan’s spy agency ISI for promoting pro-Khalistan activities and supporting the ‘Khalistan Referendum 2020’, an online campaign to demand a separate homeland for the Sikhs.The ‘Referendum 2020’ is an initiative of pro-Khalistan group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which has been banned by the Indian government for advocating a separate homeland for the Sikhs.The Centre in a July 10, 2019 notification had declared the SFJ as an unlawful association and had banned it for five years, saying the group’s primary objective was to establish an “independent and sovereign country” in Punjab and it openly espouses the cause of Khalistan, challenging the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India.

16-07-2020||New Delhi||Productive screen time maybe necessary for meeting learning outcomes, say schools||The HRD Ministry’s cap on the duration of online classes has thrown private schools in a quandary as they juggle to strike a balance between “good” and “bad” screen time while trying to address curriculum concerns of senior classes.The guidelines have been framed by the Ministry, following concerns raised by parents about schools conducting online classes like regular schools, which has increased children’s screen time after the COVID-19 pandemic mandated a shift from classroom teaching to online learning as schools continue to remain shut for over four months.“The reduction of screen time for students during online classes is quite apt for primary classes but for senior classes, it might cause problems. In junior classes, the syllabus can be covered through projects and other co-curricular activities. The recorded flip classes are yet another way to complete the syllabus in junior and middle classes,” Alka Kapur, Principal, Modern Public School Shalimar Bagh, said.“Moreover, in junior classes, parents can still help children cover up the syllabus by giving them ample practice at home. However, in senior classes, most of the topics being vast and elaborate require in-depth understanding and explanation. Hence, the screen time given by the MHRD may not be sufficient. Rigorous revision and practice will be a herculean task for the teacher and the students in senior classes if we continue in the given scenario,” she added.According to Manit Jain, co-founder of The Heritage Schools, there had to be a distinction between “good” and “bad” screen time.“While most guidelines are relevant, it is important to make a distinction between good and bad screen time. Putting restrictions on timings without analysing the effect on learning continuity will have an adverse impact on students’ development. There are several myths around online learning that need to be busted and policymakers must recognise that productive screen time is not only desirable but is necessary in such times,” he said.“Many countries continue to run their entire timetables as they did when they were running in the physical environment. What if learning remains interrupted for the next 18 months? What might be the potential learning loss? What happens in international boards, where they will not cut substantial portions of the syllabus? What will happen to the last child who will not have access to a home environment that can compensate for the learning losses?” said Jain, who is also chairman of FICCI Arise, a collegium of stakeholders aimed at promoting quality education.In the guidelines called “Pragyata”, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) has recommended that the duration for online classes for pre-primary students should not be for more than 30 minutes.For Classes 1 to 8, the HRD Ministry has recommended two online sessions of up to 45 minutes each while for classes 9 to 12, four sessions of 30-45 minutes duration have been recommended.“The recommendation provided by the HRD Ministry is based on complaints by parents that regular online classes have increased children's screen time after the COVID-19 pandemic. The research is not done scientifically as according to new online teaching research, during online classes, gaze does not remain fixed for a long time and it is not at all dangerous for the students. So, I completely feel that this is not a good idea to reduce the screen time for students as this will hamper student's learning and growth,” said Harish Sanduja, Director-Schools, Seth Anandram Jaipuria Group of Educational Institutions.However, a few schools said they had already kept in mind concerns about screen time and have been planning their classes accordingly.Nidhi Bansal, Pro-Vice Chairperson, Pacific World School, said: “Our current timings followed aren’t very different from the latest guidelines issued by the HRD Ministry, however, we would definitely revisit our course of action in conducting online classes to reduce chances of any such unpleasant situation with our students.”“When young and impressionable minds are exposed to online teaching for such prolonged periods with no prior training or guidelines, there is a possibility of them being exposed to multiple threats like cyberbullying, age-inappropriate content. As a school, we have no other option but to conduct online classes for completing their academic syllabi,” said Pallavi Upadhyaya, Principal, Delhi Public School, Ghaziabad.Sangeeta Hajela, Principal, DPS Indirapuram, said: “The right approach would be to not dismiss the directive as unpractical but to also look at the disclaimer which allows one to review, adapt and adopt the advisory according to the local needs.”According to Ryan Pinto, CEO, Ryan International Group of Institutions: “The process of improving online education should continue to evolve and therefore we hope there will be regular reviews to these guidelines and appropriate changes can be made for an effective teaching and learning experience.”Universities and schools across the country have been shut since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. A nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into effect the next day.While the government has largely eased restrictions, schools and colleges continue to remain closed.

Sriramulu told reporters here.Chitradurga is 205 km northwest of Bengaluru in the southern state.Noting that the infection does not differentiate between rich and poor, police, doctors, politicians or legislators, Sriramulu said the communicable disease could rise to alarming level in the ensuing two months, as the cases were rising daily the world over."Who can control corona? In the present situation, only god has to save us. Otherwise, the people should become aware of its (virus) consequences. If we have made mistakes, we are ready to face punishment for them," said Sriramulu, who is the ruling BJP's legislator from the Molakalmuru reserved assembly segment in the district.Refuting the opposition Congress charge that the cases were rising in the state due to negligence by ministers, officials and legislators, Sriramulu said Karnataka was performing better than other states till the cases began to steadily rise since unlock started and the people were moving in violation of the guidelines.A record 3,176 cases were reported from across the southern state during the day, taking the Covid tally to a whopping 47,253, including 27,853 active cases after 18,466 were discharged, with 1,076 during the day, while 928 succumbed to the virus, with 87 in the last 24 hours.In Bengaluru, which is under 9-day lockdown since Tuesday night till July 22 morning, 1,975 positive cases were registered, taking its tally to 22,944, including 17,051 active after 5,455 were discharged so far, with 463 during the day, while 437 died of the infection, with 60 in the last 24 hours.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/only-god-can-save-us-from-covid-says-karnataka-minister-113790
16-07-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal governor says education system in state 'politically caged'||The education system in West Bengal is “politically caged”, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said on Thursday, a day after most Vice Chancellors of state universities skipped a meeting called by him and asserted that he would seek an explanation for their absence.His threatened move may set the stage for yet another confrontation with the state government.Dhankhar had convened an online meeting with the vice chancellors to discuss the academic situation amid the COVID- 19 pandemic on Wednesday. Barring one, all vice chancellors had stayed away.Dhankhar told reporters that he would also ask the VCs, who were absent, about the academic problems being faced by students because of the outbreak of the disease.“I find there is tightening of this political cage in the education scenario in West Bengal,” he said, apparently referring to most VCs staying away from the meeting.“I wanted to fathom the problems the universities and colleges are facing by calling a virtual meeting of VCs which they opposed tooth and nail for the reasons known to all,” he said.Amid frequent run-ins with the Governor, the West Bengal government had recently amended the relevant rules relating to the powers of the governor as the Chancellor of universities.The new rules have vastly reduced the governor's role in the functioning of universities.Under the fresh set of rules, all communications between the governor and the universities have to be routed through the higher education department.“Can education department and VCs self-proclaim they cannot be commanded by a chancellor? Are they not accountable? When they become accountable?” Dhankhar said, voicing displeasure over the absence of the VCs from the meeting.“The saddest elements in their entire gamut is that they completely forgot the students’ crisis amidst the pandemic,” he said.He, however, placed the blame for the absence of the VCs on the state government.Insisting that he had shown “utmost patience” while dealing with the vice chancellors, who he treated as “my family”, Dhankhar said the “unwholesome situation was created by the state government”.He also referred to another meeting with the VCs he had called on January 13 which failed to take off, after the education department objected to the governor calling such an interaction without informing it.Dhankhar said his January 15 letter to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee about the VCs not attending the meeting went unanswered. Dhankhad said, in his letter to the Chief Minister, he had deprecated “judgemental approach” and sought an end to such stalemate.Dhankhar said the students were facing an “unprecedented crisis” and that he saw “gloom on the faces of young minds due to government apathy. Noncommittal government makes them more restive with each passing day”.The Governor said graduate and postgraduate students needed degrees to pursue further studies and secure suitable jobs through competitions.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had recently written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to re-examine the HRD ministry and the UGC guidelines to hold college and university exams by September 2020, citing risks from COVID-19. Dhankhar was apparently referring to that letter.“Denying degrees means denying academic progression and jobs. Degrees cannot be given without evaluation which happens to be in the form of examinations. Exams can be held only when the courses have been completed,” Dhankhar said.Dhankhar said he wanted to know during the meeting what steps the universities intended to take.“How long and how far the students of this state will be denied their rights in the situation when the state has completely failed in containing COVID-19 transmission?” he asked.Dhankhar asked Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Education Minister Partha Chatterjee and all the VCs “who have been denying to come forth to grapple with these issues and problems so acutely faced by the students that where is their response to change with the crisis currently thrust on us”.“They must come out in black and white for which they have been elected selected and funded by the people,” he said.The governor said, in the interest of students and their education, he would have to set in motion “with utmost reluctance” action to “deal with their conduct in accordance with the applicable Act”.Dhankhar, however, was silent about what that could be.

16-07-2020||New Delhi||Start of human trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidate important milestone for Atmanirbhar Bharat: DBT||Zydus Cadila’s move to begin human trials of its indigenously developed vaccine candidate for COVID-19 is an important milestone for an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, Department of Biotechnology Secretary Renu Swarup said on Thursday.Zydus Cadila on Wednesday said it has initiated Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. ZyCoV-D, the plasmid DNA vaccine designed and developed by Zydus, has been partially funded by the Department of Biotechnology under the National Biopharma Mission.This makes it the first indigenously developed vaccine for COVID-19 to be administered in humans in the country, the DBT secretary said in a statement.Swarup said the development is also a big leap forward for the scientific community.“This is an important milestone for Atmanirbhar Bharat as Zydus begins human clinical trials for the indigenously developed vaccine. We hope that the vaccine continues to show positive outcomes as it has done so far in the pre-clinical phase where it was found to be safe, immunogenic and well-tolerated,” she said.The adaptive phase 1 and 2 dose-escalation, the multi-centric study will assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine, the statement said.ZyCoV-D and COVAXIN, developed by city-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research, are the only two vaccine candidates to have got a nod from the drug regulatory body to conduct human trials.“This partnership with Zydus is to serve the country's need for a vaccine to fight the dreaded pandemic which has put a billion people at risk,” Swarup said.Such research endeavours will help the country develop preventive strategies for future disease outbreaks as well. They exemplify the government’s focus on creating an ecosystem that nurtures and encourages new product innovation to make real and measurable changes to issues most relevant to our society, Swarup added.Zydus Cadila chairperson Pankaj Patel said the commencement of human trials is a very important step in the fight against the pandemic and one that will help the nation combat the healthcare challenge.In the pre-clinical phase, the vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response in multiple animal species such as mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits.The antibodies produced by the vaccine were able to neutralise the wild type virus in virus neutralisation assay indicating the protective potential of the vaccine candidate.No safety concerns were observed for the vaccine candidate in repeat-dose toxicology studies by both intramuscular and intradermal routes of administration. In rabbits, up to three times the intended human dose was found to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic, the DBT statement added.

16-07-2020||---||Rajasthan HC to hear Pilot camp petition over disqualification on Friday||New Delhi/Jaipur, July 16A division bench of the Rajasthan High Court will hear on Friday petition filed by dissident MLAs over Speaker's disqualification notice.The amended petition filed by Sachin Pilot, 18 other Congress MLAs likely to be heard at 1 pm on Friday. Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi, who had written to the Speaker seeking the MLAs' disqualification, also approached the court, asking to be heard before it passes any order.The 19 MLAs were sent notices Tuesday by the Speaker after the Congress complained that they had defied a party whip to attend two Congress Legislature Party meetings.The Pilot camp, however, argues that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.Pilot moved the court ahead of Friday deadline the speaker had given to Pilot and 18 other rebel MLAs to respond.The notice accused the rebels of deliberately skipping two CLP meetings at Jaipur and “deliberate collusion to topple the state government”.Also read: Disqualification notice to Pilot, 18 MLAs brings issue of Speaker’s power to fore againThe Pilot camp has argued before the court that their absence at the CLP meetings cannot constitute defiance of the whip because whip applied only when the assembly is in session and the whip is issued on the floor of the house. The Pilot group has taken the battle to the court and would expect to pre-empt disqualification from the assembly by the Speaker.Today’s move to go to the high court seeks to act in time to thwart damages because Speaker’s ruling once passed is hard to challenge legally. The disqualification notices have put spokes in the wheels of the Pilot camp with three MLAs said to have returned to Gehlot since yesterday according to the claims by CM’s people.For Pilot the situation is getting tough to negotiate.He has to hold his ground and also keep his flock together. His political elbow room would eventually depend on the MLAs who back him.Pilot also doesn’t appear interested in taking up Congress offer of a truce after the CM on Wednesday launched an all-out public attack on him going to the extent of saying that there was evidence that “the former deputy CM and state chief was conspiring to topple his own government”.Pilot would need to ward off the disqualification threat to buy time and plan his future moves. — With PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-hc-to-hear-pilot-camp-petition-over-disqualification-on-friday-113775
16-07-2020||New Delhi||Disqualification notice to Pilot, 18 MLAs brings issue of Speaker’s power to fore again||The issue of Speakers’ power under the Constitution to entertain pleas seeking disqualification of MLAs has come to the fore again amid the political crisis in Rajasthan where the Assembly speaker has entertained such a plea by the ruling Congress party and sought responses of sacked Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs within three days.The Apex Court, in a plethora of verdicts, has given varying judicial opinions on Speakers’ powers ranging from refusing to intervene in the matter to assuming the role of the Speaker itself and going to the extent of disqualifying lawmakers under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution.The 2011 verdict of the Supreme Court in the Karnataka case may strengthen the case of the 19 MLAs, including Pilot, in the matter of Rajasthan Assembly Speaker CP Joshi’s show-cause notice.The top court had set aside the disqualification of 11 BJP MLAs, who were opposed to the then Chief Minister BS Yedurappa, by the Speaker. The high court had endorsed their disqualification.“Merely because these MLAs expressed lack of confidence in Yeddyurappa would not mean that the Speaker was empowered to take action against them,” a bench headed by the then Chief Justice Altamas Kabir had held.It had then taken note of the assertion of the 11 MLAs that they were part of the BJP and would support any other leader in the party, and held this rebellion did not require action under 10th schedule (which deals Speaker's power to deal with defection) of the Constitution.“Rajasthan Speaker’s notice to Pilot and others with him is patently illegal and beyond the scope of the 10th schedule of the Constitution. They have not joined or expressed a wish to join or support BJP,” senior lawyer and Constitutional law expert Rakesh Dwivedi said.“Protesting against CM and asking for change or pressuring High Command of the Congress to change CM does not amount to leaving the party,” he said.In response to a question whether a political party can issue a legally tenable whip to its MLAs for activities outside the Assembly, the senior lawyer said: “No. Whips are issued for activities in the House. Not attending meetings of the Congress legislature party is pressure tactic and an intra-party activity. Speaker has erred and notice is against the Yedurappa case of Supreme Court.”He said, however, the party could take disciplinary action against Pilot.Dwivedi added there were no media reports that Pilot indulged in any anti-party activities and met leaders of rival political parties to topple the government; rather there have been reports of police probe against the Deputy Chief Minister for offences such as sedition.There have been contrary views as well, holding that the Speaker has ample and wide powers under the 10th schedule to deal with anti-defection activities of the lawmakers.“Being the head of the House, the Speaker is well within his right to issue the (disqualification) notice,” another senior advocate Ajit Sinha said, adding that the action of suspension or disqualification can always be challenged.“As far as the notice is concerned, the Speaker has the right. Those who have been issued notice can claim that the speaker cannot disqualify for the activities done outside the house, but the issuance of the notice at the first place cannot be called illegal,” he said.The Apex Court and the high courts have been very cautious in intervening with the role of Speaker in the matters of disqualification.The Constitution gives exclusive jurisdiction to the Speaker to rule on disqualifications for defection.In the recent Karnataka crisis, the top court had said that 15 rebel Congress-JD(S) MLAs in Karnataka “ought not” to be compelled to participate in the proceedings of the ongoing session of the state Assembly and an option should be given to them as to whether they wanted to take part or stay out of it.However, the Apex Court had also said the Assembly Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar will decide on the resignation of the 15 MLAs within “such time-frame as considered appropriate by him”.But there have also been instances where the top court has assumed the role of the Speaker to itself after taking note of the delay on the part of the Speaker in deciding such pleas.In a rare move, the Supreme Court had invoked its plenary powers and ordered forthwith removal of BJP lawmaker and Manipur Forest Cabinet Minister TH Shyamkumar, restraining him from entering the Assembly till further orders.Shyamkumar had won the Assembly polls in 2017 as a Congress candidate but later joined the BJP government. The plea of his disqualification was pending with the Speaker.Recently, the top court has sought response of the Speaker of Tamil Nadu Assembly on a plea of DMK seeking a direction to “forthwith” decide its pending plea for disqualification of 11 AIADMK lawmakers who had voted against Chief Minister K Palaniswami during the 2017 confidence vote.

"The Janata Curfew will last from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily, with exceptions for essential services or those working night shifts in industries or medical emergencies. The curfew will be in place till August 10. Violators will be imprisoned," Sawant said in a press conference on Wednesday."People should have been more careful. The government has realised that people have not followed the norms. As many as 40,000 persons have been fined for not wearing masks. Looks like people only understand the language of the law," Sawant said."The complete lockdown over the weekend will begin from Thursday night till Monday morning. Barring essential services, nothing would be allowed to open," Sawant said, urging people not to indulge in panic buying."Perhaps, we can flatten the curve now, with this effort," he said, adding that the Cabinet had okayed the weekend curfew in a bid to flatten the coronavirus curve.The state's active cases have crossed 1,000-mark, with 18 deaths linked to Covid-19. Most of the cases and deaths were recorded over the last month.Sawant said that since the region was in the midst of a heavy monsoon, cases were expected to spike which often trigger respiratory illnesses. "Covid cases increase the most in the rains. We are in the midst of the monsoon. Perhaps, we have reached the highest spike right now. That is why we are looking to flatten the curve, with these precautionary measures," the Goa CM said.The main opposition party in Goa, the Congress has however said that the partial lockdown was a sign of a "defective administration"."The partial lockdown announced by the Chief Minister is reflection of his defective administration. This announcement has no scientific base, it is not a solution," state Congress president Girish Chodankar said.Chodankar also demanded that Chief Minister Pramod Sawant present a white paper on the status of Covid-19 spread in Goa as well as steps taken by the government to manage the pandemic.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/goa-cm-orders-night-curfew-weekend-lockdown-till-august-10-113762

I have worked hard to defeat the BJP in Rajasthan. This speculation is being fuelled to tarnish my image.”Pilot’s comments came hours after Congress chief whip in Rajasthan Assembly Mahesh Joshi petitioned Speaker CP Joshi to disqualify 19 dissident MLAs under the anti-defection law and the Speaker issued notices to all of them. The rebels have been asked to respond by Friday.The Congress, through disqualification of the rebels, seeks to bring down the Assembly strength from the current 200 and secure an edge in the power game to thwart any potential future threat to its government.As of today, CM Ashok Gehlot-led state dispensation looked comfortable claiming the backing of 102 MLAs in the 200-member Assembly. Three dissident lawmakers from the Pilot camp had also returned to the party by the evening.The Congress, meanwhile, offered Pilot another chance with party leader Randeep Surjewala saying, “We heard Sachin Pilot say he is not joining the BJP. If that is the case, he should decline the hospitality of the BJP… and come back to the Congress family.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/speaker-sends-notice-to-pilot-18-others-113534
