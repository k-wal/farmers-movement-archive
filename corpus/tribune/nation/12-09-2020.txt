12-09-2020||Madurai/Dharmapuri (TN)||NEET: Two medical aspirants die by suicide in Tamil Nadu||Two medical aspirants allegedly died by suicide in Tamil Nadu on Saturday, on the eve of the National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET), with political parties opposed to the qualifying exam stepping up their demand for its scrapping.Opposition parties in the state led by the DMK slammed the BJP-led Centre over the NEET issue, even as the ruling AIADMK, also opposed to the exam, rued the deaths of the youngsters.Both the victims, a 19-year-old girl from Madurai and a 20-year-old youth from Dharmapuri, were found hanging in their homes in the respective districts, sending shock waves in a state that has witnessed a spate of suicides over the issue in the past three years.READ: NEET-UG on Sunday; isolation rooms for symptomatic candidates, 15.97 lakh to take tests Dalit girl Anitha from Ariyalur was the first victim who died by suicide in 2017 after she failed to crack NEET, despite good scores in Class 12 exam, prompting the state political parties to mount an offensive against the Centre and demand for cancelling the exam.On Saturday, Jothisri Durga and M Adithya allegedly ended their lives by hanging, police and district officials said in Madurai and Dharmapuri.Durga, daughter of a sub-inspector, in a purported suicide note left behind by her said she was “apprehensive” about NEET though others had high ‘hopes’ on her, police said.Adithya, on the other hand, appeared for NEET exam last year but could not clear it. He had been preparing since then.He was found hanging at his residence in the evening, Dharmapuri Collector S Malarvizhi said citing preliminary investigation.His parents had gone to Salem to see the NEET exam centre where their son was to appear for the exam on Sunday.“But they returned home to find their son hanging from the ceiling fan. His parents say Adithya has a good academic record,” Malarvizhi told PTI.The deaths come days after another medical aspirant in Ariyalur in the state also allegedly died by suicide.Durga’s death in the morning drew sharp responses from Tamil Nadu political parties opposed to NEET, even as Chief Minister K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam of the ruling AIADMK expressed shock over the incident.DMK President MK Stalin said NEET “is not an exam at all.”Taking to Twitter, Palaniswami expressed grief over the “sad” incident and said students have many avenues to taste success and resorting to such extreme steps was distressing. “It is distressing to see students, the hope for the future, taking such steps,” he said.Condoling the girl’s death, he expressed his sympathies with the family.In a tweet, Panneerselvam expressed grief over such incidents concerning the students, who are the “pillars of the future.” “Students should learn to face any situation with guts and parents should aid them in this,” the deputy CM, also the AIADMK Coordinator, said.State Revenue Minister RB Udhayakumar visited the family and consoled them.Stalin, Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, expressed shock over the alleged suicide, but said killing oneself was not the solution. “We can realise from the death of Anitha to Jothisri Durga that NEET is severely affecting students,” he said in a tweet. “I repeat, suicide is not a solution; NEET is not an exam at all. #BanNeet_SaveTNStudents,” he added.In a separate statement, he appealed to students not to resort to such extreme steps, asserting that success has to be achieved through struggle.Training his guns on the Centre and the state government, he said: “The student community is falling prey to the fire called NEET fuelled by them”.Assuring his party’s support to the students on the issue, he said the DMK was prepared to take forward any legal or political struggle against NEET and it will be scrapped in the DMK rule, he said, in an apparent reference to the elections due next year. Meanwhile, DMK Youth Wing Secretary and Stalin’s son, Udhayanidhi visited the family and provided an assistance of Rs 5 lakh.PMK MP Dr Anbumani Ramadoss, whose party is an NDA constituent, also condoled the student’s death. “#SayNoToNEET #BanNEET,” the PMK Youth Wing leader tweeted.His father and party founder Dr S Ramadoss condoled the deaths of the two and called for scrapping the exam.MDMK founder and Rajya Sabha MP Vaiko slammed the BJP-led Centre, saying suicides of students in the state was happening due to the “imposition” of NEET on them.Recalling various instances of suicides by students in Tamil Nadu, including that of Anitha, which had sparked an outrage in the state, Vaiko alleged that despite their high class XII scores, students from the poorer sections were ‘filtered’ in NEET and their medical dreams ‘destroyed.’   “Cancellation of NEET alone can prevent such deaths,” he said in a statement.Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam leader and independent legislator, TTV Dhinakaran and Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan also expressed anguish over Durga’s death.Many on Twitter expressed grief over the deaths and demanded that NEET be scrapped.On Wednesday, the Supreme Court had refused to entertain a batch of pleas seeking deferment or cancellation of NEET scheduled for Sunday.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan had said authorities will take all necessary steps for conducting the NEET-undergraduate exam amid the COVID-19 pandemic for admission in medical courses.

12-09-2020||New Delhi||Process to elect next party president set in motion: Cong||The Congress on Saturday said Sonia Gandhi has made organisational changes after authorisation from the party’s working committee and has set in motion the process of election of the next party president by constituting an election authority.Asked about the organisational changes made by Gandhi and the subsequent reported statements by some leaders who had written to her over party reforms, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said he had not seen a single statement by any Congress leader on the issue and cannot comment on that.On whether the organisational changes had Rahul Gandhi’s imprint, he said Rahul Gandhi was unanimously elected in an AICC session, but post the 2019 verdict he chose to take moral responsibility and resigned.“Crores and crores of Congress workers and unanimously all leaders, including the ones that you mentioned in the meeting of the CWC, expressed complete confidence in the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and in fact some of them urged him to take over as Congress president,” he said at an online press conference.However, he said, it was not for him to comment on the issue at this juncture “for Congress president Sonia Gandhi has constituted an election authority and has set the process of election of the President in motion”.On being pressed further on the issue, Surjewala recalled Sonia Gandhi’s remarks  where she had said that “’our job is to fight the Modi government and its anti-people policies and not fight with each other’ and all of us are working towards that single minded goal, like Arjuna used to only look at the eye of the fish”.To queries on the organisational changes made by Sonia Gandhi, he said change is part of a continuous process and in one voice the Congress Working Committee had decided that she should make all organisational changes afresh, based on which she made these changes.“A lot of new people have got a chance, many old people of the party have got a chance, a lot of colleagues who were already there have got more strength to continue serving the organisation,” he said.In a major organisational reshuffle, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday dropped Ghulam Nabi Azad, Motilal Vora, Ambika Soni and Mallikarjun Kharge as AICC general secretaries, reconstituted the CWC and appointed P Chidambaram, Randeep Surjewala, Tariq Anwar and Jitendra Singh as its regular members.Gandhi also formed a six-member special committee to assist her in organisational matters, apart from reconstituting the central election authority of the AICC with Madhusudan Mistry as its chairman, Rajesh Misra, Krishna Byre Gowda, S Jothimani and Arvinder Singh Lovely as its members.Gandhi, 73, left for the United States on Saturday for a routine medical check-up, sources close to her said.She would return in the last week of September and would miss more than half of the Monsoon Session of Parliament.She is accompanied by Rahul Gandhi, who is expected to return within a week, they said.Her medical check-up was overdue and was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sources said.She had cleared the Congress’ organisational restructuring before departing for her medical check-up. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/process-to-elect-next-party-president-set-in-motion-cong-140317

12-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Police name Yechury, Yogendra Yadav, Jayati Ghosh as co-conspirators||The Delhi Police have named CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav, economist Jayati Ghosh, Delhi University professor and activist Apoorvanand, and documentary filmmaker Rahul Roy as co-conspirators in the February Delhi riots.They have been accused of asking anti-CAA protesters to go to “any extreme”, spreading discontent in the community by calling CAA/NRC anti-Muslim, and organise demonstrations to “malign the image of the Government of India”.The names appeared in a supplementary charge sheet, a copy of which is with the PTI, filed by the police on the riots in North East District between February 23 and 26, which claimed 53 lives and left 581 injured, 97 of them having gunshot wounds.These eminent personalities have been made accused based on the confessions of three students—women’s collective Pinjra Tod members and JNU students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, and Gulfisha Fathima of Jamia Milia Islamia—in the Jafrabad violence, from where the riots spread to other parts of north-east Delhi.All three are facing charges under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.In the charge sheet, which was made public just two days before the commencement of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, the Delhi Police has claimed that Kalita and Narwal admitted to not just their complicity in the riots but also named Ghosh, Apoorvanand and Roy as their mentors, who allegedly asked them to carry out the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and go to “any extreme”.Their similarly-worded disclosure statements – mentioned in the charge sheet—claim the two JNU students said they organised the Daryaganj protest in December and the Jafrafad chakka jam (road block) against the CAA on February 22, 2020 at the behest of Ghosh, Apoorvanand and Roy.The student-activists also told the police the three coordinated with the Islamist group Popular Front of India (PFI) and the Jamia Coordination Committee to mentor the Pinjra Tod members to carry forward their campaign against the CAA, according to the charge sheet.The police have used Jamia student Fathima’s statement to corroborate the ensuing events.The charge sheet claims that apart from Yechury and Yogendra Yadav, Fathima’s statement mentions Bhim Army chief Chandrasekhar, United Against Hate activist Umar Khalid and some leaders from the Muslim community such as ex-MLA Mateen Ahmed, and MLA Amannatullah Khan.The document claims they aided the conspirators of the violence.In her statement, Fathima said she was told to organise the protest to “malign the image of the Government of India”, the police claimed.In her statement, included in the charge sheet, she says that ¨big leaders and lawyers started coming in to provoke and mobilize this crowd, including Omar Khalid, Chandrashekhar Ravan, Yogendra Yadav, Sitaram Yechury, and lawyer Mahmood Pracha, etc”.“Pracha said the sitting in demonstration is your democratic right and the rest of the leaders filled the feeling of discontent in the community by calling CAA/NRC anti-Muslim¨ she said, according to the charge sheet.According to the charge sheet, Kalita added, “Umar Khalid had also given some tips for doing protest against CAA/NRC. On the directions of these persons, Umar Khalid’s United Against Hate Group and JCC (Jamia Coordination Committee) & members of our Pinjda Tod (we) together started protest in difierent parts of Delhi.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-police-name-yechury-yogendra-yadav-jayati-ghosh-as-co-conspirators-140293

The RCEP was to be a free trade agreement among these six countries and the 10 of ASEAN but India stayed away as its interests were not being safeguarded.Strategic analysts in India have hoped the ASEAN will tilt towards the Quad (US-India-Australia-Japan) in the contestation of South China Sea. On the other hand, China has been resisting a tandem act by the Quad to persuade ASEAN by raising its bilateral ties with member countries. In the latest such instance, Indonesian and Chinese Defence Ministers decided to shelve their divergence on South China Sea and build on the existing ties that include a high-speed railway from Jakarta to Bandung.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-asean-review-strategic-ties-adopt-new-five-year-plan-of-action-140287
12-09-2020||New Delhi||Govt’s 3 farm ordinances ‘death knell’ for agriculture, alleges Cong||The Congress on Saturday hit out at the Centre over three farm ordinances, alleging that they would subjugate the farmers “at the altar of a handful of crony capitalists” and were a “death knell” for agriculture.The party asserted that it will oppose the ordinances both inside and outside Parliament and reach out to like-minded parties to put up a joint resistance on the issue.The Congress’ attack came amid protests by farmers, including in Haryana and Punjab, against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020.The ordinances seek to provide barrier-free trade for farmers’ produce outside notified farm mandis, and empower farmers to enter into farming agreements with private players prior to the production for sale of agri-produce.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala expressed solidarity with those protesting against the ordinances and said the party will fight the Modi government “tooth and nail” on this issue.“These three draconian ordinances are a death knell for agriculture in India. They will subjugate the farmer at the altar of a handful of crony capitalists, making them labourers to toil on their own land rather than getting a remunerative price for their crop under the system of minimum support price,” he said at an online press conference.“Our floor leaders will speak to every party. They are already in touch and we will put up a joint opposition to the draconian ordinances of the Modi government aimed at subjugating the farming community and abolishing the livelihood of crores of people who are aligned with the grain markets and other market systems,” he said.Surjewala raised various issues in the ordinances that would allegedly harm the interests of the farmers.There is no provision in the ordinances for the protection of the rights of farm labourers or tenants, he said.“When the mandi system ends, the farmer will be dependent only on contract farming and the big companies will set the price for his crop. What is this if not a new zamindari system?” he asked.“As soon as the mandis are done with, the livelihood of lakhs and crores of labourers, middlemen, book-keepers, transporters etc. working in the grain-vegetable mandis will end automatically,” he claimed.Surjewala alleged it was a “plot” to convert the “disaster of the farmers” into “opportunities” for a handful of crony capitalists under the cover of the coronavirus pandemic.He claimed that the BJP will have to bear the consequences of the “anti-farmers” move for a long time to come.Alleging that the three ordinances were a “direct attack” on the ‘federal structure’, Surjewala said ‘farming’ and ‘mandis’ come under the jurisdiction of states, but the Modi government did not even consider it appropriate to consult them before promulgating the ordinances.With the abolition of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), farmers will neither get the ‘minimum support price’ (MSP) nor the price of the crop according to the market price, Surjewala said.“The government, through its crony capitalist friends, wants to establish ‘East India Company’. It wants to enslave farmers and labourers at the hands of crony capitalists,” he alleged. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govts-3-farm-ordinances-death-knell-for-agriculture-alleges-cong-140282
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Kolkata man claiming to be part of Dawood’s gang had also made threat calls to Maharashtra CM, Pawar: ATS||A Kolkata resident held on Friday for allegedly making threatening calls to Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut recently had also made similar calls at residences of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, state home minister Anil Deshmukh and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, ATS officials said here on Saturday.The accused, Palash Bose, had claimed himself to be a member of Dawood Ibrahim’s gang while allegedly making these phone calls earlier this month, they said.An official said Bose (49) had lived in Dubai for more than 15 years and returned to Kolkata a few years ago.“He made these calls by using a SIM card which he had procured from Dubai,” he said, adding that Bose told investigators that he had also used international SIM cards to make these calls.Police are trying to find out if Bose had any connections in Dubai, the official said.Police had registered a case under sections 505 (Statements conducing to public mischief), 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation), and 507 (criminal intimidation by anonymous communication) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on the complaint of Raut, said Deputy Commissioner of Police, Anti- Terrorism Squad, Vikram Deshmane.Police had also added section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932, he said.“During investigation, ATS Mumbai received information from a reliable source that the accused is hiding in Kolkata, following which he was picked up from that city by a team led by police inspector Daya Nayak,” he said.Police recovered two mobile phones, four SIM cards—three international and one domestic—from the accused, the DCP said.Another official said Bose’s  motive behind making these threat calls is under investigation.He said Bose, a science graduate, had obtained phone numbers of politicians whom he had targetted from various websites.Mumbai Police were given the transit remand of the accused till September 14.On Sunday, police had beefed up security outside Thackeray’s residence ‘Matoshree’ in Bandra after an unidentified caller, claiming to be fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim”s aide, called the bungalow’s landline number.State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had received threat calls on more than one occasion over his stance in connection with the controversy involving actress Kangana Ranaut.Deshmukh had received the calls from Himachal Pradesh and another location from different numbers on Tuesday and at around 6 am on Wednesday, sources close to him had said, adding that the callers asked the minister not to get involved in the controversy.Earlier also, an anonymous caller had phoned Deshmukh’s Nagpur office, threatening him and Sharad Pawar, a minister had said.Kolkata Police had said that Bose claimed himself to be a fan of Ranaut.The Shiv Sena and the actress are engaged in a war of words after the latter recently likened Mumbai to Pakistan- occupied Kashmir (PoK) and also said she feared Mumbai Police more than the movie mafia.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is ruled by the Shiv Sena, on Wednesday pulled down some illegal alterations made at Ranaut’s bungalow in suburban Bandra. The Bombay High Court later granted a stay.

12-09-2020||New Delhi||India, China troops within shooting range at Spanggur Gap||China has mobilised thousands of soldiers, tanks and howitzers within rifle range of Indian Army deployment at Spanggur Gap in the southern part of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh, sources said, even as Indian troops are on high alert.The Chinese People's Liberation Army made provocative military deployments at Spanggur Gap, which is between Gurung Hill and Magar Hill, from August 30 after Indian soldiers seized tactical heights on the ridge line on the southern bank of Pangong Tso near Chushul at the Line of Actual Control (LAC)."Seeing the Chinese PLA troop and guns mobilisation, the Indian Army too made mirror deployments at Spanggur Gap. Both the countries' troops and guns are within shooting range," said a government official.Further, sources said, China has deployed its militia squads to "consolidate the border" and "stabilise Tibet region". They have been tasked to try and dislodge the Indian Army soldiers from the tactical heights.The militia is an irregular mix of mountaineers, boxers, members of local fight clubs and others. Most of the members are raised from the local population."Militia is basically a reserve force of the Chinese's People Liberation Army. They are deployed during war time situations and to help the PLA in its military operations," said a senior government officer.The officer also said that Chinese militia also conducts independent operations and provides combat support and manpower replenishment to the PLA.Indian Army has clearly reiterated that the forces will retaliate if Chinese troops make provocative military moves.At the northern bank of Pangong Lake, sources said that even as PLA troops continue to occupy positions on Finger 4 mountain spur jutting into the lake, Indian soldiers have occupied some heights overlooking their positions."Our troops have occupied some heights overlooking the positions occupied by PLA," said a source.The north bank of the lake is divided into 8 'Fingers' that are contested by both sides.

Thus, there is a need for an intra-court appeal,” Bhushan submitted.The petition comes less than two weeks after the Supreme Court imposed a token fine of Re 1 on Bhushan, who was convicted for criminal contempt for his two tweets against the judiciary, saying he had attempted to “denigrate the reputation of the institution of administration of justice”.The conviction and sentence had come after Bhushan refused to apologise to the court. After the sentence was pronounced, he had announced that he would pay the fine and file a petition seeking review of the decision.Bhushan is facing another criminal contempt case initiated in the top court 2009 for his statement in Tehelka Magazine that half the 16 former CJIs were “corrupt”.The lawyer contended “that the right to appeal against conviction in original criminal cases is a substantive right under Article 21 and flows from principles of natural justice. The absence of such a right thus violates Article 21”.Maintaining that contempt proceedings were quasi-criminal in nature, akin to a criminal trial, he argued that procedural safeguards similar to criminal trials must apply in contempt cases as well.Describing ‘Original Criminal Contempt Cases’ before the Supreme Court as a unique and distinct category of cases, he pointed out how the top court in the past framed special rules to deal with death penalty cases and devised special remedy in the nature of ‘Curative Petition’ against its own final judgments on certain limited grounds. “Right of Appeal is an absolute right according to Article 14(5) of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which India has ratified and is therefore binding upon the Indian State. Under ICCPR, first appeal is a right even where trial is by the Highest Court and Review is not a substitute for an appeal,” Bhushan contended.“The freedom of speech guaranteed under Article 19 can only be restricted/regulated under Article 19(2) by a procedure which is reasonable and stands the test of Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life and personal liberty),” he submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhushan-moves-sc-seeks-right-to-appeal-in-contempt-conviction-hearing-by-larger-bench-140275
12-09-2020||New Delhi||Judges becoming victims of ‘juicy gossips’ and ‘slanderous’ social media posting: Justice NV Ramana||Supreme Court judge NV Ramana on Saturday said that judges are now becoming victims of “juicy gossips” and “slanderous social media postings” as they restrain themselves from speaking in their own defence.Justice Ramana, who is next in line to become Chief Justice of India, said that life of a judge is no better than others and there has been a misunderstanding that “judges lead a life of luxury in their ivory towers”.Chief Justice of India S A Bobde said the freedom of speech of judges “is curtailed by the same laws which prevent people from saying whatever they feel like, adverse to the independence of the judiciary”.They were speaking at the launch of book “Judiciary, Judge and the Administration of Justice” authored by former Supreme Court judge Justice (retd) R Banumathi, who had superannuated on July 19.Their remarks come in the backdrop of the row involving activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan. On August 31, the apex court had imposed a “nominal fine” of Re 1 on Bhushan, who was convicted for criminal contempt for his two tweets against the judiciary, saying he has attempted to “denigrate the reputation of the institution of administration of justice”.Justice Ramana said that the main theme of the book is the responsibilities and duties of a judge.“Judges themselves restrain from speaking in their own defence and they are now being construed as a soft target for criticism. This issue is further complicated by the proliferation of social media and technology. Judges are becoming victims of juicy gossip and slanderous social media posting,” he said.Justice Ramana said that from his own experience, he can say that the life of a judge is not better than others and even their family members have to make the sacrifices.“There seems to be a misunderstanding that judges lead a life of luxury in their ivory towers. However, the reality is quite different and it is difficult for others to comprehend. Judges have to balance their social life, in order to be independent,” he said.Justice Ramana said that he believes, in the present day, it requires sacrifices to be made by judges, unparalleled to any other profession.The CJI said the judiciary belongs to the nation and its achievements are the result of “unflinching dedication” and commitment of numerous individuals on and off the bench.He said that for judges and consequently for the judiciary, the biggest challenge is to ensure that the nation inches towards the goal set in the Constitution.He said that an independent judiciary is ‘Sine qua non’ (essential condition) to achieve the same.“It is not for the personal benefit of the judges but for the effective exercise of the power vested in the judiciary,” he said, adding, “In fact, even the freedom of speech of judges is curtailed by the same laws which prevent people from saying whatever they feel like, adverse to the independence of the judiciary.”     Talking about the book, Justice Ramana said that the book by Justice (retd) Banumathi symbolizes the immense experience she has gained for many decades and her insights into judicial functioning stretch over the entire judicial system from trial court to the apex court.“She has worked tirelessly for 32 years, rendering justice and contributed a lot to the Indian judicial system. It is Justice Banumathi’s hard work and her independent thinking. She has always been a fearless and dynamic judge. She has vast experience on the judicial and administrative side. She has been one of the finest judges the country has witnessed,” Justice Ramana said.He added that with her vast experience, Justice Banumathi has laid down for all judges a guide in which she had dealt with important concepts of constitutional importance such as the doctrine of separation of power and the importance of judiciary’s independence.“She has also highlighted the relevance of judicial accountability and impartiality. In the second part of the book, she enlightens the readers about the recent developments of our judicial system about the e-courts and court management system. She elaborates on how technology has transformed the justice dispensation system,” he said.The Chief Justice of India also said that COVID-19 pandemic would present a “huge pendency of cases” in the courts and a lot of emphasis has to be placed on utilising mediation for resolving many of these matters.The CJI, who said that courts are going to face a “flood of cases” once the pandemic goes away and lockdowns are lifted, also stressed on the need to devote energy to mental health and referred to the “uncomfortable prediction” that there might be a suicide pandemic.Speaking on the occasion, apex court’s Justice D Y Chandrachud referred to the dedication of Justice (retd) Banumathi towards the cause of justice and legal profession.Justice Chandrachud, who is the chairperson of Supreme Court E-committee, referred to the work done by it and also provided data of cases at the district level during the pandemic.He said around 28.66 lakh cases were registered at the district level in the pandemic period out of which 12.69 lakh matters were disposed of.Justice (retd) Banumathi said the book highlights the various essential facets of judgeship and also gives a comprehensive view of the accomplishments of the E-court project.Supreme Court judge Justice Indu Malhotra and Chief Justice of Delhi High Court Justice D N Patel also addressed the gathering that was attended by several other judges of the apex court.

12-09-2020||New Delhi||There will be ‘flood’ of pending cases post-COVID, mediation needs to be emphasised: CJI||Chief Justice of India S A Bobde on Saturday said the COVID-19 pandemic would present a “huge pendency of cases” in courts and a lot of emphasis has to be placed on utilising mediation for resolving many of these matters.The CJI also stressed on the need to focus on mental health and referred to the “uncomfortable prediction” that there might be a suicide pandemic following the COVID crisis.“This COVID pandemic is going to present us with huge pendency of cases. I do not see any way out of it. We have to decide cases,” the CJI said during a virtual event where he launched the book - ‘Judiciary, Judges and the Administration of Justice’ - authored by former top court judge Justice R Banumathi.The CJI said he believes that this is the time when a lot of emphasis has to be placed on utilising mediation, pre-litigation and post-litigation mediation to resolve many matters.“I am not suggesting every matter can be, but when the pandemic goes away and the lockdowns are all lifted, we are going to face a flood of cases which I do not know how we are going to decide if we go in the usual way of following the detailed procedure and this is something which we all have to put in our minds together to deal with,” he said.Addressing the gathering, Justice N V Ramana said judges are now being construed as soft targets for criticism and are becoming “victims of juicy gossip and slanderous social media posting”.Justice Ramana, the senior-most judge of the apex court after the CJI, said that judges have to balance their social life in order to be independent.“It is completely upon the judge to maintain a distance. Judges themselves restrain from speaking in their own defence and they are now being construed as soft targets for criticism. This issue is further complicated by the proliferation of social media and technology. Judges are becoming victims of juicy gossip and slanderous social media posting,” he said.Raising the issue of mental health, the CJI said it requires serious attention as there is a very “uncomfortable prediction” about a suicide pandemic.“I don’t believe and sincerely hope that it does not happen,” he said, adding that pandemic has brought two things amongst people which is very troublesome—depressive tendency and unnecessary aggression.“It is high time that we devote energy to mental health,” he said, adding that the Supreme Court has taken an initiative to deal with the mental health issue and provide professional mental health advice, which the secretary general of the top court would soon announce.He said the judiciary belongs to the nation and its achievements are the result of “unflinching dedication” and commitment of numerous individuals on and off the bench.The CJI said that for judges and consequently for the judiciary, the biggest challenge is to ensure that the nation inches towards the goal set in the Constitution.He said that an independent judiciary is ‘sine qua non’ (essential condition) to achieve the same.“It is not for the personal benefit of the judges but for the effective exercise of the power vested in the judiciary,” he said, adding, “In fact, even the freedom of speech of judges is curtailed by the same laws which prevent people from saying whatever they feel like, adverse to the independence of the judiciary.”          Justice Ramana said there is a misunderstanding that judges lead a life of “luxury in their ivory towers”.“From my own experience, I can state that the life of a judge is not better than others. There seems to be a misunderstanding that judges lead a life of luxury in their ivory towers. However, the reality is quite different and it is difficult for others to comprehend,” he said.The CJI said the book authored by Justice Banumathi (retd) is “unique” in the sense that it provides valuable insight into the functioning of the colossal institution of the judiciary.Speaking on the occasion, apex court judge Justice D Y Chandrachud referred to the dedication of Justice Banumathi (retd) towards the cause of justice and legal profession.Justice Chandrachud referred to the work done by the Supreme Court E-committee, of which he is the chairperson, and also provided data of cases at the district level during the pandemic.He said around 28.66 lakh cases were registered at the district level in the pandemic period out of which 12.69 lakh matters were disposed of.He also referred to the data uploaded on the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) and said around 3.39 crore cases are pending.Justice Chandrachud said data of around 9.91 crore disposed of cases is available on NJDG along with around 12.53 crore orders and judgements.Justice Banumathi (retd) said the book highlights the various essential facets of judgeship and also gives a comprehensive view of accomplishments of the E-court project.She said the book impresses upon the judges and lawyers for the smart use of technology to make the judicial process more transparent and efficient.Supreme Court judge Justice Indu Malhotra and Chief Justice of Delhi High Court Justice D N Patel also addressed the gathering which was attended by several other judges of the apex court. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-will-be-flood-of-pending-cases-post-covid-mediation-needs-to-be-emphasised-cji-140272
12-09-2020||New Delhi||International passengers can opt for Covid-19 test, waiting lounge at Delhi airport for Rs 5,000||Delhi airport on Saturday started its on-arrival COVID-19 testing facility wherein an international passenger can pay Rs 5,000 to avail a RT-PCR test and also use the waiting lounge, said senior officials of its operator DIAL.The Civil Aviation Ministry had on September 2 said international passengers, who have to take connecting domestic flights after landing in India, will have the option of getting themselves tested for COVID-19 at the entry airports.Passengers who opt for the test will have to wait in a specified lounge in the airport or a designated hotel in the city till their results come, the ministry noted. If found negative, they will be exempted from mandatory institutional quarantine and can take the connecting flight.“The COVID-19 test at the airport will cost Rs 2,400. The waiting lounge charges are Rs 2,600,” said an official of the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL).Results of the RT-PCR test will be declared within 4-6 hours after collecting the sample, the official noted.Currently, the specified waiting lounge established at the Delhi airport has a capacity to handle 100 passengers at a time, said another DIAL official. All seats have been arranged in the waiting lounge keeping in mind the social distancing criteria.“This capacity can easily be expanded whenever the number of arriving international passengers rise,” the official stated.Currently, the Delhi airport handles 7,000-8,000 arriving international passengers per day, the official noted.The DIAL started the COVID-19 testing facility on Saturday at the multi-level car parking area of Terminal 3 in collaboration with Genestrings Diagnostic Centre.In a statement, the DIAL said passengers will have to provide their name, contact details and valid identity proof in their online application for the COVID-19 test at the Delhi airport.“They will also have an option to modify the slot in case they are not able to reach at the scheduled appointment time. Besides, passengers belonging to the same family can book a single slot all together online,” the press release stated.As per the government rules, all arriving international passengers have to undergo mandatory seven-day institutional quarantine followed by seven-day home quarantine.However, if an arriving international passenger has a COVID-negative certificate from a RT-PCR test done 96 hours prior to the journey, he or she is exempted from mandatory institutional quarantine.In case an arriving international passenger -- who has to take a connecting domestic flight -- does not have such a COVID-negative certificate, he or she has the option of getting himself or herself tested at the COVID-19 testing facility of the entry airport. If the result is negative, the passenger will be allowed to go and board his or her connecting domestic flight.Scheduled international flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown.However, special international passenger flights have been operating in India under Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral air bubble arrangements formed between India and other countries since July. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/international-passengers-can-opt-for-covid-19-test-waiting-lounge-at-delhi-airport-for-rs-5-000-140269
12-09-2020||Madurai (Tamil Nadu)||NEET: Another medical aspirant commits suicide in Tamil Nadu||A 19-year-old medical aspirant died of alleged suicide here on Saturday, apparently 'apprehensive' over the National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET), police said.The victim was found hanging at her residence and a purported suicide note left behind by her said she was 'apprehensive' though others had high 'hopes' on her, police said.The death, which comes days after another medical aspirant in the state’s Ariyalur town allegedly committed suicide, drew sharp responses from Tamil Nadu political parties opposed to the NEET, even as Chief Minister K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam of the ruling AIADMK expressed shock over the incident.DMK President M K Stalin said the NEET "is not an exam at all".Taking to Twitter, Palaniswami expressed grief over the "sad" incident and said students had many avenues to taste success and them resorting to such extreme steps was distressing."It is distressing to see students, the hope for the future, taking such steps," he said.Condoling the girl's death, he expressed his sympathies with the family.In a tweet, Panneerselvam expressed grief over such incidents concerning the students, who are the "pillars of the future"."Students should learn to face any situation with guts and parents should aid them in this," said the Deputy CM and AIADMK coordinator.Stalin, Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, expressed shock over the suicide, but said killing oneself was not the solution."We can realise from the death of Anitha (a medical aspirant who died of suicide in 2017) to Jothisri Durga that NEET is severely affecting students," he said in a tweet."I repeat, suicide is not a solution; NEET is not an exam at all. #BanNeet_SaveTNStudents," he added.PMK MP Dr Anbumani Ramadoss, whose party is an NDA constituent, condoled the student's death and expressed his sympathies with her family."#SayNoToNEET #BanNEET," the PMK Youth Wing leader tweeted. His father and party founder Dr S Ramadoss also called for scrapping the exam.MDMK founder and Rajya Sabha MP Vaiko slammed the BJP-led Centre, saying suicides of students in the state were happening due to the "imposition" of the NEET on them.Recalling various instances of suicides by students in Tamil Nadu, including that of Anitha, which had sparked an outrage in the state, Vaiko alleged that despite their high Class XII scores, students from the poorer sections were “filtered” in the NEET and their medical dreams “destroyed”.     "Cancellation of NEET alone can prevent such deaths," he said in a statement.Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam leader and independent legislator, TTV Dhinakaran and Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan also expressed anguish over Durga's death.On Wednesday, the Supreme Court had refused to entertain a batch of pleas seeking deferment or cancellation of the NEET scheduled for Sunday.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan had said that authorities would take all necessary steps for conducting the NEET-undergraduate exam amid the COVID-19 pandemic for admission in medical courses.

Staff members laid them alongside the wreaths at the war memorial. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/seven-nations-observe-75th-anniversary-of-end-of-world-war-ii-in-singapore-140265
12-09-2020||Vijay Mohan||For first time, scientists work out turbulence parameters over Himalayas||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 12Scientists at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) have for the first time come up with estimates for turbulence parameters in the lower troposphere over the central Himalayan region.The calculation of atmospheric turbulence parameters specific to the Himalayas would result in weather predictions becoming more certain and also help in preventing air traffic disasters.While the turbulence parameters for southern India were known earlier, the same were not available for the Himalayan region and consequently some approximate values were used by scientists and meteorologists for their calculations. The parameters have now been found to be much higher over the Himalayan region that thought earlier.Accurate and timely information of the higher values of the atmospheric turbulence parameters and understanding of time and space distribution of turbulence structure in the troposphere could help improve performance of numerical weather prediction and climate models.Scientists and meteorologists will be able to update these values in their existing models thereby improving weather forecast. Also, precise knowledge on turbulence over this region will help in safe air traffic movements.The researchers from ARIES used the Stratosphere Troposphere Radar (STR) for their study for determining the magnitude of refractive index structure that represents the strength of the atmospheric turbulence. They found the magnitude of atmospheric turbulence to be very large at the lower altitudes due to the mountain wave activities and presence of low-level clouds.Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, Ashutosh Sharma said the indigenous development of the STR will further strengthen the country’s efforts to better understand the regional changes in weather and climate, particularly in the Himalayan region, which is having complex topography.According to scientists, it is also important to model clear-air turbulence as that would aid in limiting air traffic disasters, particularly over the complex mountainous regions. Low levels of cloud are generated in a mountainous region with complex topography and because of this, stable air in this region is set into oscillations known as mountain waves and lee waves.Characterisation of turbulence in the mountainous region is vital to understand the dynamics of mountain induced wave disturbances and other related phenomena, which has crucial role in modulating the general circulation wind patterns.The study, undertaken by ARIES faculty members DV Phani Kumar, S Bhattacharjee, Manish Naja and a PhD student Aditya Jaiswal, has been published in the Radio Science, a quarterly peer-reviewed journal published by the American Geophysical Union and co-sponsored by the International Union of Radio Science.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-first-time-scientists-work-out-turbulence-parameters-over-himalayas-140264

The NTA has increased the number of exam centres from the previous 2,546 to 3,862 to ensure the conduct of safe exams in the midst of a surging COVID pandemic with cases today rising beyond 46 lakh with a daily rise of over 97,000 infections today.In an important decision, the NTA will allow all symptomatic candidates to take exams in an isolation room, as earlier reported by The Tribune.The NTA advisory has clarified that all candidates will be tested with thermo guns at the entry to registration rooms and candidates with more than 37.4 degree centigrade (99.4 degree Fahrenheit) will be taken to an isolation room and allowed to take tests there if their fever does not improve.The Health Ministry had in its standard operating procedures for exam schedules allowed the exam conducting agencies to frame their own policy on how to deal with symptomatic candidates—whether to let them take tests or to deny them.NTA chief Vineit Joshi earlier in an advisory said symptomatic candidates will be allowed to take tests alone in separate rooms where invigilators will be present in protective gear.In the recent JEE Mains exams for entry to undergraduate engineering courses, 6.35 lakh candidates appeared out of 8.58 lakh who had registered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/neet-ug-on-sunday-isolation-rooms-for-symptomatic-candidates-15-97-lakh-to-take-test-140256
12-09-2020||Patna||Raghuvansh Prasad Singh’s condition worsens, put on ventilator||Former Union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, whose recent resignation from the RJD founded and headed by Lalu Prasad has left political waters in Bihar astir, has fallen critically ill and put on a ventilator, a close aide said on Saturday.Singh, who has been admitted at AIIMS, Delhi for about a week after developing post-COVID complications, resigned from the primary membership of the party on Thursday and followed it up with an open letter, a day later, addressed to Prasad’s arch rival and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, triggering speculations about his future moves.“Singh sahib’s condition deteriorated considerably last night. At 11.56 pm, he was put on ventilator. We are praying for his well-being,” the aide, who remains by the side of the septuagenarian, told PTI-Bhasha over phone.A staunch loyalist of the RJD supremo whom he supported in thick and thin, Singh ran afoul with the party a few months ago when murmurs about mafia don-turned-politician Rama Singh, his rival in Vaishali Lok Sabha constituency, led him to resign from the post of the national vice-president.A cabinet colleague of Prasad in the Manmohan Singh government, Singh thereby stymied Rama Singh’s entry into the party and although he did not give up the primary membership at that time, he stayed away from the RJDs day-to-day affairs which was attributed, in part, to his ill-health.On Thursday, his hand-written note addressed to Prasad declaring that he has had enough went viral on the social media.On the same day, the RJD supremo sent a letter to Singh from Ranchi, making an emotional appeal to his companion for over three decades not to leave the party.On Friday, Singh wrote another letter from hospital, this time addressed to Nitish Kumar, which was seen as his attempt to cosy up to the chief minister, who heads the JD(U) and has been a fierce rival of the RJD supremo for decades.Often called the architect of the MNREGA scheme, which was floated when he was the Union minister for rural development, Singh has been in political wilderness for some time, having lost two consecutive elections in 2014 and 2019 from Vaishali which he has represented in the Lok Sabha a record five times.His relations with Tejashwi Yadav, younger son and heir apparent of Lalu Prasad, turned sour when he started pitching for Nitish Kumar back to the Grand Alliance helmed by the RJD, after the party received its worst-ever drubbing in the Lok Sabha polls last year.The JD(U) is said to be keen to win over Singh, a highly respected Rajput leader, in the run up to the assembly elections, and speculations have been rife that it is mooting a legislative council berth for the former Union ministers son. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/raghuvansh-prasad-singhs-condition-worsens-put-on-ventilator-140254

No part of Afghanistan is untouched by our 400-plus development projects. Confident that this civilizational relationship will continue to grow,” he said.Last month, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani agreed to release 400 Taliban prisoners, paving the way for the beginning of the long-awaited peace process aimed at ending nearly two decades of conflict in the war-torn country.India has been a major stakeholder in peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested $ 2 billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.India has been keenly following the evolving political situation after the US inked a peace deal with the Taliban in February. The deal provided for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, effectively drawing curtains to Washington’s 18-year war in the country.The US has lost over 2,400 soldiers in Afghanistan since late 2001.India has also been maintaining that care should be taken to ensure that any such process does not lead to any “ungoverned spaces” where terrorists and their proxies can relocate.India has been calling upon all sections of the political spectrum in Afghanistan to work together to meet the aspirations of all people in that country including those from the minority community for a prosperous and safe future.

12-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Ahead of Bihar polls, Nitish, Nadda hold seat-sharing talks||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 12BJP national president JP Nadda, who is in Bihar in connection with the party’s election  programme, on Saturday met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to resolve the seat-sharing differences among the NDA allies ahead of the forthcoming elections to the 243-member Assembly.Sources said the two allies decided to reach an agreement “at the earliest” in order to put at rest all speculations regarding the alliance, especially arising out of open show of acrimony between the JDU and the LJP. Nitish Kumar is believed to have expressed unhappiness over statements made by LJP president Chirag Paswan and stressed on early resolution so that there is no ambiguity in the minds of the voters.Much of the issue is related to the number of seats the allies will contest in the forthcoming elections. Aiming to increase the political relevance of his party, Chirag Paswan is demanding a share corresponding with the number of Lok Sabha seats the LJP contested in the 2019, in other words at least 42 seats in the 243-member Assembly. While the LJP contested six seats in the last general elections, senior leader Ram Vilas Paswan was also accommodated in the Rajya Sabha.  Meanwhile,  six sitting MLAs from the RJD have joined the JDU and “more are expected” as per sources. Therefore, Nitish Kumar too is pressing for a “minimum 120 seats”.Apart from accommodating the LJP, which is threatening to contest against the JDU, the NDA also has to look after the interests of Jitan Ram Manji-led HAM(S) which joined the alliance recently.Sources say Manjhi is being “persuaded to not contest the Assembly elections” in which case he may be accommodated in the Rajya Sabha.    Nadda was accompanied by the party’s state election in-charge Bhupendra Yadav, state president Sanjay Jaiswal and Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi.JDU Lok Sabha MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh was also present at the talks where Nitish Kumar is believed to have voiced annoyance over Chirag Paswan’s utterances and the damage they were doing to the image of the alliance. The BJP leadership is believed to have assured Nitish Kumar that it will intervene to iron out differences between his party and the LJP.  Nadda, who is in Bihar for a two-day tour, also offered prayers at the famous Patan Devi temple after which the Bihar capital is named.He interacted with women farmers and litchi cultivators at a village named after legendary “Kisan Chachi” whose efforts at promoting entrepreneurship among rural women earned her a Padmashri.He also addressed ‘makhana’ and fish producers at Darbhanga and inugurated the ‘Atmanirbhar Bihar Abhiyan’ at the party’s office in Patna.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-bihar-polls-nitish-nadda-hold-seat-sharing-talks-140238

I am wholeheartedly thankful to the Govt of India and the Indian Army for their persistent effort in securing their return,” Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu said in a tweet.“I appreciate Indian Army for the smooth return of our citizens. I thank Indian Army Chief, his office and the local Commanders for constantly following up the matter and regularly updating me on the matter,” tweeted Kiren Rijiju, Lok Sabha member from Arunachal Pradesh and Union Minister of State for Sports and Youth Welfare.The local media had initially reported that the youths were “abducted” by PLA. The Army today said the boys had “inadvertently strayed to the other side of LAC”.Also read: Amid standoff with China, IAF to get land in Uttarakhand to carry out activities in border areasJaishankar attends meeting on Afghan peace processAccording to Lt Col Harsh Wardhan Pande, spokesman of the Army’s Tezpur-headquartered 4 Corps, instances of Indian nationals unknowingly trespassing into Chinese side of the LAC and landing in the custody of the PLA were not uncommon.“Three such incidents took place in the current year in Upper Subansiri and West Siang districts, including the latest one. All such individuals were brought back home safely after consistent efforts and coordination by Indian Army”, Pande said.The latest incident also received a lot of media attention owing to the ongoing stand-off between the Indian Army and the PLA at Ladakh. The five boys, who were taken into custody by PLA on September 2, were handed over to the Army this morning at Kibitu on the Indian side of the Indo-China border at Arunachal Pradesh.The youths – Toch Singkam, Prasat Ringling, Dongtu Ebiya, Tanu Baker and Ngaru Diri – belong to the Nacho area in Upper Subansiri district. They will be now quarantined for 14 days at Kibitu and thereafter will be sent back to their respective families.Sources said the boys went to the LAC accompanying army personnel as porters and strayed into the Chinese side when they were returning to Nacho. Army spokesman Pande, however, claimed the boys went to the forest for hunting, which for them was a traditional sport, and also to search for medicinal herbs.China had initially feigned ignorance about the missing boys and even questioned their nationality saying it did not recognise the “so called Arunachal Pradesh which was actually south Tibet”. However, on September 8 PLA confirmed that the boys were indeed in their custody.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-hands-over-5-indians-who-went-missing-from-arunachal-140234

12-09-2020||Vijay Mohan||AFT to examine role of major general in case of irregularities in construction works||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 12The Armed Forces Tribunal will look into the role of a major general in ordering a court of inquiry into allegations of irregularities by a colonel and a lieutenant colonel in award of construction contracts at a time when he was himself responsible for finalisation of the contracts.Taking up the petition filed by the colonel through his counsel Col Indra Sen Singh (retd), the Tribunal has directed that the court of inquiry proceedings be held in abeyance till further orders as the bench wanted to satisfy itself with regard to the role of the major general in the entire matter. He was then serving as a brigadier with 11 Corps. The Army has maintained that all related proceedings have been initiated on the directions of the Corps Commander.The petitioner was commanding an engineer regiment at Ambala when several construction jobs were allotted to his unit as emergency works for providing comprehensive security cover due to the enhanced security threat to various garrisons in 2018.The allegation against him was that overpayments were made to the vendors and contractors who had supplied the required materials for carrying out the security-related construction works.He has averred that the role of his unit, which had just moved to the location, was limited to the execution of the construction works after receiving the necessary materials which were required to be sanctioned and procured through a duly laid down process for which the approving authority was the brigadier. Neither he nor any officer in the unit was responsible in any manner for selecting the vendors and procuring the material.While the petitioner has not disputed that overpayment was made and thereafter the excess amount was deposited in government account by the vendors as soon as the irregularity was detected, he has contended that the brigadier had compelled his unit to complete the work without waiting for the report of the Emergency Empowered Committee (EEC) which was convened by 11 Corps itself.He has pointed out that the court of inquiry’s convening order was issued through the General Staff Branch, under the signature of the same brigadier (now major general) who himself was involved in the planning and execution of the works, whereas under the relevant Army regulations it should have come from the Adjutant General’s Branch.He has further stated in the petition that the original Request for Proposal (RFP) was prepared and uploaded with due approval of the brigadier after 11 Corps repeatedly instructed him to submit the same for approval without waiting for the EEC report. Had the correct procedure and sequence of action as provided for been followed there would not have been any need to prepare an amended RFP, which could not be uploaded, and thereby would not have caused confusion, it was said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aft-to-examine-role-of-major-general-in-case-of-irregularities-in-construction-works-140226

From farmers’ vantage, it appears that there is little to cheer about and there are many things of concern, says Kavita Kuruganti of Alliance of Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture.According to a statement, the government has dubbed the ordinances as “historic developments” and the “1991 moment” for Indian agriculture but “these ordinances are not about farmers but about agri-businesses”.The other points highlighted by activists include||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agriculture-reform-ordinances-more%C2%A0about-agri-businesses-than-farmers-agri-activists-140221

A total of 18 lakh houses have been constructed in the country during the lockdown period."This is an example of turning adversity into opportunity," Modi said, and attributed the achievement to the contributions of skilled migrant workers who had returned to their villages in the wake of outbreak of Covid.As against an average of 125 days needed to construct a house under the scheme during normal times, it was constructed in only 45-60 days during the period.Several welfare schemes have been converged with the PMAY-G for integrated development and planning of the houses.He said although the welfare housing scheme was in implementation under other names before his tenure, it is now implemented with a reformist approach. Earlier there was lack of transparency.Transparency through technology intervention, holistic vision, participatory and bottoms-up approach weeding out any chance of corruption, and instilling a sense of satisfaction, empowerment, sense of belonging among the beneficiaries, and time-bound implementation completion of projects are the hallmarks of the implementation at present, he said.Modi said he had announced on Independence Day that optical fibre connections would be provided in villages. Cable lines of more than five thousand kilometre (cumulative) length had already been laid across the country, he said. Implementation of several projects in rural India during lockdown period helped provide jobs locally which is facilitating revival of economy, the PM said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/development-of-villages-and-empowerment-of-poor-to-strengthen-india-modi-140220

Negotiations were intense but cooperation prevailed”.The resolution urged member states to “enable all countries to have unhindered timely access to quality, safe, efficacious and affordable diagnosis, therapeutics, medicines and vaccines, and essential health technologies for the COVID-19 response” and recognised the “role of extensive immunisation against COVID-19 as a global public good for health in preventing, containing and stopping transmission in order to bring the pandemic to an end, once safe, quality, efficacious, effective, accessible and affordable vaccines are available”.It supported Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ appeal for an immediate global ceasefire, including to help create “corridors for life-saving aid, open windows for the diplomacy of dialogue”.It called upon political and religious leaders to promote inclusion and unity in response to the pandemic and to prevent and take strong action against racism, xenophobia, hate speech, violence, discrimination, including on the basis of age and stigmatisation.The resolution also calls upon Member States to “advance with determination, bold and concerted actions and address the immediate social and economic impacts of the pandemic, while striving to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by designing recovery strategies out of the crisis to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda”.In its explanation of the vote, the US said it “does not concur” with the references to the World Health Organisation in the resolution and criticised China for hiding the truth about the outbreak that originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.“Unfortunately, we might never know for certain how much of the pain and suffering caused by COVID-19 could have been avoided if the Chinese Communist Party had behaved like a responsible government and immediately warned the rest of the world of the virus that they uncovered in Wuhan,” the US Mission to the UN said.“Not only did they fail the world but the World Health Organisation’s failures in the early days of the pandemic also contributed to needless suffering and the worsening of this pandemic. The WHO needs to reform, including by demonstrating its independence from the Chinese Communist Party,” the US Mission said.It added that Washington voted against the resolution as it “cannot allow the resolution to be hijacked by several themes that are not pertinent to the discussion”.In a tweet, the US Mission said it “cannot, in good conscience”, support a resolution including unrelated language supporting the advancement of the Chinese Communist Party propaganda, abortion, and language against sanctions that are designed to constrain bad actors including removing unilateral economic and trade sanctions.The US said: “The text attempts to undermine the international community’s ability to respond to acts that are offensive to international norms. Economic sanctions are a legitimate means to achieve foreign policy, security, and other national and international objectives, and the United States is not alone in that view or in that practice.”The resolution emphasised that illicit financial flows, in particular those caused by tax evasion, corruption and transnational organised crime, reduce the availability of vital resources for responding to and recovering from COVID-19.

However, they constitute an advancement over the existing system. Therefore they are worth embracing," the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice said in its 103rd report on the functioning of virtual court proceedings through videoconferencing."The concept of virtual courts has gained immense ground during Covid times. It is and will remain the new reality and the new normal. The committee believes that this move will unlock the courts and also mitigate the inconvenience of attending courts as long distance travels can be dispensed with and proceedings become less expensive as well,” the panel said.Headed by Rajya Sabha BJP MP Bhupender Yadav, the report said virtual courts would “strike a balance between these two extremes and extend expeditious justice to the litigant public without compromising quality.”However, the panel expressed unhappiness over the fact that e-Courts Integrated Mission mode project is progressing at a snail's pace”. Emphasising the need to augment infrastructure, it said “the benefits of virtual courts will percolate down only when all court complexes are fully ICT enabled.”Noting that court proceedings were recorded in some form or the other world over, the report said live-streaming of certain proceedings will promote transparency.The committee members also said that the judiciary may also consider broadcasting virtual hearings of certain specified categories of cases to further the principle of open justice and open court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-panel-bats-for-virtual-courts-post-covid-140032

12-09-2020||New Delhi||Amid rift with JD-U, Paswan firmly stands by son’s decisions||Union Minister and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, whose son Chirag Paswan is currently engaged in a bitter battle for political space with NDA partner JD-U in poll-bound Bihar, today said he will firmly stand with Chirag in his decisions related to the party’s affairs in the state.Tweeting a set of messages with deep political meaning, Paswan, who holds the Ministry of Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution in the Narendra Modi government, said despite being ill during the Covid crisis he refused to get hospitalised because of his responsibilities.Paswan said his health had started to deteriorate, but to ensure that the work does not suffer he did not get hospitalised. “I continuously served the country and made every effort to ensure that food reaches on time everywhere,” he added.Paswan said he finally got admitted to a hospital at Chirag’s insistence. “I am happy that my son Chirag is with me at this time. Besides taking care of me, he is also fulfilling his responsibilities towards the party,” Paswan added.Chirag is the LJP president. He said he would firmly back every decision Chirag takes for the betterment of the party.Notably it was at Chirag’s insistence that the LJP joined hands with the BJP ahead of the 2014 elections. However, Chirag is now at the logger-heads with its Bihar NDA partner, CM and JD-U leader Nitish Kumar, who the BJP has projected as the face of the alliance in the upcoming elections.At a recent meeting of the LJP’s parliamentary board, many members expressed resentment against Nitish’s leadership. Another meeting is expected later this week when a decision on the alliance may be taken.It is possible that the LJP, which has decided to draw up a list of 143 candidates to pitch against JD-U, may contest these elections outside the NDA. However, it will very much remain a part of the Central dispensation where Paswan is the Cabinet minister. Political observers believe the arrangement may actually work in the BJP’s favour.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-rift-with-jd-u-paswan-firmly-stands-by-sons-decisions-140028

12-09-2020||New Delhi||New National Education Policy curriculum for students in 2022: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said when India completes 75 years of Independence in 2022, every student should be learning as per the National Education Policy-2020. This is our collective responsibility, he said while addressing a conclave on School Education in 21st Century where he called upon teachers, administrators, voluntary organisations and parents to cooperate and participate in this mission.Noting that the marksheet had become a “pressure sheet for students and prestige sheet for families”, the PM said the new policy aimed at removing this pressure.The NEP will reduce the syllabus and make learning a fun-based and complete experience, the PM said, also allaying reservations regarding the medium of instruction, the language. He also noted that the Ministry of Education had received over 15 lakh suggestions from teachers on the NEP implementation within a week.He said the students under the new policy would learn under a curricular that is scientifically oriented to make the country ready for challenges in the 21st century. It is a curriculum that focuses on critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, curiosity and communication, the PM said, stressing on the importance of promoting new age learning and knowledge about coding, artificial intelligence, data science and robotics.While the existing system is limited, the new policy offer many opportunities to students who may want to change their subject at a later stage, he said.Limitations in the current system is the main reason for a large number of drop-outs, he added.It is as important to change the education system as changing an old blackboard or pin-up board, the PM said. Education is much more than marks and mark-sheets, he also said.The PM also said schools were free to teach any language, but the medium of education till Class V should be the mother tongue or the local language.He also gave several suggestions to participating educationists, especially on employing practical aspects in the learning process.The NEP-2020 is the first education policy of the 21st century which was announced after 34 years of the previous National Policy on Education 1986.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-national-education-policy-curriculum-for-students-in-2022-modi-140026

It’s a matter which needs to be decided,” a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said.The court is seized of a petition filed by former NLSIU Vice-Chancellor Prof R Venkata Rao and a parent of a law aspirant challenging the university’s decision to walk out of the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) and to go for a separate entrance test for admission to law courses.Prof Rao contended that the decision to go for a separate National Law Aptitude Test (NLAT) would make NLSIU an “island of exclusion” from an “island of excellence”.The Bench issued notices to NLSIU and its Vice-Chancellor Prof Sudhir Krishnaswamy asking them to respond in three days and posted the matter for further hearing on September 16.The interim order allowing NLAT-2020 was mainly due to the fact that it was scheduled to be held on Saturday and there was not much time left. However, the court said NLAT results can’t be declared and no admissions can take place during pendency of the matter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hold-separate-test-but-dont-declare-results-supreme-court-to-bengaluru-law-varsity-140030

Wang outlined China’s “stern” position on the situation at the border and called on the Indian side to “move back all men who have trespassed”. It said it was willing to hold “enhanced dialogue” at the field commander level to facilitate the process. Sources here said the Moscow meeting saw the Indian side seeking disengagement in all friction areas with the military commanders working out the final deployment to permanent posts. The Chinese side was also told that its large amassing of troops had created several flashpoints along the LAC.The Chinese embassy statement quoted Jaishankar as saying that India “does not consider the development of bilateral relations as dependent on the boundary question and India does not want to go backwards”.Sources here did not contest this Chinese assertion about Jaishankar. But they contradicted the Chinese quote about Jaishankar indirectly by stating the recent incidents in eastern Ladakh “have” impacted the development of the bilateral relationship. The sources underlined that while India recognised that a final solution would take time, peace on the border was essential for further developing bilateral ties in other spheres.Joint statement made no mention of timeline for disengagement or restoring April status quoWhile agreeing on a five-point agenda to improve the current situation on the LAC which “is not in the interest of either side”, Jaishankar and Wang said both sides would continue the dialogue at three planes — through the Special Representative mechanism, Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination and field commanders level.The ministers agreed that as the situation eases, the two sides should expedite work to conclude new confidence-building measures to maintain peace in border areas. The interaction held on the sidelines of the SCO meeting agreed not to allow differences to become disputes by abiding with all the existing agreements and protocol on China-India boundary affairs, maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas and avoid any action that could escalate matters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hours-after-5-point-plan-to-ease-lac-tensions-china-asks-india-to-pull-back-139948

12-09-2020||Hyderabad||Doctors perform India's first double lung transplant on Covid patient from Chandigarh||In a first of its kind procedure in India, doctors at the Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) here successfully performed double lung transplant surgery on a Covid-19 patient.The 32-year-old patient from Chandigarh, who received lungs from a brain-dead person in Kolkata, was discharged from the hospital on Friday.The team of doctors was led by Sandeep Attawar, considered a pioneer in heart and lung transplant surgeries in India.Rizwan alias Monu was suffering from sarcoidosis that affected his lungs significantly, leading to fibrosis of the lungs. The doctors said his condition deteriorated rapidly and double lung transplant was the only permanent option for cure.The situation worsened when the patient contracted coronavirus while awaiting for his double lung transplant. His oxygen requirement increased from 15 liters/minute to 50 liters/min for the last eight weeks."The patient was a severe case of lung sarcoidosis, and Covid-19 only complicated the precarious lung condition. Fortunately, a match to his lungs was found in a person declared brain dead in Kolkata, and the harvested lungs were airlifted to Hyderabad to save the life of the patient," said Attawar.According to him, the procedure was complex and had little scope for errors and only a timely transplant of lungs helped save the patient. "What is more important is that good outcomes are difficult to achieve as these patients are extremely sick, under nourished and bed-ridden before the transplant. Post discharge, he will need close monitoring, bio bubble environment and careful drug control for at least six weeks," he said.A veteran in the field of transplant surgeries with an experience of over 24 years, Attawar has so far performed over 12,000 heart surgeries, and over 250 transplant surgeries for lungs, heart, and artificial heart implants (LVAD).IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doctors-perform-indias-first-double-lung-transplant-on-covid-patient-from-chandigarh-139794
