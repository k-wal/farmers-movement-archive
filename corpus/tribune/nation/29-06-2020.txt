But if their visas were not cancelled, then it’s a different situation, it added.On behalf of the petitioners, senior advocate CU Singh pointed out that blacklisting note was a general order for more than 900 foreign nationals.Noting that the MHA notification said the decision had to be taken on a case-to-case basis, the Bench sought to know if such orders were passed and served on the foreigners in question.The Bench said its understanding was that in each case separate order needed to be passed for visa cancellation.Four petitions have been filed by 34 individuals, including a Thai national who is seven months pregnant, challenging the Centre’s orders of April 2 and June 4 by which over 2,500 foreign nationals, who are currently in India, were blacklisted.The Government’s decision violated the principle of natural justice by blacklisting the foreigners present in India without first granting an opportunity of being heard and resultantly depriving them of their right of locomotion and travelling back to the country of their citizenship, one of the petitioners alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tablighi-jamaat-congregation-sc-asks-mha-to-clarify-if-separate-visa-cancellation-orders-issued-for-each-case-106140

I am now worried if someone is actually using the apartment without our knowledge and you have helped us uncover the reality,” the actor wrote sarcastically.In a statement, Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) said they had verified the meter reading of Taapsee and found it to be correct.“Upon receipt of the complaint, we have verified the meter reading and found to be correct,” a spokesperson from AEML said.Replying to Taapsee’s tweet, actor Pulkit Samrat said his bill was Rs 30,000.Actor Renuka Shahane too shared her bills on Twitter, writing that she was charged Rs 5,510 for May but was billed unexpectedly higher in June by Adani Electricity.“Dear @Adani_Elec_Mum  I got a bill of Rs5,510/= on the 9th of May while in June I got a bill of Rs 29,700 combining May and June where you’ve charged me Rs 18,080 for the month of May. How did Rs 5,510/= become Rs 18,080/?”          Qureshi said she too was puzzled that her bill jumped to Rs 50,000 when it was Rs 6,000 last month.“What are these new electricity rates? @Adani_Elec_Mum Last month I paid 6k .. and this month 50K?!  What is this new price surge? Kindly enlighten us.”            Nambiar said he was frustrated with the inflated bill which he received for the current month.“I am just joining the bandwagon to vent my frustration against @Adani_Elec_Mum. Without a single new appliance being bought & barely using air conditioning - my bill for this month has tripled!” the “David” director tweeted.Quoting actor-comedian Vir Das’s tweet, where he asked if anyone else in Mumbai got an electricity bill that is triple of what they usually pay, celebrities including, Neha Dhupia, Dino Morea and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub replied they are experiencing surge in bills.Filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan said it’s “ridiculous” that despite so many complaints, Adani Electricity hadn’t issued even a “correction”.     “So many people talking about the absolutely ridiculous electricity bill inflation by @Adani_Elec_Mum! And yet no correction or apology! Meter reading can’t be an excuse for this broad daylight robbery at a time when most people don’t have sources of income! Horrible,” the “Masaan” director wrote.When contacted, a spokesperson from AEML said the team has re-started physical meter reading which was halted in March because of COVID-19.“Bills were generated on lower side being an average of preceding three months, that is December, January and February, which are winter months.“Actual consumption in the months of April, May and June is comparatively higher due to seasonal impact (summer) and increased usage (advent of Lockdown/WfH),” the statement read.AEML said the consumers will now start receiving bills based on their consumption with “appropriate tariff slab benefits”.                “The bill amount for the past period shall be accounted as per Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) guidelines,” the statement added.

29-06-2020||New Delhi||India increases surveillance in Indian Ocean region to track Chinese activities||The Navy has increased its surveillance missions and beefed up operational deployment in the Indian Ocean region in the wake of India’s seven-week bitter border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the development said.The Indian Navy is also ramping up its operational cooperation with various friendly naval forces like the US Navy and the Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force in view of the fast-evolving regional security landscape, they said.On Saturday, the Indian Navy held a crucial exercise with the Japanese Navy in the Indian Ocean region, an area where Chinese naval vessels and submarines are making frequent forays, they said.Indian Navy ships INS Rana and INS Kulish were part of the exercise while the Japan Maritime Self Defence Forces deployed its two ships, JS Kashima and JS Shimayuki, for the exercise.The exercise assumed significance as it took place amid India’s border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh and Chinese Navy's aggressive posturing in South China Sea as well as in the Indo-Pacific region.“The aim of the exercise was to enhance interoperability between the two navies,” said a source.Navies from the US, India, Australia, Japan and France have been deepening their mutual cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region in view of China’s growing attempts to expand military influence in the resource-rich region.Following an escalation in tension between India and China in eastern Ladakh after the killing of 20 Indian Army soldiers on June 15, the government put all three forces on alert.The Indian Navy was asked to raise its alert level in the Indian Ocean Region where the Chinese Navy has been making regular forays.The people cited above said the Indian Navy has increased its surveillance missions and enhanced operational deployment in the Indian Ocean region in the last couple of weeks.“We are increasing surveillance to track Chinese activities in Indian Ocean region,” said a military expert.The Galwan Valley incident on June 15 was the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La when India lost around 80 soldiers while the death toll on the Chinese side was over 300.India and Japan are part of the influential “Quad” or Quadrilateral coalition which also comprises the United States and Australia.In November 2017, the four countries gave shape to the long-pending “Quad” coalition to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.The US has been pushing for a greater role for India in the Indo-Pacific which is seen by many countries as an effort to contain China’s growing clout in the region.

The nose of an animal (the calf) was visible from a cut in the dead animal’s skin,” the BSF said.The calf was barely able to breathe, the force said.“Cattle smugglers have started adopting very cruel and ruthless methods for smuggling of cattle along this border,” the force said.The operation was conducted by the troops of the 44th battalion of the force tasked to guard the India-Bangladesh border in this region.Officials said the force has “enhanced its vigil” to check the novel methods of cattle smuggling across this border especially during the ongoing monsoon season when the rivers are in spate and smugglers use these conditions to aggressively push cattle to the Bangladesh side.A strong strategy backed by good intelligence inputs is being used all along the over 900 kilometres of this border that is guarded by the South Bengal frontier of the BSF, the force said.The total length of the India-Bangladesh border is about 4,096 km.BSF field units are “in contact” with the local police for better coordination to curb this menace along this front, a senior officer of the force said.

The tunnel is likely to be completed in the near future and commissioning of the tunnel will allow year-round traffic on the Manali-Leh axis,” adding that on account of its strategic importance, adequate arrangements for intelligence, security and maintenance of this axis round the year needed to be made in advance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eastern-ladakh-stand-off-himachal-governor-urges-defence-minister-to-increase-deployment-106116

You should treat candidates who do not appear as opt-out cases,” it said.The option for change in the examination centre should be given until last week considering the fact that an area might become a containment zone due to the COVID-19, it said.Petitioner’s counsel Alakh Alok Srivastava said there should be one examination centre per district. Out of around 3,46,000 registered aspirants, only 53,000 have taken the ‘opt-out’ option, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-icai-to-be-flexible-consider-allowing-students-to-opt-out-even-during-exams-106115
29-06-2020||New Delhi||Centre allows export of COVID-19 PPE medical coveralls||Partially relaxing export norms, the government on Monday permitted shipments of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) medical coveralls for COVID-19 with an export quota of 50 lakh units per month.The product was banned for export earlier, but has now been moved to the restricted category, under which an exporter would have to seek a licence from the government for shipments.In a notification, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) said: “A monthly quota of 50 lakh PPE medical coverall for COVID-19 units has been fixed for issuance of export licence to the eligible applicants to export PPE medical coveralls for COVID-19 as per the criteria to be separately issued in a trade notice”.All other items that are part of PPE kits remain prohibited and the monthly quota shall not be applicable on export of these items, it said.These items include medical goggles, all masks other than non-medical/non surgical (cotton, silk, wool, polyester, nylon rayon, viscose - knitted, woven or blended); nitrile gloves and face shield.These products are in huge demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal tweeted: “Boosting Make in India exports, PPE medical coveralls for COVID-19 have been allowed with a monthly export quota of 50 lakh.”DGFT has also laid out a detailed procedure and criteria for export of PPE coveralls.An exporter has to apply online through a DGFT’s system for export authorisation and there is no need to send a hard copy of the application.“Only applications for export of PPE medical coveralls for COVID-19 filed from 1st to 3rd day of each month will be considered for the quota of that month,” the directorate said adding that all approvals/allocations will be done by 10th of every month.Validity of the export licence will be for three months only.Further, it said that the firm applying should be a manufacturer of PPE coveralls and copy of testing/accreditation of the product shall be issued to the firms from the laboratories notified/recognised by the textiles ministry.“The firm shall either submit a copy of importing country’s PPE medical coveralls standards certificate obtained by it or a copy of Bureau of Indian Standards certificate obtained by it, if the importing country does not insist on a standard certificate,” it added.All the relevant documents have to be submitted along with the online application to fulfil the eligibility criteria and incomplete applications will not be considered for any allocation, it said.Earlier on June 22, the government had decided to continue exports ban only on specific PPE such as medical coveralls of all classes and goggles.For the first time, on January 31, India had banned export of all PPE including clothing and masks.Hailing the decision, Apparel Export Promotion Council of India (AEPC) Chairman A Sakthivel said the government should also allow export of N95 masks.The decision to permit export of PPE medical coveralls has opened the entire global market for domestic players who were fast enough to seize this opportunity of producing and supplying PPE kits as the world struggles to control coronavirus pandemic, Sakthivel said.The production of PPE is more than sufficient to cater to the needs of the country and allowing exports of such items will not only help the health workers across the world, but also support the revival of the apparel industry in the country, he added.The council has been requesting the government to allow these exports as the production of PPE has increased to over 8 lakh units per day.  “A single mask manufacturing machine can produce one lakh pieces per day and we have more than 200 such machines currently,” he said.The government should soon extend the export opportunity for N95 masks as well, he said, adding that the size of the global market for PPEs is more than USD 60 billion for the next five years.The chairman further said that India is in competition with countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan as they have lifted the ban on PPE exports and are receiving huge orders from large buyers in the US and Europe.

29-06-2020||New Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat: HC asks Centre, Delhi govt to respond to foreigners’ plea on alternate accommodation||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the Centre, Delhi Government and police to reply to a plea by several foreign nationals connected to Tablighi Jamaat, who participated in the religious congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz event during the COVID-19 lockdown, seeking permission to add three more places of alternate accommodation for them.A Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar issued notices to the Centre and Delhi Government and Delhi Police and asked them to take instructions on the matter.The court, which conducted the hearing through video conferencing, listed the matter for further hearing on Tuesday.The application sought modification in the court’s May 28 order by seeking to include three more places of alternate accommodation for the foreign nationals connected to Tablighi Jamaat in light of ongoing criminal proceedings.On May 28, the high court had directed that 955 foreign nationals, who had participated in the Markaz, be shifted from institutional quarantine centres, where they were kept since March 30 despite testing negative for COVID-19, to nine alternate accommodations.The plea, filed through advocates Mandakini Singh and Ashima Mandla, said that during the course of the month, 65 foreign nationals housed at Meeraj International School have faced discomfort with regard to the arrangements there.It said the community is praying for permission to immediately shift these 65 foreign nationals from Meeraj International School to Texan Public School in Moujpur here, a new accommodation suggested by them.“Apart from the Texan Public School, the community has now identified an additional 2 alternate places of accommodation, which may be used in the future, if need be, to house any of the 955 foreign nationals in question. The community once again undertakes to bear all costs for shifting accommodation and further duly notify the Respondent No.4 (Delhi Police) of the whereabouts of the foreign nationals,” it said.The high court had on May 28 disposed of two petitions filed by various foreign nationals seeking to be shifted to alternate accommodation and stating that the financial burden will be borne by the community, Tablighi Jamaat.The high court had warned that they should not shift to any other location without the permission of Delhi Police.The high court had allowed the shifting of the foreign nationals to the eight facilities—Jamiat Ulema Hind, Haj House, Zayed College, HR School, two MS Creative Schools, Meeraj International School (Couples) and Axle School—and to Hotel Smart Plaza at Mahipalpur here in respect of the Malaysian Nationals.Delhi Police had told the high court that 47 charge sheets have been filed in respect of 910 foreign nationals belonging to 35 countries.After being exposed to a large gathering in March amid the COVID-19 or coronavirus lockdown many members of Tablighi Jamaat from Markaz Hazrat Nizamuddin were taken out by the authorities and lodged in different quarantine centres in Delhi.Some of them were sent to the centres a few days later after being detained from various mosques.In April, COVID-19 cases in Delhi spiked after hundreds of many Tablighi Jamaat members, who had attended a large congregation in Nizamuddin, tested positive.The other members were directly taken to quarantine centres to contain the spread of COVID-19.

29-06-2020||New Delhi||Plasma bank to be set up in Delhi for treatment of COVID-19 patients: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced setting up of a ‘plasma bank’ for treatment of COVID-19 patients in the national capital and said it will start operating in the next two days.Addressing an online media briefing, he said the bank would be set up at the Delhi government-run Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and doctors or hospitals would have to approach it for plasma if a COVID-19 patient needed the same.The Chief Minister said the AAP government would encourage those who had recovered from COVID-19 to donate their plasma.A helpline will also be set up by for queries related to the donation of plasma.He said that his government would make transportation arrangements for those willing to donate their plasma.“The plasma bank will be first of its kind for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Perhaps, it will be the first plasma bank in the country,” he said.The need of setting up such bank was felt when people were running from pillar to post to get plasma, he said, adding that both government and private hospitals will be able to get plasma from the facility.Kejriwal, however, said that plasma therapy is not a “sanjeevani booti”.“Usually, it is difficult to save the lives of those patients who are in the last stage or with co-morbidities and on ventilator support. Those patients who are in moderate stage...this therapy is very helpful for them,” he said.In the plasma therapy, antibodies from the blood of patients, who have recovered from coronavirus, are used to treat infected patients. It is aimed at assessing the efficacy of convalescent plasma to limit complications in COVID patients.Kejriwal said that his government had so far conducted a clinical trial of plasma therapy on 29 COVID-19 patients and the result was “encouraging”.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain, who had tested positive for COVID-19, was administrated plasma therapy. He has now recovered.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that in the LNJP Hospital, plasma therapy was conducted on 35 COVID-19 patients and of them, 34 lives were saved with one death reported. Similarly, 49 patients were administrated therapy in private hospitals and 46 people recovered from the virus, he added.Requesting people to come forward and donate their plasma, he said: “In the entire life, there is a very little chance to save someone’s life and you (those recovered from COVID-19) have got this chance,” he said.Kejriwal said relatives of a COVID-19 person are free to give plasma to the patient and it is not necessary to only donate to the bank.He asserted that there was no shortage of beds in the national capital as several steps had been taken to effectively deal with the COVID-19 situation.“At present, we have 13,500 beds and of these, only 6,000 beds have been occupied so far,” he said.On Sunday, Delhi recorded 2,889 fresh COVID-19 cases, taking the tally in the city over the 83,000-mark, while the death toll from the disease mounted to 2,623.The number of containment zones in the city also jumped to 421 on Sunday from 280 after the re-mapping of such areas.

Unable to attend regular classes, she appeared in the exams as a private student.Safia fought with her family to let her appear in the exams, said her mother Amna Javed.“She was adamant on appearing in the exams and fought with us for it. We were confident she will pass. She secured 69 per cent marks,” she said.The results for Class 10 and 12 UP Board exams were declared on Saturday.Joint Director, Education, Pradeep Kumar said Safia has set an example for other students facing similar odds.He said he came to know about Safia from a social worker, who told him that the girl was adamant on appearing in the board exams but she could not do so without an oxygen cylinder due to her disease.“After I got to know about it, I directed the centre in-charge at the Government Girls’ Inter-College (Safia’s exam centre) to make arrangements for her. I am happy that she passed with good marks. It will boost the morale of all those facing similar situations. She has set an example,” he said.According to Safia’s family, a local charitable organisation has decided to honour her for her achievement.

29-06-2020||New Delhi||First batch of Rafale likely to arrive in India by July 27; to be based in Ambala||India is likely to receive the first batch of six Rafale fighter jets by July 27. The fighter jets are expected to significantly boost the combat capability of the Indian Air Force, people familiar with the development said.The IAF has been on high alert for the last two weeks in view of the escalation in tension with China following the clashes between the troops of the two countries in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh, in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The two armies are locked in a bitter standoff in the region for seven weeks.On June 2, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held a telephonic conversation with his French counterpart Florence Parly, during which she conveyed that the Rafale jets would be delivered to India as scheduled notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic in France.Military officials, on the condition of anonymity, said the arrival of the Rafale jets would significantly enhance the IAF’s overall combat capability and would send a clear message to India’s “adversaries”.When asked about the matter, the IAF did not comment.The first squadron of the aircraft will be stationed at Ambala Air Force Station, considered one of the most strategically located bases of the IAF.India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore.The aircraft is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.Meteor is the next generation of BVR air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by the MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden. Besides the missile systems, the Rafale jets will come with various India-specific modifications, including Israeli helmet-mounted displays, radar warning receivers, low-band jammers, 10-hour flight data recording, infra-red search and tracking systems among others.The IAF has already completed preparations, including readying required infrastructure and training of pilots, to welcome the fighter aircraft.The second squadron of Rafale will be stationed at Hasimara base in West Bengal. The IAF spent around Rs 400 crore to develop infrastructure like shelters, hangars and maintenance facilities at the two bases.Of the 36 Rafale jets, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater and they will have almost all the features of the fighter jets.The Congress had raised questions on the deal, including on rates of the aircraft, and alleged corruption, but the government had rejected the charges.

However, for state government employees the ratio is 15 per cent or 15 people, whichever is higher.The order stated that there will be a phase-wise opening of various services.All essential shops will continue to operate as earlier, the order said.“Non-essential shops will continue to operate as per relaxations and guidelines issued vide orders May 31 and June 4, and "are in operation as per the policy of the respective Municipal Corporation,” it said.All non-essential markets, market areas and shops except malls and market complexes will remain open from 9 am to 5 pm, the order reads.Liquor shops will continue to operate and provide home delivery wherever permitted, it said.E-commerce activity for essential as well as non- essential items and materials, including various types of home delivery services, will continue as before, it said.All industrial units which are presently open will continue to operate.Also, work at all public and private construction sites, which have already commenced, can continue to operate further, the order said.

29-06-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 a setback for education sector, govts need to address inclusion challenges: UNESCO report||The COVID-19 pandemic will have a considerable setback on learning, according to the UNESCO’s Global Education Monitoring Report, which also urges governments to rebuild education systems that are better and accessible to all.The report said that assessing the effect of school closures on COVID-19 infection rates “has been filled with uncertainty, as conclusive evidence is yet to emerge, making the issue at times quite divisive”.“Some teachers who belong to vulnerable groups are concerned that their health is at risk. Only a minority of countries can enforce strict social distancing rules in schools,” the report said.It said depending on the structure of the academic year, school closures had affected their calendars, teacher training and licensing schedules, besides examinations.“Overall, the setback on learning is expected to be considerable, although its magnitude is difficult to pin down.”The fourth edition of the annual report, which was launched recently, has pointed out that COVID-19 pandemic would impact the disadvantaged students more who had fewer resources at home, and it would increase socioeconomic gaps.“Among the low and middle-income countries, 17 per cent are planning to recruit more teachers, 22 per cent to increase class time and 68 per cent to introduce remedial classes when schools reopen. How such classes are planned and targeted will be critical to whether disadvantaged students can catch up. The COVID-19 crisis has shown that the issue is not just about technical solutions to tackle the digital divide. Although distance learning has captured many headlines, only a minority of countries have the basic infrastructure to focus on the pedagogical challenges of online approaches to teaching and learning. Most children and youth have suffered a short-term direct, but hopefully temporary, loss of learning,” it said.The Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM Report) is developed by an independent team and published by UNESCO.It has the official mandate of monitoring progress in meeting the Sustainable Development Goal on education.The report provides an in-depth analysis of key factors for the exclusion of learners in education systems worldwide, including background, identity and ability, gender, age, location, poverty, disability, ethnicity, indigeneity, language, religion, migration or displacement status, sexual orientation or gender identity expression, incarceration, beliefs and attitudes.“Concern remains about more lasting effects, likely to be brought about indirectly by the recession, which will throw millions of people back into poverty,” said the report.“Many low and middle-income countries have not been able to support learners at risk of exclusion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments need to take a close look at the inclusion challenges to rebuild education systems that are better and accessible to all learners.”According to the UNESCO estimates, over 154 crore students are severely impacted by the closure of educational institutions across the world amid the COVID-19 outbreak, owing to which girls will be the worst hit as it will lead to increased dropout rates and further entrench gender gaps in education.

Today the price of petrol in the national capital Delhi and other big cities have crossed Rs 80 a litre,” Gandhi said accusing the government of being insensitive.She said after the March 24 lockdown the government has raised the prices of petrol and diesel 22 times.LIVE: Congress President, Smt. Sonia Gandhi joins the #SpeakUpAgainstFuelHike campaign https://t.co/ihbCCrIDpR  “They have increased diesel price by Rs 11 per litre and petrol by Rs 9.12 a litre. They have provisioned for garnering lakhs of crores by hiking excise duty on petrol and diesel in the last three months. All this at a time when global crude oil prices are falling,” she said.In a video message, Gandhi said after 2014 also the government had instead of giving relief of reduced international crude oil prices to people, had raised excise duty 12 times making an additional collection of about Rs 18 lakh crore.“All this proves the government is taking people’s money to fill their coffers.“The government’s duty is to support people in tough times, and exploit their plight to profiteer. This government has set a new example of extortion from the people by way of unfair fuel price hikes. This is not just unfair but also insensitive as it directly hurting the farmers, the poor, the working class, the middle class and small businessmen,” Gandhi said the immediate rollback of hikes in prices as also of excise duty on petrol and diesel since March this year and pass on the benefits to the people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-resorting-to-extortion-with-fuel-price-hikes-sonia-106094

Their importance has been amply emphasised by the PM, she added.However, the sector faces a number of challenges due to lack of access to modern technology and equipment, training, access institutional credit, basic awareness on quality control of products and branding and marketing skills that limit their performance and growth.They contribute much less in terms of value addition and output despite its huge potential, she said.“The sector comprising nearly 25 lakh units contributes to 74% of employment in food processing sector. Nearly 66% of these units are located in rural areas and about 80% of them are family-based enterprises supporting livelihood of rural household and minimizing their migration to urban areas,” the minister said.The scheme adopts “One District One Product” (ODOP)under which states will identify food product in a particular district keeping in view the existing clusters and availability of raw material.The ODOP product can be a perishable produce-based product, a cereal-based product or a food product. The list includes mango, potato, litchi, tomato, tapioca, kinnu, bhujia, petha, papad, pickle, millet-based products, fisheries, poultry, meat as well as animal feed.Preference would be given to those producing ODOP products but units producing other products would also be supported, she said.The scheme also focuses on waste to wealth products, minor forest products and Aspirational Districts. Existing Individual micro food processing units desirous of upgradation can avail credit-linked capital subsidy at 35% of the eligible project cost with a maximum ceiling of Rs 10 lakh per unit.Seed capital at Rs 40,000 per SHG member would be provided for working capital and purchase of small tools, she added.Meanwhile, the Operation Greens Scheme has been extended from tomato, onion and potato (TOP) crops to other notified horticulture crops.The scheme provides subsidy for transportation and storage from surplus production area to major consumption centres with an objective of protecting growers from making distress sale and reducing post -harvest losses.The MoFPI is planning to start free online skill classes for SC and ST entrepreneurs, in collaboration with NIFTEM and FICSI, for providing e-learning. It has identified 41 courses and job roles like baking, making jam, pickles, for which access to digital content would be made available. Once certified, these entrepreneurs would have better employment potential, or they can start their own venture, said Harsimrat Kaur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-scheme-will-generate-investment-of-rs-35-000-crore-says-food-processing-industries-minister-106093

The western state reported over 5,000 cases for the fourth consecutive day on Monday.With 13,829 cases, Haryana is in the 9th spot in the overall tally, while the death count was 223.Plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those into a coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.According to the ICMR’s ‘Clinical Management Protocols for COVID-19’, convalescent plasma therapy, also called passive antibody therapy, may be considered for patients with moderate illness with no improvement in condition despite the use of steroids. The recipient is to be closely monitored for several hours after transfusion for any adverse events and its use should be avoided in patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency or immunoglobulin allergy.A single-day spike of 19,459 COVID-19 cases took India’s tally to 5,48,318 on Monday, while the death toll climbed to 16,475 with 380 new fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data.The country has seen a surge of 3,57,783 infections from June 1 till date.The global COVID-19 count stood at 10,154,984 while the death toll was 502,048, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. India is in the fourth position in terms of confirmed cases and in the eighth spot in the overall death tally.The number of active cases in India stands at 2,10,120, while 3,21,722 people have recovered, and one patient has migrated, according to the Health Ministry’s updated data.The gap between recoveries and active cases is 1,11,602 as of Monday, with the recovery rate now at 58.67 per cent, the ministry said, adding that a total of 12,010 COVID-19 patients have recovered since Sunday.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a total of 83,98,362 samples have been tested up to June 28, with 1,70,560 samples tested on Sunday.As cases surge, Nagaland also joined Maharashtra, West Bengal and Manipur in extending the lockdown beyond June 30. But like Manipur the curbs will be in force only till July 15.A Maharashtra government official said all critical patients will receive two doses of 200 ml convalescent plasma free of cost.“The project, titled ‘Platina’, is the largest convalescent plasma therapy-cum-trial project in the world. With it, we intend to save lives of some 500 critical COVID-19 patients. The trial will be held in 17 medical colleges under the department of medical education and drugs, and four BMC-run colleges in Mumbai,” he added.Addressing an online media briefing, Chief Minister Kejriwal said the planned plasma bank will start working in the next two days, adding the AAP government will encourage those who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate their plasma.He said the AAP government has so far conducted clinical trial of plasma therapy on 29 COVID-19 patients and the result was “encouraging”.“Haryana to start Plasma Therapy for treatment of Covid-19 patients in all its medical colleges after approval from ICMR,” said state Health Minister Anil Vij in a tweet.AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria recently said the number of people infected is not important as long as the mortality is low. “Our aim is to work towards keeping a low mortality.”As states ramp up testing, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed officers to increase COVID-19 testing facilities in the state and operate available TrueNat machines at full capacity.Use of TrueNat machines should be promoted in private hospitals, he said addressing an unlock review meeting with senior officers and ministers.“The testing capacity for COVID-19 should be increased. Available TrueNat and rapid antigen machines should be operated at full capacity for doing maximum tests in the state,” an official release said quoting the chief minister.As part of its efforts to ramp up the testing capacity, the ICMR had approved the use of TrueNat, a diagnostic machine for tuberculosis, for conducting coronavirus tests.Himachal Pradesh’s tribal district of Lahaul and Spiti, meanwhile, reported its first COVID-19 case on Monday after a 25-year-old labourer from Bihar tested positive, officials said.The sample of the labourer, who is working with the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), was taken at the Keylong regional hospital, they said.With this, the total number of COVID-19 cases in Himachal Pradesh has risen to 918.Besides Maharashtra, several states continued to record a big jump.Tamil Nadu reported nearly 4,000 fresh cases and the tally crossed 86,000 while 62 more deaths brought the toll to 1,141The COVID-19 tally in Andhra Pradesh spiralled to 13,891 as 783 fresh cases were added while 11 more deaths took the toll to 180.Telangana has also recorded big surge in cases which has crossed the 14,000 mark.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/single-day-spike-of-19-459-covid-19-cases-takes-indias-tally-to-5-48-lakh-106073

It is looting the country by increasing the price of petrol and diesel from the past 21 days. The poor and middle class people are helpless,” the video narrated.The video, shared by Rahul Gandhi, went on to urge the people to raise their voice against the hike, so that it lands on the “deaf ears of the government”.

This includes flights by the older IL-76 and AN-32 that have been part of the IAF fleet since the 1980s.The most significant aspect of the air effort perhaps is airlifting of India’s newest and most powerful tanks, the T-90, which now spearhead the Army’s strike formations, from the plains to Ladakh. Chinese deployment across the LAC, including concentrations in depth, reportedly includes a mix of light and heavy tanks, including new variants.Besides through air, heavy induction has also been taken through the Srinagar-Leh and Manali-Leh road axis.According to an IAF officer, airlifting the T-90 was possible due to the payload capacity of the C-17, which is about 77 tonnes. A  T-90 weighs about 46 tonnes, which is more than the capacity of the IL-76, which can airlift about 45 tonnes. The operating environment of high-altitude airfields like Leh further restricts the load that can be carried.The IAF has a squadron of IL-76 based in Chandigarh. In addition, another six IL-78 midair refuelling tankers based in Agra, which are same as IL-76, can also be used in the conventional transport role. The IAF’s work horses are 104 AN-32 medium lift aircraft.The Army had three regiments of the older T-72 tanks, which weigh around 40 tonnes, deployed in this sector. Many of these tanks, along with BMP-2 mechanised combat vehicles, have been airlifted to Ladakh by the IL-76 since the early 1990s. Given the weight and length of the tractor-trailer, it is not practical to negotiate the high mountain passes, hairpin bends and narrow stretches that lie on the road link from the mainland to Ladakh. Tank transporters can only be used on some road stretches within Ladakh.Barring some troops movements over the past about two decades during hotspots such as the surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LOC) in 2018 and the airstrike on Balakot in 2019 and during major face-offs with Chinese in Depsang Plains, Demchok and Doklam, the last major mobilisation of Indian forces was in 2001 following a terrorist attack on Parliament. “Since then the IAF heavy airlift capability in terms of tonnage has about doubled. While the induction of much-needed new fighter aircraft had eluded the IAF for years, the past decade has seen a quantum leap in our ability to rapidly transport men and material, be it for operations or for aid to civil authorities during calamities,” an officer remarked.In 2008, the IAF began inducting the C-130, of which 11 are now in service. With a payload of about 20 tonnes, these have given a fillip to air maintenance of forward areas from landing strips such as the strategic Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) near Siachen, which earlier relied on the AN-32. It is the upgradation of the road link to DBO, passing adjacent to the current face-off site of Galwan Valley, that is  cited as one of the reasons for the Chinese incursions in that area.Next in the IAF’s inventory were the C-17s of which 11 are in service since 2013.The vertical air lift component has also been getting a boost with the induction of the indigenous Dhruv, Russian Mi-17V5 medium lift helicopters and the US CH-47 Chinook heavy lift helicopters. The IAF has inducted about 90 Dhruvs and from 2008 onwards, procured about 150 Mi-17 in batches. Combined with the earlier versions, the Mi-17 fleet is reported to number 220.Last year, the Chinook, of which 15 have been procured, entered the IAF service. These have enhanced the all-weather, round-the-clock logistic capability, especially in the mountains, where manoeuvrability in close confines is an issue and have redefined heli-lift operations like rapid inter-valley transport of troops, airlifting artillery guns and heavy under slung loads like vehicles and construction equipment.In the winter of 2018, the IAF had demonstration its rapid airlift capability, ferrying a record 463 tonnes of load from Chandigarh to airfields and drop zones in the Ladakh region in a single wave. A fleet of 16 fixed wing aircraft, comprising C-17, Il-76 and AN-32 accomplished the task in less than six hours.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/behind-massive-build-up-at-lac-is-the-iafs-never-seen-before-airlift-capability-106054

The incident has triggered a nationwide furore, leading to the suspension of four policemen, including two sub-inspectors.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi expressed grief and regret over the incident. In an SMS sent to the party’s Shakti platform members in Tuticorin district, he said, “Let us agitate till those responsible for this (deaths) are punished.”Tamil actor Rajinikanth has conveyed his condolences to the victims’ family.

29-06-2020||BY Satya Prakash||Police disregard for civilians exposed||The custodial deaths of Jayaraj and his son Fennix Emmanuel, arrested for violation of Covid lockdown in Tuticorin by the Tamil Nadu Police, have once again exposed the brutal manner in which cops deal with unarmed civilians in India.The anger that has spilled out on the streets of Tamil Nadu is but natural. The fact that the father-son duo was arrested and bashed up for having kept their mobile store open beyond the permitted time during the lockdown only compounds the gravity of criminal behaviour on the part of the police.Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Rather it’s a part of a disturbing trend witnessed across India. The Centre told Parliament in April 2018 that during 2016-17, 1,616 people died in judicial custody while 145 people died in police custody while the figure for 2017-18 was 1,530 and 144 respectively.The brutality unleashed by the police in various states on helpless civilians, mostly migrant workers, for alleged violation of lockdown norms reflects on the mindset of the police who have least regard for citizens they are bound to protect. The police across the country registered thousands of cases against people, including migrant workers walking back home on foot along with women and children, and beat them up for alleged violation of lockdown.But for a delayed intervention by the Supreme Court, the cases would have gone on. On June 9, the top court had asked states/UTs to consider withdrawing criminal cases lodged against migrant labourers for alleged violation of lockdown and treat them in a humane manner.It’s a tragedy of Indian democracy that even after 73 years of Independence, police continue with a colonial mindset and treat citizens as lesser mortals who can be pushed around, bashed up, tortured and even killed. There must be a fair probe into the matter and those found guilty be given exemplary punishment.At the macro level, the nature of relationship between the State and the people in general must change to reflect the transition from colonial rule to a representative democracy which guarantees a set of fundamental rights to its citizens. The usual excuses that police are underpaid, overburdened, ill-trained and ill-equipped won’t work anymore. It’s time to act to avoid a US-type ‘defund the police’ movement in India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-disregard-for-civilians-exposed-105976

India’s aim is a self-reliant India. India’s tradition is trust and friendship. India’s spirit is brotherhood. We shall keep moving ahead abiding by these principles. — Narendra Modi, PMThe Prime Minister made the statement during his radio broadcast ‘Mann ki Baat’, referring to the recent incidents and clash along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. Modi said: “Those who cast an evil eye on Indian soil in Ladakh have got a befitting response. India honours the spirit of friendship… she is also capable of giving an appropriate response to any adversary, without shying away.”In unlock phase, focus on health & economyThe country will have to focus on defeating coronavirus and bolstering the economy as it exits from the lockdown and enters the “unlock” phase, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday underscoring the need to keep guard against the deadly virus.He praised the sacrifice of the Indian Army, saying that “the entire country comes together in paying tributes to the bravery of our jawans who attained martyrdom in Ladakh”. Every Indian painfully regrets the loss, he added. India, Modi said, had solemnly resolved to safeguard her honour and sovereignty. “India’s aim is a self-reliant India. India’s tradition is trust and friendship. India’s spirit is brotherhood. We shall keep moving ahead abiding by these principles,” he said in what is being seen as a message to China.PM Modi has been under constant attack by the Congress over the faceoff with China. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly accused him of surrendering Indian territory to the Chinese — an allegation that came up after the Prime Minister, at an all-party meeting earlier this month, said China had not captured any Indian territory or crossed the border.Speaking about Covid, the Prime Minister said just 6-7 months ago “neither did we know the catastrophe that corona was nor had we expected the fight to go this long”.He said the country would have to focus on defeating coronavirus and bolstering the economy as it exited from the lockdown and entered the “unlock” phase.Power equipment from China under scannerNew Delhi: Tightening import norms, India will check all power equipment bought from China for malware and Trojan horses that can be potentially used to trigger electricity grid failures to cripple economic activity in the country, Power Minister RK Singh said. He said, “Power is a very sensitive and strategic sector for any country....so we have to guard it against any sabotage by countries which are adversaries or possible adversaries.” More tariff barriers and rigorous testing of foreign equipment for imports from adversary countries are some of the focus areas, he said.

The death toll reached 16,095.The number of recoveries is 3,09,712, as against 2,03,051 active cases. Government experts attribute the rise in daily cases to enhanced testing. Daily test count crossed 2.3 lakh samples today as against total national capacity of three lakh samples.Over the past 24 hours, the country added 19,906 new cases of Covid infection and saw 13,832 recoveries. The disease graph will not decline until the number of recoveries per day outstrips the number of newly infected, experts say.The government is, therefore, shifting to rapid and active testing and isolation to ensure that symptomatic people are tested and managed. States, including Delhi, have launched house-to-house surveys to find symptomatic persons and manage them. Total testing labs in India are 1,036 with 749 in the government sector and the rest in private.India has added over one lakh cases in just a week's time having reached the first mark of one lakh cases after 109 days.The revision in the Covid-19 clinical management protocol, meanwhile, with the latest addition of dexamethasone steroid, is also aimed at improving disease management.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/daily-spike-in-covid-cases-nears-20-000-count-5-28l-105965

These questions were part of a unique forum on mental health the IIM-Ranchi organised for its students today.The institute claims to be the first to lead a discussion on decoding depression in the aftermath of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide which has seen at least five youngsters ending their lives. Rajput’s death has suddenly brought the focus back on mental health.Answering student queries was Ashish Pakhre, a leading psychiatrist from the AIIMS, New Delhi. He said depression was neither in the head nor was it something one needed to feel guilty about.“Depression is a genuine mental health condition and not a sign of weakness. It has a range of causes — neurobiological, poor psycho-social support, weak interpersonal relations and personality issues that can make coping with situations challenging for some people,” Pakhre said.Most students, faced with twin stresses of Covid and uncertain academic and professional futures, asked if sadness equaled depression and when did the alarm bells start ringing.“Sadness and anxiety are normal human reactions but when these reactions become too overwhelming to handle, that’s when you should seek help. Depression manifests in changed behavioural patterns like loss of sleep, loss of appetite, undue anger and poor social connect. When these behavioural patterns last long enough beyond two weeks or so and start to cause functional impairment, social and occupational dysfunction, that’s a sign of depression,” explained Pakhre.The specialist said most people would have the mechanisms to cope with life situations. “Some, who do not have the coping skills, should remember that depression is a clinical condition,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stress-is-a-health-issue-not-weakness-iim-students-told-105978
