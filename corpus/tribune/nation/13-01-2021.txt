13-01-2021||New Delhi||North shivers as Srinagar records lowest temperature in 8 years; no relief for few more days||There was no let-up in the intense cold conditions in the north and northwestern parts of the country on Wednesday as Srinagar recorded its lowest temperature in eight years, while some places reported traffic disruptions as fog reduced visibility.A cold wave gripped the national capital too as frosty winds from the snow-clad western Himalayas brought the minimum temperature down to 3.2 degrees Celsius. A dense fog blanketed some parts of the city, lowering visibility to 50 metres and affecting traffic movement.The IMD said the lowest minimum temperature of 0.2 degrees Celsius was reported at Ganganagar (west Rajasthan) over the plains of the country.Due to the prevalence of dry north/northwesterly winds, minimum temperatures are very likely to remain below normal over most parts of Northwest India during next 3-4 days, said the IMD."Cold day/severe cold day conditions very likely to continue in many pockets over Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi and in some pockets of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand during next three days," it said.Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are also likely in many pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi and Uttar Pradesh; in some pockets of east Rajasthan and in isolated pockets over west Rajasthan during next 3-4 days, the IMD added.Meanwhile, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall and moderate thunderstorm and lightning is very likely over south Tamil Nadu, south Kerala and Lakshadweep during the next 24 hours, the IMD said in its 8 pm bulletin.It said extremely heavy rainfall was observed at isolated places over Tamil Nadu on Wednesday."Today, cold day conditions at a few places with severe cold day conditions at isolated places (were) observed over Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi and east Uttar Pradesh; cold day to severe cold day conditions at isolated places over west Uttar Pradesh and cold day conditions in isolated places over Punjab," said the IMD.Himachal Pradesh's Keylong and Kalpa shivered at subzero temperatures, while state capital Shimla registered a low of 5.7 degrees Celsius, said the Meteorological Department.Lahaul and Spiti's administrative centre Keylong continued to be the coldest place in the state at minus 11.4 degrees Celsius, said Shimla MeT centre director Manmohan Singh.Kalpa recorded a low of minus 2.6 degrees Celsius, he added.In Uttar Pradesh, cold wave conditions prevailed at isolated places as Churk recorded the lowest temperature of 3.2 degrees Celsius.Dense to very dense fog occurred at isolated places over the state.Intense cold conditions prevailed in parts of Rajasthan too, where Ganganagar was recorded as the coldest place at 0.2 degree Celsius.The Kashmir valley reeled under severe cold too, with Srinagar city – the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir – recording its lowest minimum temperature in eight years, the Meteorological Department said here on Wednesday.Srinagar recorded a low of minus 7.8 degrees Celsius, which was the lowest temperature recorded in the city in eight years, said a MeT official.He said the exact same minimum temperature was recorded in the city in 2012 on January 14.The rest of the Valley was also reeling under intense cold.Biting cold conditions prevailed in most parts of Punjab and Haryana also with Narnaul being the coldest place in both the states at 1.4 degrees Celsius. Narnaul in Haryana recorded a low of three notches below the normal.Hisar was the another place where the mercury settled below the 2 degrees Celsius-mark. It registered a minimum temperature of 1.7 degrees Celsius, five notches below the normal.Among other places in the state, Ambala, Karnal and Rohtak experienced cold conditions at 7.8, 6.5 and 5 degrees Celsius, respectively, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) here.Bhiwani and Sirsa reeled under cold conditions at 2.8 and 3.4 degrees Celsius, respectively.Chandigarh, the joint capital of both states, recorded a low of 5.7 degrees Celsius.

13-01-2021||Lucknow||Mandate of 30 days’ notice under Special Marriage Act optional: Allahabad HC||In a judgment that is likely to bring relief to inter faith couples, the Allahabad High Court on Wednesday declared as optional the mandatory publication of notice of intended marriages under the Special Marriage Act, saying it violated the Right To Privacy.Making such publication mandatory would invade in the fundamental rights of liberty and privacy, the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court said.It would also affect the couple’s freedom to choose marriage “without interference from state and non-state actors”, Justice Vivek Chaudhary said.He said it shall be optional for the parties to the intended marriage to make a request in writing to the marriage officer to publish or not to publish such a notice.If the couple did not intend so, the marriage officer has to solemnise their marriage forthwith without publication of 30 days notice, the court said.A section of the Special Marriage Act, 1954, requires an inter-faith couple to give written notice of the marriage to the district marriage officer.The court was considering a habeas corpus petition alleging that an adult girl is being detained against her wishes to marry her lover who belongs to a different religion.The judgment comes against the backdrop of a recent controversial law enacted by the Uttar Pradesh government which prohibits forcible conversion for the sake of marriage.           The Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, prohibits conversion of religion by marriage to be unlawful. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mandate-of-30-days-notice-under-special-marriage-act-optional-allahabad-hc-197966

13-01-2021||New Delhi||Vaccine drive accelerates, doses reach far corners of India||India’s drive against COVID-19 gathered momentum on Wednesday with planes carrying vaccines flying into airports across the country from where the precious cargo was dispatched to small cities and towns in readiness for the inoculation exercise beginning January 16.From Assam to Goa and from Jammu and Kashmir to Kerala, the vaccines were carefully and swiftly transported to far corners of the country, a day after the first consignment of the Covishield vaccine from the Oxford/AstraZeneca stable rolled out of the Serum Institute of India manufacturing facility in Pune.According to sources, 95 per cent of the 1.1 crore doses of Covishield vaccine purchased by the government have been delivered and shipped to nearly 60 consignee points across India in two days.Of the 55 lakh doses of indigenously developed Covaxin of Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech ordered by the Centre, the first tranche of 2.4 lakh doses have been dispatched to 12 states.Covaxin has been sent to 12 sites, one each in Ganavaram, Guwahati, Patna, Delhi, Kurukshetra, Bengaluru, Pune, Bhubaneswar, Jaipur, Chennai, Lucknow and Hyderabad, according to official sources.The vaccines have been allocated to all states and UTs in proportion to their healthcare workers database, the Health Ministry said.The Mumbai airport authorities said it has facilitated the delivery of about 2,72,400 doses of the Covishield vaccine to 22 domestic destinations on Wednesday, starting with low-cost carrier GoAir’s first flight to Goa with  23,500 doses of Covishield vaccine.These shipments were carried out by SpiceJet, IndiGo, GoAir and Vistara to Bagdogra, Rajkot, Ranchi, Imphal, Agartala, Cochin, Bhopal, Kanpur, Jammu, Srinagar, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Gorakhpur, Raipur, Dehradun, Varanasi, Indore, Trivandrum and Jabalpur, it said.On Tuesday, consignments were sent from Pune to 13 cities including Delhi.As the vials began reaching their destinations, in readiness for the pan-India vaccination drive that will be launched on Saturday, states firmed up their plans and fine-tuned logistical details.In Delhi, where the drive will begin in 89 centres, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said his AAP government will provide the vaccine free if the Centre fails to do so.He said he has already appealed to the Centre as there are many people in the country who can’t afford the life-saving jab.In accordance with the national priority list, the vaccine will be first given to healthcare and frontline workers. While Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand and Union territories of Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir were among those to receive the first consignment of the vaccines on Wednesday, others like Maharashtra and West Bengal started their transportation to various districts.A special vehicle carrying COVID-19 vaccines was held up and had to take a five-kilometer detour in West Bengal’s Purba Bardhaman district after the national highway was blocked by protesters led by state minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury who were agitating against the new farm laws, sources said.The van, piloted by the West Bengal Police, was on its way to Bankura and Purulia to deliver the vaccines when it was stranded despite a ‘green corridor’ being arranged for its swift movement, they said.Chowdhury, who is the state library services minister, said he was not aware of the movement of the vaccine van and cleared the road once it was brought to his notice, but by that time the vehicle had been already diverted.The first consignment of about 94,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine reached the Madhya Pradesh capital on a scheduled flight from Mumbai, a state government official said.From the airport, insulated vans of the health department transported the boxes—that signal India entering a decisive phase in its fight against the pandemic—to the State Vaccine Centre where Medical Education Minister Visvas Sarang inspected the arrangements. The doses will be dispatched to eight districts from Bhopal.Kerala, too, received its first Covishield vaccine consignment on Wednesday morning on a Go Air flight that landed at Kochi. Another flight was expected to land in Thiruvananthapuram later in the day.Sources in the National Health Mission sources said of the 4.33 lakh doses of the vaccine, 1,100 will be sent to Mahe, an enclave of Puducherry.The vaccine will be stored in the regional vaccine centres at Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode from where it will be distributed to 133 centres.So far, 3,62,870 people have registered themselves for a shot.Giving details of the vaccination plans for Maharashtra, Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the state had already received 9.83 lakh doses of the total requirement of 17.5 lakh for the first phase.Of these, 9.63 vials were from SII and 20,000 from Bharat Biotech, the state minister told reporters.“We have to give the doses twice to a person in a gap of four weeks, hence 55 percent of the around eight lakh registered health workers will undergo vaccination as of now,” he said.The Centre, he said, has asked the state to reduce the number of inoculation centres from 511 to 350, saying the government should focus on other emergencies as well.Each vaccination session will cater to a maximum of 100 beneficiaries per day and the Union Health ministry said it has advised the states not to organise “unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day”.“States have been advised to organise vaccination sessions taking into account 10 percent reserve/wastage doses and an average of 100 vaccinations per session each day.“Therefore, any undue haste on the part of states to organise unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day is not advised,” the Union Ministry said.It also said that states and UTs have also been advised to increase the number of vaccination session sites that would be operational every day in a progressive manner as the vaccination process stabilises and moves forward.The country’s financial capital, Mumbai, which will have 72 centres, received over 1.39 lakh Covishield vaccine doses, said civic body Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.Health department staffers of the BMC brought the vaccines from neighbouring Pune under police security, it said. The civic body has created a centralised cold storage facility for vaccines in Kanjurmarg.The towns of Aurangabad and Thane in the state got their share of the first doses too.Goa Health Services Director Jose D’Sa told PTI that two boxes comprising 23,500 doses of the Covishield vaccine were received in the morning.Around 18,000 health workers in the coastal state will be covered during the initial phase, another health official said.The northeast state of Assam received its second consignment of COVID-19 vaccines when a cargo flight of a private airline carried 12,000 doses of Covaxin weighing around 78.5 kg,  from Hyderabad to Guwahati.“The consignment was shipped by Bharat Biotech and handed over to state government officials within six minutes of its arrival,” said an Airports Authority of India spokesperson.The first batch of 2.40 lakh vials of COVID-19 vaccine for Assam and Meghalaya had landed on Tuesday.Guwahati’s LGBI Airport has been marked as the nodal point of distribution of vaccines for the northeast.Assam and Tripura welcomed their first lot of Covishield doses.“The vaccine containers were transported to a National Health Mission (NHM) storage facility at Gorkhabasti area,” State Immunization Officer Kallol Roy told reporters in Agartala.SpiceJet said it had transported 3.5 tonnes of COVID-19 vaccines on Wednesday from Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad to 11 cities.GoAir said it was airlifting a total of 69,600 vials of the vaccine.The Mumbai airport said that the standard operating procedures (SOPs) implemented by it in anticipation of the vaccine distribution saw the terminal register a cargo processing time of just seven minutes, right from goods acceptance to dispatch at the ramp, it added.Besides, the airport has deployed a dedicated COVID-19 task force to reduce dwell time and facilitate advanced planning and collaboration between the airport and all stakeholders in this process, it said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccine-drive-accelerates-doses-reach-far-corners-of-india-197961

13-01-2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Three lions rescued near Rajkot city; transported to Gir||A pride of three Asiatic lions that had strayed out of its natural habitat at Gujarat’s Gir forest and reached near Rajkot city, was rescued and relocated on Wednesday, an official from the forest department said.The three lions had travelled more than 100 km from Gir forest to reach Rajkot taluka and had been camping in the surrounding areas over the last one month, said Dushyant Vasavada, chief conservator of forests (Wildlife), Junagadh.The animals were rescued by a forest team and shifted to Gir, where they will be released in the wild soon, the official said.During their stint in Rajkot for over a month, the lions were spotted in different villages close to human settlements, some not very far from the city, causing panic, he said.The pride reached very close to Rajkot city and was recently spotted near Aji Dam on the outskirts, he said.According to local forest officials, the lions were first spotted in villages of Jasdan taluka in the district and were also seen in villages of Rajkot taluka, where they preyed upon cattle.A rescue team with the experience of handling lions was called in from Gir and the lions were captured in separate cages on Wednesday morning and taken to the forest, Vasavada said.One of the lions had a radio collar on, which helped the forest department to keep an eye on the pride, he said.As per the latest census conducted last year, Gujarat has witnessed a 29 per cent rise in the population of Asiatic lions.The “Poonam Avlokan (full-moon night estimation exercise)” carried out in June last year showed that the Asiatic lion population reached 674. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-three-lions-rescued-near-rajkot-city-transported-to-gir-197954
13-01-2021||Kolkata||TMC advises Left, Congress to back Mamata; Congress says merge with us||The Trinamool Congress on Wednesday said the Congress and the Left Front should rally behind Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in her fight against the "communal and divisive" Bharatiya Janata Party, a suggestion the two parties rejected outright.The Congress proposed that the TMC should merge with it instead to put up a united fight against the BJP.The BJP, which has emerged as a potent force in the state, said the TMC's suggestion amounted to an admission that it was not in a position to take on the saffron party on its own in the assembly polls in West Bengal due in April-May."If the Left Front and the Congress are genuinely anti-BJP, they should rally behind Mamata Banerjee in her fight against the communal and divisive politics of the saffron party," senior TMC MP Sougata Roy told reporters.TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee is the "real face of secular politics against the BJP", he said.Reacting to the TMC's proposal, state Congress chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury blamed the West Bengal's ruling party for the growth of the BJP in the state."We are not interested in aligning with the TMC. Why is the TMC now interested in an alliance with us after poaching our MLAs over the last 10 years. If Mamata Banerjee is keen on fighting the BJP, then she should join the Congress as it is the only pan-India platform to fight against communalism," he said.Banerjee had floated the Trinamool Congress in 1998 after breaking away from the Congress.Senior CPI-M leader Sujan Chakraborty wondered why the TMC was trying to woo the Left parties and the Congress after branding them as "negligible" political force in the state. He also said the BJP was trying to woo Left voters."This only reflects that we are still a force to reckon with. The Left and Congress will defeat both the TMC and the BJP in the assembly elections," he said.Reacting to the development, state BJP president and Lok Sabha MP Dilip Ghosh said it reflected the TMC's "desperation"."They (the TMC) can't fight us alone, and so they are seeking the help of other parties. It also proves that the BJP is the only alternative to TMC," he said.The Left and the Congress have come together to contest the assembly polls after the drubbing they got in the last Lok Sabha elections. The CPI-M-led Left Front had drawn a blank in the LS polls, while the Congress managed to win just two of the state's 42 seats.The BJP, on the other hand, clinched 18 seats, just four less than TMC's 22.In the 2016 assembly polls, which the Left and Congress contested together, the combine had won 76 of the state's 294 seats, while the TMC bagged 211. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-advises-left-congress-to-back-mamata-congress-says-merge-with-us-197952
13-01-2021||New Delhi||Govt misleading country, Supreme Court on farms laws: Congress||The Congress on Wednesday accused the government of misleading the country and the Supreme Court by claiming that pre-legislative consultations were held prior to the passage of the three farm laws and claimed this amounted to contempt of court.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi at a press conference alleged that the government changed its stand from “having no information” on pre-legislative consultations to suddenly claiming the laws were a result of two decades of deliberations.He said while the government has now claimed two-decades of consultations, in response to an RTI on the issue on December 22, 2020, it was stated that “this CPIO does not hold any record in this matter”.“This is a serious example of the Central government misleading the apex court and misrepresenting the people of India. The passage of legislations is an act of deception and defrauding,” he alleged.“It is thus clear that there are serious attempts at prevarication, distortion, misrepresentation and misleading the nation, the apex court and all relevant stakeholders, apart from indulging in blatantly contumacious conduct. Not even perfunctory, much less any meaningful pre legislative consultation was attempted, much less done by the Modi government,” he also alleged.Singhvi said the government has stated in its affidavit in the Supreme Court that the laws were made after 20 long years of deliberations with the states, whereas there were no consultations and the laws “were rammed through in Parliament”.The Centre said it is filing this affidavit “to remove deliberate wrong perception created by non-farmer elements present at the protest site and using media and social media and to apprise this Court with true facts”.As part of the consultation process, the Centre cited in its affidavit the Guru Committee in 2000, the Model Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act in 2003, the Empowered Committee of some state ministers in 2013, the Working Group on agricultural production in 2010 and another Model law in 2017.“However, these evil laws were rammed down the throat of Parliament and all discussion, analysis and interaction was guillotined in the temple of democracy,” Singhvi alleged.He said it is thus clear that the government has attempted to “fool” all the people of India all the time by practising “falsehoods on stilts” and it has not even spared the court.“Can discussions held 20 years ago by some committee qualify as pre legislative consultation for laws passed in 2020,” he asked.“Aware of their legislative incompetence in the matter, past governments have sufficed to draft model laws leaving the choice to states. These model laws are way different from the black farm laws rammed down Parliament’s throat last September,” Singhvi said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-misleading-country-supreme-court-on-farms-laws-congress-197946
13-01-2021||New Delhi||Sale of poultry products banned in Delhi; bird flu cases reported in Uttar Pradesh||Fresh bird deaths and avian influenza cases were reported in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday, while in neighbouring Delhi, civic bodies banned the sale of poultry products, even as the city government asked people not to panic and eat completely cooked eggs and chicken.Unusual mortality among birds has also been reported in some districts of Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir, as per a statement of the Union fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying ministry, which has asked state governments not to ban supply of poultry products.However, bird flu outbreak has been confirmed only in Delhi, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat till now, according to the ministry.“Further, cases of unnatural mortality of birds have been reported in Ganderbal district of Jammu and Kashmir and four districts of Jharkhand,” it said.On banning of poultry products, the ministry said it has been found that many states are banning supply of poultry and poultry products from other states. This will add to the negative impact on the poultry industry and hence, states are requested to reconsider such decision, it said.In the national capital, the ban on sale, storage of poultry or processed chicken meat by shops and restaurants has been imposed by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).Earlier, the Delhi government had imposed a ban on sale of processed and packaged chicken brought from outside the city, after bird flu cases were confirmed in the national capital on Monday.The civic bodies through their veterinary services departments have also said that said owners of restaurants and hotels will face action if egg-based dishes or poultry meat and other products are served to customers.In the past one week, Delhi has reported several bird deaths, including those of ducks at the Sanjay Lake and crows at city parks. Reports of over 50 bird deaths were also received on a helpline of the Delhi government’s animal husbandry unit on Tuesday.The Delhi Health Department in its advisory in view of bird flu cases, asked people not to panic and follow a set of dos and don’ts, including not consuming half-cooked chicken, half-boiled or half-fried eggs.“H5N8 is highly pathogenic in birds but the pathogenicity in humans as well as the likelihood of human infection with avian influenza (AH5N8) virus is low,” the advisory issued by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) of Delhi stated.It said avoid contact and prevent exposure from sick-looking sluggish chicken.“Eat only completely cooked eggs and poultry products cooked at 70 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. Do not consume half-cooked chicken or bird or half-boiled and half-fried eggs,” the advisory said.Do not keep raw poultry meat near cooked meat. Wash hands frequently at the time of handling raw poultry products. Take due care of personal hygiene and maintain cleanliness in surrounding, it cautioned.In Uttar Pradesh, bird deaths were reported from Jalaun district and avian flu cases from Kanpur.Samples taken from two dead crows in Kanpur have tested positive for bird flu and with these, the number of confirmed cases of the influenza has increased to four in the city, forest officials said.In Jalaun, five birds, mostly crows, were found dead and their samples have been sent for testing, while in Fatehpur district two peacock carcasses were found in a forest. However, officials ruled out bird flu as the cause of death of the peacocks.Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Rajendra Kumar Sharma said as per the postmortem report, the birds died due to cold.In the wake of the bird flu scare in Maharashtra, Thane Collector Rajesh Narvekar has instructed the forest department to pay special attention to wetland areas for migration of birds in the district.Seven rapid response teams have been deployed in the district and a control room has been activated to monitor the bird flu situation, he said during a review meeting with senior officials.

13-01-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||India, Taiwan to ink labour mobility pact||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 13India and Taiwan are negotiating a labour mobility pact that will institutionalise the movement of professionals from here to Taipei, said sources.With falling demographics like its East Asian peers Japan and South Korea – Taiwan last year recorded more deaths than births – India senses an opportunity to make the island nation a destination for its skilled workers.“We are looking at every sector,” said a source.Taiwan currently employs about 7 lakh foreign workers and feels the need for more. There are 10,000 Indians living in Taiwan, the biggest group being of students.There are also several rich Indians based in Taiwan with business in gems and jewellery but the labour mobility pact would ensure many more could become expatriates in a country that by law prohibits different wage scales for local and foreign workers.With a minimum pay of $ 24,000 annually, Taiwan is an attractive destination for Indian workers, said the sources.Currently, most of the foreign workers from Taiwan are from Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.Thailand, which began sending workers to Taiwan 20 years back, and Vietnam have an advantage because of their huge ethnic Chinese community. As a result there are no language barriers.As many as 2.5 lakh Vietnamese work in Taiwan. Thais numbers though are falling as Bangkok is experiencing labour shortage.The idea of a labour mobility pact began making the rounds of South Block three years back. But the Wuhan and Chennai informal summits between Chinese President Xi Jinping and PM Narendra Modi put it on the backburner. After the Galwan Valley clash, the die has been cast for a prolonged chill in Sino-Indian ties, giving the idea a second life.But the mobility of Indian workers to Taiwan could run aground on the language issue as there are few Mandarin speakers here. A labour mobility pact with Japan has had a sluggish start because of this issue.Sources said India would have to move fast on a labour mobility pact because Taiwan has already signed one with Malaysia but has not activated it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-taiwan-to-ink-labour-mobility-pact-197942

13-01-2021||New Delhi||SC order, farmers’ reaction exposes trust deficit, limitation of judiciary’s role: Agriculture expert||The Supreme Court’s order on the formation of a committee and farmers’ reaction to it has “not only exposed trust deficit between the government and farmers but also limitation of judiciary’s role in arbitration,” say some agriculture experts. The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the implementation of the three contentious farm laws and set up a four-member committee to hear various stakeholders’ views. While farmer’ unions and ‘jathebandis’ rejected the order, the ruling BJP said it will abide by the ruling.While BJP leaders say that people need to understand that “law making will be done by the Parliament and not the people on the street”, Prof Sudhir Panwar, an agriculture expert, says after months-long stand-off between the two sides the SC was expected to resolve the issue by deciding on the Constitutionality of the three laws.“The issue was whether the laws are Constitutional or not. After both sides exhausted all options and when the Government failed to resolve the crisis, the Supreme Court came forward in the role of arbitrator through formation of a committee.”“However, the decision of farmers to continue the agitation is indicative of deficit of trust between farmers and the Government on one side and farmers and the proposed committee on another side. Things are exactly where they were when the agitation started while farmers are still on Delhi’ borders,” says Panwar.While the popular perception is that the verdict has “given the Narendra Modi government elbow room out of a difficult situation”, apparently the government also believes “what it has not been able to convey to the people, the unyielding stance adopted by the unions will now do that”. So far as the BJP is concerned party spokesperson Sudesh Verma says the government did not want the laws to be put on the hold but the highest authority in the country, the Supreme Court, wanted time to decide and everyone needs to respect that. “The SC has taken a humanitarian point of view. The government did not want laws to be put on the hold, because many traders have signed contracts with farmers. We will abide by the SC’ order, however, the larger issue people need to understand is law making will be done by the Parliament and not the people on the street,” Verma added. Regarding objections on names in the committee, party leader RP Singh said they have not been recommended by the BJP or the government. “The names have been decided by the SC. It is clear those sitting on the agitation do not want to change the laws, they just want to show the government in poor light,” he says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-order-farmers-reaction-exposes-trust-deficit-limitation-of-judiciarys-role-agriculture-expert-197939
13-01-2021||New Delhi||SC seeks Meghalaya’s reply on plea of journalist for quashing of FIR||The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought response from Meghalaya government on a plea of veteran journalist Patricia Mukhim against the High Court order refusing to quash an FIR for her Facebook post which allegedly incited communal tension between the tribal and the non-tribal communities in the state last year.A Bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Indu Malhotra and Vineet Saran issued notice to the state government and sought its response by February 5.It also permitted advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the scribe, to serve the copy of the petition to advocate on record for the state government. Mukhim in her plea said that she has been facing persecution for speaking the truth and seeking enforcement of rule of law against perpetrators of hate crime. She has said in her plea that a plain reading of her Facebook post would make the intent clear that the purpose of the post is to appeal for impartial enforcement of rule of law and equal treatment before the law of all citizens. On November 10, last year, the Meghalaya High Court had refused to quash a police complaint against Mukhim for her Facebook post. While disposing the plea of Mukhim, a Padma Shri awardee and the editor of The Shillong Times newspaper, the high court had said that the investigation agency should be given a free hand to probe into the matter. “In the event, the investigating agency is required to be given a free hand to investigate the matter and to come to its own conclusion in due process of law.“Consequently, I find no merit in the instant petition for exercising powers under Section 482 CrPC. This petition is accordingly hereby rejected,” the high court had said.Mukhim had hit out at the Lawsohtun village “dorbar” (council) on Facebook for failing to identify the “murderous elements” after five boys were attacked at a basketball court in July, last year. Eleven people were picked up and two were arrested in the case. “There is an attempt to make a comparison between tribals and non-tribals vis—vis their rights and security and the alleged tipping of the balance in favour of one community over the other.“This in the opinion of this Court would fall on the mischief of Section 153 A (a) IPC as it apparently seeks to promote disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between two communities,” the high court had said. The FIR was lodged on a complaint filed against Mukhim by the village council on July 6, last year, for her post on the social media, alleging that her statement incited communal tension and might instigate communal conflict. She was subsequently booked under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc. and other provisions of the IPC). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-meghalayas-reply-on-plea-of-journalist-for-quashing-of-fir-197938
13-01-2021||New Delhi||CBI registers bank fraud case of over Rs 200 crore against Steel Hypermart India Private Pvt Ltd||The CBI has registered a bank fraud case of over Rs 200 crore against Bengaluru-based Steel Hypermart India Private Limited and its directors for losses incurred by a consortium of banks led by the Indian Bank, officials said on Wednesday.                     The agency on Wednesday carried out searches in Bangalore and Shoolagiri, Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu at the premises of the company and accused persons, CBI spokesperson RC Joshi said.Besides the company, the CBI has named its directors Mahendra Kumar Singhi and Suman Mahendra Kumar Singhi, and chartered accountant Mukesh Surana in its FIR registered based on a complaint from the Indian Bank, the officials said.The bank, in its complaint, alleged that the company had availed credit facilities from the consortium of e-Vijaya Bank and Indian Bank between 2017 and 2019.The account was declared a non-performing asset in April 2019 and subsequently tagged as fraud in November that year, Joshi said.The fraud resulted in the loss of Rs 168.39 crores to Indian Bank and Rs 31.99 crore to e-Vijaya Bank (now Bank of Baroda).“It was further alleged that the borrower company in order to avail higher working capital limits from the banks, had inflated its turnover, made purchase transactions with the related/sister concerns, inflation of receivables, diversion of fund within the related/sister concerns, submitted false/fudged accounts/statements, etc. and siphoned off the banks funds, thereby causing loss to the said banks,” Joshi said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-registers-bank-fraud-case-of-over-rs-200-crore-against-steel-hypermart-india-private-pvt-ltd-197936
13-01-2021||London||Vijay Mallya denied permission to appeal in UK bankruptcy case||Liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya was on Wednesday denied permission to appeal against a UK High Court order refusing to dismiss bankruptcy proceedings brought by a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI), in their pursuit of debt related to his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.The 65-year-old businessman, who remains on bail in the UK, had filed a renewed application to appeal against UK court orders in the case from last year, which had allowed for an adjournment of bankruptcy proceedings until the debt issue before the Supreme Court in India was decided upon.His counsel, Philip Marshall, argued that the banks’ bankruptcy petition should be dismissed rather than just adjourned as the debt in question was disputed and being deliberated upon in the Indian courts.“While this was a new point [before the appellate court], I do not accept it as a reasonable ground for appeal as the matter can be dealt with during proceedings that are still continuing,” said Justice Colin Birss, during a remote hearing of the Chancery Appeals Division of the High Court in London.Mallya’s barrister also raised the issue of “abuse of process” by the banks in their alleged non-disclosure of securities held in India and the existence of third-party security in the form of assets related to United Breweries Holdings.The judge reiterated that he had dismissed both these as sufficient grounds of appeal in a ruling he handed down “on paper” in December last year.“There is no prospect of success of an appeal based on this ground, although this does not preclude reliance on it [third-party security] later,” the judge ruled.The hearing forms part of a series being heard by the High Court since the SBI-led consortium of 13 Indian banks had initiated the proceedings against Mallya in December 2018 as part of their efforts to recoup around 1.145 billion pounds in unpaid loans.Both sides have deposed retired Indian Supreme Court justices as expert witnesses on Indian law in support of their arguments for and against a bankruptcy order against Mallya in the UK.While the banks argue a right to waive their security over the Indian assets involved in the case in order to recover their debt in the UK, lawyers for Mallya argue that the funds in question involved public money held by state-owned banks in India which precluded them from such a security waiver.The next hearing to conclude closing submissions in the case is scheduled to be heard at a yet-to-be-agreed date in the coming weeks.In parallel, Mallya’s lawyers have also been applying to the court in order for him to meet his considerable and mounting legal costs from monies held with the Court Funds Office (CFO) as part of the bankruptcy proceedings.In the last hearing related to costs on Monday, Judge Sebastian Prentis at the Insolvency and Companies Court (ICC) division of the High Court had agreed only to allow sufficient funds to cover the hearing on Wednesday.The issue of funds held by the court will now be fully dealt with at a hearing listed before the High Court on January 22, during which it will be decided whether to sanction sums towards living expenses and legal fees from the sale of a French luxury property Le Grand Jardin last year.Meanwhile, the separate proceedings related to the former Kingfisher Airlines chief being extradited to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering remain held up by a “confidential” legal matter.

13-01-2021||Shimla||If chill in plains runs down your spine, head for sunny hills||If the chill in the plains of northern India runs down your spine these days, travel to the hills in Himachal Pradesh where the sun is shining brightly. The reason is less humidity in the hills compared to the plains where the sun is largely fogged out.Manmohan Singh, the Director of the India Meteorological Department here, told IANS on Wednesday that the hill stations in the state currently have more pleasant weather owing to longer duration of sunshine compared to the plains."The maximum and minimum temperatures in most of the places in Himachal Pradesh are high due to prevailing dry weather and no foggy conditions," he explained.The humidity level of 70 per cent or more causes fog. In the plains, he said, it is close to 100 per cent. However, in the hills it's between 30 and 40 per cent.According to him, Shimla's humidity level was 32 per cent whereas it was 86 per cent in Chandigarh, which is located in the plains.He said the dry weather conditions in the hill state would continue at least for over a week.In Shimla, which is located around 7,000 feet above sea level, the minimum temperature on Wednesday was 5.7-degree Celsius, while in Chandigarh, which is located in the foothills of the lower Shivaliks, it was also 5.7-degree Celsius.The maximum temperature in Shimla and Chandigarh was 18.4-degree Celsius and 11.1-degree Celsius, respectively, meaning the plains were colder than the hills."What a pleasant sun in Shimla compared to the bone-chilling cold of Delhi where a dense layer of fog engulfs the city almost throughout the day," said Ankit Dubey, a tourist.His wife Silky added: "In Delhi, the sun is a luxury these days. So it is better to be in the hills where the weather is dry and you can enjoy long sunny days." The minimum temperature in another hill destination, Dharamsala, the seat of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, was 3.6-degree Celsius, whereas the popular tourist spot of Manali, where nearby hills are wrapped up in a white blanket, saw a low of one degree Celsius.In Punjab's Amritsar and Ludhiana, the minimum temperature was 3.5 and 3.8-degree Celsius, respectively, while it was 1.4-degree Celsius in Haryana's Narnaul, the coldest in both the states.Delhi woke up to a bone-chilling cold of 3.2-degree Celsius on Wednesday as a dense layer of fog engulfed the national capital. Likewise, a thick blanket of fog enveloped many places of both Punjab and Haryana.Hill stations like Kasauli, Chail, Kufri, Narkanda, Palampur and Manali are bright, sunny and perfect for a break from the dismal winter weather of the plains.The weatherman attributed the rise in temperature in the hills to long, sunny days that kept the minimum and maximum temperatures up by several notches.However, unusually rising mercury owing to long dry spells is not going down well for Shimla residents as they say there has been a noticeable change in the climatic conditions of the town in the past 20-25 years."Now the snow is going missing from Shimla's landscape," remarked Subhash Gupta, a former government employee settled in the town since 1960."Earlier, most of our family members preferred to migrate to the lower hills from December onwards owing to extreme cold conditions. Now, the locals have almost stopped migration. In fact, a chunk of tourists have started coming here in the winter months," he said.Another resident, Prem Lal Negi, said that Shimla in recent years has hardly experienced heavy snow. "Earlier, you couldn't stay without a heating system in entire Shimla. Now, it is required only at the highest points of the town like Jakhu," he added.Environmentalists blame deforestation and rise in vehicular pollution for the change in Shimla's extreme climatic conditions.--- IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-chill-in-plains-runs-down-your-spine-head-for-sunny-hills-197927
13-01-2021||Kolkata||K D Singh arrest triggers war of words in poll-bound Bengal||The arrest of former TMC MP K D Singh in a money laundering case triggered a fresh verbal duel in the poll-bound West Bengal on Wednesday with the BJP demanding questioning of top brass of the Trinamool Congress in the case, while the ruling party denying any association with Singh for long.The Enforcement Directorate has arrested Singh in a money laundering case, official sources said on Wednesday.They said Singh has been placed under arrest under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The opposition BJP in West Bengal demanded the top brass of the TMC leaders should be questioned in this connection.“Who is K D Singh? His identity is that he is a former MP from the TMC. So the best thing would be to question the TMC leaders to bring out the truth,” state BJP vice-president Jaiprakash Majumdar said.Speaking on the issue, his party colleague Suvendu Adhikari, who had recently switched over to the BJP, claimed Singh’s dealings with the TMC leaders should be probed.Senior CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said the TMC can’t deny its involvement with Singh as their leaders had used his plane during election campaign.The TMC leadership, however, denied any association with Singh for the last few years.“He has not been associated with us for a long time. For the last few years, we have no relation with him. If he has committed any wrong then the law will take its course. We have nothing to say regarding it,” TMC MP Sougata Roy said.He, however, described the demand for questioning of the TMC leaders as “baseless and politically motivated”.The central probe agency had carried out searches at the premises K D Singh and those linked with him in September 2019 in connection with two PMLA cases.Singh has been the chairman of the Alchemist group and while he resigned from the post in 2012, he is stated to be the Chairman, Emeritus and founder of the business group.The ED is probing him as part of two money laundering cases.

The work is expected to be completed in the next 10 months and the 2022 Republic Day parade will be held on a redeveloped Rajpath.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building, which is expected to be completed by the 75th anniversary of India's independence and is estimated to cost Rs 971 crore.The new building will come up in front of the existing Parliament House that was built nearly 94 years ago at a cost of Rs 83 lakh at that time and would eventually be turned into a museum.The new building will house larger Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Halls, with capacities of 888 seats and 384 seats respectively, to accommodate an expanded Parliament after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026. The Lok Sabha Hall will also have additional capacity, up to 1,272 seats, to host joint sessions.According to the plan, provisions in the furniture will be made for smart displays and biometrics for ease of voting with an intuitive and graphical interface, digital language interpretation and recording infrastructure to produce real-time metadata, programmable microphones that put the control of managing the house with the speaker. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/central-vista-construction-work-of-new-parliament-building-to-start-on-january-15-say-sources-197923

It has been alleged that she was gang-raped and then killed.The police have booked three people in the case and are trying to nab them.According to police sources, one of the accused was known to the girl and the other two were his friends.“We are probing all angles and have launched a hunt to nab all the culprits,” Singh said.According to the police, the girl student, aged 15-16 years, had gone missing from her house in a village under the Harduaganj police station area on Sunday morning.Shortly after her family received a message that she has been kidnapped and demanded Rs 5 lakh as ransom for her release, they added.The kidnappers warned that if the money was not paid, a video showing the girl in a compromising position would be posted on social media, the police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-conclusive-proof-of-sexual-assault-in-autopsy-report-of-up-girl-dna-test-result-awaited-cops-197907
13-01-2021||---||SC verdict decriminalising adultery shouldn’t apply to armed forces: Centre to SC||New Delhi, January 13More than two years after the Supreme Court decriminalised adultery by declaring Section 497 of IPC as unconstitutional, the Centre has moved the Supreme Court with a plea that the historic verdict shouldn’t apply to the Armed Forces as it may cause instability among personnel who stay away from family.A three-judge Bench headed by Justice RF Nariman issued notice to the petitioner on whose plea section 497 IPC was declared unconstitutional and referred the matter to a Constitution Bench.Now, Chief Justice of India SA Bobde will constitute a five-judge Constitution Bench which will hear the Centre and the original petitioner and decide the issue.In a historic verdict, the Supreme Court had on September 27, 2018 declared unconstitutional Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code which punished only men for having sexual relationship with a married woman.In a unanimous verdict, a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra had said the 158-year-old Victorian era law was “manifestly arbitrary” and violated a woman’s right to equality and right to non-discrimination guaranteed under Article 14 and Article 15 of the Constitution as it treated them as chattels.The top court had, however, said adultery would be a ground for divorce in matrimonial proceedings and cautioned that the verdict should not be taken as a licence to indulge in such acts.Striking down the adultery law, the top court had said, “This (Section 497 IPC) treats the woman as a chattel. It treats her as the property of man and totally subservient to the will of the master. It is a reflection of the social dominance that was prevalent when the penal provision was drafted.”“The enforcement of forced female fidelity by curtailing sexual autonomy is an affront to the fundamental right to dignity and equality,” said the top court. It treated a married woman as a property of the husband, the Bench had said.It had said, “In treating a woman as chattel for the purposes of this provision, it is clear that such provision discriminates against women on grounds of sex only, and must be struck down on this ground as well.”“Adultery, in certain situations, may not be the cause of an unhappy marriage. It can be the result. It is difficult to conceive of such situations in absolute terms,” said verdict by CJI Misra and Justice AM Khanwilkar.The top court also declared Section 198 of the Criminal Procedure Code that deals with prosecution of offences against marriage as unconstitutional.According to Section 497 of IPC, whosoever has sexual intercourse with the wife of another man is guilty of adultery, which is punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both. It says the woman in question can’t be punished as an abettor.An Italy-based NRI—Joseph Shine – had challenged the provision which prescribes a jail term of up to five years or fine or both, terming it “unjust, illegal and arbitrary and violative of citizens’ fundamental rights.” Shine had questioned the gender bias in the provision drafted by Lord Macaulay in 1860. He also challenged Section 198(2) the Criminal Procedure Code which allows a husband to bring charges against the man with whom his wife committed adultery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-verdict-decriminalising-adultery-shouldnt-apply-to-armed-forces-centre-to-sc-197896

Later, he will also address the Thuglak magazine’s 51st anniversary function at Kalaivanar Arangam, according to the itinerary issued by party’s media in-charge Anil Baluni.Banking heavily on megastar Rajinikanth, the saffron party appears to have also changed tack regarding relations with regional ally AIADMK after his decision to stay away from politics.Saffron leaders, who had earlier been insisting that it is the NDA, which would take a call on the issue, now say their regional ally (that is the AIADMK) will decide the Chief Ministerial candidate for the Assembly elections due in April-May 2021. “In Tamil Nadu, AIADMK is the major partner. They will decide who their next Chief Ministerial candidate is,” BJP national general secretary and in-charge of Tamil Nadu CT Ravi was quoted as saying recently, signifying a major climb-down for the party trying hard to stake a major claim in the southern state. While the chief minister candidate will be from AIADMK, party leaders say a formal announcement regarding this will be made by the NDA coordination committee.Notably, the AIADMK has already passed a resolution (in its general council held on Saturday) that incumbent Edappadi K Palaniswami will be chief minister candidate.Earlier Ravi had said the NDA will decide on the chief minister candidate.“NDA partners will take a call on the CM candidate for the alliance. When the NDA gets the majority, the BJP’s Parliamentary Board and the alliance coordination committee will decide the CM, he had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-outreach-in-poll-bound-tamil-nadu-nadda-to-be-in%C2%A0chennai-tomorrow-on-pongal-197895

They are expected to study the CCTV footage of the previous day for identifying the attackers.Deputy SP (Sachivalaya) Rajesh Singh Prabhakar, who is part of the Special Investigating Team formed by the zonal IG for cracking the case, told reporters, "We have some vital clues which we would not like to divulge right now. But we are confident that the culprits would be caught soon." The post-mortem report of the deceased was awaited, he added.There was an outpouring of grief for Singh, survived by a wife and two children less than 10 years of age, who was known to be sociable and, by virtue of his job profile, close to many powerful politicians and bureaucrats in the state.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav tweeted, "If Nitish Kumar is not able to control law and order, he should resign." Congress national general secretary Tariq Anwar said that the incident is ample proof that Nitish Kumar has lost grip on law and order.Sunil Kumar Pintu, an MP from Kumar's own party JD(U), said, "Our leader's commitment to maintaining law and order will bear no fruits until and unless officials concerned pull up their socks."BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Thakur said that the state government must hand over the case to the CBI if the police fails to solve it within five days.Controversial former MP and Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav also pointed to Singh's "high profile connections" and stressed on the need for a thorough inquiry.BJP's Maharajganj MP Janardan Singh Sigriwal said, "I had pulled some strings for getting Rupesh, whose family has been known to me since long, transferred from Kolkata to Patna. I had never thought of such a tragic end to such a promising life.""It is time that laws are amended and provisions made for public execution of perpetrators of crime in order to strike terror in the hearts and minds of hardened criminals," he said.Meanwhile, at the paternal residence of the deceased in Saran district, the wails of the bereaved father rent the air."After my son came to Patna, I was feeling relieved that upon my death, he would be certainly here in time to lend his shoulder to the bier.

13-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmers’ stir gives vendors at Singhu border a chance to revive income||Before the coronavirus pandemic, Rakesh Arora used to be a vendor at the India Gate, but his business did not pick up after lockdown. Now, the farmers' stir at the Singhu border has given him a chance to improve livelihood, selling badges and stickers.With the protesting farmers staying put at the border point of the national capital for over six weeks now, a number of small businesses have sprung up at the site, the newest being sale of pro-protest badges and stickers.Shopkeepers with basketful of badges and stickers with 'I love Kheti (farming)', 'I love Kisan', and 'Kisan Ekta Zindabad' printed on them have seated themselves at every nook and corner of the highway. Almost every protester could be seen wearing a badge, while the tractors and trolleys flaunt the stickers.Arora and his nephew brought in inventory worth Rs 2,500 two days ago from Ambala and have managed to sell products worth Rs 700 so far."I used to be a vendor at India Gate. But after lockdown, business has been really poor. So we decided to set shop at the protest once we saw an opportunity," Arora said.Amaan, an electrician from Delhi's Okhla has also taken to selling these badges and stickers, owing to lack of work. Both badge and sticker are being sold at Rs 10."It doesn't yield much income, but something is better than nothing. Barely 15-20 people buy these each day," he said.Brothers Moin (17) and Nadeef (11), from Uttar Pradesh's Loni, have also ventured into this business. "We bring in 500 of these badges every day. We manage to sell some 300 of them," said Moin, who set up shop in Singhu a week back.Many shopkeepers at Singhu border are hoping to make most of the agitation, by earning whatever little they can. Many of these badges are sourced from Delhi's Sadar Bazaar market.Chandan Kumar, who has been running an electrical equipment shop at the Singhu border for over five years now, has pushed bulbs, switches and wires to the back and lined his shop with 'No Farmer, No Food' stickers and badges."The electrical business had completely taken a backseat. I realised that the farmers liked stickers about their agitation. So I started getting radium paper from Kashmere Gate market and printing the stickers myself," he said.Kumar said while it was not at all a close substitute for his earlier business, it did bring in some income.For over a month several farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are camping at the borders of Delhi to protest the three farms laws, which the NDA claims will reform the agri sector.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

From bank statements it can be seen that funds were diverted to own companies,” ED's Special Public Prosecutor NK told the court, seeking 14-day custodial interrogation.In September 2019, the ED had carried out searches on the premises linked to Singh in New Delhi and Chandigarh in connection with the 14 companies of Alchemist Group related to and controlled by his son Karan Deep Singh.During searches, according to ED, a number of documents reflecting the circular nature of transactions, digital evidence and property documents were seized. Search at the official residence of KD Singh in Delhi resulted in the recovery of Rs 32 lakh in cash along with foreign exchange worth $10,000.Investigation under the PMLA by the ED was initiated in 2018 on the basis of FIRs registered by Kolkata Police under sections relevant to cheating and criminal conspiracy against Singh, his son, Alchemist Township India Limited, Alchemist Holdings Limited and various other companies and directors linked with the group for allegedly cheating thousands of customers.According to the ED, the former TMC MP used his companies, including Alchemist Township India Limited and Alchemist Holdings Limited, to raise huge amounts of money collected from customers in the garb of investments by promising them high returns. The money was also raised against the sale and booking of plots and flats, the agency had said.Officials in the ED said the funds raised were allegedly not used for the intended purpose and were allegedly diverted and siphoned off to various group companies. “Money so collected from the innocent public was transferred in a circular manner in order to conceal and layer in a fraudulent way. Further, various entities involved in this process have dummy directors,” said an ED official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-arrests-former-tmc-mp-kd-singh-in-alchemist-group-money-laundering-case-197869

13-01-2021||Washington||A strong India would act as 'counterbalance' to China, says declassified White House document||Asserting that India maintains the capacity to counter border provocations by China, the outgoing Trump administration in a declassified document has said that a strong India, in cooperation with like-minded countries, would act as a "counterbalance" to China in the strategic Indo-Pacific region.Running into 10 pages, the document was recently declassified in part by US National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien and now has been posted on the website of the White House.“India's preferred partner on security issues is the United States. The two cooperate to preserve maritime security and counter Chinese influence in South and Southeast Asia and other regions of mutual concern. India maintains the capacity to counter border provocations by China,” said the US Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific.India, it said, remains preeminent in South Asia and takes the leading role in maintaining Indian Ocean security, increases engagement with Southeast Asia, and expands its economic, defence and diplomatic cooperation with other US allies and partners in the region."A strong India, in cooperation with like-minded countries, would act as a counterbalance to China," the document said.The US and its partners on every continent are resistant to Chinese activities aimed at undermining their sovereignty, including through covert or coercive influence, it said.The policy framework said its objective is to accelerate India's rise and capacity to serve as a net provider of security and major defence partner; solidify an enduring strategic partnership with India underpinned by a strong Indian military able to effectively collaborate with the US and its partners in the region to address shared interests.The actions proposed by the framework include building a stronger foundation for defence cooperation and interoperability; expand defence trade and ability to transfer defence technology to enhance India's status as a major defence partner; increase cooperation on shared regional security concerns and encourage India's engagement beyond the Indian Ocean Region.It also seeks to support India's membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group and work with the country towards domestic economic reform and an increased leadership role in the East Asia Summit (EAS).The framework proposes to offer support to India - through diplomatic, military, and intelligence channels - to help address continental challenges such as the border dispute with China and access to water, including the Brahmaputra and other rivers facing diversion by China.Redacted in part, the Framework among the actions proposes to support India's ‘Act East Policy’ and its aspiration to be a leading global power, highlighting its compatibility with the US, Japanese, and Australian vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific; and build regional support for US-India Common Principles in the Indian Ocean, including unimpeded commerce, transparent infrastructure-debt practices, and peaceful resolution of territorial disputes.Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Beijing has impeded commercial activity like fishing or mineral exploration by countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, claiming that the ownership of territory belonged to China for hundreds of years.“Promote US-India energy cooperation across all sources and technologies to diversify India's energy sources and supplies. Partner with India on cyber and space security and maritime domain awareness. Expand US-India intelligence sharing and analytic exchanges...creating a more robust intelligence partnership,” said the document, classified by former Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger.Pottinger has recently resigned from his post over the Capitol Hill violence on January 6.The framework also seeks to work with India and Japan to help finance projects that enhance regional connectivity between India and countries of the region.The document said its objective is to prevent China's industrial policies and unfair trading practices from distorting global markets and harming US competitiveness. Actions recommended by it are to counter Chinese predatory economic practices that freeze out foreign competition, undermine US economic competitiveness, and abet the Chinese Communist Party's aspiration to dominate the 21st century economy.Another objective of the framework is to strengthen the capacity of emerging partners in South Asia, including the Maldives, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, to contribute to a free and open order.Actions recommended are to establish a new initiative with South Asian partners modelled on the Maritime Security Initiative in Southeast Asia to improve maritime domain awareness, interoperability, and data-sharing with the US.It supports creation of a maritime information "fusion centre” in the Indian Ocean; establish a regional forum to promote common principles and standards and establish and gain broad consensus on a statement of principles on acceptable maritime behaviour, to include a commitment to regional cooperation in line with shared security objectives.

The police were in the process of bringing them to Goa, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-africans-arrested-for-duping-goa-woman-of-rs-37-lakh-197847
13-01-2021||New Delhi||Telegram crosses 500 million subscriber mark led by user additions in Asia||Messaging service Telegram crossed 500-million subscriber mark globally and added 25 million new users in the last few days as it gained ground amid the controversy over WhatsApp's latest privacy policy update.While Telegram did not specify India-specific user numbers, it said 38 per cent of the new users are from Asia, followed by Europe (27 per cent), Latin America (21 per cent) and MENA (Middle East and North Africa at 8 per cent).In a statement, Telegram said it surpassed 500 million monthly active users in the first week of January, and "has continued to grow with 25 million new users joining Telegram in the last 72 hours alone".Reports citing Sensor Tower data indicated that Telegram had 1.5 million new downloads between January 6-10 in India.India is the world's second-largest telecom market and the biggest consumer of data. As on October 30, 2020, the total telephone connections stood at 117 crore, of which 115 crore were mobile connections.A report by Ericsson had stated that Indians used about 12 GB data per month on an average in 2019, the highest consumption globally, and this is expected to rise even further to about 25 GB (gigabytes) per month by 2025.In a recent blogpost, Telegram CEO and founder Pavel Durov said global user addition has seen a "significant increase" compared to last year when 1.5 million new users signed up every day, and that with its current growth rate, Telegram is on track to reach billions of users in the near future."We've had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different. People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services...With half a billion active users and accelerating growth, Telegram has become the largest refuge for those seeking a communication platform committed to privacy and security," he said.Durov added that the company takes this responsibility very seriously."Unlike other popular apps, Telegram doesn't have shareholders or advertisers to report to. We don't do deals with marketers, data miners or government agencies. Since the day we launched in August 2013 we haven't disclosed a single byte of our users' private data to third parties," he claimed.Apps like Telegram and Signal have seen massive surge in downloads and usage after WhatsApp updated its privacy policy that included a controversial change of linking data of WhatsApp users to Facebook's other products and services.WhatsApp had also stated that users will have to agree to the new terms and policy by February 8, 2021, in order to continue using the platform.This kickstarted a spate of conversations as well as memes on the internet over WhatsApp's alleged sharing of user information with Facebook.WhatsApp, on its part, has sought to assuage users' concerns, saying its latest policy update does not affect the privacy of messages on the platform.In a blogpost earlier this week, Facebook-owned WhatsApp emphasised that it does not share users' contact lists or data of groups with Facebook for advertisement purposes.The blogpost was followed by full-page ads in leading dailies in the country on Wednesday where it sought to clear the air over the changes that have been introduced as part of the latest update.WhatsApp, which has over 400 million users in India, counts the country among its biggest markets globally.Signal is also hoping to capitalise on the opportunities in India with its "simple and straightforward" terms of service and privacy policy. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telegram-crosses-500-million-subscriber-mark-led-by-user-additions-in-asia-197846

People traditionally celebrate it by circling around bonfires, throwing food items—peanuts, puffed rice, popcorn etc—into the fire, singing folk songs, dancing and feasting on the festive food.Also readFarmers in Punjab, Haryana burn copies of farm laws on Lohri“The celebrations can wait. We will celebrate all these festivals the day our demand of repealing of these black laws are met by the Centre,” said 65-year-old Gurpreet Singh Sandhu who hails from Haryana’s Karnal district.Several bonfires were lined up at the Delhi-Haryana border stretch, the nerve centre of the farmers’ agitation. The protesting farmers raised slogans, sang songs of resistance and hope as they orbited the bonfire, burning copies of farm laws and praying for the success of their protest.“This Lohri is filled with struggle,” said Rajbir Singh, a 34-year-old farmer from Punjab’s Barnala district.“It is minus the fun, the song and the dance we used to have back home on Lohri. But I am happy to be here and celebrate it with my family of farmers this time.”                 “Today, we have burned the copies, tomorrow the Centre will burn them. They have to, we will make them do it,” he added.Many farmer leaders, including Yogendra Yadav, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, also threw copies of the farm laws in the bonfire, created on the premises of the Kisan Andolan office.Earlier in the day, farmer leader Manjeet Singh Rai said they would celebrate Lohri by burning the copies of farm laws at all protest sites in the evening.Meanwhile, the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of around 40 protesting farmer unions, is hold a meeting to discuss the next course of action.This comes a day after the protesting farmer unions asserted that they would not appear before the Supreme Court-appointed panel, alleging it was "pro-government", and said they would not settle for anything less than the repeal of the three contentious laws.The unions also raised doubts over the neutrality of the members of the committee even as they welcomed the top court's order to stay the implementation of the laws.The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the implementation of the controversial farm laws till further orders and set up the four-member committee to resolve the impasse between the Centre and the farmer unions protesting at Delhi's borders over the legislations.Also read: Protesting farmers don't know what they want, says Hema Malini; adds 'Punjab has suffered a lot of losses'Thousands of farmers, mostly from Haryana and Punjab, have been protesting at several border points of Delhi since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of the three laws and a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) system for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed the apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-lohri-protesting-farmers-in-delhi-burn-copies-of-new-agri-laws-197840

13-01-2021||Mumbai||Actor Sonu Sood a habitual offender of illegal construction, civic body tells HC||Bollywood actor Sonu Sood is a "habitual offender" who keeps carrying out unauthorised construction work in a residential building in suburban Juhu despite demolition action initiated on two occasions in the past, the Mumbai civic body stated in its affidavit filed in the Bombay High Court on Tuesday.The affidavit was filed in response to the petition filed by Sood last week challenging a notice issued against him by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in October last year and an order passed by a civil court in December 2020 dismissing his suit against the notice.In its notice, the BMC had alleged that Sood carried out structural changes in the six-storey residential building 'Shakti Sagar' and was converting it into a commercial hotel."The appellant is a habitual offender and wants to enjoy the commercial proceeds of the unauthorised work and therefore once again started reconstructing the demolished portion in order to make it operational as a hotel albeit illegally and without permission from the Licence department," the civic body said in the affidavit.As per the affidavit, Sood was trying to protect an "ex-facie illegal commercial hotel, which has been constructed and modified by the appellant (Sood) contrary to the sanctioned building plan"."The appellant has not been given permission for change of user of the said property from residential to commercial and there is no license to run the commercial hotel," the affidavit said.It added that Sood had sought umbrage under unwarranted and baseless allegations of harassment and malafides."The appellant, who has totally modified an entire building unauthorisedly into a hotel, is running the same without a license," the municipal corporation said.The BMC said initial action was initiated against the illegal construction in September 2018 but Sood continued the construction work.On November 12, 2018, demolition of the unauthorised work was carried out."Such is the audacity of the appellant that he once again started alterations and reconstructed the demolished portion. Therefore, the BMC once again took action of demolition on February 14, 2020," the affidavit said.It said Sood had no documents to even indicate that he or his wife Sonali Sood are the owners of the said building.The petition will be heard on Wednesday by Justice Prithviraj Chavan.The high court on Monday extended till Wednesday the civil court's order restraining the BMC from taking a coercive action against the alleged illegal construction.Sood in his plea had claimed that he had not carried out any illegal or unauthorised construction in the six-storey Shakti Sagar building."The petitioner (Sood) has not made any changes in the building that warrants permission from the BMC. Only those changes that are allowed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act have been done," Sood's advocate Amogh Singh had argued.The petition had requested the court to quash and set aside the notice issued by the BMC in October, 2020, and also sought an interim relief to not take any coercive action against the actor.Sood, who is known for his roles in films like "Dabangg", "Jodha Akbar" and "Simmba", came into spotlight in 2020 for his philanthropy work in helping migrants reach their homes during the COVID-19 lockdown.

The two codes, which have been passed by Parliament, are on industrial relations, social security and occupational safety health & working conditions (OSH).While 10 unions, dominated by those leaning to the Left, boycotted the meeting in protest against the ministry’s alleged plan to hold it through video-conference, the BMS, TUCC and NFITU attended it.During discussions, the BMS opposed the proposal for lowering the cap on earned leave in the OSH draft rules.The rules proposed a cap of 240 days on earned leave, 90 days for journalists and 120 days for sales representatives. BMS leaders demanded raising the limit of earned leave to 300 days for all.“The proposal to lower the cap is a great loss for those who have sacrificed their right for leave and worked for their employers,” BMS national functionary Pawan Kumar said. The BMS’ other demands include increasing the eligibility criteria of EPF scheme from a monthly salary of Rs 15,000 to Rs 21,000 to make it on a par with the ESI scheme.“The rules should provide that ESI benefits continue to be provided to the employees even after crossing the Rs 21,000 salary cap,” the BMS said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trade-unions-divided-over-rules-framed-under-labour-codes-197515

It posted the matter for hearing after eight weeks.“The constitution of a committee of experts… to negotiate between the farmers’ bodies and the government may create a congenial atmosphere... a stay on implementation of the three laws for the present may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith,” it said.While maintaining that it didn’t want to stifle a peaceful protest, the court said, “this extraordinary order of stay on implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present and will encourage the farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others.”To allay fear regarding minimum support price (MSP) being done away with and possibility of farmers losing their land, the court said, “The MSP system in existence before the enactment of the farm laws shall be maintained until further orders. In addition, the farmers’ land holdings shall be protected, i.e., no farmer shall be dispossessed or deprived of his title as a result of any action taken under the farm laws.”It said the representatives of all farmers’ bodies, whether they were holding a protest or not and whether they supported or opposed the laws shall participate in the deliberations of the committee and put forth their view.The Bench turned down farmers’ demand that the Prime Minister himself should approach them for negotiations, saying he was not a party to the proceedings.Earlier, Attorney General KK Venugopal opposed the stay, contending that “none of the petitioners who have attacked the farm laws have pointed out any single provision which is detrimental to the farmers and that the laws enacted by Parliament cannot be stayed by this court.” While appreciating Venugopal’s arguments, the Bench said, “This court cannot be said to be completely powerless to grant stay of any executive action under a statutory enactment” and went on to pass the stay order.Many senior lawyers, who appeared on behalf of the farmers on Monday, were conspicuous by the absence on Tuesday. Several lawyers, including senior counsel PS Narasimha, representing Hyderabad-based Consortium of Indian Farmers Association (CIFA), said their clients were in favour of the farm laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-puts-laws-on-hold-forms-4-member-panel-197499

Exhorting youngsters to join politics, the Prime Minister said till the time they came forward, the poison of dynasties would continue to weaken democracy.Narendra Modi, PMBe builders of India Political dynasties are raising the burden of non-performance on the country. Let your decisions be inspired by national good. Swami Vivekananda used to say the youth must become the builders of India. It’s your responsibility to lead the future and this responsibility stretches to the field of politics.  He was addressing the second National Youth Parliament virtually on the occasion of Swami Vivekenanda’s birth anniversary.Citing lessons from the life of Swami Vivekananda, the Prime Minister said dynastic politics was the source of social and political corruption, and the youth must lead the eradication of this “disease”.He said a new awakening in the country was witnessing people supporting honesty and performance with surnames no longer enough to win elections. “Days for those who won on surnames are over. You also need to show a strong CV now and public representatives have realised this,” the Prime Minister said, lamenting that there were still people whose goals were driven by the urge of preserving their family legacies for whom it’s “me and my family rather than nation first.”Hails Winners of ‘Vocal for Local’ debate “Political dynasties, like a new form of dictatorship, are raising the burden of non-performance on the country,” he said in the presence of Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla and ministers of education and youth Ramesh Pokhriyal and Kiren Rijiju.Noting that people who have a legacy of corruption now find corruption a burden, the Prime Minister said dynasts had a feeling that “if their past generations were not held accountable, they could also get away”.“They see such distorted examples in their own houses. That’s why such people have no respect for the law nor fear for it. The onus of changing this scenario is on the youth and the awakening of the country,” he said. The youth should participate in politics not with the intention to receive but with the intention to give. “Until youngsters enter politics, the poison of dynasties will continue to weaken our democracy. Youth participation in politics is critical to save democracy,” said. The PM said the youth have to make this century the century of India. “Let your decisions be inspired by national good. Swami Vivekananda used to say the youth must become the builders of India,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-dynastic-politics-weakening-democracy-youth-can-prevent-it-197512
