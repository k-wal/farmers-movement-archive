Why was the Fund advertised on banned Chinese apps?” he asked in a series of tweets.Surjewala also sought to know how much money was received by the fund from Pakistan and Qatar and who donated that money.“How many thousand CR were received in Fund from 27 foreign countries?” he asked.“Why were the 27 Indian Embassies advertising the Fund through ‘Closed Channels, not in Public Domain’, when Fund is not a ‘Public Authority’ within RTI?” he asked.The Congress leader also sought to know why the fund has been exempted from a preview of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) by the government.“Isn’t it the only exception in India for a charitable trust?

16-12-2020||Coochbehar (WB)||BJP calling up TMC leaders, trying to coerce them to join it: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday called the deserters of ruling TMC  “opportunists and cowards” and accused BJP of trying to coerce Trinamool Congress leaders to join the saffron party.She also blamed BJP for trying to break TMC by using “moneybags”.Banerjee, who is also the TMC supremo, urged the people to give their mandate against the “outsider” BJP, which she said has come here to loot the Bengalis and leave after the elections are over.“Imagine the audacity of the BJP leaders ---they are calling up my (TMC) state president Subrata Bakshi and asking him to join the party. The BJP doesn’t have any political courtesy or ideology. And, there are one or two opportunists who only work for their own benefits,” she told a rally here.“The old-timers of the party are our real assets. We have an ideology, those who are deserting the party don’t have any ideological conviction. The BJP is trying to coerce TMC leaders to join. It is using moneybags to break opposition parties... But, we will fight and defeat them in the assembly polls,” she asserted.Her comments come in the backdrop of growing resentment in the TMC with several senior leaders, ministers and MLAs openly speaking out against the party leadership and the state government.Senior TMC leader Suvendu Adhikari had recently quit the state cabinet and has resigned as MLA on Wednesday evening fuelling speculations of his possible switchover to the saffron camp later this month.Continuing her tirade, she said “Some are acting as fence sitters; they are apprehensive that they may not get tickets as they have been non-performers as MLAs. The BJP is calling up party leaders and telling them do you want to stay in jail or in active politics.”“They (MLAs) can go if they want. Those who have deserted TMC are opportunists and cowards. I don’t want cowards who are afraid to stand up against the BJP.“I along with my party workers will fight against the BJP, which is a party of dacoits and thieves. I will defeat the BJP,” Banerjee, a strident critic of the saffron party, said.Slamming the BJP as a party of “outsiders”, the feisty TMC boss said she will never allow the saffron camp to take control of Bengal and urged the people to resist any such attempt.“If some goons from outside come to our state and terrorise you all of you should united in their resistance of them. We believe in peace,” she said.“But few people come to the state only during elections to terrorise people. We won’t allow them to have a free run here. We will never allow outsiders to take control and rule the state,” Banerjee said.Her comments came in the backdrop of the issue of Bengali sub-nationalism, which is emerging as a rallying cry in West Bengal ahead of the assembly elections due next year.She urged the voters of north Bengal, which has 54 assembly seats spread across seven districts, to give a mandate against the “outsider” BJP and said it is trying to destroy the state with its “divisive politics”.“The RSS and BJP are trying to take control over Bengal for their vested interest. They are not real Hindus. They are not Ramakrishna or Vivekananda, they only spread hatred,” the feisty TMC supremo said.BJP has made deep inroads in north Bengal and bagged seven out of the eight Lok Sabha seats in the last parliamentary elections.Hitting out at BJP’s campaign to distribute cards to 75 lakh youths in the state for providing job opportunities in the next five years, Banerjee said “It is a bluff by the BJP to fool the masses”.“They are the biggest dacoits of Chambal and they have come here to loot the Bengalis. They will loot you and leave after the elections are over. I will stand by you throughout the year,” she said.Reacting to Banerjee’s allegation of BJP trying to poach TMC MLAs and elected representatives, West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said:“The allegations are baseless. The truth is TMC leaders and members of Prashant Kishor’s team are calling up BJP leaders in various parts of the state”.Kishor is the poll strategist for TMC for the 2021 West Bengal assembly poll.Election to the 294-member state assembly is due in April-May next year.

16-12-2020||New Delhi||EC orders FIR against 3 IPS officers, others in 'polls cash' case against Kamal Nath aides||The Election Commission has asked the Madhya Pradesh CEO to lodge a criminal case against three IPS officers and others whose alleged role in the use of black money during the 2019 general elections came to the fore after the I-T department raided close aides of former chief minister Kamal Nath.The Commission has also asked the Union Home Secretary to initiate "appropriate departmental action" against the IPS officers and also asked the Madhya Pradesh chief secretary to undertake a "similar action" against a state police service officer.The poll body said it was recommending action after it "deliberated" upon a report sent to it by the CBDT (Central Board of Direct Taxes) intimating it about the Income-Tax Department's "search operations in Madhya Pradesh and its findings of extensive use of unaccounted cash during the General Elections 2019." The CBDT is the administrative authority for the I-T Department.An EC statement said the CBDT report informed the Commission about certain entities and individuals who were engaged in "unauthorised and unaccounted cash contributions to individuals on behalf of a certain political party, which was reported to be corroborated during searches against persons by the tax department". While the EC did not name the party, it has been widely reported that the CBDT report referred to the Congress party."The report specifically mentions instances of prima facie involvement/nexus of public or government servants in unauthorised or unaccounted cash transactions," the statement said.It said the EC has directed to forward the copy of the October 28 CBDT report "to the Chief Electoral Officer, Madhya Pradesh to lodge criminal action before designated authority, that is the Madhya Pradesh economic offences wing, against concerned for the violation as per extant electoral and other relevant laws." EC sources identified the three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers as Sushovan Banerjee, Sanjay Mane, V Madhu Kumar and the state police service officer as Arun Mishra.The tax department had conducted raids at 52 locations in Madhya Pradesh and Delhi in April last year and those searched included Nath's former Officer on Special Duty (OSD) Pravin Kakkar, adviser Rajendra Miglani, Ashwani Sharma, executives linked to his brother-in-law's firm Moser Baer, a company of his nephew Ratul Puri and others.The CBDT, on April 8 last year, had said in a statement that tax sleuths recovered Rs 14.6 crore "unaccounted" cash and seized diaries and computer files of suspect payments after the raids.It said the department detected a trail of Rs 20 crore suspect cash allegedly being moved to the "headquarter of a major political party in Delhi"."Searches in Madhya Pradesh have detected widespread and well-organised racket of collection of unaccounted cash of about Rs 281 crore through various persons in different walks of life, including business, politics and public service." "A part of the cash was also transferred to the headquarter of a major political party in Delhi, including about Rs 20 crore, which was moved through hawala recently to the headquarter of the political party from the residence of a senior functionary at Tughlak Road, New Delhi,” the CBDT had said.While the CBDT had neither identified the political party nor the senior functionary, Nath had earlier said the action against his aides was politically motivated. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-orders-fir-against-3-ips-officers-others-in-polls-cash-case-against-kamal-nath-aides-185214
16-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||J&K DDC elections: This time lotus will bloom in Valley, says Shahnawaz Hussain||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 16As the high-profile District Development Council elections in J&K draw to a close on December 19, senior BJP leaders are oozing confidence of the party doing well, including in Kashmir Valley where it never won a single seat in the erstwhile Assembly.Union Minister Anurag Thakur says J&K will give a “decisive mandate in favour of BJP and reinforce that ballot is mightier than the bullet”.“Is baar Kashmir ghati main kamal khila ke dikhayenge (Lotus will bloom in the Valley this time),” adds senior BJP leader Syed Shahnawaz Hussain.Talking to The Tribune, Hussain said people have “complete faith in Prime Minister Modi and they are not talking of Article 370 but only development”. Excerpts of the interview  Q. What is your feeling towards the end of these elections?   A. The BJP is contesting these elections on the plank of development. As a party’ in charge, I have campaigned fearlessly, including in difficult parts. I want to tell the country that perceptions about J&K are not correct. People here want ‘jamhooriyat’ (democracy).  Atal Bihari Vajpapyee had talked of ‘Insaniyat’, ‘Jamhooriyat’ and ‘Kashmiriyat’. Without ‘jamhooriyat’ there can neither be ‘insaaniyat’ nor ‘Kashmiriyat’. Our aim is to make J&K dynasty and corruption free and ensure democracy here.  Mehbooba Mufti said ‘Bharat ka jhanda uthane wala nhi milega’. Let me tell her, not only is Indian flag flying high here we have also raised the BJP flag in places where these Kashmiri leaders may not have gone, places where people suffered due to militancy, witnessed encounters. People have faith in Narendra Modi, they consider him their elder brother, they are happy with what he has done for them.Q. What was the feedback on Article 370 during your visit to these places?A. Neither they talked about it nor did I. They know they as Kashmiris enjoy the same rights as Shahnawaz does as a Bihari. It (Article 370) is only an issue with Mehbooba Mufti and Gupkar Gang, not with people who want good governance, development, education, electricity, roads.Q. Then what is the need to make a comparison between India’s Muslims and those in Pakistan as you did on Tuesday? A. That statement was incomplete. I said it in Parliament in 2000 that there is no better country for Indian Muslims than India or a better friend than Hindus. Today let me add to it, they also have no better leader than Narendra Modi. The rights they enjoy in India, they do not have in any other country, and that is a fact.Q.  PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti has made many allegations regarding not being allowed to campaign freely, rigging, security forces not letting people cast votes, in these elections?A. They are completely baseless. I am also security covered and there are many places I am not allowed to go. Today, I wanted to go to Charar-i-Sharief  but the administration did not allow me. Mehbooba is looking for ways to explain her defeat. I think she knows they have lost the election. Because of such high voting percentages our rivals are now scared. The voting percentage shows people have voted for  ‘jamhooriyat, insaniyat and Kashmiriyat’. Our focus has only been development.Q. You targeted your opponents, calling them ‘Gupkar Gang’?A. When so many parties get together to gang against us, what should we call them? They are a gang of corrupt dynasts, which is why they are a gang. They have just got together to save their wealth, they have nothing to do with people. More than 90 per cent of our focus has been on people and development issues.Q. What is your final assessment of your performance? The BJP is famous for giving exact figures.  A. I just want to say that in the Valley, where we did not have even a single seat  in the Assembly, whatever we get we will welcome, consider it as blessing of people of Kashmir, their ‘dua’. If I give a number they will say Shehnawaz ne pehle hi bta diya. I am confident that lotus (BJP's election symbol) will bloom in the Valley. ‘Is baar Kashmir ghati main kamal khila ke dikhayenge, Jammu main to kamal pehle hi khila hua hai’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jk-ddc-elections-this-time-lotus-will-bloom-in-valley-says-shahnawaz-hussain-185210
16-12-2020||New Delhi||Tax burden on cigarettes in India far below international standards: Study||The current tax burden on cigarettes in India is far below the standard of international best practice, a new study showed on Wednesday that named Australia and New Zealand as top-performing countries for significantly reducing the affordability of cigarettes.In the first edition of the International Cigarette Tax Scorecard, compiled by  Tobacconomics, India got an overall score of 1.88 out of 5 possible points, which is slightly better than the South-East Asia average (1.82), but lower than the global average (2.07) and scores of top-performing countries (4.63)."The top-performing countries are Australia and New Zealand, which reflects their high, uniform specific cigarette excise taxes with regular increases that have significantly reduced the affordability of cigarettes," said Tobacconomics after assessing the performance of cigarette tax policies in over 170 countries including India.Tobacconomics, based at the University of Illinois at Chicago's Institute for Health Research and Policy, conducts economic research to inform and shape fiscal policies for health globally.It said the scorecard assessed countries' cigarette tax policies based on international best practices using data from the World Health Organization from 2014-2018.Nearly half the countries scored less than two out of the five-point maximum.There has been little improvement from 2014-2018 – the global average score rose only slightly from 1.85 in 2014 to 2.07 in 2018.Regarding India, it said the country had significantly improved its score on cigarette taxation policy from 1.38 in 2014 to 2.38 in 2016 after which it declined to 1.88 in 2018 due to the lack of tax increases on tobacco and increasing affordability of cigarettes.Overall scores, however, improved in 89 countries. Introduction of significant cigarette excise taxes, simplification of previously complicated tiered cigarette excise tax structure and large tax increases are the reasons why some countries improved their scores, and they are already reaping the rewards of higher revenues and lives saved."The scorecard shows considerable untapped potential for cigarette tax increases to raise revenue for a COVID-19 recovery and importantly, prevent premature deaths and promote a healthy and productive workforce," said Frank J Chaloupka, Tobacconomics director and lead author of the scorecard."The current tax burden on cigarettes in India is 52 per cent and is far below the standard of international best practice. The lack of increase in taxes on tobacco products after the introduction of the GST in the year 2017 has increased the affordability of cigarettes in India," said Dr Rijo John, a health economist and adjunct professor at the Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kochi.Dr John suggested that India must reduce the number of tiers for the purpose of cigarette taxation and significantly increase its existing excise taxes on tobacco products to save lives and raise much-needed revenue."Indian and global studies are providing clear evidence of how tobacco use in all forms, whether smoking or chewing, is leading to severe COVID-19 manifestations and adverse outcomes," said Dr Harit Chaturvedi, Chairman of Max Institute of Cancer Care.Regular tax increases on tobacco products will reduce their consumption and generate much-needed revenue to strengthen health promotion and prevention programs, while it will also help address comorbidities of tobacco use and COVID-19 pandemic in India, said Dr Chaturvedi.According to some estimates, about 3,500 people die every day in India from tobacco use and the economic burden from tobacco use amounted to Rs 1,77,341 crore in 2017-18, which is 1 per cent of the country's GDP.As the COVID-19 pandemic has created a major dent in India's GDP growth, reforming tobacco taxes provides a quick and easy way for India to raise much-needed revenue for economic recovery, experts said."Tobacco taxes are the single most effective way to minimise the negative health and economic impacts of tobacco consumption. The best way to do this is through a uniform specific excise tax that comprises at least 75 per cent of the retail price and is automatically updated to stay ahead of inflation and income growth," said Tobacconomics.

16-12-2020||New Delhi||India ranks 131 in UN’s human development index||India dropped one spot to 131 among 189 countries in the 2020 human development index, according to a report released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).Human Development Index is the measure of a nation’s health, education and standards of living.Life expectancy of Indians at birth in 2019 was 69.7 years while Bangladesh has a life expectancy of 72.6 years and Pakistan 67.3 years, the 2020 Human Development Report said.India, Bhutan (129), Bangladesh (133), Nepal (142), and Pakistan (154) were ranked among countries with medium human development, the report said.India’s HDI value for 2019 is 0.645 which put it in the medium human development category. India has been positioned at 131 out of 189 countries and territories, according to the report. India had ranked 130 in 2018 in the index.Norway topped the index, followed by Ireland, Switzerland, Hong Kong and Iceland, the report showed.Talking to reporters, UNDP Resident Representative Shoko Noda said the drop in India’s ranking doesn’t mean “India didn’t do well but other countries did better”.Noda said India can help other countries too and lauded its commitment to reduce carbon emissions. According to the report published by the United Nations Development Programme on Tuesday, India’s gross national income per capita fell to USD 6,681 in 2019 from USD 6,829 in 2018 on purchasing power parity (PPP) basis.Purchasing power parity or PPP is a measurement of prices in different countries that uses the prices of specific goods to compare the absolute purchasing power of the countries’ currencies.The report said evidence from Colombia to India indicates that financial security and ownership of land improve women’s security and reduce the risk of gender-based violence, clearly indicating that owning land can empower women.It further said indigenous children in Cambodia, India and Thailand show more malnutrition-related issues such as stunting and wasting.“In India different responses in parent behaviour as well as some disinvestment in girls’ health and education have led to higher malnutrition among girls than among boys as a consequence of shocks likely linked to climate change,” the report said.The report said under the Paris Agreement, India pledged to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP from the 2005 level by 33–35 percent by 2030 and to obtain 40 percent of electric power capacity from non–fossil fuel sources by 2030.“As part of the plan, the National Solar Mission aims to promote solar energy for power generation and other uses to make solar energy competitive with fossil fuel–based options. Solar capacity in India increased from 2.6 gigawatts in March 2014 to 30 gigawatts in July 2019, achieving its target of 20 gigawatts four years ahead of schedule. In 2019, India ranked fifth for installed solar capacity,” the report said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-ranks-131-in-uns-human-development-index-185207

But last week, he posted a statement on Twitter, saying the matter was between the farmers and the government and some people were trying to stir the trouble.“I know that many people want to take advantage of the situation and are creating problems. They are not thinking of farmers. They may have their own agenda. I stand with my party and farmers and will always be with farmers,” Deol had tweeted.“Our government always thinks of the betterment of farmers and I am sure that the government will ensure the right outcome after holding talks with farmers,” he added.The farmers are protesting against the new agriculture laws, which they fear will end the safety net of Minimum Support Prices (MSP), or guaranteed minimum prices, and leave them open to exploitation by corporate.After Sunny Deol’s tweet, his father Dharmendra, a legendary actor who was also a BJP MP between 2004 and 2009, had posted: “I’m extremely in pain to see the suffering of my farmer brothers.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mha-accords-y-category-security-to-sunny-deol-after-he-backs-new-farm-laws-185205
16-12-2020||Jaipur||Jaipur-Delhi highway remains partially blocked||The Jaipur-Delhi highway remained partially blocked as the farmers’ stir against the Centre’s agriculture laws entered its fourth day on the Haryana-Rajasthan border on Wednesday.Farmers led by Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav and former CPI(M) MLA Amra Ram are agitating on the stretch leading to Delhi in Shahjahanpur of Rajasthan’s Alwar district, which borders Haryana. They had blocked the road on Sunday after police stopped their march to Delhi.“We have not closed the highway. The government has closed it. The authorities should remove barricades and everything will open in 10 minutes. I assure the public,” Yadav told reporters.He said they feel ashamed when people face problems.“Last night, an ambulance arrived. We cleared the way but the Haryana Police did not remove barricades. Who is responsible for this,” he asked.In response to a question, Yadav said if farmers retreat today, then there will be no farmer movement in this country for the next 20-25 years. People will not trust any farmer movement, he said.Kisan Panchayat national president Rampal Chaudhary is also camping at the dharna site in Shahjahanpur. Former MLA Amra Ram claimed the agitation is being backed by farmer leaders from Gujarat and Haryana.He said the roads have been closed to traffic by the Haryana government and its police.

Unlike other vaccines, it can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, making it easier and cheaper to produce and keep – and distribute around the world.According to the UK High Commission, “Millions of the doses made by Serum Institute will be distributed to the world’s poorest people via the global COVAX initiative, in partnership with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Gavi, the vaccine alliance.”“The Foreign Secretary signalled his ambition for a closer UK-India relationship as part of a wider UK focus on our partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. They also spoke about the 10-year roadmap which heralds a new era for the UK and India with an ambitious plan for an Enhanced Trade Partnership (ETP),” the release added.Work on mutual recognition of degrees was agreed upon during Raab’s meeting with Minister for Education Ramesh Pokhriyal. The two also appreciated the collaboration between the University of Edinburgh and the state government to open a new biotechnology university in Gujarat in July next year.Raab also handed over a letter from Johnson, inviting PM Modi to the G7 meeting to be chaired by the UK in 2021.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-seeks-ambitious-roadmap-of-ties-with-uk-185194
16-12-2020||New Delhi||Forming new committee no solution: Protesting farmer leaders on SC suggestion||Protesting farmer unions on Wednesday said constituting a new panel to break the stalemate on the three new agri laws, as indicated by the Supreme Court, is not a solution as they want a complete withdrawal of the legislations.They also said the government should have formed a committee of farmers and others before the laws were enacted by Parliament.Their assertions came after the Supreme Court indicated earlier in the day that it may form a panel having representatives of the government and farmer unions to resolve the deadlock.Read also: SC issues notice to Centre on petitions seeking removal of agitating farmers from Delhi roadsFarmers' forum writes to Centre, rejects proposal to amend farm lawsAbhimanyu Kohar, a leader of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sabha which is one of 40 protesting farmer unions, said they have already rejected a recent government offer to form such a panel.“Setting up a new committee by the court is not a solution. We just want a complete repeal of the three agriculture laws. Earlier, there have been several rounds of talks between a group of Central ministers and farmer unions, which was like a committee itself,” Kohar told PTI.Taking to Twitter, Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav, who is also a member ‘Sankyukt Kisan Morcha’, said, “The SC can and must decide on the constitutionality of the 3 farm acts. But it is not for the judiciary to decide on the feasibility and desirability of these laws. That’s between the farmers and their elected leaders. SC monitored negotiation would be a wrong path.”In another tweet, he said, “This amounts to resurrecting a proposal made by the Govt on 1st December which farmers organisations had rejected unanimously.” The Sankyukt Kisan Morcha is an umbrella body of 40 protesting farmer unions.Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), which has been leading the agitation at Tikri Border, said there would be no meaning of a new committee now.“We will be in the new committee only after the government first repeals the three laws. The government should have formed a committee of farmers and others before enacting the new agriculture laws. There will be no meaning of new committee at this stage,” BKU Ekta Ugrahan’s Punjab general secretary Sukhdev Singh said.However, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said, “We have only seen media reports about the SC order as of now. We want to first see an authentic copy of the order and then see what the government has to say. Only then can we comment on this.”Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court indicated that it may form a committee having representatives of the government and farmer unions across the country to resolve the deadlock.The top court was hearing a batch of applications seeking a direction to authorities to immediately remove the farmers from the roads, saying commuters were facing hardships due to the blockades and the gatherings might lead to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.“Your negotiations have not worked apparently. It is bound to fail. You are saying you are willing to negotiate,” a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.Mehta, who is representing the Centre, replied, “Yes, we are willing to talk to farmers.”Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi border points for the last 20 days now in protest against the three laws that they claim will lead to a dismantling of the mandi system and the Minimum Support Price mechanism, apprehensions that the government has been saying are misplaced.On Tuesday, the leaders of the agitating farmers had asserted they will “make” the Centre repeal the three new agri laws in a hardening of their stand.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.

Besides, a large number of cattle were also attacked by the tiger.The Forest officials are using drones to track the movement of the animal and have advised people not to venture out alone, especially into the jungles.The state officials have attributed the frequent sighting of the tiger in the forests of Kumram Bheem in Asifabad district to easy availability of prey and abundant water sources in the area. The tigers in the area that are said to be moving around in the region include those from neighboring Maharastra’s Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) and reserves of Chhattisgarh.It is estimated that there are about 10 tigers in the region, but only one appears to have turned a man eater.On November 11, a young tribal Sidam Vignesh was killed by the tiger near a stream around Digida village in Dahegaon Mandal. Two men, however, managed to escape, leaving Sidam behind. Again, on November 29, a tribal girl Pasula Nirmala (18) was mauled by the tiger in her fields in Kondapalli village in Penchikalpet Mandal.The tiger has been spotted at least half a dozen times till December 10.The last sighting was in Gunderpalli, Morligudu and Agargudu villages of Penchikalpet Mandal and near the water tank of Siddapur Village in Bejjur Mandal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/panic-prevails-in-telanganas-asifabad-area-due-to-frequent-sighting-of-tiger-185186

16-12-2020||Mumbai||Suicide abetment: HC allows Arnab to challenge chargesheet||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday allowed journalist Arnab Goswami to challenge the chargesheet filed in the 2018 abetment of suicide case against him after it was informed that a magistrates court in Raigad district has taken cognizance of the document.Goswami’s counsel Aabad Ponda told the HC that the magistrates court at Alibag in the adjoining district earlier in the day took cognizance of the chargesheet filed by the police against his client and two others in the suicide case of an interior designer.Ponda then sought time from the high court to amend the petition filed by the Republic TV Editor-in-Chief against the FIR registered by the Alibag police in the more than two-year-old case case to also challenge the chargesheet.A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik accepted the request and directed the magistrates court to issue a copy of the chargesheet to Goswami at the earliest.The chargesheet has been filed before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Sunayna Pingale.The HC said it would hear the matter further on January 6.Goswami and the two other accused were arrested by the Alibag police on November 4 in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik in 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by the companies of the trio.The 47-year-old TV journalist, who has denied charges in the case, had then filed a petition in the HC seeking to quash the FIR and had also sought interim bail.The high court had on November 9 refused to grant interim bail following which Goswami approached the Supreme Court.The apex court on November 11 granted interim bail to Goswami.The police earlier this month filed its chargesheet in the case against Goswami and the two other accused.The news anchor later filed an application in the HC seeking a direction to the magistrate to not take cognizance of the chargesheet.Since the magistrate has just taken cognizance of the chargesheet, we would like to amend the petition and bring the chargesheet on record to challenge the same, Ponda said.He called filing of the chargesheet a “hasty” move.

16-12-2020||New Delhi||Team co-led by Indian scientists solves 100-yr-old mystery of how malaria affects brain||Using brain imaging techniques, scientists, including those from The Center for the Study of Complex Malaria in Odisha, have unravelled the century-old mystery of how malaria affects the brain, an advance which reveals how the deadly disease causes different outcomes in adults and children.According to the researchers, cerebral malaria is a severe, life-threatening complication of infection with the Plasmodium falciparum parasite that can infect humans through the bite of Anopheles mosquitoes.While a fifth of people with this form of the disease die despite treatment, and neurocognitive after-effects are common in survivors, they said the effects of malaria on the brain have puzzled scientists for the last 100 years.The study, published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases on Wednesday, used cutting-edge MRI scans to compare the changes in the brains of survivors with those who died from the disease across different age-groups.“For years, scientists have relied on autopsies to understand the pathology of cerebral malaria, but these don’t allow you to compare between survivors and fatalities,” said Sam Wassmer, a co-lead author of the study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in the UK. “By using neuroimaging techniques to see a snapshot of the living brain, we were able to identify the specific cause of death in adults,” Wassner said.In the study, the scientists assessed 65 patients with cerebral malaria and 26 control patients with ‘uncomplicated’ malaria, who were being treated at Ispat General Hospital in Rourkela.They found that brain swelling tends to decrease with the age of the patient, and that, unlike in children, there was no correlation between brain swelling and death in adult patients from the same cohort.Instead, the researchers said fatal adult cases had severe oxygen deprivation affecting all brain structures, compared to only localised oxygen-deprivation in survivors.They said the findings were corroborated by significantly elevated levels of specific molecules in the blood which indicate oxygen-deprivation.Based on the results, the researchers believe a system could be developed for the identification of patients at risk of developing fatal disease upon admission that could inform their clinical management.“The results suggest the tantalising prospect of targeted treatments for cerebral malaria, and we are now planning clinical trials to test whether adjunctive therapies for oxygen-deprivation are effective for adults,” said Sanjib Mohanty, study co-lead from the Centre for the Study of Complex Malaria.“If successful, this could be a significant step toward reducing the death toll of one of the world’s most deadly diseases,” he added.

The panel had called him on the issue of the citizens’ data safety.Mohan was accompanied by Shivnath Thukral, the public policy director of Facebook.Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, along with Tharoor, questioned Mohan about a recent Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report suggesting that the social media giant is reluctant on banning the Bajrang Dal on its platform due to financial reasons and concerns over the safety of its staff, sources said.The WSJ report suggested that despite an internal assessment calling for a ban on the Bajrang Dal, Facebook has not cracked down on the Hindu nationalist group due to these reasons.Replying to queries, Mohan suggested to the panel members that the Facebook fact team consultant has so far not found any such element in the content posted by the Bajrang Dal that is violative of its social media policies.Further quizzing him, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey asked if the Bajrang Dal content was not found to be violative of its social media policies, then why did the Facebook not deny the WSJ report and termed it as fake.

On December 1, price was hiked by a similar Rs 50 per cylinder.“Rising prices of domestic gas cylinders will only increase financial woes of people. Raising Rs 100 in 15 days is too much and shows how Govt remains insensitive to people’s problems,” Gehlot said in a tweet.Under the NDA government, there is no relief even during this time of economic slowdown and the coronavirus crisis, the Congress leader said in another tweet in Hindi. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-cm-targets-centre-over-lpg-price-hike-185153
16-12-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Ruling LDF surges ahead in Kerala local body polls||The ruling CPI(M)-led LDF in Kerala on Wednesday appeared to make a sweep of the local body polls in the state, while the BJP seemed to have made some gains, leading in Pandalam, the centre of protests against women’s entry into Sabarimala, among others.The Left front was leading in 514 grama panchayats, five corporations and 11 district panchayats, prompting Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to attribute the good show to the people of the state.The outcome of the polls is seen as an indicator of the public mood ahead of the 2021 assembly elections in the state.The Opposition Congress-led UDF was in the second spot, leading in over 400 local bodies.The Left front is also ahead in 108 block panchayats, Vijayan told reporters here.He also took to Twitter to thank the people for reposing faith in the ruling front.“Thank you Kerala. Thank you for reposing faith in LDF.We are humbled by the trust and the confidence of the people of Kerala. This is a victory for secularism and inclusive development,” he said.It was “people’s victory,” he said, adding LDF’s performance is a resounding reply to those who tried to belittle the state’s achievements.The Opposition Congress led UDF was leading in 375 grama panchayats, 44 block panchayats, 45 municipalities and three district panchayats.The BJP is ahead in 23 grama panchayats and two municipalities, including Pandalam, which was the centre of protests against the entry of women of the banned age group into the Sabarimala Ayyappa shrine.The saffron party was ahead in Palakkad municipality also.Though the BJP could not put up a spectacular show, it still seemed to better its 2015 record, where it won 14 grama panchayats and the lone Palakkad municipality, and if the trends hold, could nearly double its seats this time.The BJP had earlier organised state-wide protests against the entry of young women in the age group of 10-50 years into the shrine.UDF leaders—KPCC President Mullapally Ramachandran, Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said the claims that the party-led front had been routed was baseless.The front has not lost ground in any of its traditional bastions.The front’s Political Affairs committee will be meeting on Thursday to take stock of the results, Ramachandran said, adding that the CPI(M) and the LDF need not rejoice.They had not sought votes on the development agenda, he claimed.Chennithala said BJP has managed to do well only in some pockets and had failed to make any inroads and was a “total failure.”“We have fared well in the elections. Over 375 panchayats are with us. The BJP has proved to be a total failure in the state.Even after using all the influence of central agencies, the BJP failed. Yes, we had certain issues which we will address”, he said.The fight against the ‘anti-people’ policies of the central and state governments will be continued, Chennithala said.“When compared with the 2015 local body polls, the UDF did better this time. It’s true that the anti-government sentiments were not seen this time. We will address the failure in each panchayat and move forward after correcting the mistakes”, he said.“Other than in Pandalam and Palakkad, BJP has not made any impact in Kerala. We will look into the reasons behind loss of seats in Thiruvnanthapuram,” Chennithala said.BJP state president K Surendran alleged the UDF and LDF worked together to defeat his party in Thiruvananthapuram.The UDF vote share has gone down drastically. Many communal organisations have also helped the LDF, he alleged.The good show by CPI(M) in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation is the result of an “unholy nexus” between the Left and the Congress, he said, adding the latter had failed in fighting the Left party. They need to introspect, he added.A Vijayaraghavan, LDF convener, who also holds the charge of CPI(M) state secretary, said the poll outcome showed that people have rejected the ‘false campaign’ against the party and the Chief Minister.“Some tried to create controversies out of various allegations. The central probe agencies tried to derail the day-to-day governance of the state. Kerala has never seen any such poisonous campaigning ever. But people rejected all those and stood by the Left government”, he said.The government was going through a very tough time due to various natural calamities, lack of funds from the Centre and the COVID-19 pandemic. But the people saw that the government never let any such adversities affect the people, he said.P K Kunhalikutty, leader of IUML, a constituent of the UDF, said the party had retained its strongholds. The UDF and the Congress have to introspect the election result, he said.Earlier, the three phase polling, as per strict COVID-19 protocol, was held in a total of 21,893 wards in 1,200 local self governing bodies—including six corporations, 941 village panchayats, 14 district panchayats and 87 municipalities on December 8, 10 and 14.

16-12-2020||New Delhi||SC issues notice to Centre on petitions seeking removal of agitating farmers from Delhi roads||The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Centre on petitions seeking removal of agitating farmers from roads in Delhi as commuters faced blockades since November 26 when thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Western UP descended on the national capital.Terming it a "matter of national importance", a Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde said such issues needed to be resolved through negotiations.Asking the petitioners to make farmers' bodies parties to the petition, it said a committee had to be formed of representatives of farmers' organisations and government nominees and other stakeholders to conduct negotiations to resolve the issue.Also read: Forming new committee no solution: Protesting farmer leaders on SC suggestion Farmers' forum writes to Centre, rejects proposal to amend farm laws"We will form a committee to resolve the dispute. It will have members of Bharatiya Kisan Union, Government of India and other farmer organisations. We will ask farmer organisations also to be a part of the committee as it will soon become a national issue," the CJI noted."All of you sit together. Prepare a tentative list of committee members," the CJI said posting the matter for Thursday.On behalf of the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted that the government was in talks with the farmers. Members of BKU and some others were protesting at the site but some other elements had joined the protests, Mehta alleged without identifying the "other elements". He said the government would not do anything against farmers' interests.As Delhi government counsel Rahul Mehra demanded repeal of farm laws, Mehta said the NCT government had no role in the matter.There are several petitions on the issue. One of the petitioners, Rishabh Sharma, contended that "since the virus is spreading rapidly and the cases of Covid are increasing day-by-day in Delhi, it is paramount that this protest be stopped immediately".He demanded that the Delhi borders should be opened and protesters shifted to a designated place where they should follow norms, including physical distancing, to check the spread of Covid.The petitioner contended it's "very necessary" to remove the gathering as it blocked roads for all the emergency/medical services needed to stop the increasing spread of Covid.Many people were frequently travelling to Delhi from different states in order to get treatment in big government hospitals situated in the capital, Sharma pointed out.He submitted "that life of lakhs of people protesting at the Delhi borders is under immediate threat since the virus is very contagious and if by chance the coronavirus takes the shape of community spread, it will cause havoc in the country".Sharma sought "immediate intervention" of the top court to restrict the mass gathering of people at a particular place.The petitioner said Delhi Police allowed protesters to hold demonstration peacefully at Nirankari Ground, Burari, in north Delhi, but despite that they blocked the borders of Delhi, preventing people from using roads.Citing the top court's recent verdict in Amit Sahni versus Commissioner of Police and Others, Sharma said protests which blocked the public way and caused grave inconvenience to commuters could not be allowed, and indeterminable number of people could not assemble wherever they chose to protest.The petitioner said he moved the top court as the people affected by such irresponsible acts of the protesters and the state were not in a position to remove them, for they were huge in number even as the protest caused a lot of trouble to citizens.Noting that Covid was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11 and the government had issued various guidelines to restrict public gatherings to a maximum of 50 people, Sharma said despite that more than three lakh farmers had gathered on Delhi borders to protest against the farm laws.The farmers' organisations which have been added as parties to the case are: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU–Rakesh Tikait), BKU-Sidhupur (Jagjeet S Dallewal), BKU-Rajewal (Balbeer Singh Rajewal), BKU-Lakhowal (Harinder Singh Lakhowal), Jamhoori Kisan Sabha (Kulwant Singh Sandhu), BKU-Dakaunda (Buta Singh Burjgill), BKU–Doaba (Manjit Singh Rai) and Kul Hind Kisan Federation (Prem Singh Bhangu).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-petitions-seeking-removal-of-agitating-farmers-from-delhi-roads-185133
16-12-2020||New Delhi||HC seeks Centre, AAP govt responses on PIL for back wages to child, bonded labourers||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought the responses of the Centre and the AAP government on a Public Interest Litigation seeking recovery of back wages due to rescued child and bonded labourers.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan issued notices to the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Delhi government and the police over the plea filed by the father of a now-rescued child labourer."Give us a detailed status report," the bench said, and listed the matter for January 22. In his plea filed through advocates Kriti Awasthi and Nimisha Menon, the petitioner has sought an expeditious recovery of the back wages due to his child as well as to 115 other victims of bonded labour in whose cases the recovery process has been initiated after they were rescued.The plea also seeks directions to the authorities to “initiate the recovery proceedings in 77 cases where recovery, till date, has not been initiated”.The petitioner has contended that the authorities have allegedly failed to recover the back wages of his child and those of other similarly placed victims of bonded labour who are entitled to such relief as per various high court judgments. The petition has said that such recovered amounts would serve as a rehabilitative financial assistance for the rescued victims of child and bonded labour.The plea has further contended that various government schemes and policies also entitle such children/victims to back wages.The petitioner has claimed that his child was entitled to the back wages within seven days from the date of being rescued, which was in 2014, but nothing has been done in six years.Similar is the situation of other rescued victims of child and bonded labour, the plea has claimed, and added that the back wages have not been received by them despite being identified as bonded labourers and receiving their release certificates.The petition has contended that if the amounts are not received, these victims would be prone to be re-trafficked. The petitioner has claimed that his child was working as a bonded labourer when he was just eight-year-old and worked for one-and-a-half years before he was rescued in 2014."During the course of his employment, the petitioner's child, was subjected to severe abuse for over a period of one-and-a-half-years at the hands of the trafficker/employer who inhumanely compelled the child to work for around 12 hours a day and for wages less than the prescribed minimum wages."The rights of the petitioner's child as envisaged under Article 19, 21 and 23 of the Constitution of India were infringed. The petitioner's child was illegally forced to work as a child bonded labourer without basic wages, and in aberration of his liberties suffered the most dehumanizing treatment," the petition has said. Back wages envisages to correct wage violations by requiring the employer to make up for the difference between what the employee was paid and the amount he should have been paid.

16-12-2020||Washington||US Congress passes defence policy bill that calls out Chinese aggression against India||The US Congress has officially passed the USD 740 billion defence policy bill, which among other things include calling out Chinese aggression against India along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The US House of Representatives and the Senate on Tuesday passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which included key components of Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi's resolution language urging the Chinese government to end its military aggression against India along the LAC.China and India have been locked in a military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh since May this year. Several rounds of talks between the two countries to resolve the standoff have not yielded any concrete outcome.The House and Senate versions of the bill were reconciled by a bipartisan Congressional conference committee earlier this month.The inclusion of this provision, which Krishnamoorthi led as an amendment when the bill passed the House, reflects the US government's strong support for its allies and partners like India in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.Krishnamoorthi's measure, which passed each chamber with overwhelming bipartisan support, will become law if President Donald Trump signs it.Trump has threatened to veto the bill as it lacks a repeal of legal protections for social media companies. However, the NDAA has been passed by Congress for the last 59 years.“Violent aggression is seldom the answer, and this is especially true for the Line of Actual Control, which is the disputed border region that separates the People's Republic of China from India,” Krishnamoorthi said.“By including my resolution language in the NDAA and signing that legislation into law, the United States government will send a clear message that China's military provocations of India will not be tolerated,” he said.“The United States is committed to standing with our allies and partners like India in resolving the border standoff using diplomatic means,' Krishnamoorthi said.As approved by the conference report, the powerful NDAA says that it is the sense of the Congress on the aggression of China along the border with India and its growing territorial claims.The Senate agreed to include the provisions of the bill that was passed by the House in its version of the bill.The House bill contained provisions that would express the sense of Congress on cross-border violence between China and India and the growing territorial claims of Beijing.Expressing "significant concern" over the continued military aggression by China along the border with India, the NDAA says that China "should work with" India toward de-escalating the situation along the Line of Actual Control through existing diplomatic mechanisms and refrain from attempting to settle disputes through coercion or force.Attempts by China to advance baseless territorial claims, including those in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and with respect to Bhutan, are destabilising and inconsistent with international law, says the bill.China is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims.Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.

No statue or memorial should be desecrated and certainly not one like that of Gandhi who really fought for the values that America represents of peace, justice, and freedom." "It is appalling that it has happened more than once and we believe the reputation of Mahatma Gandhi should be respected, especially here in America's capital," she said.A State Department spokesperson said on Tuesday that they were aware of recent protests in front of the Indian Embassy in Washington DC."We take our responsibility to provide for the safety and security of foreign missions in the US very seriously and are discussing the recent incident with the Indian Embassy," the spokesperson said.Hundreds of Sikhs from in and around Greater Washington DC area, Maryland and Virginia, along with many from other states like New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina, on Saturday undertook a car rally to the Indian embassy in downtown Washington DC, where they gathered to express solidarity with the protesting Indian farmers.However, the peaceful protest was soon hijacked by the separatist Sikhs who were carrying Khalistani flags with anti-India posters and banners.During the protest, many of the pro-Khalistan Sikh youths flashing kirpans jumped on the statue of Mahatma Gandhi and pasted a poster over it. The group raised anti-India and pro-Khalistan slogans.The Indian embassy condemned the "mischievous act" by hooligans masquerading as protesters."The statue of Mahatma Gandhi at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Plaza in front of the embassy was defaced by Khalistani elements on 12 December 2020. The Embassy strongly condemns this mischievous act by hooligans masquerading as protesters against the universally respected icon of peace and justice," it said in a statement.The embassy said it has lodged a strong protest with the US law enforcement agencies and also taken up the matter with the Department of State for an early investigation and action against the culprits under the applicable law. The statue of Mahatma Gandhi was unveiled by then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the presence of then US president Bill Clinton on September 16, 2000, after the US Congress passed a law in 1998.This is for the second time that Gandhi's statue has been desecrated by miscreants this year.The first such incident was reported on the intervening night of June 2 and 3 when unknown miscreants vandalised his statue outside the Indian embassy in the US with graffiti and spray painting, prompting the mission to register a complaint with the local law enforcement agencies.Vandalism of the statue of the apostle of peace happened during the week of nationwide protests against the custodial killing of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.

Whenever there will be one, we will call you. It is a peaceful struggle,” he said, while asking the Nihangs not to practise martial arts at the protest site. Nihang leader Deep Singh Khalsa said they had come to support farmers. “The leaders because of their selfish interests want us to go back,” he alleged.Rajewal’s statement was also criticised on social media. He later said his motive was not to hurt anybody’s sentiments.The unions have decided that each organisation would deploy 50 volunteers to keep an eye on anyone trying to hijack their struggle. “We had three options. Either to allow this struggle to become a sarva dharma sammelan, one dharma sammelan or let it be farmers’ sammelan. We obviously chose the last option,” said Raminder Singh Patiala, state committee member of the Kirti Kisan Union.A farmer leader, preferring anonymity, said even their own leaders had been asked refrain from using religious text in their speeches.Similarly, youngsters have been asked to not use abusive language against BJP leaders and stop playing midnight DJs and vulgar songs. “It has been our tradition to protect dignity of women.

The book is slated for a launch in January 2021.Mukherjee’s daughter Sharmishtha, who has custody of his diaries, however, snubbed her brother, saying he should not do disservice to their father for some “cheap publicity”.“I, daughter of the author of the memoir ‘The Presidential Years’, request my brother @ABHIJIT_LS not to create any unnecessary hurdle in the publication of the last book written by our father. He completed the manuscript before he fell sick. The final draft contains my dad’s handwritten notes and comments that have been strictly adhered to. The views expressed by him are his own and no one should try to stop it from being published for any cheap publicity. That would be the greatest disservice to our father,” she said. Her reaction came after her brother earlier tweeted tagging Rupa, “I, the son of the author of ‘The Presidential Years’ request you to kindly stop the publication of the memoirs as well as motivated excerpts which are already floating around certain media platforms without my written consent.” Abhijit said his father would have done the same had he been alive.Last week, Rupa released excerpts from the book in which Mukherjee blames Sonia and Manmohan Singh for the party’s dismal 2014 showing.The late President writes, “Some members of the Congress have theorized that, had I become the PM in 2004, the party might have averted the 2014 Lok Sabha drubbing. Though I don’t subscribe to this view, I do believe that the party leadership lost political focus after my elevation as President.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pranabs-family-spars-over-his-memoirs-184848

Earlier this week, a big question mark was put on the support it enjoys after no one turned up in response to its call to gherao the Indian High Commission in London last Friday. The lawsuit was filed before the “Howdy Modi” rally in the US in September last year and was intended to act as an irritant during PM Modi’s week-long visit to Houston and Washington. It had challenged the abolition of Article 370 and reorganisation of J&K into two Union Territories. Sources here said the brain behind the lawsuit was SFJ’s Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who is facing a chargesheet in India along with several other separatists living abroad. The case was dismissed as the litigant, the Kashmir Khalistan Referendum Front, and two other complainants identified as “TFK” and “SMS” did not attend two consecutive hearings.
