13-08-2020||New Delhi||Each degree rise in heat index led to 187 MW increase in power demand: CSE||Every degree rise in heat index resulted in 187 megawatt increase in electricity demand during Covid-19 lockdown, which was 6 per cent higher than in 2019, according to a new analysis.The analysis by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) was on electricity demand and its correlation with weather data during the successive stages of lockdown and unlocking in Delhi.The analysis stated that this trend was largely driven by heat stress and cooling demand in the residential sector.It said the overall level of electricity demand reduced during hard lockdown but with partial unlocking and even with much lower level of economic activities, heat wave combined with thermal discomfort in poorly designed buildings spiked the peak demand again – taking it quite close to the peaks of previous summers.“Higher heat stress this summer combined with thermal discomfort in poorly designed buildings and increased dependence on air conditioning upset the energy budget. Every degree rise in heat index resulted in 187 MW increase in electricity demand during lockdown- 6 per cent higher than in 2019,” says the CSE analysis.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, CSE, said understanding this connection is critical as climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of heatwaves in the future.“If built environment is not designed for thermal comfort, heat stress will increase cooling demand and use of energy-intensive mechanical cooling systems, thus undoing the carbon savings from other energy efficiency measures,” she said.Roychowdhury says that according to the World Energy Outlook of the International Energy Agency, cities account for nearly 70 per cent of the global consumption of electricity. In its study, CSE carried out a rapid analysis of real-time electricity demand during the lockdown and unlocking phases in Delhi.It accessed real-time electricity consumption data of 5-minute granularity from the State Load Dispatch Centre in Delhi, the apex body responsible for integrated operations of Delhi’s power system, the CSE said in a statement.The analysis has considered the time slots such as Pre-lockdown from January 1 to March 21, lockdown 1.0 - March 22 to April 14, lockdown 2.0 - April 15 to May 3, lockdown 3.0 - May 4 to May 17, lockdown 4.0 - May 18 to May 31.Also, Unlock 1.0 -June 1-30 and Unlock 2.0 - July 1-30.As per Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager with CSE’s Urban Data Analytic Lab, “Delhi is a big energy guzzler and makes an important case study”.“CSE’s earlier analysis in 2018 and 2019 had found that Delhi’s peak electricity demand was consistently higher than Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai taken together.      “Delhi’s appetite for electricity has almost tripled since 2000. Domestic and commercial consumers together accounted for almost 75-80 per cent of annual electricity consumption in Delhi during the period 2010 to 2017. On an average, an electrified household in Delhi consumed about 260 kWh of electricity monthly in 2016–17, that was up from 155 kWh in 2000, which is almost three times the national figure of 90 kWh,” he said.Roychowdhury said, “There is a message for the post-pandemic ‘new normal’. The learning from the lockdown phases challenge the current approaches that predominantly focus on energy efficient cooling systems and do not pay adequate attention to the architectural design and material and heat management strategies to reduce the overall thermal load on buildings and the city.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/each-degree-rise-in-heat-index-led-to-187-mw-increase-in-power-demand-cse-126062

It will be conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA) in pen and paper-based mode.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-possible-to-hold-neet-overseas-nta-tells-sc-126059

The hearings have often been hit by technical glitches.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bar-council-of-india-demands-free-laptops-ipads-wifi-for-lawyers-126050
13-08-2020||---||Maharashtra, Delhi move to cancel final-year exams ‘entirely wrong’, UGC tells SC||New Delhi, August 13Terming the decisions taken by governments of Maharashtra and Delhi to cancel final-year university examinations as “entirely wrong”, the University Grants Commission (UGC) on Thursday asserted that its July 6 guidelines setting September 30 deadline for such examinations were binding on state universities.In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court ahead of Friday hearing, the UGC pointed out that the Maharashtra Government’s stand was contradictory inasmuch as it wanted the final year examinations to be cancelled but new academic session to commence.“Needless to say, those alleged circumstances should then prevent even the commencement of the next academic session. That apart, the State Govt. avers that the next academic session must begin in the interest of students, while, at the same time, contending that the final examinations should be cancelled and degrees can be awarded without such examinations even though such a step would irreparably damage the future of students,” the UGC said, terming Maharashtra government’s contention as “meritless”.It also attacked the Delhi Government’s decision to “unilaterally” cancel the final year examinations and to allow graduate students to use alternative assessment measures in contravention of the UGC’s guidelines even though it was required to hold such examinations in the interest of students.“Decision taken by Delhi government will impact the standard of higher education in the country which the UGC is mandated to maintain,” it submitted.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan is to take up on Friday petitions challenging the UGC’s July 6 circular mandating holding of final year examinations by September 30.The higher education regulator had earlier told the top court that not holding examinations will not be in students’ interest as their degrees may not be recognised if the states would act unilaterally and cancel final year examinations in violation of UGC norms.States couldn’t change the UGC rules which only the regular of higher education was empowered to prescribe for awarding degrees, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing UGC, had told a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, which had earlier refused to stay the UGC’s decision.The UGC maintained that its decision was taken “after due deliberation by taking into account and balancing all relevant factors” and that its circular was issued to “protect the academic future of students”, while keeping in mind their “health and safety”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-delhi-move-to-cancel-final-year-exams-entirely-wrong-ugc-tells-sc-126043

This will ensure a reduction in the number of deaths due to non-availability of organs,” said Gandhi on the occasion of the National Organ Donors Day.India’s rate of deceased organ donation remains among the lowest in the world less than 1 per million.In Spain and Croatia, the corresponding rates are 46.9 and 38.6 per million, respectively.Despite the easing of national organ donation laws and policy push by the government, the gap between annual demand of organs for transplant and their availability in India remains huge.Health Ministry data show that annually the following number of persons need organ and tissue transplant—kidneys (2.5 lakh), liver (80,000), heart (50,000), cornea (one lakh). Actual number of organ transplants done every year is acutely low—kidneys (160), liver (33), heart (45) and cornea (2,188).Medical experts have repeatedly said they can save several road accident victims if the country reaches satisfactory levels of organ donations.As per latest data India saw 4.61 lakh road accidents in a year involving 1.49 lakh deaths.Doctors say there are two kinds of organ donations. One is deceased organ donation. The other is living donor organ donation.Living donor has to be a person above 18 years and it means any person above 18 years can pledge to donate one kidney (the other is capable of maintaining body functions); a portion of pancreas (half the pancreas are enough to sustain required functions) and a part of the liver (segments of liver will regenerate after some time in both the donor and the recipient) in their lifetime.People can pledge organs online through the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) website www.notto.gov.in||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/put-all-adults-in-organ-donor-registry-varun-gandhi-to-move-bill-126041

13-08-2020||New Delhi||Adani warns of growth being hit if rural-to-urban migration is not checked||Billionaire Gautam Adani on Thursday said India’s growth may be hampered unless rural-to-urban migration is not tackled by developing a model to keep local population employed locally in rural areas.Addressing students of Anand-based Institute of Rural Management in Gujarat, he called for cluster-based policies and adoption of digital technologies to promote agriculture and food processing units.“The total number of migrant workers in India exceeds 100 million. One in four workers in India is a migrant. Some migration is beneficial. However, unless we tackle the issue of continued increase in rural-to-urban migration, India’s growth will be hampered,” he said.The rural-urban imbalance reflects the inequality of opportunities that need to be addressed, he added.“I am sure all of you vividly remember the recent moving images of tens of millions of migrant workers trying to get back to their villages because of the COVID-19 crisis,” he said.“More than ever before, we must now develop a model of a rural economy wherein local populations can be employed locally. This will mean that we need to rethink how our local economies are structured and clustered.”  Adani, who heads India’s largest infrastructure conglomerate that spans from ports to power, cited the example of Israel that merged learnings from a rural kibbutz-based culture with modern technology and made self-sufficiency an absolute mantra.“The COVID-19 crisis has forced upon us a chance to rethink the rural development model,” he said.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has outlined a vision of ‘Aatmanirbhar Agriculture’ that calls for transforming farmers into entrepreneurs.“India already has a head start as the world’s largest producer of milk, pulses, banana, mango and papaya, and the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, groundnut, vegetables, fruit and cotton. This is a great launchpad,” he said.At the same time, there are four underlying challenges — shrinking arable land as a result of over-cultivation, overgrazing, urbanisation, and chemical overuse; unpredictability as a result of climate change, water availability and the knock-on impact on output; current lack of productivity and supply chain inefficiencies; and shortage of value-adding processing facilities in terms of numbers, scale, and locations.“The common opinion is that success in agriculture is based on scale. While this is generally true, recent advances in areas like digitisation, seed quality, and weather forecasting, combined with smart policymaking and general public awareness, have opened up the agriculture sector in several ways,” he said.Outlining the aspects that will define the agriculture landscape, he said there is an increasing realisation that the concept of clustering and agriculture efficiency go hand-in-hand.“Cluster policies are crucial for small-scale farmers and agribusiness. It enables them to achieve higher productivity, higher value-added production, and to minimise the back-breaking costs of logistics, storage, wastage, and interference from the middlemen,” he said.India is made up of over 700 districts and each district is a potential self-sufficient microcluster, he said.A cluster is a geographic concentration of interconnected businesses and institutions that help build an array of competitive entities.This approach can be used to develop targeted clusters of 15 to 20 proximate villages with populations of 30-40 lakh, he said.Adani said the coronavirus pandemic has exposed fundamental faultines in the current way societies engage and consume.“Going ahead, globalisation and trade will be different, national and international policies will be different, healthcare will be different, and supply chains will be different,” he said.However, India will continue its journey to be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.Stating that food processing is key, he said the unorganised food processing sector in India comprises about 25 lakh units, 66 per cent of which are in rural areas.These units contribute 74 per cent of employment in this sector.“While India is the second-largest food producer in the world, less than 10 per cent of the total produce is processed into value-added products. As a comparison, the US processes 65 per cent. Developing countries such as the Philippines, and Brazil process as much as 75 per cent of their produce,” he said.He also added that the primary reasons for India’s low food processing numbers are the lack of processing facilities at the right locations.This has a cascading impact on storage, wastage, and price realisation.

And it is in fact Pakistan that has repeatedly effected administrative and demographic changes in territories that it has occupied illegally and forcibly in J&K and Ladakh,” it said.Pakistan’s unprovoked ceasefire violations, numbering close to 3,000 in the first seven months of 2020 alone, provide support for terrorist infiltration along the Line of Control (LOC), the statement added.The Global Times has declined to carry the Indian Embassy’s response, the mission said. “The Global Times @globaltimesnews declined to carry the Indian Embassy’s response to this interview,” the Embassy tweeted on Thursday.The Embassy also attached to the tweet its detailed response which Global Times, part of the ruling Communist Party of China’s (CPC) publications, has declined to carry. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-rejects-lies-and-half-truths-on-j-k-penned-by-pak-envoy-to-china-126031

Responding to Lalan Singh’s jibe, the LJP in turn called him ‘Surdas’. LJP spokesperson Mohammed Ashraf said it was due to the blessings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Nitish Kumar was the CM. “Chirag Paswan only reiterated what Prime Minister Modi said. I think Lalan Singh has become ‘Surdas’ who cannot differentiate between good and bad,” the LJP leader said.After Prime Minister Narendra Modi views that states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat should step up testing, Chirag Paswan had said: “The LJP has been demanding from the very beginning that testing needs to be increased in Bihar. After Prime Minister Modi’s intervention we are not only hopeful but confident that Bihar government will increase the rate of testing so that the state can be protected against coronavirus.”Quite obviously the main cause of the friction is the issue of seat-sharing and struggle for better share and power. According to Chirag Paswan, his party is ready to contest on all 243 assembly seats and that its alliance in Bihar is only with BJP. Meanwhile, BJP leaders dub the cold war between its two Bihar partners as “natural posturing among allies before division of seats”. Chirag Paswan had been targeting JD-U and CM Nitish Kumar regarding his handling of the migrants’ crisis, the pandemic, floods and also the response to the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput who belongs to Bihar. Much before the FIR was eventually registered in Patna, the LJP had been questioning Nitish Kumar on his silence and the reason why he was not talking to his Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray for a CBI probe in the death of Rajput.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kalidas-vs-surdas-nda-allies-jd-u-ljp-lock-horns-ahead-of-bihar-polls-126030
13-08-2020||Jaipur||Gehlot, Pilot shake hands; all set for confidence vote in Rajasthan assembly||Sachin Pilot shook hands on Thursday with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, the image marking the patch-up between the two party factions in the state ahead of the assembly session where the Congress government is set to face a floor test.The BJP said after a legislature party meeting that it will move a no-confidence motion against the Gehlot government in the session which begins on Friday. Hours later, the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) met and announced that it would seek a confidence vote to prove its majority.With the disgruntled MLAs led by Pilot back in the party-fold following the intervention of the top leadership, the Congress is likely to pass the floor test.In a House of 200, the party has 107 MLAs and the support of independents and allies. The BJP has 72 members.When Pilot got down from his car at the chief minister’s residence, he was received by Govind Singh Dotasra, who has replaced him as the party’s state unit president.Pilot was also sacked as the state’s deputy chief minister and Gehlot referred to him as “useless”, using the Hindi term “nikamma”.The fault line persisted even after the party high command welcomed Pilot back, promising that a committee will look into his grievances.MLAs loyal to Gehlot, still camping together at a hotel, expressed dissatisfaction with the dissidents’ return. But the chief minister has urged them to “forgive and forget”, and move on.The truce – at least for now – was reflected in the meeting between Gehlot and Pilot at the chief minister’s residence, ahead of the CLP meeting.Party leaders K C Venugopal, Avinash Pande, Randeep Surjewala and Ajay Maken had travelled from New Delhi to Jaipur for the MLAs meeting, and the first face-to-face interaction between Gehlot and Pilot after the month-long crisis.Govind Singh Dotasra was also there as the two leaders shook hands, and then all of them posed together for the cameras.The party had put out a similar picture following the reconciliation between the two after the 2018 assembly polls, when Gehlot was picked by the party for chief minister’s post and Pilot settled agreed to be his deputy.The CLP meeting was also attended by the 18 MLAs who had revolted along with Sachin Pilot, a party leader said.“Everything went on well. Now the Congress is united,” AICC general secretary K C Venugopal told reporters after the meeting. He added that the MLAs will fight the BJP’s politics unitedly.At the CLP meeting, where Sachin Pilot also spoke, Gehlot urged MLAs to put the acrimony of the past month behind them, leaders said.He also assured that everyone’s grievances will be addressed, a signal perhaps to Pilot who has claimed that the issues that concern him were not being taken care of.On Gehlot’s call, all MLAs raised in a show of unity, a party leader said.Earlier in the day, Congress general secretary Avinash Pande announced that the party is revoking the suspension of two MLAs, who were part of the group led by Pilot.The Congress had taken action against Bhanwarlal Sharma and Vishvendra Singh, accusing them of being part of an alleged attempt to “topple” the Gehlot government. Singh was also sacked as the state’s tourism minister.On Thursday, he told PTI that he remained a party worker and will fulfil any responsibility assigned to him.Singh also reminded that the party high command has assured the MLAs in the Pilot camp that there will be no vindictive action against them.The assembly session will be stormy, BJP state president Satish Poonia predicted after the legislature party meeting.“The BJP will move a no-confidence motion in the assembly. We are getting ready our proposal, which will be signed by our MLAs. We will include all points like mismanagement in handling the coronavirus pandemic and the deteriorating law and order situation,” Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria told reporters.The BJP MLAs’ meeting was also attended by the party’s national vice president Avinash Rai Khanna, former CM Vasundhara Raje and Union minister Narendra Tomar.In the high court, arguments continued on petitions challenging the merger last year of six Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs with the Congress in Rajasthan.The BSP and and a BJP MLA had filed petitions against the assembly Speaker’s decision to allow the merger. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gehlot-pilot-shake-hands-all-set-for-confidence-vote-in-rajasthan-assembly-126028

The airbase is situated at an altitude of 16,600 feet.In June, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria made a quiet visit to Ladakh and Srinagar air bases to review the IAF’s overall preparedness.In the last two months, the IAF deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the LAC.The IAF has been carrying out night time combat air patrols over the eastern Ladakh region in an apparent message to China that it was ready to deal with any eventualities in the mountainous region.The IAF has also deployed Apache attack choppers as well as Chinook heavy-lift helicopters to transport troops to various forward locations in eastern Ladakh.

Recently, India completed the Supreme Court building in Mauritius, another Indian Ocean island-country with which diplomatic ties have been intensified."Once implemented, GMCP will render the Chinese project insignificant in comparison. It will help in demonstrating India’s overarching presence through a high-visibility project in the Greater Malé region and showcase India’s expertise in conceptualising and implementing a complex infrastructural project of this scale,’’ said sources.The project will connect the national capital Male with eastern islands Villingili, Gulhifahu (where a port is being built under Indian LoC) and Thilafushi (new industrial zone).Jaishankar also said a cargo ferry service between India and Maldives will begin shortly. India renewed Maldives’ quotas for the supply of essential commodities ranging from potatoes and eggs to river sand.India’s total financial commitment in the Maldives covering all loan and grant projects is well over $ 2 billion, all of which have been announced after President Solih came to power in November 2018.Apart from the project, India is helping out the Maldives in all possible ways. With tourism and fish exports coming to a grinding halt in March, the Maldivian economy is under immense strain and its President personally called up PM Modi to seek financial assistance.To help shore up its forex reserves, India has provided $ 150 million to the Maldives and it can avail another $ 250 million till July 2021.The Maldives has been the biggest beneficiary of Indian aid during the pandemic. India donated 5.5 tonnes of essential medicines, helped in the evacuation of Maldivians from Wuhan, provided 580 tonnes of food aid and deployed a medical team.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-assisted-venture-to-dwarf-chinese-bridge-in-maldives-as-most-visible-project-125997

He was then sacked as deputy chief minister and the party's Rajasthan chief.We have to put all our energies in this fight to save democracy with the spirit of forgive & forget and move forward."Whatever misunderstanding occurred in the party in the last one month, we need to forgive and forget in the interest of the country, the state, the people and in the interest of democracy," Gehlot said in a tweet."We have to put all our energies in this fight to save democracy with the spirit of forgive and forget and move forward," he wrote on Twitter.The Rajasthan Chief Minister claimed a "very dangerous" game to undermine the democracy is going on in the country.The struggle of the Congress is to save democracy under the leadership of the party president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, he said."Save democracy should be our priority with the spirit of forgive and forget. The conspiracy that is going on to topple elected governments one by one in the country, the way governments were toppled in the states of Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and other states."How ED, CBI, Income Tax, the judiciary have been misused, it is a very dangerous game that is going on to undermine democracy," Gehlot said in a series of tweets.Ahead of the Assembly session beginning Friday, the dissidents MLAs have reached Jaipur following the intervention of the Congress high command on Monday.The MLAs in the Gehlot camp were on Wednesday flown back to Jaipur from Jaisalmer, where they were together at another hotel.They were taken straight from the airport to the Fairmont hotel on the outskirts of the city, where they had stayed before being moved to Jaisalmer.

The ED wants to know about the people who visited Sushant in the last one year—who all were there at his home; if any meetings took place; and what were the things that were discussed.The agency will also ask them who saw the body of the late actor first after his death. The ED wants to know if financial things were discussed and how was the behaviour of Rhea and her family members with the late actor. The ED registered a case of money laundering on July 31 on the basis of the Bihar Police FIR against his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her family members. The Bihar Police registered a case on the basis of Sushant's father K.K. Singh's complaint on July 25.Singh in his complaint alleged transactions worth Rs 15 crore from the Kotak Mahindra bank account of his son to some unknown bank accounts.The ED has till date recorded the statement of Sushant's sister Mitu Singh, who resides in Mumbai; Rhea, her father Indrajit, brother Showik, Sushant's ex-manager and Rhea's manager Shruti Modi, Sushant's house manager Samuel Miranda, actor's flatmate Siddharth Pithani, Chartered Accountant Sandeep Sridhar and Rhea's CA Ritesh Shah in connection with the case.The source said that the agency will also scrutinise the documents that has been collected from Rhea, Showik, Indrajit, Shruti Modi and others during their questioning.The agency after scrutinising the documents will decide whether to summon the named accused in the agency's ECIR. The CBI has also registered a case in Sushant's death case on August 7 on the recommendation from the central government after the Bihar government demanded for the central agency's probe. The 34-year-old actor who was from Purnea in Bihar, was found dead in his Bandra flat in Mumbai on June 14.

13-08-2020||New Delhi||No FIR was lodged in Sushant Singh Rajput case in Mumbai due to political pressure: Bihar to SC||The Bihar government in its written submission to the Supreme Court on Thursday said that on account of political pressure in Maharashtra, neither an FIR was lodged nor any cooperation was provided to Bihar Police in the case in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.The Supreme Court has reserved the order on the plea of main accused Rhea Chakraborty seeking transfer of the case registered in Patna to Mumbai. On Tuesday, the apex court reserved the order and asked all the parties in the case to file their written submissions. "It is apparent that it is on account of political pressure in the State of Maharashtra that neither the FIR has been registered by the Mumbai Police nor did they extend any cooperation to Bihar Police in discharging their obligation to conduct investigation expeditiously," said the Bihar government in its submissions before the top court. Senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing the Bihar government, had argued on similar lines.Criticizing the quarantine of senior Bihar police officer in Maharashtra, the government said, "Whereas on the one hand, the State of Bihar and its officials had acted with all sense of responsibility and regard to authorities of State of Maharashtra, sadly, it has met with complete absence of reciprocation by similar conduct by the authorities of the State of Maharashtra." The written submissions also cited that Rhea in the transfer petition relied upon a tweet to the Union Home Minister requesting for investigation by the CBI. "Even in the Additional Affidavit, Petitioner has stated that she has reiterated for investigation by CBI," said the Nitish Kumar government.The state government argued that the attention of the apex court is also invited to the provision of Section 406 of the CrPC, whereunder it has been envisaged to make a prayer for transfer of a case. Whenever there is information regarding commission of a cognizable offence, u/s 154(1) Cr.P.C. it is mandatory to register an FIR and conduct investigation immediately and expeditiously. "No doubt or dispute with regard to jurisdiction would permit, in any manner whatsoever, to cause any impediment in the expeditious conduct of the investigation.

Then it got listed before Justice Mishra's Bench which is seized of two criminal contempt cases against Bhushan.The petitioners had challenged Section 2(c)(i) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, that defines 'criminal contempt' as publication of anything - whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever - which scandalises or tends to scandalise, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court.Section 2(c)(I)  was a manifestly arbitrary and vague provision of law which violated right to equality and right to free speech guaranteed under the Constitution, they had contended."The broad and ambiguous wording of the sub-section violates Article 14 by leaving the offence open to differing and inconsistent applications. This uncertainty in the manner in which the law applies renders it manifestly arbitrary and violates the right to equal treatment," they had submitted.Terming it as unconstitutional, they had argued, "It is incompatible with preambular values and basic features of the Constitution, it violates Article 19(1)(a), is unconstitutionally and incurably vague, and is manifestly arbitrary. "The offence of "scandalising the court" is rooted in colonial assumptions and objects, which have no place in legal orders committed to democratic constitutionalism and the maintenance of an open robust public sphere," the petition read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/n-ram-arun-shourie-prashant-bhushan-withdraw-pil-challenging-validity-of%C2%A0-criminal-contempt-125975

13-08-2020||New Delhi||PM unveils 'fearless' tax scrutiny; faceless appeals to start from Sept 25||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched a platform to provide faceless assessment and appeal in income tax cases, which he said was part of the process to overhaul colonial-era tax laws."The previous system, instead of expanding the taxpayer base, was harassing honest businessmen, workers and those providing employment,’’ observed the PM while also launching the taxpayers' charter, first announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her Budget speech.The Prime Minister said after Independence, the coercive and colonial system of tax collection was only tinkered with. "But largely the system and the character remained the same. As a result, the taxpayer, who is a strong pillar of national development, was put in the dock.""Soch and approach dono badal gayi (Both the thinking and approach have changed). Reforms should be policy-based, holistic and one reform should form the basis for further reforms,’’ the PM observed while pointing out that earlier regimes would label changes made under pressure as reforms and they would become an end to themselves. "We not done just one reform. There have been constant efforts over the last few years,’" said the PM while pointing to the junking of 1,500 outdated laws, a huge improvement in the ease of doing business and major changes in laws and rules. "Seeing this commitment the trust of foreign investors has increased leading to record inflow of foreign direct investment even during the Corona period," he underlined.The PM said the changes were due to four reasons: policy-driven governance, narrowing of grey areas of discretion, limiting human interface by use of technology, and awarding efficiency in bureaucracy.The earlier system enabled the flourishing of 'black and white' because it was complex. The new GST slab system has removed the need for unnecessarily providing several documents; schemes like 'Vivad Se Vishwas' have helped resolve three lakh cases out of court and the IT system is being made seamless, painless and faceless. The PM said the taxpayer charter will balance between the responsibilities and duties of a taxpayer and also fix the responsibilities of the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-unveils-fearless-tax-scrutiny-faceless-appeals-to-start-from-sept-25-125966

And even after the restrictions were relaxed, it has decided to continue with the practice.In the last week of July, the seven-judge panel headed by the senior most judge Justice NV Ramana had apprised the Bar leaders of its decision to not open the apex court for physical hearings "for the time being" and had assured to meet them again after two weeks to reconsider the issue.Now, Shivaji M Jadhav, president of the Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association (SCAORA), said that the judges' committee met the Bar leaders on Tuesday and "is seriously considering to start at least 2-3 physical courts from the next week".Jadhav said in the meantime, the apex court's registry would take necessary steps to prepare the courts for physical functioning.Sources said that the judges' panel would give its commendations to Chief Justice S A Bobde for necessary action.The panel, evaluating the court's opening,  told leaders of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and the SCAORA that at least three courts may start holding physical hearings on a trial basis and this will be in addition to the virtual court hearings already in place, they said."I may also add that the physical courts are in addition to virtual courts and people would have the option to do virtual hearing as well. Matters from the final hearing list published before the lockdown would be listed before the physical courts. The final decision would be taken by the judges' committee in a day or two," said the SCAORA president.The judges’ panel has met leaders such as Bar Council chairperson Manan Kumar Mishra, Supreme Court Bar Association president Dushyant Dave and Shivaji Jadhav on the issue of resumption of physical hearings in SC.Bar leaders have been demanding the start of the physical hearings as soon as possible while continuing with virtual court hearings with an improved system for limited types of matters.Justices Ramana, Arun Mishra, Rohington Nariman, UU Lalit, A M Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and LN Rao are part of the committee set up by the CJI to look into the issue of resumption of physical hearings in the top court again.In June and July, the committee of judges had not agreed to the demands of bar bodies including SCBA to resume regular courtroom hearings for the time being and would review the functioning of the Supreme Court later.

13-08-2020||KV Prasad||Will Kamala be game-changer?||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 12Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate for the November 3 US Presidential elections, ended the suspense by announcing the selection of Senator Kamala Harris as the Vice President running mate. While the US elections evince global interest, this development has generated plenty of excitement in India.And why not! Kamala was born in the US to an Indian mother Shyamala Gopalan and Jamaican father Donald Harris. She becomes the first African-American/Indian-American to be on the ticket for the presidential polls.‘Fearless fighter’Will her presence in the race challenging Republican President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence swing the pendulum the Democrats way? Her strong presence in a large West Coast California, her African-American and Indian-American connect, is a calculation the party would have made at a time when the country is facing the three major crises — Covid pandemic, economic downturn and a strong call for racial justice. Surveys at present give Biden a sizeable lead over Trump.A majority of Indian-Americans traditionally vote Democrats. However, criticism by the party members on recent developments like CAA, abrogation of Article 370 in J&K and Kamala’s own observation on Kashmir could result in a greater swing away from the party among the 1.3 million Indian-American voters than the 2016 presidential polls.As the Attorney General of California since 2010 she began to make her political mark that grew bigger after winning the senatorial race in 2016 to become the first South Asian woman to enter the US Senate, where she vigorously pursues scrutiny of policies of the Trump administration. Her record on criminal justice as Attorney General attracted a fair share of criticism and rekindled during the primaries.Preferring to be portrayed as a Black American, Kamala maintained her connections with India making an odd visit to Tamil Nadu where her mother’s family hails from. As per reports, the Senator falls back on her maternal aunts with one of them being part of her campaign team. Her sister Maya was associated with Hillary Clinton. The first public test for Kamala would be the sole October 7 Vice Presidential debate with incumbent Pence as Biden-Harris hope to create history.There is an uncanny resemblance between Biden and Kamala. In 2007, Biden who threw his hat in the Democratic party primaries ring, dropped out of contention in race eventually won by Barack Obama. Obama split the ticket to have Biden as his running mate, and struck an equation to balance the political dynamics as the first African-American to run for the office of the President. Now, 12 years later Biden who faced a challenge from Kamala in the primaries reversed the role.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-kamala-be-game-changer-125877

There was a delay in ensuring adequate supplies of PPE during the pandemic, it submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-for-probe-into-covid-mismanagement-125897

13-08-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||South Block may not have wished for this VP nominee||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 12For the nativist strategic watchers in Delhi, Kamala Harris’ pick as Joe Biden’s Vice-President nominee may not mean the continuation of India’s season in the US that began with the “Howdy Modi” rally in Houston last September and carried through with a return rally in Ahmedabad this February.Since then, and especially after the Galwan Valley clash of June 15, there has been a spate of statements, beginning with the White House siding with India.Harris’ mother Shyamala does have an Indian connection but her marriage to a Jamaican-British academic infused a politics in her two children that was far removed from the revivalist, muscular display of “New India” at the Howdy Modi Houston rally which she boycotted; not just because of Trump’s on-stage presence.In their social media posts, both the sisters, Kamala and Maya, have referred to themselves as blacks rather than the in-between category of brown.Kamala has no black vs brown conflict in her mind. Neither does she, a proud wearer of Indian sarees, discount her heritage from India. In her memoir, “The Truths We Hold”, she said her mother “knew that her adopted homeland would see (my sister) Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women”.This awareness has already dawned on the pro-Hindutva diaspora, which has been joined by its social media allies in India to kick-start a campaign against Kamala for being “anti-Kashmir”.There are no illusions in New Delhi that Biden and Harris will be less-easy pushovers than the Trump-Pence duo when it comes to explaining the positives accruing from the year-long lockdown in Kashmir.There are no illusions either on Kamala’s stand on anti-Muslim orientation of regimes in the US and elsewhere. Her observations at a 2017 rally in Washington were unequivocal: “We will fight against anti-Muslim rhetoric! We are going to fight for our Muslim brothers and sisters. We are going to fight for our immigrant brothers and sisters because they and we are what make this country great.” This is an inconvenience South Block may not have factored when conducting a SWOT analysis of a Biden victory.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/south-block-may-not-have-wished-for-this-vp-nominee-125733

The meeting came as India’s Covid count touched 23,29,638 cases with 60,963 new infections in 24 hours and 56,110 record recoveries over the same period. The toll has climbed to 46,091 with 834 new fatalities over a day.With cumulative national load climbing, AIIMS (New Delhi) Director Randeep Guleria said the cases would rise as testing had been ramped up and there was no cause for panic as long as the death rate was low. He said the cases had neither hit the peak not reached a plateau. “The cumulative disease load should not overwhelm us.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-mustnt-procure-covid-vaccine-on-their-own-centre-125735

13-08-2020||---||Govt cracks down on Chinese firms over laundering, hawala||New Delhi, August 12The government has cracked down on Chinese establishments with the Income Tax Department conducting several search operations.According to sources in the I-T Department, a few Chinese individuals and their Indian associates were prima facie involved in money laundering and hawala transactions through shell entities.In the raids that were carried out on various premises of Chinese entities, their close confederates and some bank employees, IT Department sources claimed to have found that at the behest of Chinese individuals, more than 40 bank accounts were created in various dummy entities and were used in the transactions of over Rs 1,000 crore over the period, said a statement by the Ministry of Finance. No details were provided.Bank employees involved: SourcesThe findings also included a subsidiary of a Chinese company and its related concerns that have allegedly taken over Rs 100 crore bogus advances from shell entities for opening businesses of retail showrooms in India.Besides, incriminating documents in respect of hawala transactions and money laundering with the active involvement of bank employees and chartered accountants have also been found as a result of search action.In the search operation, which is still in the process, evidence of foreign hawala transactions, involving Hong Kong and US dollars, has also been unearthed, claimed the ministry press release, which said the search operation was based on “credible information”.Meanwhile, some of the biggest importers of Chinese goods have decided to turn a new leaf. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has launched a campaign “China Quit India” and said there was an urgent need to check China’s growing footsteps in India and import of Chinese goods.Meanwhile, there are confabulations in the Finance Ministry over an order issued on July 23 that amended the General Financial Rules, 2017, “to enable imposition of restrictions on bidders from countries which share a land border with India on grounds of defence and national security”.The problem is the rules apply to Hong Kong, which is controlled by China. This has affected several European companies that are headquartered in Hong Kong, but have operations in India, among several other countries in the region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-cracks-down-on-chinese-firms-over-laundering-hawala-125814
13-08-2020||Ajay Banerjee||100 days on, no headway, more troops on ground||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 12Exactly 100 days after troops of India and China were first involved in a physical clash on the north bank of Pangong Tso, little has changed along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.In fact, troop levels have increased since the first clash. Both sides have added numbers to their war-waging equipment, including artillery guns, tanks, rocket launchers, missiles, fighter jets and drones.After the May 5-6 clash, there was another physical clash at the north bank of Pangong Tso in mid-May. The third clash was at Galwan on June 15 when Indian Army lost 20 soldiers, while the People's Liberation Army (PLA) lost an unspecified number of its men.Five meetings at the Lt General-level were conducted between June 6 and August 2. It was decided to go ahead with de-escalation. China, however, backed out of the agreement.Barring success in creating a 3-km buffer zone at Patrolling point 14 (Galwan) and PP 15 (Hot Springs), there has been no breakthrough. China is adamant on not moving further away from the LAC from its position at Finger-4.The PLA has a similar stance as regards PP 17 and PP 17-A, near Gogra. At 900 sq km Depsang plains, talks have been unsuccessful.The restoration of status quo ante (as on April 2020) seems a distant goal as Ladakh gets ready for a long winter that will see below freezing night temperature by the end of this month.Light Combat Helicopters deployed in LehTwo Light Combat Helicopters developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited have been deployed for operations at high altitude in Leh. It is a potent weapon platform because of its state-of-the-art systems and highly accurate weapons that are capable of hitting any type of target during day or night.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/100-days-on-no-headway-more-troops-on-ground-125640
