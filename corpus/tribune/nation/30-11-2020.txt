The most important challenge faced by us is terrorism, particularly cross-border terrorism,’’ said Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu while chairing the virtual meet of the Council of Heads of Government of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) here on Monday.“We are against states that use terrorism as an instrument of state policy...We need to create conditions for stability and economic sustainability,’’ he added.Parts of several SCO countries are in an “arc of radicalism’’ stretching from Pakistan to the Caucasus running through several Central Asian countries.  The Vice-President’s observations seemed to hint at Pakistan but MEA’s Secretary (West) Vikas Swarup said at a media briefing that the SCO’s charter prohibits the raising of bilateral issues. “We do not raise bilateral issues and expect others to do the same,’’ he said.Naidu also expressed similar sentiments in his opening address. “It is unfortunate to note that deliberate attempts have been made to bring bilateral issues in the SCO forum. Such acts are counterproductive. We should respect each others’ territorial integrity and sovereignty.’’His reference was to the Pakistani representative putting up a map behind him at the SCO NSA’s virtual summit that inaccurately depicted Kashmir. NSA Ajit Doval had then walked out of the virtual meetingIndia is hosting a SCO CHG summit for the first time since it became a full member in 2017. The highest body is the SCO Heads of State summit whose last virtual meeting, chaired by Vladimir Putin from Moscow, was addressed among others by PM Modi, Imran Khan and Xi Jinping.Over 60 per cent of the vaccines for the global immunisation program are being manufactured in India. This production and delivery capacity will be used to help all the countries in fighting this crisis, assured Naidu.He also sought fair and transparent trade as the world recovers from the pandemic-induced disruption.India, as chair of SCO CHG, has proposed a special working group on start-ups and innovations.India had invited Turkmenistan as a Special Guest. It is the only Central Asian country that has stayed out of SCO.India, during its chairmanship, focused on creating three new pillars of cooperation: startups and innovation, science and technology and traditional medicine, said Swarup.Naidu also launched the first SCO online exhibition on shared Buddhist heritage which was curated by National Museum, New Delhi, in collaboration with SCO member countries.The exhibition can be accessed at https://nmvirtual.in/||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/terrorism-biggest-challenge-faced-by-region-says-india-at-sco-meet-178047
30-11-2020||New York||Dictionary.com picks ‘pandemic’ as its 2020 word of the year||On December 31, China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin to the World Health Organisation (WHO). By January 31, the WHO declared an outbreak of a novel coronavirus a global health emergency. Come March 11, the world was facing down the COVID-19 pandemic.Parents sat children down to explain what a pandemic is. Related terms usually restricted to medicine and science stormed into everyday conversation. Over time, we were pandemic baking and pandemic dating and rescuing pandemic puppies from shelters.All of which led Dictionary.com on Monday to declare “pandemic” its 2020 word of the year.Searches on the site for the word spiked more than 13,500 per cent on March 11, senior research editor John Kelly told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of the announcement.“That’s massive, but even more telling is how high it has sustained significant search volumes throughout the entire year. Month over month, it was over 1,000 per cent higher than usual. For about half the year, it was in the top 10 per cent of all our lookups.” Another dictionary, Merriam-Webster, also selected pandemic as its word of the year earlier on Monday.Kelly said pandemic beat out routine lookups usually intended to sort more mundane matters, such as the differences between “to, two and too”.“That’s significant,” Kelly emphasised: “It seems maybe a little bit obvious, and that’s fair to say, but think about life before the pandemic. Things like pandemic fashion would have made no sense. The pandemic as an event created a new language for a new normal.”Lexicographers often factor out routine lookups when evaluating word trends.“The pandemic,” Kelly said, “made us all worthy of watercooler chatter with Dr Anthony Fauci as our knowledge grew about aerosols, contact tracing, social distancing and herd immunity, along with the intricacies of therapeutic drugs, tests and vaccines that can help save lives.”“These were all part of a new shared vocabulary we needed to stay safe and informed. It’s incredible,” said Kelly, who works with a team of lexicographers to come up with words of the year based primarily on-site traffic.Asymptomatic, furlough, non-essential, hydroxychloroquine and a host of other pandemic-related words saw massive increases in lookups as well.Jennifer Steeves-Kiss, chief executive officer of Dictionary.com, said one key ingredient in the hunt for the site’s word of the year is sustained interest over time. Pandemic met that standard.“This has affected families, our work, the economy,” she said, adding: “It really became the logical choice. It’s become the context through which we’ve had dialogue all through 2020. It’s the through line for discourse.”The word pandemic has roots in Latin and the Greek pandemos, meaning “common, public”.Breaking it down further, “pan” means “all” and “demos” means “people.” As evidenced in a medical text by a Dutch-born physician, Gideon Harvey, pandemic entered English in the 1660s in the medical sense, Kelly said. He noted that “demos” is also the basis for the word democracy.A pandemic is defined by Dictionary.com as a disease “prevalent throughout an entire country, continent, or the whole world; epidemic over a large area.” Its broader sense, as evidenced in its roots, can be used thusly: “A pandemic fear of atomic war.”Dictionary.com also noted other worthy search trends beyond the pandemic. After the May 25 death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, words around racial justice experienced spikes, including fascism, anti-fascism, defund and white fragility.“There was no way for us to leave that out of the conversation this year,” Kelly said.

30-11-2020||Kolkata||CLP leader Chowdhury questions absence of moratorium on farm loans||Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of Congress party in the Lok Sabha and chief of West Bengal unit of the party has questioned the absence of any concession from the side of the government in the case of agricultural loans in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.In an open letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Congress leader said that as a common man a farmer was allowed to avail the facility of moratorium on loan if he bought a car or a refrigerator, but no moratorium was on offer for a loan obtained by a farmer for buying a tractor.This double standard had been acknowledged by the central government also in the affidavit submitted by it in the Supreme Court, Chowdhury, who is also chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, wrote in the letter.The feudal mentality of bankers was a stumbling block for extending any financial assistance to farmers, Chowdhury alleged. Banks were least bothered about the plight of farmers, Chowdhury said and pointed out that no moratorium package had been so far announced for farm loans.Chowdhury urged Prime Minister Modi to allow farmers to renew Kisan Credit Cards only on payment of interest on the loan taken by them. There should not be any pressure on small and marginal farmers to pay the principal amount as well as the interest, Chowdhury said in the “open letter”.The Berhampore MP said the concession would benefit 85 per cent of farmers. Chowdhury said farmers across the country were “feeling threatened and vulnerable” because of the flawed agricultural policy.Lakhs of farmers were protesting against the new farm laws, Chowdhury wrote.It was unfortunate that the central government decided not to pay attention to farmers, Chowdhury wrote in his open letter to prime minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/clp-leader-chowdhury-questions-absence-of-moratorium-on-farm-loans-178041

30-11-2020||---||Lakhs of people sign petitions on Change.org seeking justice for farmers||New Delhi, November 30The cyberspace is abuzz with links for protests petitions being shared not just here but in the UK, Canada, Australia and the US in favour of the farmers’ agitation against three recently passed farm laws.Over the last two days, over two lakh people have signed petitions demanding justice for the farmers. The rapidly growing petitions have in fact been started by Indian nationals living in the UK, Canada and the US.A large part of Indian diaspora in these countries comprises Sikhs from India’s Punjab province, which also happens to be the hotbed of the ongoing farmers’ agitation.The biggest petition among these was started by the American Sikh Council, and has been signed by over 50,000 people over the last three days. Similarly, a petition by Prabhjot Bath, a resident of the UK, has received over 50,000 signatures.Another rapidly growing petition, titled ‘Justice for farmers of India’, was started by Canada-based Gina Takhar on Saturday. “My grandfather used to say that once in your life you need a doctor, a lawyer, a policemen and a preacher, but everyday, three times a day, you need a farmer,’’ she said quoting motivational speaker Brenda Schoepp.Mindy Athwal’s petition, started from Wolverhampton in the UK, has been signed by over 30,000 people, while a similar number of people have signed another petition by Parminder Brar, a resident of Canada.A petition by Ravinder Uppal from Birmingham in the UK has been signed by almost 10,000 citizens, while another one started by US-based Kiran Badesha has received over 4000 signatures.“The backbone, sweat and tears of our farmers have fed millions and raised generations of Indians. Without whom, millions would have starved and generations would have never left the country. We need them, and they need us more than ever, today,” says Kiran in the petition.While most of these petitions are addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, some are appealing to Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar as well.Most petitions seek a rollback or rethink on the new farm laws. However, some like Chandigarh resident, Shubh Karman wants Navdeep Singh, the son of a farmer to be acquitted in his petition. Navdeep shot to fame on Friday after images of him climbing atop a water cannon being used on the farmers to turn off the tap went viral. Navdeep was charged with attempt to murder. Shubh writes, “Authorities could have avoided all this through a peaceful dialogue which is being demanded by the protesting farmers from the very first day. Please sign my petition to bring the government’s attention towards the much needed peaceful dialogue, establishment of grievance redressal mechanism along with the inclusion of the MSP clause in writing by the government. Also, all farmers forcefully arrested and booked should be released and acquitted.”Another Chandigarh resident, Harman Singh Siddhu has petitioned the PM, raising several concerns via his petition.“This has shaken the national consciousness. Let us raise our voices in support of these farmers so that it reaches the top echelons so they do not mistreat our hardworking farmers instead agree to their genuine demand,” says Siddhu.Nida Hasan, country director of Change.org, hoped the situation would be resolved soon.“Change.org as a people’s platform consistently reflects concerns of citizens, which is true of the farmer’s stir as well. I really hope that the standoff is resolved peacefully through mutual dialogue,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhs-of-people-sign-petitions-on-change-org-seeking-justice-for-farmers-178036

30-11-2020||Bhopal||‘Tiger state’ MP lost 290 big cats in 19 years: Official||Madhya Pradesh has lost 290 tigers over the last 19 years but the central Indian state still has more than 675 tigers, including 125 cubs, in the designated reserves and in the wild, a top Forest department official said on Monday.Claiming that the population of tigers has actually “gone up”, he said Madhya Pradesh will continue to remain the “tiger state of India”.The official said only five per cent of the deaths of big cats had occurred due to poaching or in man-animal conflicts. Most of the deaths of the tigers occurred either in territorial fights or due to natural causes, he added.“Madhya Pradesh has lost 290 tigers so far since 2002,” Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Alok Kumar told PTI.However, there are 550 big cats in tiger reserves in Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Pench, Satpura, Panna and Sanjay Gandhi reserve and in the wild, he said, adding that there are 125 cubs in the parks.Kumar said about 10 to 20 more tiger cubs might be roaming in the wild.“They can’t be captured as they might be deep inside the jungles. When they turn young and venture out, we would be able to see them,” he added.Kumar said movements of tigers were recorded through camera traps, patrolling and other means.Asked about the deaths of 290 tigers since 2002, Kumar said, “As the number of tigers has risen, they are fighting for territorial control. We are losing 25 to 30 striped animals every year. Of them (the deceased tiger), 95 per cent were weak and old. While the remaining five per cent of (290) tigers were killed by poachers or in man-animal conflicts”.Queried on whether territories of the majestic beasts have  shrunk due to encroachments, he said, “We do have an adequate area for tigers”.Kumar said there was no talk on increasing the area for the striped animals.“The habitat of tigers needed to be protected, and for this people need to be made aware as well,” he added.Kumar said the typical lifespan of a tiger living in a reserve is 12 to 13 years.Responding to a query, he said Madhya Pradesh will continue to remain the tiger state of India.“The tiger state tag pulls tourists to Madhya Pradesh.Our tourism is largely big cat-centric,” said MP Wildlife Board (MPWB) member Abhilash Khandekar.He said the state government should take utmost care to conserve its “tiger state” status so that it does not lose out on tourists and thus revenue.“We don’t have many big industries in MP. So each tiger counts for us,” he said.He said that economy of Panna region had been adversely affected in 2005 when the population of big cats dwindled in the Panna Tiger Reserve in 2005.Earlier, MP had lost the ‘tiger state’ tag to Karnataka in the all India tiger estimation exercise for 2010, primarily due to alleged poaching in the Panna Tiger Reserve.That time, MP had 257 tigers compared to 300 in Karnataka.In the 2014 tiger census, MP slipped to no.3 position in the country with a population of 308 striped animals, after Uttarakhand (340) and Karnataka (408).The central Indian state regained the top slot in the 2018 Census with a population of 526 tigers, two more than Karnataka.

Whereas tests are being conducted free of cost in govt establishments, however this will help those who get their tests done in pvt labs,” Kejriwal tweeted.                         Jain in reply to the chief minister’s tweet said orders for this will be issued immediately.

30-11-2020||Ahmedabad||Hope GDP will be positive in next quarter: Amit Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday said he hoped that the GDP would be back to positive territory in the next quarter, after two consecutive quarters of contraction.Prime Minister Narendra Modi worked hard for the economic recovery and had also announced a package after the crisis due to coronavirus, Shah said after inaugurating two road over-bridges in Ahmedabad through virtual mode.He also praised Modi for a record FII (foreign institutional investors) inflow to India during the COVID-19 pandemic period.“The Prime Minister used the time of COVID-19 pandemic to visualise policy-making, keeping in mind its long-term impact on the economy,” Shah said.Without wasting a second, he worked on reforms in many areas such as farm sector, electricity, industrial policy, to create a system to maintain the pace of development, he said.Towards this end, he offered a package of Rs 20 lakh crore for the welfare of poor people and to give pace to the economy, Shah said in his address via video-conferencing.“As a result, in terms of the recent GDP figure, we are only six per cent behind...and I hope that in the next quarter, the GDP will be in plus (positive),” Shah said.The gross domestic product (GDP) had contracted by a record 23.9 per cent in the first quarter (April-June) of 2020-21 fiscal as the coronavirus lockdown pummelled economic activity.The country’s economy recovered faster than expected in the July-September quarter as a pick-up in manufacturing helped GDP clock a lower contraction of 7.5 per cent, according to official data released recently.Shah also praised Modi for a record FII (foreign institutional investors) inflow to India during the pandemic period, and said it was a result of far-sightedness of the Prime Minister who “utilised the COVID-19 period to bring about reforms in the economic and industrial policy”.“As far as the FDI (foreign direct investment) is concerned, today India has received the highest amount of FDI during COVID-19 time. India received a record FII (inflow) in the month of November, money for investment from abroad,” he said.Shah also praised Gujarat for its progress in terms of industrial development.“Gujarat has always continued its tradition of progress in terms of industrial development. As reported in newspapers, in terms of FDI, Gujarat has remained on top with nearly 50 per cent investment,” he said.Shah also assured the Gujarat government of Centre’s support for development projects.He praised Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel for taking forward the tradition of development started by Modi, when he was the state’s chief minister.Shah said Gujarat deserved to be congratulated for maintaining the pace of infrastructure development despite the COVID-19 pandemic.Addressing a gathering on the occasion, Rupani said inauguration and laying of the foundation stone of projects worth Rs 15,000 crore were done during the COVID-19 period, and the government did not let the pace of development be affected.“We did not let COVID-19 pandemic come in the way. We laid the foundation stones and inaugurated projects. The Prime Minister also inaugurated four projects...Gujarat gets the highest GDP. Now, there is nobody in Delhi to create hurdles. We now get whatever we ask for,” he said.The two flyovers inaugurated on Monday were part of the Rs 867-crore Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar highway project that connects Sarkhej (in Ahmedabad) to Chiloda (in Gandhinagar), Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said.Seven more flyovers would be constructed on the 44-km route to ensure uninterrupted movement of traffic, Patel said.

30-11-2020||Sonepat (Haryana)||No social distancing at protest, farmer leaders say new laws bigger threat than coronavirus||Amid fears that the “Delhi Chalo” protests by farmers will lead to coronavirus spreading faster, their leaders have said the “black laws” enacted at the Centre are a bigger threat than the contagion.There had been few signs of social distancing as thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana began their protest last week against the three new agro-marketing laws, setting off on a march to the national capital.On the way, they skirmished with police at barricades and since Friday are massed at Delhi’s entry points, many of them sheltering inside tractor-trolleys.Masks appear to be a rarity and there is little attempt at keeping distance from each other, safeguards meant to prevent the infection from spreading.But as experts fear that the event could become a coronavirus “superspreader”, farm leaders say there are more pressing concerns before them.Also read: Farmers protest at Delhi borders may act as COVID-19 ‘superspreader’ event: Experts“The new farm laws brought by the (Narendra) Modi government are a bigger threat than coronavirus as farmers fear they will lose their livelihood with the implementation of these laws,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan told PTI over the phone.Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher asked why coronavirus posed a serious threat to life only during the farmers’ agitation, and not during the recent Bihar assembly polls.“When Bihar elections took place, where was COVID-19? When any political gathering takes place, where is coronavirus,” he asked, in an apparent reference to the election rallies.He claimed that the issue comes up only when farmers begin agitation for their rights.The Delhi Police initially declined permission for the farmers’ protest in the city, citing the threat of COVID-19.On Sunday, Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar lashed out at his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh, saying he will be responsible if the gathering of farmers worsens the coronavirus situation. Singh has backed the protest.A spokesperson for the BKU’s Haryana unit, led by Gurnam Singh Charuni, on Monday claimed that farmers were trying their best to keep COVID-19 at bay.“As much as we can, we are trying to follow the guidelines. But at the moment thousands of farmers are saying that getting the Centre’s farm laws rolled back is the first priority as these will anyway destroy them,” he said.He said it was now up to the Centre to accept their demands.When asked if they fear that the infection may spread as thousands have gathered over a large area, he said: “No farmer fears this disease at the moment. All they have on their minds is to get these laws rolled back.”In Sonipat, a Haryana Health Department official said they have so far distributed 5,000 masks to the protesting farmers.“Also, after every kilometre we have stationed an ambulance. Mobile toilets have also been installed at various points and sanitisation is being regularly carried out,” he said.The health department also plans to carry out random tests for COVID-19.“We are trying to take all necessary measures so that everyone remains safe amid the pandemic,” he said, adding: “We are also urging farmers to wear masks and try to maintain social distancing.”Unions have expressed apprehension that the new agri-marketing laws enacted at the Centre will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving farmers the mercy of big corporates.The government, however, says that the new laws give farmers options to get higher prices for their crops and the MSP regime will still continue.

30-11-2020||Kolkata||‘Bengali Pride’ to be TMC’s main poll plank to counter BJP’s aggressive Hindutva campaign||Buoyed by the “positive” response to its ‘insider versus outsider’ campaign, the TMC leadership has decided to embrace ‘Bengali pride’ as its main poll plank for the 2021 Assembly polls to counter the BJP’s aggressive Hindutva campaign in West Bengal.The Mamata Banerjee-led party, which has often been mocked by opponents for not having a well-defined ideological plank, seems to have finally found its calling in Bengali sub-nationalism, as a section of top party leaders feel only an “inclusive message of regionalism, which the Bengalis can identify with, will counter the aggressive nationalism and Hindutva practised by the saffron camp”.“During the next Assembly polls, apart from development, Bengali pride will be our main poll plank.“Bengali pride is not just about Bengalis, it appeals to all sons of the soil. This philosophy will help counter BJP’s attempts to import leaders from outside to control the people of the state,” senior TMC leader and MP Sougata Roy told PTI.According to TMC sources, much like the regional parties of Tamil Nadu, which are proponents of Tamil pride, and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, which harps on Marathi ‘Ashmita’ (pride), the TMC plans to emerge as the protector of Bengali culture and identity.“The JD(U) in Bihar had talked about ‘Bihari versus Bahari’. Even the BJP, which boasts of nationalism, had campaigned on the poll plank of Gujarati ‘Ashmita’ during the 2007 Gujarat elections. So if we do the same, we think no one should complain about it,” another TMC leader said.A senior leader of the Mamata Banerjee-led party, who was a part of a select group of the members that formulated this ideological plank, said “divisive politics and religious polarisation could never be countered with development politics. Only sub-nationalism and regionalism can do that.”   Born in the womb of the Congress, the TMC, which rose to power after a long fight against the CPI(M)-led Left Front, had initially adopted the slogan of ‘Maa Mati Manush’ (Mother, Land and People), carefully blending socialism and secularism—a  powerful concoction that countered the communists and their doctrines well.The party tasted success in 2011 and continued its winning streak in 2016 assembly polls.The rise of the BJP in Bengal’s political map, however, has made the TMC realise that its socialist slogan was not all enough to offset ‘Hindutva’, especially at a time when it has been branded as a party “that favours only minorities” by the saffron camp.According to TMC sources, after the electoral reverses in the Lok Sabha polls last year, and with the emergence of the BJP as a prime contender for power, the TMC initially tried to shed the ‘anti-Hindu’ tag and embrace ‘soft Hindutva’, but it soon realised that it could never beat the BJP in its own game.The party then took a cue from the results of the final phase of the Lok Sabha polls in Bengal, where the saffron party, which, despite its spectacular performance in the previous phases, drew a blank in all nine seats that went to polls towards the end.The TMC zoomed past the saffron party in the final phase with its fiery campaign over “insult to Bengali icons”, following the desecration of social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar’s bust during a BJP rally.Although the BJP had denied the allegations, the damage was done.Then on, TMC supremo and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has often invoked Bengali sub-nationalism, and called the BJP a party of “outsiders”.“Initially it was a half-hearted campaign, as we were worried about its impact on the Hindi-speaking population of the state. But later it was decided that Bengali sub- nationalism or Bengali pride would be our main ideological plank. Whether we win or lose, this will be our mainstay in days to come,” the TMC leader, who played a key role in zeroing in on the idea, said.Citing Bengal’s demographic map, where 70 per cent is Hindu population and 30 per cent Muslims, the TMC leader said, “The state consists of 86 per cent Bengalis, that’s the antidote of BJP’s politics. Bengalis are an independent-minded community since the days of British Raj.“Post-independence, too, be it the Congress or the communists, none of them ever accepted the supremacy of Delhi.Hindu-Muslim politics won’t work here,” he said.Over the last two weeks, the TMC haed been holding aggressive “insider versus outsider” campaigns to corner the BJP in various areas, and statements such as “Bengal will be turned into Gujarat” with the import of leaders from other states, has provided the much-needed ammo to even out the party’s internal conflicts, which is now out in the open.Lack of a face to counter Banerjee and the BJP’s “over-dependence” on central leadership has added to the benefits of the TMC.“People have to decide whether they want to be dominated by outsiders or handover the reins to a son of this soil. It is a decision which will impact our next generations,” TMC minister Bratya Basu said.Political analyst Suman Bhattacharya feels that “Bengali pride” is a formidable weapon which will benefit any political party that nurtures the cause carefully.“Most of the political parties of the country have their origins in Bengal.  But the issue of Bengali pride has never been taken up. Any political party who can properly nourish the cause will gain out of it,” he said.Narratives themed around ‘Bengali pride’ and ‘natives versus outsiders’ are slowly gaining momentum, with various outfits raising the pitch for reservation for domicile Bengalis in jobs and education in the state, where, until a few years ago, cultural sub-nationalism was an alien concept.Organisations such as Bangla Pokkho, Jatiyo Bangla Sammelan and Bangla Sanskriti Mancha are making their presence felt in the state, where the BJP, according to them, are trying to “impose Hindi and “north Indian culture”.“The people of the state should be made aware of the need to fight for the issue of Bengali pride. The BJP is the biggest threat to the Bengali culture. They believe in the domination of non-Bengalis over Bengalis,” Kaushik Maiti, senior leader, Bangla Pokkho, said.The saffron party, on its part, said the TMC was making a “desperate attempt” to divide the majority community along ethnic lines and stave off an “imminent” defeat in the assembly elections.“The founding father of our party is Syama Prasad Mookherjee, a stalwart of Bengal. So how come we are a party of outsiders? Is Bengal out of India? These issues are nothing but a sign of TMC’s desperation after sensing its defeat,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said.The saffron party’s national general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya feels tha the TMC is more interested in welcoming infiltrators than people from other parts of the country.“Nowhere in the country, have we faced such a situation where people of this country are branded as outsiders. Here, infiltrators are welcomed with open arms and people of this nation are outsiders,” he said.West Bengal Congress president Adhir Chowdhury slammed the TMC for fanning sub-nationalism and said the party was “dishing out one poison to kill another”.Elections to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly are likely to be held in April-May next year.

30-11-2020||New Delhi||Farmers protest at Delhi borders may act as COVID-19 ‘superspreader’ event: Experts||The protest by thousands of farmers, who have stayed put at various border points of Delhi for the fifth consecutive day on Monday against the Centre’s new agriculture reform laws, may act as ‘superspreader’ event for coronavirus infection, say experts.The national capital has already been witnessing a spike in COVID-19 cases post Diwali celebrations and amid rising pollution levels.Samiran Panda, who heads the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases (ECD) division of the ICMR, sought strict compliance to protective and preventive behaviour to curb the spread of the infection.“A protest is a mass gathering and thus from a public health perspective, I would suggest protective and preventive behaviours against the spread of coronavirus infection failing which a superspreading event might set in. It is important to note that the SARS-COV-2 is a transmission efficient virus and such gatherings are conducive for its spread,” he stressed.KK Aggarwal, president of the Confederation of Medical Association of Asia and Oceania (CMAAO) and former IMA president, said the agitation should not have been allowed by the government.“Why for every such step we need a Supreme Court direction or intervention? The government has the powers under the Diseases Epidemic Act to take control of any situation which can spread the infection. The Indian Penal Code section 270 also gives powers to the local police station to file cases if they feel any event can spread infection,” he said.Aggarwal also noted that in a pandemic, politics should never get precedence.“The farmers’ agitation will end up as superspreading events which will not only be a danger to Delhi but also to the whole country,” he added.Any agitation or gathering might cause the spread of COVID-19 and thus gatherings should be avoided during this time and if it could not be avoided at all, social distancing norms must be maintained, Sanjay Rai, professor in the Department of Community Medicine at AIIMS said.Such gatherings might hamper government efforts to control the transmission of COVID-19, he said.Delhi Police placed concrete barriers and enhanced security at the Ghazipur border with UP as the number of protesting farmers swelled there while thousands more remained at the Delhi-Haryana border for the fifth day Monday to protest against the Centre’s agricultural reform laws.Security was stepped up after farmers threatened to block more highways connecting the national capital.

They have no other demand. They are at pains to explain to the Government that they fully understand the impact of these laws; each and every protestor is articulate and clear about this. It is only the Prime Minister, his Cabinet Ministers, his officials and his set of experts and advisers who do not understand that farmers see these Acts as an attack on their ownership of land through contract farming, as an attack on their income and increase in their debts, as winding-up government controls and freedom to the big corporations, the MNCs in agriculture production, processing and marketing of foods, as winding-up of assured pricing, procurement, government storage and food supplies, as increasing farmer suicides, as increasing food prices and black marketing and end PDS, etc,” the statement further read.“The AIKSCC decided to urge farmers’ bodies to immediately rally all forces into Delhi to intensify this protest. The AIKSCC shall coordinate joint protests by various mass organisations in Delhi and other major cities by various sections of our citizens as ‘Hum Kisano ke Saaath’ campaigns. The AIKSCC has called upon all state bodies to prepare exact mass protests programs jointly in large numbers in order to rally the farmers and rural India all over the country to force the government to relent and withdraw these the three Farm Acts and EB 2020. Urban people will also be involved in these protests which include sit-in demonstrations and protests in front of toll plazas, Reliance pumps, Adani malls etc,” the statement added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-defending-farm-bills-shows-govts-complete-opposition-to-solving-demands-of-farmers-farmers-union-178011

Farmers are the strength of the nation. The question is why is the farmer on the roads today? Why has he walked thousands of kilometres to Delhi? Why is the farmer disrupting traffic? PM Narendra Modi says the three farm laws are in favour of farmers. If so, why is the farmer angry? Why is the farmer not happy?”Gandhi said the laws are meant for two to three friends of Modi’s.“These laws are about stealing from the farmers. And therefore we will all have to stand with the strength of the country. People and Congress workers must help these agitating farmers with food and every which way possible,” he said.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, meanwhile, asked the Centre to withdraw all FIRs against farmers and talk to them unconditionally.Congress leader Anand Sharma said the subversion of farmers’ interests was condemnable. “The government must speak to farmers with respect and without conditions,” said Sharma.Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja also slammed the Centre for “breaking the back of farmers with black laws”.Party spokesman Jaiveer Shergill demanded dialogue to be started.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-urges-peoples-support-for-agitating-farmers-177996

30-11-2020||Chandigarh||DRDO shuts down 3 labs, sends staff to other centres||As part of its restructuring process, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has, in an unprecedented step, shut down three of its laboratories and merged its mandate and staff with other establishments.This is the first step towards minimising functional overlap between laboratories having a similar charter and rationalising expenditure, sources said. More laboratories are expected to be shut down or merged in the near future.Two laboratories in Delhi, the Defence Terrain Research Laboratory (DTRL) and the Laser Science and Technology Center (LASTEC) and one in Hyderabad, Advanced Numerical Research and Analysis Group (ANURAG) are now no longer functional as independent entities.DTRL was involved in the analysis of terrain characteristics and providing geo-spatial solutions and terrain intelligence for the armed forces. Its staff has now been merged with Snow and Avalanche Studies Establishment (SASE) based at Chandigarh that is working in avalanche forecasting, structural control in snowbound mountaineous areas, data collection in cryospheric regions and creation of snow cover information system. SASE has been renamed as Defence Geological Research Establishment. LASTEC was working in the fields of laser sources, laser countermeasures and laser spectroscopy and was involved in the development of high power laser sources and related technologies for directed energy applications as well as detectors, weapon locators and laser illuminators.ANURAG's mandate was advanced computing concepts and technologies including design and development of high performance computing systems using parallel processing techniques with indigenous architecture and application specific integrated circuit based products or critical applications.The staff of LASTEC and ANURAG are being relocated to two other laboratories in Hyderabad, where several DRDO laboratories, especially those involved with the development of missiles, are already based.The relocation of staff has also created some immediate functional issues like fixing of intra-laboratory seniority, allocation of tasks and responsibilities, availability of accommodation, disruption of family life and children’s education.Set up 1958, DRDO is the research and development wing of the Ministry of Defence, responsible for the design of indigenous weapon systems and allied technology. It has 52 laboratories spread across the country that are categorized into seven technology clusters named Naval Systems and Materials, Aeronautical Systems, Armament and Combat Engineering Systems, Missiles and Strategic Systems, Electronics and Communication Systems, Life Sciences, and Micro Electronic Devices, Computational Systems and Cyber Systems, all manned with a strength of about 5,000 scientists and 25,000 scientific, technical and support staff.While DRDO is said to be India's largest and most diverse research organisation, it has often drawn flak for delayed projects and missing repeated deadlines with huge cost overruns. Parliament’s Standing Committee of Defence as well as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India have commented critically on its performance and the status fo some of its projects.In August this year, Dr G Satheesh Reddy, Secretary Defence Research and Development and Chairman DRDO, had constituted a five-member committee under the chairmanship V Ramagopal Rao, Director, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, to review the existing structure of DRDO and the charter of duties of its laboratories, redefine the mandate of laboratories on the basis of current and futuristic defence requirements and minimise the overlap of technologies they are working on at a time when increasing stress was being laid on self-reliance and the import of a large number of weapon systems and military equipment has been banned.There have been attempts in the past to restructure DRDO and streamline its functioning. The last was in 2008 by the P. Rama Rao Committee that had, among other recommendations, suggested that DRDO concentrate only on core technologies of strategic importance. It was on the advice of this committee that the aforementioned technology clusters were created.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drdo-shuts-down-3-labs-sends-staff-to-other-centres-177986
30-11-2020||New Delhi||Coldest November in Delhi in 71 years: IMD||The month of November was the coldest in the national capital in 71 years, with the mean minimum temperature dropping to 10.2 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department.Delhi had recorded a mean minimum temperature of 10.2 degrees Celsius in November 1949.The mean minimum temperature for November was 9.6 degrees Celsius in 1938; nine degrees Celsius in 1931 and 8.9 degrees Celsius in 1930, according to IMD data.Normally, the mean minimum temperature for the month of November is 12.9 degrees Celsius.The mean minimum temperature was 15 degrees Celsius last year, 13.4 degrees Celsius in 2018 and 12.8 degrees Celsius in 2017 and 2016.Delhi also braved four cold waves in November –on the 3rd, 20th, 23rd and 24th.  For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days.“However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said.On Monday, Delhi recorded a minimum of 6.9 degrees Celsius. This is the eight day this month that the minimum temperature remained below 10 degrees Celsius.On November 23, Delhi recorded a minimum of 6.3 degrees Celsius -- its lowest minimum temperature in the month since November 2003, when the city recorded a minimum of 6.1 degrees Celsius, according to Srivastava.  The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and  radiate it back downward, warming the ground.The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital.  The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius.

30-11-2020||New Delhi||Centre gives in, willing to hold ‘unqualified’ talks with farmers||The BJP-led central government has conveyed its willingness to hold unconditional talks with farmers, sources in the party said on Monday--- a development that comes a day after farmers rejected the Centre’s qualified offer to advance talks.Some leaders from farmers' unions also confirmed the development.The Centre’s willingness to soften its stand comes in the wake of an ongoing meeting that Home Minister Amit Shah’s holding with senior leaders of his party at his residence. Among the several BJP leaders present at the meeting is Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar.Also read: PM defending Farm Bills shows govt’s complete opposition to solving demands of farmers: Farmers’ unionPM defends farm laws, assures farmers intentions of govt ‘as pure as Ganga’Concrete barriers come up at Delhi-Ghaziabad border as more farmers join protestNo social distancing at protest, farmer leaders says new laws bigger threat than coronavirusBoth farmers and the central government are holding a series of internal strategic talks, sources said. Some leaders from farmers’ unions were in touch with BJP leaders, sources said, and they had agreed to more talks with the central government. This assent to hold more parleys comes after a promise from Shah to hold unconditional talks with farmers. They have also been allowed to continue their protest at their current location on Delhi's borders. Sources said they could be invited for talks as soon as Tuesday.The development comes as farmers continued to hold protests at Delhi's borders for the fourth day over the controversial agriculture reforms that Parliament had passed in September.Farmers mainly from Punjab have been holding protests spearheaded by 32 farmers’ unions since, and earlier this month, announced a march to Delhi called ‘Delhi Chalo’. Amit Shah had issued a statement two days ago that his government was scheduled to hold talks with farmers on December 3, but that those talks could be advanced if protesters cleared roads and moved to a site the Centre had designated for them - a ground at Delhi’s Burari.Protesters, however, rejected the offer, opting to stay put and asking for unconditional talks.The central government says that the laws are meant for farmers’ welfare---a view that farmers contend. Farmers fear that the laws will weaken the APMC system, leaving them vulnerable to corporate interests.  'You are being misled'Prime Minister Narendra Modi meanwhile repeated once again that the laws would benefit farmers.As protests refused to die down, Modi repeated his government’s stand: that the laws were aimed at farmers’ welfare and would help augment their income. He also claimed that the farmers were being “mislead”---a claim several leaders of the BJP---including the prime minister himself---have repeatedly made in the past, much to protesters’ criticism.  Also read: Concrete barriers come up at Delhi-Ghaziabad border as more farmers join protest“If some farmers are feeling doubtful of the government's intentions it is because of lies fed to them through decades,” he claimed in a series of tweets on Monday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-gives-in-willing-to-hold-unqualified-talks-with-farmers-177982

30-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality turns ‘very poor’||Delhi’s air quality turned “very poor” on Monday and is predicted to deteriorate further with calm winds and low temperature allowing accumulation of pollutants.The city’s air quality index (AQI) was 307. The 24-hour average AQI was 268 on Sunday. It was 231 on Saturday, 137 on Friday, 302 on Thursday and 41a3 on Wednesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The winds were calm at night time. During the day, the maximum wind speed is expected to be 10 kmph, according to the India Meteorological Department.Winds are predicted to slow down further. Therefore, Delhi’s air quality is likely to deteriorate further and remain in the “poor” to “very poor” category over the next two days, it had said earlier.The minimum temperature was 6.9 degrees Celsius on Sunday and the maximum is expected to settle around 26 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.     The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city’s ventilation index—a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – will be around 2,500 m2/s on Monday and is likely to be 2,000 m2/s on Tuesday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution has reduced as the harvesting season has ended.The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels was 6 percent on Sunday, 4 percent on Saturday, 2 percent on Friday and just 1 percent on Thursday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-air-quality-turns-very-poor-177978

Khalistan is a closed chapter for which Indira Gandhi and General Arunkumar Vaidya laid down their lives," it said."The government is using all its might to crush political opponents but why is this determination not seen while dealing with the country's enemies," it asked.In the last one month, 11 soldiers from Maharashtra attained martyrdom while fighting enemies on the borders, the Sena said.Referring to the giant statue of Sardar Patel "erected by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah" in Gujarat, the editorial said Patel was also a leader of farmers and led many farmers' agitation against the British. "His statue's eyes must be moist now seeing how farmers are being treated," it said.Central agencies like ED and CBI are being used as weapons against political opponents, the Sena said."These agencies should also get a chance to display their valour," it said and suggested that (personnel of) ED and CBI should be deployed in Ladakhand Kashmir to help the Army fight India's enemies.

30-11-2020||New Delhi||Concrete barriers come up at Delhi-Ghaziabad border as more farmers join protest||Thousands of farmers continued their stir against the Centre's new farm laws at the Delhi-Haryana border for the fifth day, even as the number of those protesting at the Ghazipur border swelled on Monday, leading police to place concrete barriers and enhancing security at the border point connecting with UP.Security was stepped up after farmers threatened to block more highways connecting the national capital.Peaceful protests were underway at both the Singhu and Tikri borders with no untoward incident reported for the last two days, but the numbers of farmers at the Ghazipur border swelled, with more their counterparts from the state joining them.Rejecting the Centre's offer to hold talks once they move to the Burari ground, the farmers protesting at all Delhi border points said they will not accept any conditional dialogue and have called a meeting to discuss their next course of action later in the day.Farmers, who had reached Nirankarai Samagam Ground in Burari on Saturday, continued their protest there. A Delhi Police officer said the situation at the Ghazipur border near UP Gate remained peaceful.He said, "Cement jersey barriers have been placed to prevent the protesting farmers from entering the national capital."The protestors do not wish to go to Burari ground and want to carry out their protest at Jantar Mantar," he said.However, the Delhi-Ghaziabad border has not been sealed, police said.Sukhwinder Singh, who has been agitating at the Tikri border for the fifth consecutive day, said farmers will continue to protest at the Delhi borders as they don't want to go to Burari ground --- a designated protest site identified for the demonstration."We have enough ration to sustain for at least six months. We do not wish to go to Burari. If we proceed from here, we will only go to Jantar Mantar. We will not protest anywhere else," Singh said.He said that they are ready for talks with the Centre, but if they do not find solutions despite talks, they will block all the ways leading towards Delhi."We will not leave from here (Tikri Border) unless their demands are met. We are ready to face cold weather, we are ready to face every challenge ahead," Singh said.A medical camp has also been set up at Singhu border, which is being run by two individual doctors.Dr Sarika Verma, who has come from Gurgaon, said, "We have come here today. We are helping farmers at our own level. We have blood pressure medicine, PCM, crocin and other medicines.""The farmers are not so much aware about COVID-19. Many of them are not wearing masks, which poses a threat to human lives. We are distributing masks especially to those who have cough and the elderly here," Verma said.Another doctor Karan Juneja said that he has distributed basic medicines to 300 farmers, adding that there is a need to conduct the COVID-19 test at the protest site.Traffic continued to be disrupted in the national capital due to the protests.Taking to twitter, the Delhi Traffic Police on Monday alerted commuters to take an alternate route since Singhu and Tikri borders continued to remain closed."Singhu Border is still closed from both sides. Please take alternate route.Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk & GTK road.Traffic is very very heavy. Please avoid outer ring road from signature bridge to Rohini & vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu borders," it tweeted.In another tweet, it said, "Tikri border is closed for any Traffic Movement. Available Open Borders to Haryana are following Borders Jharoda, Dhansa, Daurala Jhatikera, Badusari, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders." Union Home Minister Amit Shah had appealed to the farmers to shift to the Burari ground and had said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place.A meeting of over 30 farmer groups was held to discuss Shah's offer for talks before the scheduled date of December 3 once they move to Burari in the city, but the thousands of protesters had refused to budge and spent another night in the cold at the Singhu and Tikri border points.Their representatives had said that Shah's condition that they shift the protest is not acceptable and claimed Burari ground is an "open jail".Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla in a letter to 32 farmers organisations sent on Saturday cited the cold conditions and the COVID-19 outbreak and said the farmers should move to the Burari ground where adequate facilities have been made for them."As soon as you shift to the ground at Burari, the very next day a high-level committee of union ministers will hold talks at Vigyan Bhavan with the representatives of all farmers unions, with whom dialogue had taken place earlier,” he had said in the letter.

30-11-2020||Washington||26/11: Extradition hearing for Tahawwur Rana to be held on February 12||A US court has set February 12 as the date of hearing for the extradition of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, who has been declared a fugitive by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack case.Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. Rana was earlier arrested in October 2009 by US police soon after Headley's arrest at Chicago O'Hare airport.US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chelonian said in her order on November 13 that the Extradition Hearing, in this case, is scheduled for February 12, 2021, at 10:00 am. Rana has time till December 21 to file his opposition to the request for extradition. The United States Government will have another months' time to file its reply.In its motion on September 28, the US government supported Rana's extradition to India where he has been charged with the offences of conspiracy to wage war, commit a terrorist act, the waging of war, the commission of murder, and a terrorist act.Rana, in his defence, has argued that the US' decision not to extradite his co-conspirator, David Headley, to India is inconsistent and bars his extradition.However, the US government argued differently “because Headley fulfilled the required terms, the plea agreement established that Headley would not be extradited to India,” said US attorney Nicola T Hanna.“Rana's situation is different because he neither pleaded guilty nor cooperated with the United States. As a result, cannot avail himself of the benefits afforded to Headley through his negotiated plea. Such a position is neither inconsistent nor a bar to extradition,” he said.Unlike Rana, Headley immediately accepted responsibility for his conduct and pleaded guilty to all of the charges in the Superseding Indictment, Hanna said. As per the plea agreement, the United States agreed that it would not extradite Headley to India “for the foregoing offences, including conduct within the scope of those offences for which he has been convicted in accordance with this plea so long as he fully discloses all material facts concerning his role with respect to these offenses and abides by all other aspects of this agreement.” Pakistan-born Rana completed Army Medical College there, and served in the Pakistani Army as a doctor for more than a decade, but eventually deserted. He is currently a Canadian citizen but was a resident of Chicago where he had a business. According to the court papers, he has also resided in and travelled to Canada, Pakistan, Germany and England and speaks seven languages.According to the federal prosecutors, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana conspired with Headley, also known as 'Daood Gilani”, and others in Pakistan to assist Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US-designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks.Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.India seeks his arrest on a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating, and murder under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The 2008 Mumbai attack was one of the most horrific terrorist attacks in India in which 166 people were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem in the country's financial capital.Pakistani national Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, was hanged to death on November 21, 2012.

30-11-2020||Vibha Sharma||Talks fine but no precondition, say farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 29Agitating farmers today rejected Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s offer for “conditional talks”, sticking to their decision to continue protesting on highways and threatening to block all five entry points to the national Capital, if the Centre did not roll back the recent farm laws.“We are ready for talks but without preconditions,” farm leaders said, stressing they would go back the moment the Centre announced to revoked the three “anti-farmer” Acts and turning down Shah’s appeal to shift to Nirankari Ground at Burari, calling it a an “open jail”.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar today again invited the farmers to the negotiating table. Shah, addressing a press conference in Hyderabad, said the farmers’ agitation was not political.“I have never said so. Don’t put words in my mouth,” he told the media in Hyderabad. This is being seen as an attempt by the government to reach out to the farmers as several BJP leaders, including Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, have called the agitation political or “Congress-driven.”Claiming that it was not just Punjab farmers’ stir, but of farmers from across the country, farmers’ unions hit out at the government for attacking “arthiyas”, arguing they were service providers and not middlemen. “You (government) are under pressure from middlemen because you have middlemen in defence, trade commerce deals,” remarked Balbir Singh Rajewal of the BKU (Rajewal).Countering claims that the protests were mainly Punjab-centric, the protesters demanded a talks invite for all. “It is a pan-India stir. Farmers from Haryana, UP, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh are part of the movement. Agitations are on in Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand too,” the All-India Sangharsh Coordinating Committee said.Stir pan-India: Farm panelCountering claims that the agitation was “Punjab-centric,” the protesters have sought talks invite for all. “Farmers from Haryana, UP, U’khand and MP are part of the movement.

AAP leader Sanjay Singh said: “We welcome the farmers to Delhi.” The party said Shah had shown “utter irresponsibility” by leaving the Capital to campaign for Hyderabad MC elections when the farmers were waiting at the Delhi border for talks.Rahul takes a dig at govtCongress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the government over the farmers’ protest. “Promise was to double farmers’ income, the Modi government did double income, but that of Adani-Ambani. Those who are still defending the black farm laws, what solution will they find in favour of farmers?” he tweeted in Hindi, adding: “Ab hogi (now there will be) #KisaanKiBaat”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/talks-fine-but-no-precondition-say-farmers-177743
30-11-2020||New Delhi||New agri laws have given farmers new opportunities: PM||With farmers from Punjab, Haryana and some other parts of the country laying a siege to the capital, PM Narendra Modi today underscored the virtues of the new farm laws, saying these had opened doors of possibilities for the farmers. While Modi made no reference to the ongoing agitation, he said farmers for years were demanding reforms and every political party at some point of time or other made a promise to fulfil those demands.“After a lot of deliberations, Parliament gave a legal form to the agricultural reforms. These reforms have not only freed them of various shackles, but also given them new rights and new opportunities. In just a short span of time, these new rights have begun to ameliorate the woes of farmers,” PM Modi said in his monthly “Mann ki Baat” radio address. He cited instances of how the new laws were bringing about change in the lives of farmers.In the case of Jitendra Bhoiji from Dhule in Maharasthra, it was payment due to him for sale of corn which was pending for long. He said under the new laws, farmers should get their dues within three days of procurement failing which complaint could be lodged.In another instance, Mohammed Aslam from Baran district in Rajasthan became CEO of his farmer producer organisation and on his WhatsApp group of farmers updates prevalent prices in the neighbouring mandis. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-agri-laws-have-given-farmers-new-opportunities-pm-177744

30-11-2020||Rohtak||Lockdown bitter pill for type-1 diabetic||A study conducted by the PGIMS here has revealed that the Covid pandemic adversely affected the health of type-1 diabetic patients during lockdown. On an average, the patients’sugar level went up by 30 per cent and the HbA1c (three-month average blood sugar) level hiked by 14 per cent, indicating poor glycemic (presence of glucose in blood) control.The reasons were low availability of insulin/glucostrips, poor compliance with the recommended diet and decreased physical activity in the lockdown period.Insulin shortageRohtak PGIMS study attributes the poor glycemic control to low availability of insulin/glucostrips, poor compliance with the recommended diet and decreased physical activity during the lockdown period.The research was conducted by Dr Anjali, Assistant Professor at the Pt Bhagwat Dayal Sharma University of Health Sciences (UHS) here, on 52 patients of type-1 diabetes. As many as 27 patients were below 10 years, 19 between 11 and 20 years and six between 21 and 30 years.The study aimed at ascertaining the impact of the lockdown (March 25 to May 31) on the patients’ glycemic control. Their post-lockdown health condition was compared with their follow-ups before the lockdown.Type-1diabetes, a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin, usually appears during adolescence. Its patients need regular treatment to maintain normal blood sugar levels through insulin therapy, diet and exercise, said Dr Sanjeev Nanda, Head, Pediatric Department, UHS.“The main reason behind the rising level of sugar was the low availability of insulin/glucostrips due to restrictions in transportation,” Dr Anjali said.During the lockdown, children were at home with their non-diabetic peers and other family members, leading to poor compliance with the recommended diet, she said.“The break from school resulted in a longer screen time and decrease in physical activity for children, causing poor glycemic control,” Dr Anjali added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-bitter-pill-for-type-1-diabetic-177786
