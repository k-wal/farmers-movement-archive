At a virtual meeting of SCO National Security Advisors, the Pakistani representative pointedly hung a map incorrectly depicting its boundaries from India’s point of view. This led to a symbolic walkout by NSA Ajit Doval.India also did not participate in an SCO military drill that had Chinese soldiers as it took place in the middle of an aggressive confrontation on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. During its membership of the last three years, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India had intensively engaged with the SCO and used it as a platform to reach out to Central Asian states. Barring Turkmenistan, other Central Asian states – Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan – are members of the SCO along with China, Pakistan, Russia and India.At the last SCO summit in Bishkek, PM Modi had laid out India’s vision for the SCO by coining the acronym “HEALTH” which stood for cooperation in health, economics, alternative energy, literature & culture, against terrorism and for humanity, said the MEA spokesperson here on Friday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-to-attend-virtual-sco-summit-on-nov-10-167028
06-11-2020||Bhubaneswar||COVID-19: Schools in Odisha to remain closed till December 31||Apprehensive that a possible second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic may hit the country mid- December, the Odisha government on Friday decided to keep schools across the state closed till December 31.The School and Mass Education (S&ME) department in a notification said: “... the state government does hereby direct that all schools in the state shall remain closed till 31 December, 2020.”S&ME secretary Satyabrata Sahoo said the department held consultations with various stakeholders and their inputs were taken.He also said the experience of the states where schools had reopened was taken before taking the decision to keep schools closed till December 31.Sahoo said that the second wave of COVID-19 cases being experienced in some states, was also noted.However, notwithstanding closure of academic institutions, the S&ME department in the notification permitted conduct of examinations (academic competitive and entrance tests), evaluation and other administrative activities.It also said that online distance learning will be permitted and encouraged.Teaching and non-teaching staff may be called to the schools for online teaching/ tele-counselling and related work, in areas outside the containment zones as per Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), the notification said.Earlier in the day, the S&ME Minister Samir Ranjan Dash said that the state will not open schools for the students of class 8 to 12 from November 15 as decided earlier.He said Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had recently cautioned about a possible second wave in the second half of December. Therefore, the department refrained from opening the school from November 15.Dash, however, said that the department had already worked out a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for reopening the schools, but the pandemic situation does not favour campus activities.The state government, as part its Unlock 6.0 guidelines announced on October 31, had said schools would be allowed to resume activities after November 15 for students of Classes 9 to 12, in a graded manner.The move to reverse the decision came after it was found that hundreds of students and teachers in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, where classes for senior school students began on November 2, have contracted the viral disease.

06-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Police book YouTuber accused of cheating ‘Baba Ka Dhaba’ owner||The Delhi Police on Friday registered a case against YouTuber Gaurav Wasan for allegedly misappropriating funds received as donation for the owner of ‘Baba Ka Dhaba’, an eatery in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar.Kanta Prasad (80), the owner of the eatery, had shot to fame after a video of him tearfully recounting the desperation of the months since the lockdown was shot by Wasan and shared widely across social media platforms recently.The case was registered against the YouTuber following a complaint lodged by Prasad on October 31, nearly a month after the video went viral.In his complaint to police, Prasad alleged that Wasan “intentionally and deliberately shared only his and his family/friends bank details and mobile numbers with the donors and collected huge amount of donation... without providing any information to the complainant”.Wasan, however, denied the allegations.Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said, “After we received a complaint, preliminary enquiry was done and an FIR was registered under section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of Indian Penal Code and an investigation has been initiated.”  Earlier in the day, Prasad said he was hurt over being called “greedy” by some people on the social media after he lodged a complaint against Wasan and challenged the YouTuber to disclose his bank details to prove his innocence.Talking to reporters at a press conference, Prasad, accompanied by his lawyer Prem Joshi and blogger Tushant, claimed that Wasan gave him a cheque of 2.33 lakh on October 26 after the YouTuber was trolled for not handing over the donation amount to Prasad.Tushant alleged that Wasan has only disclosed his bank account statements from October 7 to 10 whereas he received more money after that. He demanded that Wasan must reveal his bank account statements till October 26.Joshi highlighted that in the initial videos shared by Wasan, he had claimed that Prasad did not have a bank account or a mobile phone but that was a “lie”.Joshi also claimed that on October 26, when Wasan gave the cheque to Prasad, he made him sign a paper claiming that all dues had been settled. However, later he again gave Rs 1.45 lakh to Prasad.Wasan, however, said that he has submitted to the police his bank account statements till November 2 and maintained that he gave all the amount received as donation for Prasad to him.

06-11-2020||Kolkata||TMC has separate law for Muslims, says Amit Shah in West Bengal||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday said West Bengal under Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was having a separate set of laws for Muslims.While he did not name Muslims, Shah made it amply clear what he meant when he said that the state was having three different sets of laws including one for “a particular group of people”.“One set of law is for nephew (meaning Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and political heir Abhishek Banerjee), the second set is for a particular group and third is for ordinary people”, Shah said.“You all can make out what I mean by a particular group”, Shah said flashing a knowing smile at journalists.The Union Home Minister spoke to journalists here on Friday evening at the end of his two-day tour of the poll-bound state.Earlier in the day, Shah accused Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of “appeasement” while talking to media persons at Kolkata’s famous Dakshineshwar Temple.The charge, made from the premises of a temple associated with the 19th century mystic Sri Ramakrishna drew strong reaction from ruling TMC leaders who pointed out that Ramakrishna himself believed in plurality of religions.  Shah also talked at length about political violence in West Bengal but ruled out imposition of President’s Rule in the state before the Assembly elections slated to be held early next year.Shah was recently quoted to have said that BJP workers of Bengal were right in demanding that the state should be brought under President’s Rule.However, on Friday, Shah said imposition of President's Rule would not be necessary since the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC government would be ousted from power in any case by April.“Whether Article 356 would be invoked in the case of West Bengal is not something that one discusses in a press conference. It is decided on the basis of report from the Governor and after consideration by union cabinet. But there is no question of taking resort to Article 356 for Bengal because the present government would be out in any case by April,” Shah, who has claimed that BJP would come to power in West Bengal by winning over 200 seats (out of total 294), said. The Union Home Minister said at least 100 BJP workers had been murdered in West Bengal during the last two and half tears by the goons of the ruling TMC. Workers of CPI (M) and Congress too had fallen victim to political violence unleashed by TMC, Shah said.Shah said that no arrest was made in most of these cases of political murders despite registration of FIRs. Chargesheet too was seldom filed, Shah said and sought a White Paper from Mamata Banerjee on the results of the investigations in the cases political murders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-has-separate-law-for-muslims-says-amit-shah-in-west-bengal-167016

Survival of MP govt depends on this case”.However, Bhushan on November 4 regretted the error in his earlier tweet.“Elections were held yesterday to seats of defecting Cong MLAs in MP who were made ministers in the Shivraj Govt. Survival of Shivraj govt will depend on their re-election, not on decision of case in CJIs court challenging their ministership. I regret this error in my tweet below,” the lawyer tweeted.It is significant to note that on November 4, a Bench headed by the CJI disposed of a plea that had raised the issue of pendency of disqualification proceedings against some Congress MLAs who had joined the BJP and were appointed as ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh.The plea was disposed of after senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for petitioner Congress MLA Vinay Saxena, said that bypolls on 28 assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh have been already held on Tuesday rendering the plea as infructuous.The top court, on August 31, had imposed a token fine of one rupee against Bhushan as punishment in the contempt case against him.Bhushan was earlier convicted for two tweets against the judiciary.

His Battalion was given the specific task of clearing a well-fortified Medium Machine Gun (MMG) enemy post at Atgram.Rifleman Chhetri, with complete disregard to his personal safety, fought fearlessly, charged the bunker, killed eight enemy troops with his khukri (a type of machete) and captured the MMG post. For his conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty, he was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra.He had to quit the service due to some personal reasons even before reaching the requisite pensionable service. He was discharged from service on April 8, 1976.Since then, he has been leading a very modest life in a remote village of Banke district in Nepal. His life, after quitting the service, got filled with misery as he has had no major source of income and has been surviving on his gallantry award allowance. Due to his introvert nature, his condition was never highlighted.However, his case recently came to notice when one senior officer of his unit informed the Defence Wing, Indian officials said.He was contacted and a total amount of Rs 10 lakh was approved as a welfare measure to alleviate the hardships being faced by him in his old age.During an ex-servicemen rally at Butwal, Nepal on November 21, 2019, he was felicitated with a cheque of Rs 5 lakh as the first tranche.Gen Naravane, during his visit to Nepal, handed over the balance amount of Rs 5 lakh to him on Friday.

06-11-2020||New Delhi||India summons Pak envoy on Kartarpur issue||India followed up its strong note to Pakistan on the Kartarpur Corridor issue on Thursday by summoning Pakistan’s Deputy High Commissioner on Friday to seek a reversal of its decision, said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava during a media briefing.The Pakistan diplomat was told that the decision to hand over the management of the project to the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) instead of the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (PSGPC) was highly condemnable.This is evident by the reaction of a section of the Sikh community here which also met MEA’s Pakistan Desk in-charge JP Singh to register their protest.The MEA said such actions expose the Pakistani leadership’s tall claims of preserving and protecting the rights and welfare of the religious minority communities.But the Pakistan Foreign Office maintained that PSGPC remained responsible for carrying out rituals at the gurdwara as per Sikh code of conduct.In another minority community related development in the neighbourhood, India has viewed the attacks on Hindu temples in Bangladesh “very seriously”.The MEA noted the efforts by the local law and order machinery to book the culprits and instil confidence in the minority community.India has also taken up the issue of Saudi Arabia misrepresenting Kashmir in a map embossed on a commemorative 20 Rial note issued to coincide with Riyadh’s Presidency of the G-20 grouping.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-summons-pak-envoy-on-kartarpur-issue-167011
06-11-2020||Satya Prakash||Insulting SC/ST persons not offence under SC/ST Act, unless victim abused for caste: SC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 6All insults or intimidations to a person will not be an offence under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, unless such insult or intimidation is on account of victim belonging to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, the Supreme Court has ruled.Clarifying the legal position on the stringent SC/ST Act, a Bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao on Thursday said it was essential to establish that there was an intention to humiliate the victim because he belonged to such a caste.“Thus, an offence under the Act would be made out when a member of the vulnerable section of the society is subjected to indignities, humiliations and harassment,” it said, citing Section 3(1) of the Act that talks of insult or intimidation done in “any place within public view”.The top court noted that the object of the Act is to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as they are denied a number of civil rights. The special law is intended to punish the acts of the upper caste against the vulnerable sections of the society for the reason that they belong to a particular community, it added.The verdict came on a petition challenging an Uttarakhand High Court order dismissing the petitioner’s plea for quashing of a chargesheet and summoning order against him for an offence under the SC/ST Act for hurling casteist abuses.Noting that the allegations were within the four walls of the building and there was no member of the public present at the time of the incident in the house, the top court held that the SC/ST Act was not attracted.The basic ingredient that the words were uttered ‘in any place within public view’ was not made out, it said.The offence under the Act was not established merely on the fact that the informant was a member of SC/ST unless there was an intention to humiliate him/her for the reason that the victim belonged to such a caste, the top court said, quashing the charges under the SC/ST Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/insulting-sc-st-persons-not-offence-under-sc-st-act-unless-victim-abused-for-caste-sc-167009

With such efforts the saffron party, which has not been able to make much inroads in the Southern state (its vote share dropping from 5.56 percent in 2014 to 3,66 in 2019) is aiming to turn around the situation. Party president JP Nadda also recently appointed state vice-president Vanathi Srinivasan as Mahila Morcha national president with an eye on upcoming elections.Meanwhile in Assam, the ruling BJP said it would campaign the next elections on two key issues —development and protection of the ‘civilisation of Assam’ from the ‘civilisation of infiltrators from Bangladesh’.“The soul has to be there in the body. So, if there is development and no civilisation, this cannot happen. I think BJP will go to the polls with equal focus on these two issues,” senior leader Himanta Biswa Sarma was quoted as saying.“….But obviously it is development which gives people the good feeling,” he added.In Kerala, threats of defections of senior leaders and resignations are rocking the BJP's state unit where observers say "such open dissent was never witnessed before".Several senior leaders like Sobha Surendran are unhappy with the state president K Surendran and Union Minister  V Muraleedharan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-gets-going-after-bihar-party-gearing-up-for-elections-in-five-other-states-167005
06-11-2020||New Delhi||November 9 e-auction of 34 coal blocks will be subject to its orders, says SC||The Supreme Court on Friday categorically told the Centre that the November 9 e-auction of 34 coal blocks, including five in Jharkhand, shall be subject to its final order.The apex court also asked the Centre to inform the bidders that benefits of any nature to them will be provisional.A Bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian was told by Attorney General K K Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, that no trees will be cut in the area.The Bench, in its order, said “the matter shall stand over till after vacation. In the meantime, any action in the matter that may be taken by the defendants (Centre) shall be subject to orders of this court”.It said, “The defendants (Centre) shall take care to inform the recipients of any benefit of any nature that the action is provisional in the sense that it will be subject to the orders passed by this court”.The Bench posted the matter for further hearing on December 8.At the outset, the Bench told Venugopal that due to paucity of time it will not hear this matter at length.It said that the AG had earlier told the court that the action on the ground will be taken after two years.“What we are proposing to do is that we will say any action you will take will be subject to our orders and we will fix it immediately after reopening,” the bench told Venugopal.Senior advocates Fali S Nariman, A M Singhvi and additional advocate generals Arunabh Choudhury and Krishnaraj Thaker, appearing for Jharkhand said, that cutting of trees in the area should be prohibited. Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for an intervenor NGO ‘Jharkhand Nagrik Prayas’, said that the Centre should ensure that there should not be any cutting of trees till then.Vengopal submitted that they have already said that there will not be any cutting of trees. In its note filed in the matter, Centre has given details of coal mines which are to be auctioned and their distance from nine eco-sensitive zones/ protected area/wildlife sanctuary.                                 It has said out of nine coal blocks, five will be auctioned while auction of four coal mines—Choritand Tiliaya, Chitarpur, North Dhadhu and Sheregarha-have been cancelled due to receipt of less than two bids.On November 9, financial bids will be opened for five other coal blocks of Jharkhand which include—Gondalpara, Rajhara North, Urma Paharitola, Brahmadiha and Chakla.It has also referred to various cases laws and office memorandum of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change with regard to procedure for consideration of development projects located within 10 kilometer of National Park/Wildlife Sanctuary seeking environmental clearance under the provisions of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2006.In the suit filed by Jharkhand on the same issue, the Centre in its written statement filed on September 15, has stated that it has initiated the process of auction of 41 coal blocks under the provisions of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 and provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 on June 18, 2020.It said that on July 21, one coal mine located in Maharashtra was withdrawn from the auction in consultation with the state government, leaving 40 coal mines.The Centre further said that thereafter in consultation with Chhattisgarh government five more coal mines were withdrawn from auction and three new mines were added in the present tranche of auction. It has said that total of 38 coal mines are to be put up for auction in the present tranche.However, after the auction was cancelled for four mines in Jharkhand, the total number of coal mines remaining to go under the hammer is 34.On November 4, the top court had said it intend to pass an order that any proposed mining block within the 50 kilometer radius of an eco-sensitive zone will not be e-auctioned in Jharkhand and a similar direction may be passed if such things are brought to its notice from other states. Maintaining that it only wanted to ensure that the “forests are not destroyed,” the top court also said it was mulling over the setting up of an expert committee to examine whether an area near the proposed mining sites in Jharkhand qualifies to be an eco-sensitive zone.The Centre had opposed the remarks of the top court saying the mining sites were at a distance of 20 to 70 km from such eco-sensitive zones and in states like Goa, the mining would become impossible, if this distance parameter is applied.On September 30, the top court had observed that if an area falls under eco sensitive zone then neither the Centre nor the state government will have the right to mine it.Jharkhand had sought postponing of e-auction of coal block for commercial mining in the state till its suit under Article 131 is decided by the top court.

Around 600 large Italian companies covering varied sectors such as fashion and garments, textiles and textile machinery, automotive components, infrastructure, chemicals, energy confectionery and insurance are currently active in India.

06-11-2020||New Delhi||Air pollution may lead to faster spread of COVID-19 infections, officials tell parliamentary panel||Air pollution may lead to a faster spread of COVID-19 infections as it causes coughing and sneezing, government officials told a parliamentary panel on Friday, according to sources.Top officials of the Union Environment and Health Ministries and the governments of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab deposed before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development to find a “permanent solution” to air pollution in the National Capital and adjoining areas.In addition, officials of the Central Pollution Control Board and from other departments also depose before the panel on the ongoing situation of air pollution in the national capital and its adjoining areas.The agenda of the meeting was to deliberate upon “steps taken for prevention of air pollution  special emphasis on finding permanent solution to air pollution in Delhi and NCR.”     In a presentation before the panel, officials from the Central Government expressed concern over the threat of COVID-19 spreading faster due to air pollution.“Higher air pollution may increase episodes of coughing and sneezing spreading COVID-19 faster. More particle surface for the virus to stick to and get transported over greater distance and may potentially survive longer,” the Health Ministry said in the presentation to the committee.Citing a Lancet study, the Health Ministry said, “There is average loss of 1.7 years of life expectancy in India due to air pollution.”            Similarly, it said in Delhi there is 1.7 times higher risk of respiratory ailments and prevalence of breathing problems and 10,000 to 30,000 air pollution deaths are reported annually.The environment ministry, in its presentation, shared the details of the status of air quality of Delhi during four years between 2016 and 2019.As per the presentation, the quality of Delhi air was good for only four days during this period and was very poor for 319 days.And the quality of air in Delhi was severe for 78 days.Delhi’s air quality on Thursday dropped to its worst level since December 2019 with farm fires accounting for 42 per cent of its pollution, the maximum this season so far, according to data from central government agencies.Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions—calm winds and low temperatures—and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states led to a dense layer of haze on Wednesday night as the air quality index entered the ‘severe’ category.The haze thinned on Thursday with higher wind speed helping in dispersion of pollutants. However, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 450, the highest since December 30 last year, when it was 446.All the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded air quality in the ‘severe’ category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Noida also recorded ‘severe’ air pollution.

06-11-2020||Mumbai||No bail yet for Arnab, hearing in HC to continue tomorrow||There was no immediate relief for Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami, arrested in a 2018 abetment of suicide case, on Friday as the hearing on his interim bail plea before the Bombay High Court remained incomplete.The court on Saturday will continue to hear his petition seeking interim bail and challenging his arrest in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother.Goswami was arrested in the case by Alibaug police in neighbouring Raigad district on Wednesday, and a magistrate’s court there remanded him in judicial custody till November 18.A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik heard arguments by his lawyers Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda on Friday, but said the hearing will continue on Saturday for paucity of time.“We will assemble for this matter tomorrow at noon.Since regular court work will not be there tomorrow, we can hear this matter at length,” the HC said. The high court normally does not assemble on Saturdays.The bench, during the hearing, noted that the normal practice when seeking bail is to first approach the concerned lower court  magistrate or sessions court—and move the high court if bail is refused.To this, Salve said section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) gives the high court special powers to hear bail pleas.“His (Goswami’s) liberty is at stake,” Salve said.Advocate Ponda said a bail application was filed before the magistrate’s court in Alibaug the same night Goswami was remanded in judicial custody.“However, the application was withdrawn the next day as the magistrate had not given clarity on when it would be heard and had also expressed difficulty in deciding the plea as the case lies in the jurisdiction of the sessions court,” Ponda said.Goswami was arrested on November 4 from his Lower Parel residence here and taken to Alibaug. The chief judicial magistrate there remanded him and co-accused Feroze Shaikh and Nitish Sarda in judicial custody.Goswami is presently kept at a local school which has been designated as a COVID-19 centre for the Alibaug prison.The HC on Saturday will also hear petitions filed by Shaikh and Sarda, seeking similar relief.It will also hear a petition filed by Anvay Naik’s daughter Adnya Naik seeking reinvestigation of the case or transfer to an independent agency.On Friday, Goswami’s lawyers also argued that the Maharashtra government was trying to harass him for questioning the government on his news channel.“This is a clear case of abuse of powers. There are multiple FIRs lodged against him. In this abetment of suicide case of 2018, the police have arrested him knowing fully well that courts will soon break for Diwali vacation. The Maharashtra government just wants to teach him a lesson,” advocate Salve said.The lawyers also pointed out that Alibaug Chief Judicial Magistrate had said in the remand order that the ‘arrest appears to be illegal’, and had questioned the whole prosecution case.“The court has noted that the police have not taken permission before reopening the case,” Salve said, adding that in such circumstances, Goswami need not be jailed.The high court sought to know if the magistrate’s order of Wednesday has been challenged.Ponda informed that the police have filed a revision application before the Alibaug sessions court against it.In May 2018, interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother Kumodini Naik allegedly died by suicide over alleged non-payment of dues by the accused persons’ companies.In 2019, the Alibaug police filed a closure report in the case which was accepted by a local court there.However, the case was reopened in October 2020 by the Alibaug police who claimed that fresh evidence had come to light which warranted further probe.

It was further alleged that the accused directed the complainant to pay a bribe to settle his tax issue,” the CBI official said.On the complaint, the CBI laid a trap and caught Sehra “while demanding and accepting bribe of Rs. 20,000” from the complainant, the official said, adding that later searches were conducted at the residence of the accused in Panchkula and at his office in Chandigarh, which led to recovery of incriminating documents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-arrests-cgst-official-in-chandigarh-for-allegedly-accepting-bribe-166988
06-11-2020||New Delhi||Priyanka demands halving of electricity rates for farmers in UP||Voicing concern over alleged irregularities in electricity billing in Uttar Pradesh, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday urged the Yogi Adityanath government to act against those responsible for it and demanded that the rate of power for farmers be halved immediately.The Congress general secretary in-charge Uttar Pradesh also demanded that relief be given to weavers, artisans and small-scale industries in electricity consumption.In a statement, she said that there was a “terror” of rising electricity bills and of meters in the whole of Uttar Pradesh.Noting there has been a big rise in electricity rates in the last few years, Priyanka Gandhi said that in the last eight years, the rates for rural household consumers have increased by 500 per cent, urban domestic electricity rates have risen by 84 per cent and for farmers the rates have increased by 126 per cent.She said Uttar Pradesh has become a “laboratory” for electricity meters which have been found to run many times faster than they should.Even in houses that are locked, a bill of up to Rs seven-eight thousand is coming, she alleged.In many districts of the state, it was also seen that bills came without electricity meter being installed, she said.The public is already reeling due to price rise, the business of small enterprises has collapsed, farmers’ crops are not being sold, they are not getting help in the event of floods, hailstorms and natural disasters, crop insurance scheme has become a source of income for big companies, and in such a situation, electricity prices are constantly increasing and consumers can no longer bear the brunt of irregularities, Priyanka Gandhi said.She said that in the COVID-19 pandemic, what should have happened was that people should have been given relief by reducing the rates of electricity in a big way.Electricity bills of farmers should have been waived and weavers-artisans, small-scale industries should have been given concession in electricity bills.She demanded that the electricity rates for farmers be halved, the truth about irregularities in metering be brought to the fore, those responsible for it be punished and weavers-artisans as well as small-scale industries be given relief in electricity consumption.Later, in a tweet, Priyanka Gandhi lashed out at the Uttar Pradesh government over the alleged arrest of farmers in Saharanpur for stubble burning.“Are only farmers responsible for pollution? When will action be taken against those who are really responsible for pollution?” she said.“Farmers’ vote—legal, farmer’s paddy—legal, farmers’ straw—illegal?” she tweeted.Priyanka Gandhi also thanked Congress workers for ensuring the release of farmers allegedly arrested in Saharanpur.

06-11-2020||New Delhi||Anganwadi centres, schools, panchayat buildings to be used as COVID-19 vaccination sites||Anganwadi centres, schools, panchayat buildings and other such setups would be used extensively in addition to healthcare facilities as vaccination sites in the anti-coronavirus inoculation drive which would be monitored by the Union health ministry’s digital platform and would involve sending SMSes and generating a QR code after each jab to track the beneficiaries.According to a blueprint deliberated upon by an expert group, state governments would identify buildings that can be used as vaccination booths under the special COVID-19 immunisation programme that would run parallel to the existing Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP).“The vaccination sites will not be limited to just healthcare facilities. Such centres would also be set up in anganwadi centres, schools, panchayat buildings and other such setups as identified by state governments,” a source said.The health ministry’s existing digital platform eVIN, which is being used for the UIP, is being enhanced for COVID-19 vaccine distribution and delivery, through which SMSes would be sent to recipients informing the time, date and venue to get the shots and digitally connect them and also track them, the source said.Each person in the immunisation list would be linked with their Aadhaar cards to avoid duplication and to track beneficiaries. However, in case a person doesn’t have an aadhaar card, a government photo identity can be used, sources said.The Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) system provides real-time information on vaccine stocks and storage temperatures across all cold chain points in the country under the UIP.The prime minister, during a review meeting last month, had suggested making use of the experience of the successful conduct of elections and disaster management, for developing the vaccine delivery and distribution system, involving the participation of states/UTs/district-level functionaries, civil society organisations, volunteers, citizens, and experts from all necessary domains.The coronavirus vaccine, once available, would be distributed under a special COVID-19 inoculation programme, using the processes, technology and network of the existing UIP, official sources had said earlier.According to them, the Centre will procure the vaccine directly to make it available to the priority groups through the existing network of states and districts.The vaccine is being planned to be administered to the priority groups free-of-cost.States have been asked not to chart separate pathways of procurement, they said.The Centre, with the help of state and UT governments, has started the process of identifying around 30 crore priority beneficiaries who would be given vaccine dose in the initial phase.The government has demarcated four categories which includes around 1 crore healthcare professionals including doctors, MBBS students, nurses and ASHA workers etc, around two crore frontline workers, including municipal corporation workers, personnel of the police and armed forces, about 26 crore people aged above 50 and a special category of those below 50 with co-morbidities and requiring specialised care.States have been asked to enlist by mid-November the priority population groups to receive the vaccine.The National Expert Committee on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 has already mapped the existing cold chain presently being utilised under the government’s immunisation programme and has also made a projection of the additionality that will be required.Presently facilities of cold chain in over 28,000 locations are being used under the UIP. Presently the group is engaged with mapping the private sector facilities for augmenting the capacity.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had said in October that the Centre estimates to receive and utilise 40-50 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine covering 20-25 crore people by July next year. Stating COVID-19 vaccine introduction will span over an year with multiple groups being included “sequentially starting from health care workers”, the health ministry has sought constitution of committees at state and district level which will review preparatory activities in terms of cold chain preparedness, operational planning, strategies for state specific challenges in terms of geographical terrain and hard to reach areas etc.The ministry has suggested setting up of a state steering committee (SSC) chaired by the chief secretary, a state task force (STF) led by additional Chief Secretary or principal secretary (health), and a district task force (DTF) to be headed by the district magistrate. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anganwadi-centres-schools-panchayat-buildings-to-be-used-as-covid-19-vaccination-sites-166978
06-11-2020||New Delhi||IAF's strong posturing during Ladakh standoff helped India ward off any threat from China: Bhadauria||The proactive deployment of IAF's "offensive" capabilities in response to the standoff with China in eastern Ladakh demonstrated its current operational readiness and the strong posturing was instrumental in dissuading the adversary to a large extent, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Friday.The Indian Air Force (IAF) chief also said that the Balakot air strikes in Pakistan clearly demonstrated that air power could be put to sophisticated use and create a space for action below the conventional threshold.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria was speaking at an online seminar organised by the National Defence College."Over the past few months, the proactive deployment of our offensive capabilities in response to developments in eastern Ladakh, both in terms of deployment of air assets as well as rapid airlifting of Army combat elements, demonstrated the IAF's operational readiness today," he said without elaborating .He said the deployment also reflected the capability and the nation's resolve to use air power if the need arises."It is our belief that our pro-active action and strong posture was instrumental in dissuading the adversary from making further attempts...We remain hopeful that the peace and stability will be restored along the LAC through ongoing dialogue," he said.The IAF has deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the Line of Actual Control(LAC).The newly inducted fleet of Rafale jets has also been carrying out sorties in eastern Ladakh.On the Balakot strikes, he said terrorist organisations will have to think "hard" before making any further attempts to carry out attacks.Indian warplanes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammad(JeM) terrorist training camp on February 26 last year, nearly two weeks after the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed."The air strikes in February last year by Indian Air Force targeting terror infrastructure at Balakot clearly demonstrated that air power could be put to sophisticated use and create a space for action below the conventional threshold," Bhadauria said.Talking about the overall security scenario, he said there has been a transformation of the security paradigm in recent years."Our definitions of national boundaries have shifted beyond the classical definition of land border, shore lines etc. We cannot remain chained to the old concepts of fronts -- two fronts, one front. The nature and scope of warfare itself has expanded," he said.In Indian defence parlance, the two front conflict refers to hostilities along the country's western and northern borders.The Chief of Air Staff said the induction of modern platforms and acquisition of nice capabilities has bolstered the IAF's combat capabilities across the entire spectrum of warfare."The ongoing transformation is aimed at adding agility to our combat fleets. However, practitioners of air power are mindful of the fact that besides providing a host of kinetic and non-kinetic response options against an adversary, a strong and capable air force plays a much larger role in ensuring deterrence and avoiding conflict in the first place." Speaking on the occasion, Vice Chief of Army Staff S K Saini said India's unsettled borders have been its biggest security challenge."The possibility of conflict over territorial disputes with China and Pakistan will continue to remain an important factor in our defence planning," he added.Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh said the Indian Navy remained poised for rapid response in any situation."For the Indian Navy, operating farther and outward from Indian shores, in step with our country's national interests, is a strategic imperative and necessity," he said.He said the aim of Indian Navy is to be ‘first responder' and ‘preferred security partner' for the Indian Ocean littorals.

06-11-2020||New Delhi||India ready to help countries in vaccine production and delivery: Foreign Secretary Shringla||India on Friday conveyed to several countries that it will use its strength in vaccine production and delivery to help humanity in fighting the coronavirus crisis.The message was delivered by Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla during an interaction with ambassadors and high commissioners of foreign missions in India."Several countries have been approaching us for receiving vaccine supply. I reiterate our Prime Minister's commitment that India's vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis. India will also help interested countries in enhancing their cold chain and storage capacities for the delivery of vaccines," he said.The interaction was organised to provide the envoys an outline of the COVID-19 vaccine development programme in India, delivery system management and ongoing international cooperation on it.Shringla said India is on track to develop the vaccines."We are exploring the possibility of conducting phase three trials in a few of our partner countries. We are also looking forward to research collaboration in the field of vaccine development. Based on willingness, we may also go for joint production of vaccines in some countries," he said."We have already conducted online training sessions for nearly 90 participants from eight neighbouring countries to develop capacity in clinical trials and clinical practices. Based on demand, we can conduct more such training courses," he added.To give a flavour of India's "robust and resilient" progress in vaccine development and the trial process, the foreign secretary said that the government is planning to take a delegation of resident envoys for a tour of vaccine and diagnostic facilities in Pune.Talking about the COVID-19 infection in India, he said the daily caseload has reduced to below 50,000 from around 1,00,000 a few weeks ago."We remain vigilant though, and continue to devise and re-devise strategies based on our experiences across India," he said.Shringla said India's recovery rate is now 91.96 per cent (as on November 3, 2020) and case fatality rate has dropped to 1.49 per cent due to increase in testing numbers, contact tracing, effective isolation protocol, efficient use of hospital beds, increased availability of medical equipment, testing kits and sustained public awareness campaign."With progressively falling positivity rate, testing has worked as an effective tool to limit the spread of infection," he said.

06-11-2020||Bijendra Ahlawat||Nikita murder case: SIT files 700-page chargesheet||Tribune News ServiceFaridabad, November 6The five-member SIT probing the murder of Nikita Tomer submitted a 700-page chargesheet in the local court on Friday.Nikita (21) was allegedly shot dead by Tausif (22) outside the gate of her college in Ballabgarh here on October 26, and SIT was formed on October 27 to probe the case.“The chargesheet contains digital, forensic and material evidence besides statements of 60 witnesses, including a girl who was present at the spot and tried to help the victim at the time of the incident,” said the police.Besides the CCTV footage, the dying declaration of the victim was one of the key pieces of evidence that has been included in the chargesheet.While the chargesheet has been prepared under the direct supervision and guidance of senior officials, the SIT led by ACP (Crime) Anil Kumar has consulted legal experts to include all the angles to ensure that culprits do not get away, it is claimed.  As 10 teams of the police were engaged in the hunt for the accused soon after the crime, the main accused was nabbed within five and half hours. Nikita, a student of final year of the B.Com (Hons) was pounced upon by the accused as soon as she came out after appearing in the final semester exam. She was shot by the accused after he failed to abduct her in a car waiting there and the whole incident was captured by a CCTV installed outside a school opposite the college.''Nikita was murdered as she turned down the offer or pressure from the accused to marry him after converting to Islam,” claimed the kin.Three accused, including Tausif, his accomplice Rehan and one Arju who supplied the weapon have already been arrested.The weapon and car used in the crime has been recovered.The police had been under pressure in view of huge uproar and protest by the victim’s kin and residents who sought death penalty for the accused.The state government has already announced the trial of the case in a fast-track court. Besides providing a gun licence to the brother and maternal uncle of the victim, round the clock security has been provided to the family. “We are satisfied with the prosecution and hope that accused get death penalty soon,” said Mool Chand Tomer, Nikita’s father.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nikita-murder-case-sit-files-700-page-chargesheet-166971

06-11-2020||Patna||Bihar polls: Pleas for votes heard louder and clearer than those for masks, social distancing||As Bihar was readying for polls, many wanted them deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As voting draws to a close, it has been for everyone to see that people have gone about their business, including casting the ballots, with an air that they could not care less of all the health warnings.The Election Commission’s guidelines about social distancing and use of face masks were mostly practiced in the breach as big crowds came to hear leaders of various political parties across the state, even as the poll watchdog put in place elaborate mechanism to adhere to COVID-19 safety protocol inside polling booths.That Bihar as of now is one of the least affected states within the country by the pandemic, which has severely affected the normal life in many parts of the country, it has made people indifferent to concerns about the disease as they get on with their daily routine.Government figures said on Friday that the state, India’s third-largest by population, had only 6,356 active cases. Despite being one of the poorest states in the country, the official figures show it has a better recovery rate than the national average for COVID-19.“Why should we fear corona when we hardly see any impact of the virus around us” is the most common refrain across the state when people are asked about why they don’t use face masks or maintain physical distancing.However, several other theories, not endorsed by experts, including that the novel coronavirus does not affect people hardened by physical labour, also have some takers.Several leaders, including Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi and BJP’s in-charge for the polls Devendra Fadnavis, contracted the virus during the poll campaign.However, it has had little impact on the majority of the people as they participated enthusiastically in the polling exercise without following the COVID-19 guidelines.Officials said any strictness in enforcing the health guidelines might have been counterproductive and could have ended up curbing the people’s participation in the humongous election exercise, the first since the pandemic outbreak.The voting percentage in the first two phases of the elections has belied any concern about lack of popular participation with 55.69 per cent and 55.70 per cent of polling registered respectively.While the first phase saw nearly one per cent more polling compared to the 2015 polls, the second phase had a fall of less than 0.50 per cent.The last phase of the polls in 78 seats of the 243-seat assembly will be held on Saturday.Several rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has repeatedly made fervent appeals to the countrymen to follow the COVID-19 guidelines, saw BJP members giving masks to the people walking into venues.At several political rallies, chairs were also kept at a distance but it all amounted to little ultimately as the masses in hundreds and thousands milled around at these meetings.Rallies by state leaders, including Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, saw people packed like sardines at several places.Bamboo barricades were broken by enthusiastic crowds at Yadav’s rallies at a few places as they jostled to come close to the young politician.Political events apart, very few people seem to prefer wearing masks in much of the state, fewer still in rural areas.While the state adhered to the tough lockdown like most of the country during the pandemic’s early spread, people have become laxer with the reopening of the economy and resumption of normal life.

06-11-2020||Pune||Steps being taken to combat Delhi, north pollution: Javadekar||Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday said the Centre was taking all steps to combat air pollution in Delhi and other parts of north India ahead of the winter season.The Union minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change was speaking online at the launch of the country's first demonstration plant of Praj Industries, a private a firm that produces compressed biogas from biomass."The government is taking all steps to combat air pollution in Delhi and north India. We will be using all the possible technological interventions towards it," he said.The minister said stubble burning is an inexpensive way to get rid of agricultural waste but it severely affects air quality in Delhi and other northern states."The Indian Agricultural Research Institute has created a 'pusa decomposer', an affordable way to get rid of stubble. We have used it in five states and results are awaited. By spraying it, the stubble dissolves so it will be a very big success," Javadekar said.He said the use of technology by way of decomposers, gas and other machinery will save the national capital and its surrounding regions from air pollution due to stubble burning.The minister also said polluting industries were being monitored 24/7, adding 6000 tons of debris and waste material generated at construction sites were being used to make tiles and paver blocks.Some thermal power projects have been closed as part of this fight against pollution, he added.The minister complimented the firm for its innovations for a "cleaner and greener world" and said "CBG (compressed biogas) technology was one of the most sustainable solutions to combat air pollution".Conversion of agricultural residue and biomass into biofuel is also in keeping with the Centre's move towards Atmanirbhar Bharat, he added.

06-11-2020||Kolkata||TMC slams Shah over appeasement remark, says communalism has no place in Bengal||The TMC leadership on Friday slammed Union Home Minister Amit Shah over his "appeasement remark" and said communal politics had no place in Bengal.Mocking Shah's scheduled visit to a Matua family for lunch, the party described his refugee community outreach as a "poll gimmick" to divert attention from atrocities committed on backward communities in states ruled by the saffron party.Stressing that there was a need to restore West Bengal's "lost glory", Shah during his visit to the Dakshineswar temple here said the present "appeasement politics" in the state had hurt its age-old tradition of upholding the nation's spiritual consciousness.Shah, who is on a two-day visit to Bengal to take stock of organisational activities ahead of the 2021 state polls, had on Thursday said he could sense massive public anger against the Mamata Banerjee government and that the death knell of her regime had been sounded."What does Amit Shah mean by appeasement politics? Was he speaking as a BJP activist or as the Union Home Minister of the country? The government has to treat all communities with equality and respect. I don't think it is a crime to do something for the development of minorities in the state," said senior TMC leader and MP Sougato Roy.He sought to know why Shah ignored the fact that the Bengal Government had allowed Durga Puja celebrations, even when many BJP-ruled states cancelled it."Why is he not speaking about the state government's decision to allow Durga Puja celebrations? Was it minority appeasement? I would want to say that communalism has no place in West Bengal. The people of the state will reject BJP's divisive politics," he added.State minister Firhad Hakim too took a jibe at Shah over his scheduled lunch at a Matua family's residence and said it was a desperate attempt to fool people."In all BJP-ruled states, tribals, dalits and those from the backward communities are being tortured. There are reports of atrocities everywhere."So this drama of having lunch at the house of a person from the Matua community is nothing but a poll gimmick before the Assembly elections. But he can't people fool every time, and the Matuas are very well aware of the BJP's double standards," said Hakim.The Matuas, originally from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), had been migrating to West Bengal since the 1950s, mostly due to religious persecution. The community, with an estimated population of three million in the state, influences at least four Lok Sabha seats and 40 Assembly seats in Nadia, North and South 24 Parganas districts.According to state BJP sources, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which was passed in the Parliament last year, is likely to help several refugee communities such as the Matuas to obtain citizenship of the country.The CAA will benefit more than 1.5 crore people across the country, including over 72 lakh in the West Bengal, said the sources.

06-11-2020||New Delhi||India tops global survey on COVID-19 vaccination intent; rising hesitancy in many countries||Indians are the keenest on getting vaccinated whenever a COVID-19 vaccine is available, even as people in 10 out of 15 countries showed a growing reluctance about getting vaccinated, according to a global survey.In the World Economic Forum/Ipsos survey of 18,526 adults from 15 countries, 73 per cent said they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if available, down from 77 per cent in August.While vaccination intent has remained unchanged at 87 per cent in India since August, it has declined in 10 of the 15 countries surveyed, most of all in China, Australia, Spain, and Brazil.Globally, the two main reasons for not wanting to get a COVID-19 vaccine are concerns about side effects (cited by 34 per cent) and concerns about clinical trials moving too fast (cited by another 33 per cent). In India also, 34 per cent respondents said they are worried about side effects, while 16 per cent are concerned about fast-moving trials.Besides, one in ten persons globally said they are against vaccines in general (19 per cent in India), while another 10 per cent said they don't think a vaccine will be effective (14 per cent in India), and 8 per cent cited a low risk of getting COVID-19 (14 per cent in India), as per the survey.The World Economic Forum (WEF) said the latest survey has shown a growing reluctance to receive a vaccine, despite progress made by numerous pharmaceutical companies working on vaccine trials and international organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi and CEPI working to ensure any future solution is available for those most in need.Arnaud Bernaert, Head of Shaping the Future of Health and Healthcare at the WEF, said, "This drop in vaccine confidence is a remarkable and sad trend as we edge closer to a possible vaccine roll-out.""The numbers are significant enough to compromise the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine to manage the disease and to see an end to the cycle of new lockdowns and restrictions. It is critical that governments and the private sector come together to build trust in the next steps. It's important to know that when a vaccine is ready, it will make a difference," Bernaert added.The survey also asked the respondents how soon after a vaccine becomes available would they get one.Nearly half of the adults globally said they would get vaccinated within three months after the COVID-19 vaccine is available to all (54 per cent in India).Globally, 72 per cent said they would get vaccinated within a year (82 per cent in India).The WHO had called 'public hesitancy towards vaccination' as one of the top-10 threats to global health in 2019, affecting not only public health but businesses and economies also.The survey was conducted by leading market research company Ipsos from October 8-13, 2020, with a sample of 18,526 adults in the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, and the UK.The survey also put Indians as being the second most optimistic about availability of a COVID-19 vaccine soon -- 34 per cent expecting it within three months and 72 per cent within six months. China topped the chart with 37 per cent expecting a vaccine in three months and 75 per cent in six months.Globally, 16 per cent expect the first vaccine for general use in three months and 45 per cent in six months.More than 4.8 crore people have tested positive for the virus so far globally, while more than 12 lakh have died.India's COVID-19 caseload has crossed past 84 lakh, while nearly 1.25 lakh have died.

06-11-2020||Mumbai||No legal void to regulate TV news content: Centre to HC||There was no void in the existing legal framework on regulating the content broadcast by the electronic media and adequate mechanism existed for the purpose, the Union government told the Bombay High Court on Friday.The submission was made in context of recent reportage on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and PILs calling for restrain on media coverage of the high-profile case.Appearing for the Centre, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh told a bench that there existed adequate statutory as well as self-regulatory mechanism for the media, including TV news channels, to follow while printing or broadcasting any news items.The ASG was responding to previous queries posed by the bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni while hearing a bunch of PILs seeking that the press, particularly television news channels, be restrained in their reportage on the death of Rajput.The PILs, filed through senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, by activists, private citizens and a group of retired police officers, had also sought that TV news channels be stopped from conducting a media trial into the case.Last month, the bench had asked the Union government if there existed any statutory mechanism to regulate the content broadcast by the electronic media akin to the regulatory mechanism exercised by the Press Council of India for the print media.The bench had also asked at the time if there existed any vacuum in law on the issue, and had asked the Union government to clarify if the high court had the jurisdiction to frame guidelines for the same.On Friday, Singh said while the HC had the requisite jurisdiction, there was no need for any new statutory mechanism or guidelines to be framed for the electronic media.He said besides the statutory mechanisms that included the guidelines of the Programme Code of the Cable TV Network Act, an aggrieved party also had the option of invoking the court's intervention through the law of defamation, or the Contempt of Courts Act."There is statutory and self-regulatory mechanism in place. The Programme Code specifically states that transmission is allowed only if it confers with the code," Singh said."I am submitting that on the point of guidelines, there is already a mechanism in place," the ASG said.He said that while the court could exercise its jurisdiction to frame new guidelines, the trouble would be in implementing such rules.Singh added that the Contempt of Courts Act could be invoked in a case in pre-trial stage, too.He said that prejudicial media reporting at the stage of investigation could amount to contempt of court if it interfered with the administration of justice."It (the Contempt of Courts Act) can be invoked from the time that an FIR is registered and trial becomes imminent," Singh said."This is the view taken by the supreme court," he said."Today this high court frames guidelines, tomorrow, if another high court frames guidelines, and then another one does too, how will the guidelines be implemented?" Singh said.Senior advocate Arvind Datar, who appeared for the National Broadcasters Standards Authority (NBSA), an independent body set up by the National Broadcasters Association to look into complaints, said there was no shortage of regulatory framework at present.Datar assured the court that the NBSA would soon come out with guidelines on media reportage on a case after registration of an FIR.On previous hearings, private TV news channels, that are a party to the case, had argued that the self-regulatory mechanism was adequate and that no new mechanism or guidelines were required to control the media.On Friday, the HC closed all arguments in the case and reserved its verdict.

06-11-2020||Satya Prakash||SC issues contempt notice to Maharashtra Assembly Secretary for threatening Arnab for moving court||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 6The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Secretary asking him to explain why contempt proceedings not be initiated against him for threatening Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami for moving the court."Can any authority in the country penalise someone for approaching this court? This is in the teeth of Article 32. How dare this officer write something like this in his letter?" a Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde said pulling up the Maharashtra Assembly Secretary."We have a serious question on the author of this letter and we find it extremely difficult to overlook this,” the CJI said.The top court ordered the Assembly Secretary to remain present before it on the next date.It also appointed senior advocate Arvind Datar as amicus curiae and posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.The court told senior advocate AM Singhvi, representing the Maharashtra government, to look into the conduct of the officer concerned.The CJI's outburst came after senior advocate Harish Salve, representing Goswami, told the Bench that the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Secretary wrote a letter to Goswami on October 13 questioning the Republic TV Editor-in-Chief for "breaching" confidentiality of privilege proceedings by moving the top court.The Bench also granted protection from arrest to Goswami in this case as Salve urged the court to protect him from any coercive action by the Privileges Committee of the Assembly.Pointing out that "cases after cases" were being filed against Goswami, Salve said, "Constitutional courts have to see the reality, not the smokescreen."The Assembly Secretary, who had already been served with a notice on Arnab's petition, hasn't made an appearance so far in the court.Instead, he wrote a letter to Goswami threatening him for approaching the court.Noting that the letter written by the Secretary of the Assembly was unprecedented and had a tendency to bring the administration of justice to disrepute, the Bench said it also amounted to interference with the administration of justice."The intention of the author (Assembly Secretary) seems to intimidate the petitioner (Goswami) because he approached this court and threaten him with a penalty for doing so," the top court said.In its order, the court said the Assembly Secretary must know that the right to approach the Supreme Court under Article 32 itself was a fundamental right."There is no doubt that if a citizen is deterred from exercising his right under Article 32, it will amount to serious interference with the administration of justice," the top court said.The Supreme Court had on September 30 issued notice to the Maharashtra Assembly Secretary on Goswami’s petition challenging a notice breach of privilege issued to him for his alleged remarks against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in Sushant Singh Rajput death case.It had asked the Maharashtra Assembly Secretary to respond to Goswami's petition within a week after Salve submitted his client didn't interfere with the proceedings of the House or any of its committees.Rajput, a Bollywood actor, was allegedly found hanging at his Bandra residence in Mumbai on June 14. The Supreme Court on August 19 ordered a CBI probe into his unnatural death, saying, “A fair, competent and impartial investigation is the need of the hour.”Unless there was interference in the functioning of the House or its committees breach of privilege motion can’t be initiated against an outsider, Salve had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-contempt-notice-to-maharashtra-assembly-secretary-for-threatening-arnab-for-moving-court-166939
06-11-2020||New Delhi||Govt yet to take call on China's entry into 5G; penetration in existing network extensive: Bhalla||Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Friday said the government has not taken any call on allowing Chinese telecom companies to enter into the 5G trials in India but acknowledged that the penetration of the neighbouring country into the existing network is too extensive.Bhalla, however, also made it clear that the government is making special safeguards to ensure safety and security of the country's communication network."On 5G, the government in any case has not taken any call. Discussions are still on...when it will be allowed and who are the people to be allowed. Point is very valid. The penetration of existing telecom hardware and software is too extensive," he said at the Diamond Jubilee webinar organised by National Defence College.He was replying to a question on participation of Chinese telecom players in India's 5G trials.The home secretary said unless India gets a substitute, the existing facilities cannot be closed down abruptly."Unless we have a substitute available, we just can't switch off and say that this will not be allowed. But the government can definitely make special safeguards and ensure the safety and security of the system of communication of the country. That we are having and we are developing and we will definitely be able to deal with that," he said.The US has banned Huawei, the world's leader in telecom equipment and the number two smartphone producer, over concerns of security and Washington has been putting pressure on other countries to restrict the operations of the Chinese telecom firm.India, however, is yet to take a call on whether it intends to place curbs on Huawei or allow the Chinese telecom equipment maker to participate in the upcoming 5G trials.Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had earlier said India has its security issues over allowing Huawei to participate in the upcoming 5G trials."We will take a firm view on it. There are also security issues...it is not only a matter of technology, as regard their participation in 5G is concerned...Participation of 5G is not conditional upon the trial being started. Whether a particular company is allowed to participate or not, is a complex question, including security issues," he had said.

He has already secured bail in three other cases.Prasad's lawyer Kapil Sibal, who attended the court session virtually, said the ailing RJD chief, currently undergoing treatment at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Ranchi, has served more than half the sentence that was awarded to him in the case.The CBI objected to Sibal's assertion and said that it would take some to time to file a written reply on Prasad's health condition and his incarceration in this case.Sibal, however, claimed that the probe agency was "deliberately" delaying the matter.Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh, after taking all arguments into consideration, postponed hearing in the case till November 27.The case pertains to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 3.13 crore from Dumka treasury when Prasad was the chief minister of undivided Bihar.

06-11-2020||New Delhi||Linking Aadhaar to property will lead to major reduction in black money: Survey||A majority of respondents in a survey want the government to make "mandatory linking of all property ownerships with Aadhaar" and "mandatory disclosure of all assets of all ministers and government employees and their direct families" as a way forward to curb black money.The recommendation from people about disclosures applies not just to Central Government and Public Sector Undertakings but also to all State Government Ministers and Employees and their direct families.One of the key issues identified by people continues to be the usage of shell companies by public officials to accept bribes.Citizens have listed how family members of corrupt public officials are listed as directors in these shell companies and graft is received as share capital at a high premium. The money received is then utilised by the promoters of the company to pay salaries to themselves or fake employees on the payrolls.Citizens on the LocalCircles platform pointed to various areas where illegal economic activities are rampant. On a question in the survey asked, "What should be the one move that the Government should implement immediately to further reduce black money in India?", 15,492 voters responded. Of which, 33 per cent said "make linking of all property ownerships with Aadhaar mandatory", 38 per cent said "mandatory disclosure of all assets of all ministries and government employees and their direct families", 10 per cent said "demonetise INR 2,000 rupee note immediately", 7 per cent said "levy 2 per cent transaction tax on all cash transactions above Rs 10,000", and 5 per cent each voted for "detailed scrutiny of all individual with a Swiss Bank account" and "other things", while 2 per cent said "can't say".When compared with last year's survey, this year's results show that buying "groceries" and giving out "salaries to domestic staff" continue to be the top categories where citizens transacted in cash and didn't produce a receipt in the last 12 months.These are mainly low-value transactions that people don't ask for receipts or salary slips.LocalCircles conducted a survey to understand citizens' purchasing habits with and without a money receipt, and the purpose of that transaction? It then compared this year's findings with a similar survey released in 2019 to understand the trend among citizens transacting in cash without receipt in the last 12 months? Further, it highlights areas where black money is still getting generated in India. The survey received over 45,000 responses from more than 300 districts of India. Of which, 51 per cent respondents were from tier 1, 34 per cent from tier 2, and 15 per cent from tier 3, 4 and rural districts.After comparing the finding with similar survey results of 2019, 14 per cent of citizens in 2020 reported saying, "50-100 per cent" of their monthly purchases on average were without a receipt, from 27 per cent in 2019.This shows that there has been a 50 per cent reduction in the number of citizens who do the majority of their monthly purchases without receipt in 2020.However, four years later, the biggest beneficiaries of demonetisation seems to be faster adoption of digital payments and digital transactions by Indian citizens.

MM Naravane who paid a courtesy call on him.Gen Naravane’s three-day visit to Nepal was largely aimed at resetting bilateral ties that came under severe strain following a bitter border row between the two countries.The meeting between Gen Naravane and Oli, who is also the defence minister of Nepal, took place at his official residence in Baluwatar, Nepal Army sources said.Prime Minister Oli said that “there has been good friendship between Nepal and India”, according to his foreign affairs advisor Rajan Bhattarai.Oli expressed hope that the “problems between the two countries would be resolved through dialogue”, Bhattarai said in a tweet after the meeting.The Nepal prime minister mentioned the centuries-old special relations existing between Nepal and India, and the tradition of conferring Honorary General of Army on each other’s Army chiefs, Bhattarai said.The Indian Embassy said that “during the meeting, both sides also exchanged views on the extensive bilateral partnership between India and Nepal. Gen Naravane reaffirmed that he would work to further strengthen the defence cooperation between the two countries”.Gen Naravane conveyed the best wishes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Prime Minister Oli and the people of Nepal, it said in a statement.The Indian Army chief also expressed his personal gratitude for the warm hospitality extended by the Government of Nepal.As the last stop of his visit, Gen Naravane visited the Indian Embassy where he was briefed about the welfare activities being carried out for around 230,000 Indian Army veterans and their families in Nepal.During the visit, he also presented a welfare grant to Lance Havildar (retired) Dil Bahadur Chhettri, a winner of Maha Vir Chakra, the second highest gallantry award of India.Gen Naravane’s engagements in Nepal included a visit to the headquarters of the Nepalese Army and attending a banquet hosted in his honour by chief of Nepalese Army Gen Purna Chandra Thapa. On Thursday, the two Army chiefs held talks and discussed ways to boost bilateral military cooperation.According to the Nepal Army sources, they discussed issues pertaining to mutual security concerns.“During the meeting, they also discussed matters relating to enhancing and expanding areas of cooperation between the two armies including exchange of high-level visits and training, within the existing framework of Nepal-India Bilateral Consultative Group’s Meeting on Security Issues.“Nepal Army firmly believes that such high level of visits will help to further cement the friendship between two Armies and the two countries,” the Nepal Army said in a statement on the conclusion of Gen Naravane’s visit.He left for Delhi on Friday afternoon after concluding a successful three-day official visit to Nepal. Chief of Gen. Staff Lt. Gen. Prabhuram Sharma bade farewell to the Indian Army chief at Tribhuvan International Airport, the statement added.The Chief of Army Staff, who arrived here on Wednesday, earlier in the day enjoyed a mountain flight during which he had a brief stopover at Syangboche airport, the gateway to the world’s highest peak Mount Everest, they said.Gen Naravane also addressed the middle-level student officers at the Army Command and Staff College at Shivapuri on the outskirts of Kathmandu. During the interaction, he shared his experience with the student officers, they said.On Thursday, Gen Naravane was conferred the honorary rank of General of the Nepali Army by President Bidya Devi Bhandari at a special ceremony, a decades old tradition that reflects the strong ties between the two militaries.The Army chief’s visit is the first high-level trip from India to Kathmandu since ties between the two neighbours came under strain after the Himalayan nation came up with a new political map in May claiming several areas in Uttarakhand to be part of its territory.Nepal had protested after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal claimed that the road passed through its territory. Days later, it came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories. India too had published a new map in November 2019 showing the areas as its territories.After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a “unilateral act” and cautioning Kathmandu that such “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.India said Nepal’s action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks.India’s decision to send the Army chief to Nepal to reset the ties is seen as part of a larger exercise by New Delhi to rejuvenate relations with Myanmar, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan in the wake of greater efforts by China to expand its influence in the region.Last month, Gen Naravane travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on an important visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmarese Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties.

"Substantial electronic computing and data storage has been found, which is being examined," the CBDT said.The Board said the searches were carried out as "credible information was received that the group has received donations from foreign countries ostensibly for helping the poor and the destitute and for evangelical purposes but was actually siphoning out such tax-exempted funds in cash to engage in unaccounted cash transactions for personal and other illegal expenses in real estate transactions."It said the Thiruvalla-based group operates about 30 trusts, registered across the country, and most of them "exist only on paper and have been found to be used for routing unaccounted funds and for accommodation (hawala) transactions."  "It has been found that the modus operandi of the group is to systematically inflate expenses with the help of other parties who would return the inflated amount in cash through domestic hawala channels to the functionaries of the group," it said."Some of these other parties were also covered in the search action," it said.  During the raids, it said, evidence have been found of "systematic inflation of expenses in the purchase of consumables, construction expenses, real estate development expenses, payment of salary, etc.""The search has led to unearthing of a number of real estate transactions involving unaccounted cash payments. Related documents such as sale agreements, etc have been seized. The group has also inflated the price in real estate transactions to show as if the money received in donations is being spent on the activities of the trusts," it said."The evidence found so far indicate that the siphoning of funds in cash may be running into hundreds of crores of rupees," it added.

He was booked along with a BSF official for allegedly running the cattle smuggling gang.  On Thursday, the CBI had searched the premises of two chartered accountants in Kolkata in connection with the case, they said.The agency had booked Satish Kumar, a former commandant of the 36 BSF Battalion now posted in Raipur, alleged kingpin Haque and two others, Anarul SK and Mohammed Golam Mustafa, the officials said.It is alleged that the cattle smugglers were bribing BSF and Customs officials to keep their nefarious business running.Haque was earlier arrested in March 2018 by the CBI for allegedly bribing another BSF Commandant, Jibu T Mathew, who was held at the Alappuzha railway station in January 2018 with Rs 47 lakh cash.

This is a problem which has to be dealt with by the Executive. They have the money, the power and the resources for this. We are not abdicating our responsibility or functions but understand this, we have some limitations,” the Bench observed after a petitioner sought to draw the court’s attention to air pollution in Delhi.“The only thing is that you ensure that there is no smog in the city. We are not concerned with commission. There are many commissions and many brains are working, but just ensure that there is no smog in the City,” it said.Mehta said the government was making all efforts on a war footing to deal with the situation.Maintaining that the pollution problem has to be dealt with by the Executive as it has the power, money and resources needed for it, the Bench posted the PILs on air pollution and stubble burning in Delhi-NCR for hearing on December 8.On behalf of petitioner Aditya Dubey, senior advocate Vikas Singh said the chairman of the commission was a bureaucrat and it could have been a retired high court judge. Singh said the situation today is almost of a public health emergency and something drastic needs to be done.As Singh pointed out that there was no member from the Union health ministry despite the fact that pollution was a health issue, the Bench said the Commission was free to talk to anybody in India.To Singh’s submission that there was no classification of offence in the recently promulgated ordinance on air pollution and Rs 1 crore fine and five year jail term appeared arbitrary, the Bench said, “We don’t want to advise. These are all knowledgeable people and there are NGO people also.”According to an Ordinance issued by the Centre, the Commission supersedes all other bodies/ authorities set up through judicial orders or otherwise on air quality management and in case of a conflict between orders of the Commission and those issues by state governments, the Commission’s orders will prevail. It also replaces the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) constituted by the Supreme Court more than two decades ago.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-asks-centre-to-ensure-no-smog-in-delhi-ncr-166924

06-11-2020||New Delhi||Nafed finalises bidders, issues order for supply of 15,000 tonnes of imported onions||Co-operative Nafed on Friday said it has finalised bidders and issued orders for timely supply of 15,000 tonnes of imported onions, which will help boost domestic availability and check price rise.Since the imported onions will be delivered at port cities, state governments have been asked to indent their quantity for faster dispatch of the commodity, it said.Nafed plans to float regular tenders for supply of additional supplies of imported onions, it added."Yesterday (Thursday), Nafed received a good response in the tenders with offers to supply at Tuticorin and Mumbai.  Nafed very swiftly has issued confirmation to successful bidders last evening itself so that timely releases are made in the market," an official statement said.This time, Nafed insisted the quality and size of onion match the choice of Indian consumers who generally prefer medium sized onions whereas in overseas origins the sizes are bigger up to 80 mm, it said.Unlike last year when MMTC had directly imported yellow, pink and red onions from Turkey and Egypt, this year private importers have been offered to supply. This may ensure quality supply in minimal time, it added.Nafed, on the directions of the central government, had floated tenders on October 31 for supply of 15,000 tonnes of imported red onions at port towns loaded on truck and rail from importers.Meanwhile, onion prices are showing steady decline in wholesale and retail, Nafed said.Arrivals from old stock of rabi (winter) season and new arrivals from kharif (summer) from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and other states have arrested the rising trend of onion prices.Nafed has also opened the farm gate purchase centres in Maharashtra and Rajasthan to move the stock to consumption centres."It is hoped that with policy interventions of the government and augmented supply from buffer, import and fresh arrival, the onion market will soon normalise," it added.As per trade data, retail onion prices continue to rule in the range of Rs 80-100 per kg in some parts of the country.

06-11-2020|| Hyderabad||Hundreds test positive for coronavirus days after AP schools re-open||Within two days of Andhra Pradesh allowing schools to reopen, the state is faced with a crisis situation after 575 students and 829 teachers tested positive for COVID-19.The authorities are now in a fix as they were hoping to be more liberal with opening of schools if the test results came out positive. Only recently at the beginning of the month the schools had opened for Classes 9 and 10.The state government started testing students from the first day of the classes on Monday, but the reports received by Thursday threw up large number of COVID-19 positive among the students and teachers across all 13 districts of the state. Official are now saying that those who tested positive had come to schools with infection rather than picking up the virus in school. Education Minister Adimupalu Suresh said: “A task force has been set up. The standard operating procedures are strictly being followed. It is very unlikely that the teachers and the students can contract the virus while at school and have likely contracted the infection before reopening of the schools”. Officials said 70,790 teachers and 95,763 children have been tested for coronavirus in the state so far. Although the number of teachers and students who tested positive for virus comprise of less than one per cent of the total number of teachers and students, the results have caused huge concerns among the state officials, who were considering opening schools for more classes.  Commissioner of School Education V Chinna Veerabhadrudu said that teachers were tested before the opening of the schools, but they were allowed to attend school while awaiting the test results. “There are certain messages going around in WhatsApp stating that there is an increase of coronavirus cases after the schools reopened. Those messages were referred to the District Educational Officers concerned, who, after verifying, found that they are not genuine,” he said.Official sources said that 99.92 per cent of the high schools have resumed for Classes 9 and 10 in a phased manner where students attended classes every other day.Veerabhadrudu said: “On the whole, schools are running in a safe environment and with all due precautions. The entire machinery of School Education Medical & Health departments in the district is vigilant. There is an encouraging and positive response among the students and teachers for continuing the teaching-learning activity in the schools”.   “We are also monitoring the situation in every district very closely along with respective District Collectors. Wherever positive cases are detected the concerned teacher or student is advised not to attend the school and to immediately report to the district administration and take treatment as per the COVID-19 protocols,” Rajsekhar Budithi, Principal Secretary of School Education Department has said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hundreds-test-positive-for-coronavirus-days-after-ap-schools-re-open-166897
06-11-2020||---||Situation at LAC tense; war with China can’t be ruled out: CDS Gen Rawat||New Delhi, November 6Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Friday, while referring to the ongoing border tensions with China, has said there is a possibility of matters “spiralling into a larger conflict”.India, he said, would not accept any shifting of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).General Rawat was addressing a webinar to the National Defence College (NDC) as part of its diamond jubilee celebrations.During the webinar, he said: “Our posturing is unambiguous. We will not accept any shifting of the LAC. In the overall security calculus, border confrontations, transgressions, unprovoked tactical military actions spiralling into a larger conflict therefore cannot be discounted.”The NDC is an entity under the Ministry of Defence.While General Rawat was speaking, the eighth round of senior military commander talks between India and China were underway in Chushul in Ladakh to resolve the ongoing standoff.Also read: India-China military talks to resolve border dispute beginTalking of the situation in Eastern Ladakh, Gen Rawat said the situation remained tense and Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was facing “unanticipated consequences of its misadventure” in Ladakh because of the strong response of the Indian side.India was facing myriad external security challenges, Gen Rawat said.“Constant friction with two nuclear-armed neighbours, who are increasingly acting in collusion, poses an omnipresent danger of regional strategic instability with potential for escalation, threatening our national integrity and strategic cohesion,” he added.The CDS said the “unabated proxy war” unleashed by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir accompanied by a “vicious” anti-India rhetoric on social media and efforts to create social disharmony within India have taken Indo-Pak relations to a new low.“The surgical strikes post Uri terror attack and the Balakot airstrikes have delivered a strong message to Pakistan that it no longer enjoys the impunity of pushing terrorists across the Line of Control under the nuclear bogey,” he said.“The new Indian template has injected ambiguity and uncertainty in Pakistan, evident in its media reports, about Indian Armed Forces reaction, if Pakistan-sponsored terrorists cross the threshold of tolerance,” Gen Rawat added.The CDS said despite internal problems, failing economy, international isolation and vitiated civil-military relations, Pakistan would continue to “profess” that Kashmir was their “unfinished agenda”.“And its Army would continue to raise the bogey of an existential threat from India to justify its disproportionately large strength and need for funds to maintain its warfighting capabilities,” he said.Gen Rawat said Pakistan had continued to remain the epicentre of armed Islamist insurgency and terrorism.“For three decades now, the Pakistan Army and the ISI, known as the ‘Deep State’, have been waging a proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir and are now increasingly resorting to non-kinetic means by launching vicious anti-India rhetoric on social media and propagating false communal narratives to create social disharmony within India,” he said.Gen Rawat also listed various initiatives to reform the Indian defence forces through a variety of measures, including the ongoing work on setting up of theatre commands, reforming the procurement process to ensure optimal management of the allotted budget, initiatives to ensure jointness among three forces in training and logistics.“We are moving towards a Peninsular/Maritime Theatre Command, an Air Defence Theatre Command and three land-centric Integrated Theatre Commands for our Northern and Western borders. We are presently in advance stages of firming up the contours of the structures and transformation,” he said.Referring to evolving geo-political situation, the CDS said China, with its ambition of emerging as a global power, is already making inroads into South Asia, Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and especially East Africa through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).“Chinese aspirations are evident in the ever-expanding Chinese military maritime footprints in the Indo Pacific, huge investments in the IOR littorals, and entering into strategic partnerships with a number of countries in the region like South Africa, Egypt, Pakistan and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN),” he said.Gen Rawat said the economic slowdown due to the coronavirus pandemic had made China repressive at home but aggressive abroad as was evident through its posturing in the South China Sea, the East China Sea and the Taiwan Straits.“For India, the challenges have manifested with military flare-ups along the LAC. In the coming years, we are likely to witness the aggressive pursuit of hegemonic interests by China manifesting through economic exploitation of weaker nations,” the CDS said.About internal challenges, he said the ‘Left Wing Extremism’ and growing ‘urban terrorism’ had also contributed towards vitiating India’s security environment. With warfare ranging from conventional to hybrid, he observed that the overall security dynamics were replete with strategic unpredictability.“This gets further compounded by the phenomenal economic and military rise of China and the unique hybrid capabilities of Pakistan and machinations of its Deep State. Equally important is the need to reflect the context in which all these activities are taking place as it affects national interests, undermining our values and ethos, that we mandated to protect,” he said.The CDS observed that the present environment and the future trends indicated a host of challenges India must overcome “to compete, deter, and if necessary, to fight and win tomorrow’s wars”.“In addition to conventional war, the challenges in the hybrid and sub-conventional domain are more immediate and of profound concern, calling for an integrated response for which the Armed Forces will require to be duly empowered through technology absorption duly fused with appropriate and right-sized organisations,” he said.Gen Rawat said the future civil-military integration would hold the key to a ‘whole of nations’ approach towards national security.“In the wake of contracting envelope of the defence budget we must look at creating dual-use infrastructure through civil-military fusion,” he said.He said the emergence of a hyper-connected and super-collaborative world spawning innovation in artificial intelligence, cognitive sciences, robotics, drones, bio-weapons, directed energy weapons, quantum computing, nanotechnology and cyber capabilities would revolutionise warfare in the years to come.“These disruptive technologies are having a foundational impact on how wars will be fought. China has been focussing on military transformation and force structuring that blend with the development of disruptive technologies,” he said.He said it had raised a ‘Strategic Support Force; that is acquiring capabilities in space, cyber and electronic warfare domain to conduct an “intelligentised” form of warfare.Addressing same the webinar, Indian Air Force (IAF) Chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said proactive action and a strong posture dissuaded China from making any further attempts to alter the status quo in Ladakh.The border standoff has entered the seventh month.The standoff has been ongoing since early May at several spots along the 826-km LAC in Eastern Ladakh. Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have been held since, in which India has maintained complete disengagement and de-escalation along the LAC and pull back.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated following at least three attempts by the Chinese soldiers to “intimidate” Indian troops along the northern and southern bank of Pangong lake area between August 29 and September 8 where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years.Both sides had agreed to stop sending more troops to the frontline and refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground. Both sides have made preparations to maintain thousands of troops and equipment in extreme conditions in the high-altitude winter.Meanwhile, the meeting of senior military commanders commenced at 9:30 am on the Indian side at Chushul, Eastern Ladakh.This is the first round of talks with the Indian side led by Lt Gen PGK Menon, who took over as the 14 Corps Commander on October 13. Lt Gen Menon has attended the last two rounds of talks. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/situation-at-lac-tense-war-with-china-cant-be-ruled-out-cds-gen-rawat-166893

For the first time, Lieutenant General PGK Menon will be leading the Indian military delegates during the talks.Earlier, he attended two such talks but the delegation was led by then Lieutenant General Harinder Singh who was transferred last month to the Indian Military Academy (IMA) where he would be in charge of training the future generations of Army officers.Also read: Situation along LAC remains tense: Chief of Defence StaffJoint Secretary from the Ministry of External Affairs Navin Srivastava will also be part of the delegation."We have firmly stated to China that disengagement will happen at all friction points and not at the selected locations as they want. Our stand is clear," said a top government source.In a clear message to China, just ahead of talks to resolve border issue, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday that India is facing challenges on its borders and would defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity."India is a peace-loving country and that peace can only be ensured through the ability to deter war," Singh said while speaking at a webinar celebrating the Diamond Jubilee to mark 60 years of the National Defence College in Delhi.The minister said: "We believe that differences should not become disputes. We attach importance to the peaceful resolution of differences through dialogue. India is determined to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of unilateralism and aggression, no matter what the sacrifice."Earlier talks have ended in deadlock with no sign of de-escalation of force at the Line of Actual Control.Both countries’ military top commanders met seven times in a bid to resolve the standoff.

06-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘very poor’, may improve slightly||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the “very poor” category on Friday morning while government agencies said it was likely to improve slightly in the next 24 hours.On Thursday, the city’s air quality had dropped to the worst levels since November last year, with farm fires accounting for 42 per cent of its pollution, the maximum this season so far.Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions - calm winds and low temperatures - and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states pushed the air quality index to the “severe” zone on Thursday, the first time since January.Also read: SC asks Centre to ensure no smog in Delhi-NCRHowever, higher wind speed picked up later, helping in dispersion of pollutants.Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) stood at 397 at 10 am. On Thursday, the 24-hour average AQI was 450, the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 458.The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurugram and Noida also recorded “very poor” to “severe” air quality.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 415 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 10 am, down from 563 at 10 am on Thursday — the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 637 µg/m3, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 - finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream - were reduced to 229 µg/m3 at 10 am from 360 µg/m3 at 12 noon on Thursday. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum wind speed was 12 kilometres per hour on Friday and the minimum temperature of 11.2 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.VK Soni, head, IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said the air quality was likely to improve slightly but would remain in the “very poor” category for the next two days.The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the farm fire count in Punjab remained “very high” on Thursday and it was likely to impact the air quality of Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the farm fire count in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas increased significantly and stood at 4,135 on Wednesday, the highest this season so far.SAFAR said the boundary layer wind direction was northwesterly - favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires.“The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 42 per cent for Thursday,” it said.Stubble burning accounted for 5 per cent of Delhi’s pollution on Wednesday, 10 per cent on Tuesday, 16 on Monday and 40 on Sunday.Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.Health experts said during the COVID-19 pandemic, air pollution had become a serious health concern for about the two crore residents of the national capital.According to a doctor at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, intake of every 22 micrograms per cubic metre of polluted air is equivalent to smoking a cigarette.Ajit Jain, nodal officer for COVID-19 at Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said air pollution was turning the pandemic catastrophic.With Delhi witnessing a spike in the number of new COVID-19 cases amid worsening pollution levels, the Delhi government on Thursday announced a blanket ban on firecrackers from November 7 to November 30.The CPCB task force on the Graded Response Action Plan has also suggested government and private offices and other establishments to reduce vehicle usage by at least 30 per cent to control pollution.Implementing agencies have been asked to step up their efforts, be more vigilant, and ensure quick action, including on redressal of complaints on SAMEER application and other social media platforms to curb polluting activities.

The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) today asked Pakistan “to reverse its arbitrary decision depriving the Sikh minority community of its right to manage affairs of Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara”.Pak rejects objectionRejecting the Indian objection, the Pakistan Foreign Office said the gurdwara remained under the control of PSGPC, which was responsible for carrying out rituals as per the Sikh “rehat maryada”. It said the Project Management Unit under the Evacuee Trust Property Board had been created only to facilitate the PSGPC in this regard.“This unilateral decision by Pakistan is highly condemnable and runs against the spirit of the Kartarpur Sahib corridor as also religious sentiments of the Sikh community at large,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa led a delegation to meet joint secretary of the Pakistan Desk this afternoon. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reverse-decision-on-kartarpur-sahib-mea-166589

Meanwhile, Shah had lunch at the house of tribal BJP worker Bibhishan Hansda in Chaturdihi village in Bankura district. It was a vegetarian platter of Bengali delicacies.“Those who are in the grip of extreme poverty are not benefitting from the central schemes meant to help them in their livelihood needs,” Shah said.Noting that Bankura was having substantial tribal population, Shah said they were entitled to benefit from the housing scheme for tribes unveiled by the central government. But, the funds were not reaching them because of the state government, he alleged.Shah said similarly farmers were being deprived of the Rs 6000 annually given to them by the Centre under a scheme. The Mamata government has also prevented the central government from bringing Bengal under the ambit of the Rs five lakh health insurance coverage meant for poor, he said.He claimed that since his arrival in Kolkata last evening, he noticed that the public was hugely angry with CM Mamata Banerjee.

06-11-2020||---||India determined to protect its territorial integrity: Rajnath||New Delhi, November 5 Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said peace could not be necessarily be achieved by a desire for peace, but by the ability to deter a war.  He was speaking at the diamond jubilee celebrations of the National Defence College (NDC) before a two-day webinar on “India’s National Security-a Decade Ahead”. Expanding his thoughts, Rajnath Singh said, “The mere desire to seek peace, if not reciprocated by others, does not necessarily succeed in building a harmonious environment in a world beset by conflicting ideas of security, sovereignty and national interests.” He outlined four broad principles that are likely to guide India’s quest for national security in the future. The first is the ability to secure India’s territorial integrity and sovereignty from external threats and internal challenges. Second, he said, was the ability to create secure and stable conditions that could facilitate India’s economic growth, thereby, creating resources for nation building and to meet individual aspirations. “Third, remain steadfast in the desire to protect our interests beyond the borders in areas where our people reside and our security interests converge. Lastly, a globalised and interconnected world, the country’s security interests are interlinked by shared commons,” he added. India has proved that countries that employ terrorism as an instrument of national policy can also be deterred through options that were considered un-implementable in the past. “Pakistan continues to remain adamant in the use of terrorism as state policy,” he said, adding that India has achieved substantial success in working with progressive and like-minded countries to not only expose Pakistan’s regressive policies, but also make it increasingly difficult to continue with its previous business as usual approach. “Our strategic partnership with the US is stronger than ever before,” Rajnath Singh said, adding that India’s friendship has also grown tremendously with Japan, Australia and Russia. India has also forged a very special partnership with reliable friends like France and Israel, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-determined-to-protect-its-territorial-integrity-rajnath-166558

Bihar must also move on now,” Congress poll coordinator for Bihar Randeep Surjewala said on the eve of voting to 19 north Bihar districts.Rahul for his part pledged to build a new Bihar.“Get ready; Now the grand alliance government will create jobs for you; it will waive off farm loans and cut your power bills by half; it will ensure free education for girls and pave the way for the growth of every individual; it will bring industry to new Bihar,” Rahul promised as a fiercely contested election drew to a close.The Congress also went out full throttle against the BJP today as the campaign culminated with Surjewala questioning the role of Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM in Bihar poll.Raking up Mayawati’s recent promise of support for the BJP in order to see the SP defeated in Uttar Pradesh MLC elections, Surjewala asked, “The AIMIM is contesting in Bihar in alliance with the BSP.

The participating ministers were from Finland, Iceland, Demark, Latvia and Estonia. Some of them, such as Estonia, are at odds with Russia, a close Indian ally, but all are acknowledged leaders in high-end manufacturing and innovation.  All ministers offered cooperation in fields their countries excelled in, but SAAB Chairman Marcus Wallenberg injected a note of realism by asking for a EU-India FTA as soon as possible to deepen trade linkages with the Nordic-Baltic region. Jaishankar set out the areas where there is potential for more partnership such as renewable energy and clean technologies, factories of the future, AI and block chain-led transformation, supply chain and logistics and fin-tech. With a greater digital focus, India will also give more attention to its infrastructure as well as data and cyber security.
