16-05-2020||New Delhi||Govt speeding up industrial reforms; private sector to enhance operational efficiency: Experts||The government was fast-tracking industrial reforms and increased role of the private sector in coal, minerals, defence, power, aviation and space sectors was aimed at overall efficiency enhancement, experts said.EY India Chief Policy Adviser D K Srivastava said the fourth instalment of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement contained a stimulus of Rs 63,100 crore, of which the direct budgetary cost was only Rs 8,100 crore relating to enhanced viability gap funding to support augmenting social infrastructure.“In this tranche, the focus was more on industrial reforms rather than providing stimulus. The government seems to be relying on this crisis to fast-track industrial reforms which might otherwise face resistance. The enhanced role of the private sector in coal, minerals, defence, energy, aviation and space sectors is an element of medium-term efficiency-improving reforms. Once again, it is the supply side which has received emphasis while demand initiatives are still awaited,” he said.In the fourth tranche of the Rs 20 lakh crore economic package, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Saturday, announced bold reforms aimed at boosting the sagging economy by easing foreign investment limit in defence manufacturing, privatisation of six more airports, opening up of more air space and allowing private sector in commercial coal mining.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also announced allowing commercial mining of coal by the private sector, ending government monopoly in the sector. She said commercial mining would be done on revenue sharing mechanism which would help more coal availability at market prices.Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, Partner Arvind Sharma said the government recently permitted 100 per cent FDI in commercial coal mining and, pursuant to the recent announcement, the auction process for commercial coal mining is to be kickstarted.“This is a good measure and should ensure better availability of coal. We will also see a lot of foreign investment in this sector as global players will also participate in these auctions. Since the auction seems to be based on revenue share and not a fixed price model, we should see better participation,” he said.Deloitte India Partner Leader (Energy, Resources and Industrial Products) Debasish Mishra said the government has announced some good reform measures in the mining sector today.Single licensing policy, removal of captive non-captive distinction, revenue-sharing model and stamp duty rationalisation had been the demand of the industry for a long time, Mishra said.EY India Partner and National Leader (Metals & Mining) Saurabh Bhatnagar said the introduction of competition, transparency and private sector participation in the coal Sector would automatically build transparency of mine valuations, force rigorous mine planning and compliance, invite investments for enhancing operational efficiency to justify the bids made at the time of mine acquisition.“Elimination of distinction between captive mines and non-captive will ensure a level playing field for players in the integrated metals space. All firms will now compete through measures of efficiency and deploying best practices for running a mining business. These were much-needed reforms in the mining sector as India is a mineral-rich country and any sectoral reforms to attract investment which adds to India's GDP through this sector and save precious foreign exchange are welcome,” Bhatnagar added.KPMG in India Partner and National Head, Energy and Natural Resources Anish De said on power, the past two decades of tepid results despite corporatisation and regulation had clearly indicated that the state-owned enterprises have been unable to deliver the efficiency, customer service and governance standards required from a modern power sector.“In times of disruption like the present COVID-19 pandemic, it ends up posing a huge additional burden on the beleaguered state exchequers. Private ownership should bring in greater efficiency and better governance and help address some of the deep-seated problems of the sector. The Union Territories are a good place to start, though it should be propagated further into the state-owned discoms,” De added.PwC India Leader (Power and Utilities) Sambitosh Mohapatra privatisation of power distribution in Union Territories will assist in generating private sector appetite amongst Indian and international investors.Grant Thornton India CEO Vishesh C Chandiok said the increase in FDI in defence from 49 per cent to 74 per cent under automatic route and private sector participation in coal mining were path-breaking reforms, which have the potential to act as a multiplier for several sectors.

16-05-2020||New Delhi||Rahul Gandhi interacts with home-bound migrant workers amid lockdown||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday interacted with a group of migrant labourers near the Sukhdev Vihar flyover here and asked them about their problems as they walked home amid the coronavirus-induced lockdown.Gandhi sat on the pavement and gave the migrant workers a patient hearing and assured them of help in reaching their homes, Congress leaders claimed.Dressed in black pants and white kurta, he talked to the workers and heard their grievances.Sources close to Gandhi said he had an impromptu hour-long meeting with a group of 20 migrants, including women and children, walking from their work site near Ambala to their village near Jhansi. The meeting took place as they sat on the footpath on Mathura road in the national capital.Mahesh Kumar, a migrant worker from Madhya Pradesh who along with 14 of his family members was sitting at the footpath, narrated his tale of woe to the former Congress chief.“It was nice talking to him. At least someone heard us and our problems,” he told reporters later.The Congress claimed that the police detained some of the labourers later in preventive custody, saying they have “directions from the top to do so”.There was no immediate reaction from the police to the Congress party’s charge.Sources close to Rahul Gandhi said while adhering strictly to the law, at the request of Gandhi, volunteers from the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee have stepped up to help the group get back to their village.Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra later tweeted thanking Rahul Gandhi and saying that someone has to talk to these migrant labourers and hear their ordeal.“These are our own people. We will have to sit and talk with them. Their suffering has to be shared. They are nation builders. We cannot leave them alone in this time of crisis. Thank you my leader Rahul Gandhi,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.Asked at a Congress media briefing about Rahul’s meeting and the police allegedly detaining the workers, Congress spokesperson Gaurav Vallabh said eight crore migrants were interested in returning to their homes and Gandhi was only trying to meet them and hear their grievances.“They cannot even meet Rahul Gandhi. What is the reason of their detention. They should not even tell Rahul Gandhi that the government has done nothing for them so far,” he told reporters.A Delhi Congress leader said that Gandhi was passing from Sukhdev Vihar when he spotted the migrant workers stopped by the police. He intervened and talked to the migrant workers and assured them help.Later, several Congress workers led by Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary reached there and arranged help for the migrant workers.Chaudhary said that around 15-20 migrants, including women, children and elderly, were walking from Haryana to their native place in Jhansi, when they were stopped by the police near Modi Mill flyover.He said that Delhi Congress arranged 8-10 vehicles to carry the migrant workers following the social distancing norms.The Congress has been highlighting the problem of migrant labourers and workers walking on the roads without food and water. It has been demanding direct cash transfer to them along with free ration and has asked the government to ensure their safe transport back to their homes.Migrant labourers in large numbers have been seen walking down the roads in the absence of public transport amid the lockdown in their bid to return to their native villages. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-interacts-with-home-bound-migrant-workers-amid-lockdown-85670
16-05-2020||New Delhi||Centre launches online dashboard for monitoring movement of migrant workers||The central government has launched an online dashboard to monitor and facilitate the smooth movement of migrant workers and their contact-tracing during lockdown across the country.In a communication to all states and union territories, Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said the central government has already allowed the movement of migrant workers by buses and Shramik Special trains to enable them to travel to their native places.He said to capture the information regarding movement of migrants and facilitate the smooth movement of stranded persons across the states, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has developed an online dashboard namely, National Migrant Information System (NMIS), on the existing NDMA-GIS portal.Bhalla said the portal will maintain a central repository and help the sending as well as receiving state and district to ask for and give their acceptance in an online format seamlessly.“This system will help in speedy communication between states without creating additional work at the level of the field officers.“It has additional advantages like contact tracing, which may be useful in overall COVID response work,” he said.The states can upload batch file of individual data on the portal. As many states have already collected migrant data, this can be integrated through Application Programming Interface (API).The key data pertaining to the persons migrating has been standardised for uploading such as name, age, mobile no, originating and destination district, date of travel etc which states are already collecting.The letter said the states will be able to visualise how many people are going out from where and how many are reaching destination states.The mobile numbers of people can be used for contact tracing and movement monitoring during COVID- 19.A unique ID is generated for each migrant, which can be used for all transactions.  The government of India nodal ministries can also monitor the movement of migrants though this portal.“I urge upon you to use the online portal NMIS for capturing the information on movement of migrants and for better inter-state co-ordination,” Bhalla said.Movement of migrant workers during lockdown has become a humanitarian crisis with thousands of them were seen walking on roads and railways tracks ignoring government pleas to stay back at the place where they are.At least 16 such people were mowed down by a goods train in Maharashtra while at least 25 others were killed in road accidents in different parts of the country.

16-05-2020||London||UK's 100-yr-old COVID-19 fundraising war veteran dreams of revisiting India||A 100-year-old Army veteran Captain Tom Moore, who served in India during the World War II and became an Internet sensation with his coronavirus fundraising drive to raise millions by doing laps around his garden, says revisiting India is among his few post-lockdown wishes.In an interview with ‘The Times’, the military man who served as an engineer during the war in India expressed a wish to be able to travel once again after the coronavirus travel restrictions are eased.“I would like to go back to India again and Barbados I think, and maybe the Continent,” said Moore, who celebrated his 100th birthday last month.“Being realistic I don't think I will get to all the places. But I would love to travel on Route 66 in America,” he said.Conscripted to the 8th Battalion of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment in 1940, Moore served in India and Burma and then instructed at the Armoured Fighting Vehicle School. After the war, he became a managing director of a concrete company.He has successfully raised almost 33 million pounds for NHS Charities Together and was promoted to Honorary Colonel of the Army Foundation College, awarded Freedom of the City of London and became the oldest person ever to achieve a UK No. 1 single.“I never anticipated I would ever be a celebrity, I didn't really understand what they were,” he told the newspaper in a virtual interview over Zoom.“I don't really understand how it all happened, except I'm seen as being a hopeful person and it's true I've never despaired, even in wartime, I've always known that things would get better. Just like now, we are going through a dark patch but things will improve,” he said.Moore received a whopping 150,000 birthday cards on April 30 as well as a Royal Air Force fly-past and is a sought-after personality after he completed his mission of 100 laps around his garden to mark his centenary year and help the National Health Service (NHS) frontline professionals fighting the deadly virus.“The fly-past was wonderful. They were flying past in peace, not anger and it was in my benefit, I couldn't believe it,” said Moore.“I also loved my card from the Queen. She is a marvellous person. I remember when she and I were in the Army together, and although she was quite a lot younger than me she was in the same uniform. That felt very uniting,” he said.The war veteran refuses to slow down and is now fundraising for a new set of charities. He has set up a foundation and a website called captaintom.org to raise money to combat issues such as loneliness and help fund more hospices. He also has his own Twitter account and a publishing contract to write two books.

16-05-2020||New Delhi||Military experts welcome reform measures in defence sector||Military experts, on Saturday, welcomed the reform measures rolled out by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to promote the domestic defence industry, saying their proper implementation will help India significantly cut its ballooning import bill on weapons and military platforms.At a press conference, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a series of initiatives to promote indigenous defence production which included making separate budgetary outlay to procure Indian-made military hardware, increasing FDI limit from 49 per cent to 74 per cent under the automatic route and generating a year-wise negative list of weapons whose import won’t be allowed.Experts said increasing the existing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) cap to 74 per cent would encourage global players such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Airbus and Dassault Aviation to set up manufacturing hubs in India and bring niche technology without hesitation as the firms will have majority stakes in their Indian subsidiaries.India is one of the most lucrative markets for global defence giants as it figured among top three importers of military hardware in the world for the last eight years. According to estimates, the Indian armed forces are projected to spend around $130 billion in capital procurement in the next five years.“Nobody is going to give us critical technology unless we provide them facilities to produce for the global market,” former Army Chief Gen (retd) N C Vij said while welcoming the government’s reform initiatives in the defence sector.He said India must aim to become self-reliant in defence manufacturing as it would be difficult for the country to keep allocating scarce resources to import expensive weapons and platforms to confront complex security challenges along the northern and western borders.“The kind of money we require to beat the security challenges is so much. We cannot afford to make that kind of an allocation year-after-year. There is a need for us be self-reliant in defence production, particularly when our economy was hit hard following the COVID-19,” he said.Lt Gen (retd) Subrata Saha, former Deputy Chief of Army Staff, identified the proposed ban on imports of certain weapons and platforms as the most significant announcement by Sitharaman.“In the process, the government is giving fixed timelines for indigenous production of specific weapons and platforms. It will make sure that there is accountability,” he said.Former Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal (retd) Fali Major praised the government’s announcement on corporatisation of the Ordnance Factory Board, the nearly 200-year-old organisation that operates 41 ammunition production facilities across the country.“I welcome the reform initiatives. Raising of the FDI limit will give major impetus to defence production in India,” he said.Lt Gen Saha also lauded the announcement by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman that separate allocation in the budget would be made to procure India-made military hardware besides the proposed setting up of project management teams to oversee implementation of specific programmes.Another defence expert, Lt Gen S L Narasimhan said the reform measures were in the offing for quite some time and that they would give a major push to the Make in India initiative in the defence sector.Gen Vij felt Finance Minister’s announcement would help India realise its goal of achieving defence exports worth $5 billion in next five years.“The reform measures are very timely and they will significantly boost our defence industry,” the former Army Chief said.In February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a target of $5 billion worth of military exports in the next five years and invited global defence majors to set up manufacturing hubs in the country.In her announcement, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also said the process for the General Staff Qualitative Requirements (GSQRs) would be made realistic. In the GSQRs, the armed forces define criteria to procure platforms and hardware.India was among the world's three top importers of military hardware.According to a latest report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a leading think-tank on military spending, India’s defence expenditure stood at USD 71.1 billion in 2019, which is the third highest after the US and China.In 2017, the government came up with an ambitious policy under which select private firms were to be roped in to build key military platforms like submarines and fighter jets in India in partnership with global defence majors.

Our responses must deal with the present, but the footprints of the pandemic will redefine how we function tomorrow in ways which may not readily apparent today,” Justice Chandrachud said.The e-filing module being implemented represented the collaborative efforts between the Bar, the Bench and the Registry, he said.Noting that many of the lawyers didn't have access to technology, Justice Chandrachud said the solutions proposed must take this into account. He said the e-committee has initiated setting up ‘e-seva kendras’ at high courts and district courts for this purpose as it aimed to achieve efficiency, transparency and access to every user of justice service.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-e-filing-is-first-step-towards-effective-e-court-system-cji-85661
16-05-2020||New Delhi||Find novel ways for revival of economy, not failed ideas, says RSS affiliate BMS||In its most scathing and direct attack against the Narendra Modi government, RSS affiliate Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh on Saturday advised it to find “novel ways” to revive the economy and not depend on  “failed ideas”, Criticising the announcements made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, ruling BJP’s sister organisation in the Sangh parivaar also accused the government of “taking advantage of the crisis period” to push the agenda of corporatisation and privatisation. Objecting to privatisation of space, ISRO and space exploration, it warned of "serious consequences to the security" of the country.  "We depend on space for many security and surveillance measures that are dangerous to be privatised. Indian start-ups are not so much equipped to take up space challenges,” he said.  "Even atomic energy is being converted to PPP mode which is a major step towards privatisation. Corporatisation and PPP are the routes for privatisation, and privatisation the route for foreignisation," the BMS said.BMS president Saji Narayanan said they will call a meeting of the national office bearers and federations to decide the future course of action, terming the announcements by the Finance Minister on the fourth day as a “sad day for the nation and its people”The government should call the BMS for consultations, he said. “Social dialogue is fundamental to democracy. The government becoming shy of consultation and dialogue with trade unions, social representatives and stakeholders shows lack of confidence in their own ideas and is highly condemnable,” said BMS General Secretary Virjesh Upadhyay.He said the government’s decision to turn to privatisation showed its "dearth of ideas on economic revival in times of crisis", he added. “The impact of every change first falls adversely on employees. For employees, privatisation means massive job loss, below quality jobs will be generated, profitisation and exploitation will be the rule in the sector. Now the Government machinery, Finance Ministry will involve mainly working on privatisation and in communicating with corporate and will not find time to give attention to the social sectors like labour, agriculture and MSMEs for which the FM has  allotted attention for the last three days,” said  Upadhyay.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/find-novel-ways-for-revival-of-economy-not-failed-ideas-says-rss-affiliate-bms-85660
16-05-2020||---||Experts question timing of agricultural reforms||New Delhi, May 16The Central Government’s intention to change laws relating to essential commodities and selling of agriculture produce has been questioned for its timing by economic experts.Though several economists, led by Ashok Gulati, have appreciated Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government for biting the bullet and have hailed the decision to dilute the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees Act (APMC), others are not so sure.Besides questioning the need for making futuristic policy announcements when the need of the hour is cash transfer to farmers and a bonus on their rabi crop, experts are apprehensive about the contours of an alternate structure that will be thrust without consultations with farmer and traders.Bihar abolished the APMC Act over a decade ago.Logically, farmers should be discovering new price highs in the absence of a system cited by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as exploitative and monopolistic.“But why is it that in this season wheat production in Haryana is subdued. Or more rice comes to Haryana mills than is produced in the state?” asks noted agriculture expert Devinder Sharma, before answering the question that it was because MSP prices in Haryana and Punjab was higher.Devinder Sharma felt that the pandemic should not have been the time to push for such far-reaching reforms that require extensive consultations.Academic and agriculture economist Sudheer Panwar refers to two schools of thought for resuscitating the farm sector.The first is to take out the farm labour and redeploy it in the industrial and services sector. But the Central Government has opted for the second option of improving storage, processing and production.Panwar points out that the move to dilute the APMC Act and abolish the Essential Commodities Act points to increasing footprints of the corporate sector.While Sharma points out that a similar move has put the US agriculture into crises, Panwar says a similar experiment in the Philippines also showed that the producer would always remain under pressure.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-question-timing-of-agricultural-reforms-85658
16-05-2020||Ajay Banerjee||India opens up defence manufacturing; foreign firms can hold 74 pc stake||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 16Ending years of debate on the matter, the government on Saturday, in a path-breaking move, allowed foreign military equipment makers to invest up to 74 per cent stake, up from the existing 49 per cent, in projects in India.The move comes, as the existing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) limits for defence manufacturing sector meant it was literally a non-starter. India attracted only a measly $ 8.8 Million (Rs 66 crore) in FDI in the defence manufacturing sector in the past 19 years – that is from April 2000 to end of 2019. The figures were tabled in Lok Sabha on March 4 this year.Otherwise, annual cumulative FDI inflow into India was some $ 62 billion for the fiscal ending March 31, 2019, which had raised demands for hiking the FDI limits in defence manufacturing.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman (who was Defence Minister from September 3, 2017, to May 31, 2019), announced the change that could encourage global biggies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus, Saab, to invest in India. This will also be a boon for warship making industry, UAVs, Artificial intelligence, helicopters, military vehicles, aerospace ventures making sub-assemblies and part of aviation systems.“FDI limit in the defence manufacturing under automatic route will be raised from 49% to 74%,” Sitharaman announced.Also read Military experts welcome reform measures in defence sectorEarlier, in August 2014, within three months of coming to power, the Narendra Modi government had raised the FDI cap in the sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent.Foreign equipment makers have said it openly at various forums that they would invest only once ‘controlling stake’ in a venture is assured, 49 per cent stake did not allow that.Sitharaman also said a list of weapons and platforms will be drafted on which there will be a ban on the import, bans will be year-wise progressive timelines.Indigenisation of imported spares is another issue that the Minister addressed. The problem is largely from Russian-origin spares.Separate budget provisioning will be made for domestic capital procurement – weapons and equipment, this will help reduce the import bill.The Ordnance Factory Board, which 41 factories under the MoD will be corporatised.A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be set up to support contract management, besides the realistic setting of General Staff Qualitative Requirements (GSQRs) of weapons/platforms. GSQR’s are the parameters for choosing a weapon or platform.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-opens-up-defence-manufacturing-foreign-firms-can-hold-74-pc-stake-85649
16-05-2020||New Delhi||Courting death and injury, scores of migrants killed in accidents on way home||Hit-and-runs, collisions and even a train speeding down the tracks have killed scores of migrants since the lockdown began and injured many more making a perilous journey home along roads that are empty, winding and seemingly endless.As vehicles careen down deserted roads and lakhs of migrants are on the move — packed into trucks and tempos, riding rickety cycles or just walking towards their villages, hundreds, maybe thousands, of kilometres away — the death count from accidents rises inexorably with each day of the lockdown.The SaveLife Foundation, a non-profit organisation working towards curbing road accidents in the country, has recorded nearly 2,000 road crashes and 368 deaths from March 25 when the lockdown began to May 16 (11 am).Of these, 139 deaths wee of migrants travelling back home, 27 of essential workers and 202 of others, it said.“Of the total 368 deaths reported, over 100 were recorded from Uttar Pradesh alone. The top five states in this tally include Madhya Pradesh (30), Telangana (22), Maharashtra (19) and Punjab (17). The most common factor for these road crashes was speeding,” SaveLife Foundation CEO Piyush Tewari said.As the numbers spiralled, slowly, steadily and then in what appeared to be a torrent, a pattern emerged. Many of the tragedies occurred in the dark, which is when it is cooler to walk, and many people were caught in their sleep.That’s what happened on Saturday, too, when a trailer rammed into a stationary truck in the pre-dawn darkness around 3.30 am on a highway near Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh, killing at least 24 people and injuring 36. The vehicles, one headed from Delhi to Madhya Pradesh and the other to Rajasthan, were ferrying labourers to their homes.Some of the workers had stopped for tea and others were possibly sleeping by the roadside or in the vehicles when the crash occurred.Most of those killed were from Jharkhand and West Bengal, and some from Kushinagar in eastern Uttar Pradesh, officials said as reports suggested that some of the victims may have been crushed under cement bags loaded in one of the vehicles.A few hours later, tragedy unfolded in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, when five migrant workers going from Maharashtra to Uttar Pradesh were killed when a truck carrying them overturned on the Sagar-Kanpur Road.The combination of no traffic and speeding vehicles has led to havoc, endangering the lives of those who found themselves without work or money in the coronavirus-induced lockdown and were frantic to get home, any which way.Over this week alone, there have been multiple accidents reported from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.In Guna, Madhya Pradesh, for instance, as many as 14 migrants were killed and around 60 injured in two different road accidents on Thursday and Friday.On Friday, six migrant workers were killed and 95 injured in separate road accidents across Uttar Pradesh.And the day before, six migrant workers walking from Punjab to Bihar were killed in Muzaffarnagar in the state when they were hit by a roadways bus on the Delhi-Saharanpur Highway, officials said.With no compass to guide them on their treacherous inter-state journey home and perhaps to escape the police, many people also walk along railway tracks.On May 8, it cost 16 lives.In perhaps the most gruesome of accidents, 16 migrant workers going to Madhya Pradesh were mowed down by freight train when they dozed off on the tracks near Aurangabad in Maharashtra.In a chilling reflection of the hunger and deprivation that led the group of 20 men working in a steel unit in Jalna – four of them survived – the ‘rotis’ they had packed to see them through the journey lay scattered on the tracks.The same morning, hundreds of kilometres away, a migrant labourer couple, Krishna Sahu (45) and his wife Pramila (40), were run over by an unidentified vehicle on their way from Lucknow to Chhattisgarh. The couple, on a bicycle, were with their two children, both under five years, who survived the crash.Reduced to statistics as they undertake their own personal odysseys, challenging the odds but not always triumphing them, there was a back story everywhere.Some lockdown induced road accidents were reported as early as March 28 when four migrants were run over by a truck on the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. According to Indian Express, the four, part of a group of seven which wanted to reach their villages in Rajasthan after crossing into Gujarat, had just begun walking after taking some rest when a truck came from behind and rammed into them.Two days later, 40-year-old labourer Sukh Lal Ahirwar died in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh after a car hit him. Ahirwar and his wife had walked for two straight days from Delhi towards their home in Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh and were resting on a road divider when the accident took place, reported the Hindi daily Nayi Duniya.Those who survive have no option but continue the journey.Like the group of 20 labourers who left in a tempo from Mumbai to Lucknow on May 10.The 1,400-km journey had barely begun when the tempo met with an accident, killing their driver.The driver had spoken to the news channel NDTV just hours earlier.“There are lots of problems. We don't have anything to eat. We had rations till now, so we were eating that. Now, we are heading out. We will travel somehow in this,” one of those in the group told the channel.There were also reports of a woman and her six-year-old daughter who were part of a group travelling between Maharashtra and Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh in an autorickshaw.They had travelled almost 1,300 km when the autorickshaw was hit by a truck just short of their destination in Fatehpur.The Railways has organised “Shramik Special” trains and ferried at least 12 lakh migrants to their homes since May 1.“To bring back the workers till date, the Railways has operated 1,034 Shramik Special trains. Out of which 106 were operated yesterday (Friday). Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have taken steps positively and 80 per cent of the total Shramik Special trains have been operated by these two states,” Union Minister Piyush Goyal tweeted on Saturday.But if the thousands of workers and their families still trudging their way home, however they can, is any indication, it might be too little too late.India accounts for one of the highest roads crashes fatalities in the world with an estimated 1.5 lakh people killed in about five lakh accidents a year.

16-05-2020||Mumbai||COVID-19: Maharashtra set to take over private hospitals||The Maharashtra Government has prepared a plan to take over major private hospitals in Mumbai and Pune as public facilities run out of beds for patients suffering from the COVID-19 virus."We are preparing to take over private hospitals as we are expecting a major spike in the number of Covid-19 cases by the end of this month," Health Minister Rajesh Tope said in an online interaction with journalists here on Saturday.According to the minister, the government has asked private hospitals including those run by the corporate sector, to reserve 60 per cent of their beds for COVID-19 patients."The remaining beds should be made available for those suffering from heart ailments accident victims, pregnant women and those requiring dialysis," Tope said.The Maharashtra Government has asked hospitals in Mumbai to stopnon-essential surgeries.Under the plan under consideration by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray,beds kept aside by private hospitals will be allotted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and other civic bodies to patients suffering from COVID-19."Under the proposal, the charges for treatment of the patients will be reimbursed by the government," a health department official said.The private hospitals have been asked to put the services of their medical and non-medical staff at the government's disposal."Most of the hospitals in Mumbai and other cities are formed under charitable trusts on land allotted by the government. Hence under theDisaster Management Act and the Epidemic Act we can take over their operations in emergencies like this," a health department official said.Officials say hospitals in the private sector have around 25,000 beds available.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-maharashtra-set-to-take-over-private-hospitals-85647
16-05-2020||Mathura||Corona an ‘asur’, can only be killed by divine forces, says UP priests’ body; seeks temple reopening||An all-India organisation of priests has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reopen temples and pilgrimage centres to help combat the COVID-19 outbreak, saying COVID-19 is an “asur” (demon) and can only be killed by divine forces.“If all temples, shrines and pilgrimage centres are reopened, COVID-19 cannot do any harm (kuch nahi bigad sakta hay),” Akhil Bhartiya Tirth Purohit Mahasabha national president Mahesh Pathak said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Saturday.He said the closure of temples had also adversely impacted the economic condition of priests and demanded special financial package for them.In his letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Pathak said the religious sites could be reopened with some restrictions under the present circumstances.The government has banned congregations and closed temples and other religious sites, besides schools, colleges, malls and factories, to check the spread of COVID-19, which has infected more than 85,000 people and killed over 2,750 in the country so far.Pathak said India was perhaps facing the “wrath of deities” as they had been treated “at par with factories” during the ongoing lockdown.“COVID-19 is an ‘asur’ (demon) and it can only be killed by divine forces. I am quite sure divinity would rescue devotees from COVID-19 after joint prayers,” he told reporters here.He said the closure of temples and shrines had widened the distance between gods and devotees, and the separation could not be erased through prayers at home.He said though the portals of ‘Char Dham’ temples had been opened in Uttarakhand, entry of devotees has been banned.“The deities provide solace to a disturbed mind,” he said and demanded that devotees be allowed there.The opening of temples under a guideline would also provide some financial support to priests who had been badly hit by the COVID-triggered lockdown.The organisation has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring priests and ‘pandas’ (religious guides) under the umbrella of an economic package being provided by the government to different categories of people.A copy of the letter had also been sent to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Pathak said.

16-05-2020||Kolkata||Centre's 'botched up lockdown' responsible for deaths of migrant workers: TMC||The Trinamool Congress on Saturday slammed the Centre over the death of 24 migrant workers and blamed its "botched up lockdown" and "arrogant" approach for the suffering of lakhs of them across the country.Twenty-four migrant workers were killed and 36 injured when a trailer rammed into a stationary truck, both carrying passengers, on a highway near Uttar Pradesh's Auraiya district early this morning, police said.The impact of the collision, the latest in a series of road tragedies involving migrant workers returning to their villages, was so huge that both vehicles overturned and fell into a ditch.The Centre should have ensured that the migrant workers return home safely but instead, it is busy blaming the state governments, said TMC MP Sougata Roy.The Centre's sudden decision to announce the lockdown has led to such a mess and every day there are reports of migrants getting killed in accidents or committing suicide, said Roy.The TMC-led West Bengal dispensation, which has been under fire from the Centre for not doing enough to bring back its migrant workers, blamed the Central government's "lack of farsightedness" for the migrant crisis in the country.Senior party leader and MP Abhishek Banerjee said in a tweet, "The painful loss of lives of #MigrantWorkers forced to take desperate measures to return to their native places is a result of a botched up lockdown led by an arrogant and insensitive Govt that fails even to take cognisance of the existence & suffering of millions."Rendered jobless due to the coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown, which began on March 25, and desperate to get home, migrant workers across the country are undertaking long and arduous journeys to their native places on foot, on bicycles or packed into trucks.Over the past few days, many have been killed in accidents in different parts of the country.

16-05-2020||---||States told to distribute free ration to 8 crore migrants within 15 days||New Delhi, May 16 As hundreds of migrants continue to travel a long distance in this COVID-19 crisis, Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Saturday appealed to state governments to immediately lift food grains and pulses from the godowns and distribute them for free within a fortnight to 8 crore migrants who neither have Centre nor state ration card.According to the Food Ministry, about 142 lakh migrants will benefit in Uttar Pradesh and in Bihar (86.45 lakh), Maharasthra (70 lakh), West Bengal (60.1 lakh), Madhya Pradesh (54.64 lakh), Rajasthan (44.66 lakh), Karnataka (40.19 lakh), Gujarat (38.25 lakh), Tamil Nadu (35.73 lakh), Jharkhand (26.37 lakh), Andhra Pradesh (26.82 lakh) and Assam (25.15 lakh).In the national Capital, about 7.27 lakh migrants will get free 5kg food grains per person and 1kg chana per family for May and June."If the number of migrants exceeds the current estimation of 8 crore, the Centre is ready to provide additional grains for free supply but the identified person should be genuine which state governments have to validate," Paswan told the media via video conference here.The allocation has been made considering 10 per cent of the existing 81 crore beneficiaries under the NFSA (National Food Security Act).The free food distribution to 8 crore migrants for two months was announced by the Centre on May 14 as part of an economic package to help those who bore the brunt of the clampdown to fight the COVID-19 crisis. The Centre will bear the cost of this intervention, estimated at Rs 3,500 crore."This decision is in the interest of migrants. Congress may say give more quantity of food grains for free. The NFSA, under which 5kg per person subsidised grain is given to 81 crore through PDS, was framed during the UPA time. But, the Modi government is doing maximum. This is not the end of all. The Prime Minister is sensitive and aware of the situation," Paswan noted.Paswan, an NDA ally, further said his ministry had made all arrangements for distribution of free ration to migrants, but the state governments which have to implement at the ground level, have to be proactive and lift the ration from godowns and begin distribution immediately.An allocation of 7.99 lakh tonne of food grains has been made for distribution for two months for free. Of which, the maximum would be rice 6.95 lakh tonne which would be easy for migrants to consume, while the rest 1.04 lakh tonne is wheat, he said."Now also, many migrants are returning home walking. It is a difficult situation. Some have died on the way. They are covering long distances on foot. It hurts looking at their plight" he added.The priority now is to ensure migrants do not go hungry. Therefore, the Centre is not insisting states give details of migrant beneficiaries for availing free ration. They can provide after two months but they have to keep the data for accountability sake, he added.According to the Food Ministry, both rice and wheat have been allocated to Delhi and Gujarat, only wheat to Rajasthan, Punjab and Chandigarh, while rice to rest of the states and union territories.Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said already the Karnataka government had begun lifting the grain. The Madhya Pradesh government would do so from May 18, while Kerala has responded to take the grain from godowns.States can directly supply free ration at shelter camps, or issue distressed coupons or adopt any suitable method for free distribution of 5kg of rice or wheat per person and 1kg of chana (gram) per family for May and June, he said.States can lift an entire two months' quantity of ration in one go, Pandey said, adding that after lifting the grain states should distribute to migrants within 15 days.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-told-to-distribute-free-ration-to-8-crore-migrants-within-15-days-85641
16-05-2020||New Delhi||Stop acting like ‘sahukar’, give cash rather than credit: Rahul Gandhi to Centre||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, on Saturday, said the Centre should stop acting like a ‘sahukar’ (money lender) for its children, and demanded that cash assistance be given to the poor and vulnerable sections, who are in dire need of money now, than credit.Interacting with journalists of the regional media via video conferencing, Gandhi also warned of an impending economic crisis and asked the Modi government to at least temporarily, if not permanently, implement Congress-proposed Nyuntam Aay Yojya (NYAY), minimum income scheme, to give money directly to the marginalised section of society.“When a child is hurt, his parents do not give him credit, they see his wound...I urge the government, do give loans to people, but not act like a ‘sahukar’ to her children. Mother India should give money directly to her children as they need money now,” he told reporters.Gandhi said a ‘storm’ was brewing on the economic front that would cause damage and hurt many, and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reconsider the economic package announced by him and give money directly to the poor and the needy like migrants walking on roads, failing which the country would suffer a bigger loss economically than from COVID-19.Stating that the biggest migration since independence is underway, “triggered by policies divorced from India’s ground realities and ignoring the needs of our most vulnerable” brothers and sisters, who had been left to fend for themselves, he asserted that “yet, till today, the government has not been able to tell us what it plans to do for this huge mass of people, whose livelihoods have been cut off, as a result of the nationwide lockdown”.He also said it was important to lift the lockdown intelligently without sacrificing the old and vulnerable population to the disease.“We will have to open the lockdown and we will have to make a transition. It is very important that we open the lockdown intelligently and carefully without sacrificing the vulnerable people. We cannot sacrifice our old people,” he said, adding that protecting them was the primary duty of everybody.Asserting that India was in a crisis, he said it was heart breaking to see millions of our people walking on the highways with no food and water.“I don’t want to make a political statement, but, I have a serious reservation about the nature of the package that the government has given and I would like the government to reconsider. It is good that they have taken this step. It is not a bad step, but, the most important thing right now, is that we put money directly into the hands of our poor people,” he said.He also said the government should not worry about what the foreign agencies were going to say, but should have faith in our small and medium businesses and in our people, farmers, workers who are walking on the streets and immediately give them money in their pockets, without a single thought.“If we do not support our small businesses now, our farmers and our migrants now, our economy will not start. If our economy does not start, the question of ratings does not arise. So, I would like to ask the government and, with all respect, I would like to ask the prime minister to think about putting money directly into the bank accounts of our people,” he said.He said 52 days had passed since India was put under lockdown, but while the nation was fighting COVID-19, our farmers, migrant labourers, shopkeepers, salaried classes and small and medium industries were facing an unprecedented economic crisis.Laying emphasis on the need for an exhaustive economic package for all sections of society, he said though Prime Minister Narendra Modi belatedly announced a stimulus package on May 12, 2020, its details were not yet clear to the public and are rather opaque.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s daily press conferences on the issue were only adding to the confusion, making India increasingly sceptical and restless, he said.Gandhi said while farmers were suffering, the government’s apathy could also be seen in how the country’s MSMEs that created over 11 crore jobs, were being treated.Instead of concrete financial relief, the government had offered them loans, driving them into a debt trap from which many will never exit, he said, adding that small traders, shopkeepers, salaried middle class, government employees and pensioners were waiting for concrete steps from the government to help them tide over these difficult times.Rahul Gandhi said the Congress, after a consultative process, had made some recommendations for the stimulus package and it was still not too late for it to seriously consider them.These included income support to 13 crores poorest households by transferring Rs 7,500 preferably to each household, besides doubling the days under MGNREGA from the current 100 days of guaranteed wage employment to 200 days, ensuring food security for even the 11 crore people currently outside PDS by providing them with free ration for six months and Rs 10,000 as urgent income support to each of the 8.22 crore PM Kisan Yojana accounts, he said.He also sought Rs one lakh crore wage protection and multi-crore credit guarantee scheme for 6.25 crore MSMEs apart from giving them interest subsidy on loans for six months.The government was duty-bound to ensure the safe return of all our migrant brothers and sisters to their homes, for free, and steps must be taken for their protection and well-being and to ensure that they were treated with dignity and respect, Rahul Gandhi added.

16-05-2020||New Delhi||Army to outsource tank repairs to private parties||Indian Army is set to outsource repair and maintenance of its Russian-origin tank fleet of T-72 and T-90 tanks to private companies.Bids have been invited from private vendors by asking the how they would undertake operations of Delhi-based 505 Army Base Workshop (ABW). The Army has used what they call “Government Owned Corporate Operated” (GOCO) model to describe this. Under provisions of GOCO, mooted in 2017, infrastructure and facilities of ABWs will remain under the ownership of the government while the contractors will be responsible for the day-to-day operations, plant maintenance and meeting targets.India operates some 3,600 tanks of these two types, including some 1200 T-90 tanks and 2,400 T-72 tanks. This is part of the government’s plan to rationalise Army manpower and reduce the “tail” as recommended by the Lt Gen DB Shekatkar committee in 2016. A Committee of Experts (CoE) under the Chairmanship of Lt Gen DB Shekatkar (Retd), was constituted in 2016 recommended outsourcing the functioning of the ABWs to private sector players.The first stage of the bid called the Request for Information (RFI) has been sent out.The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has barred its own Public Sector Undertakings (PSU) and also the Ordnance Factories from bidding.The 505 Army Base Workshop has carried out repairs of tanks as well as engines and major/minor assemblies of tanks.  It currently overhauls 70 of the T-72 tanks annually and its associated engine, assemblies.From this financial year, the 505 ABW is scheduled to start all these activities for T90 tanks.Eight Army Base Workshops were established by the British during the Second World War (1939-1945) to carry out repairs and overhaul of weapons, vehicles and equipment to keep the Indian Army operationally ready.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-to-outsource-tank-repairs-to-private-parties-85636

16-05-2020||Banda||9-member family reach home at Mahboa from Delhi on tricycle cart||Amid agonizing tales of 24 migrant workers getting killed and 36 injured in a road accident near Auraiya on Saturday, the safe return of a nine-member family on a tricycle cart from Delhi to Mahoba, Uttar Pradesh, has brought some solace.Ramcharan and his family reached their village Bara in Mahoba district of Uttar Pradesh on Friday on a tricycle cart, pedalling it for nearly 600 km over a week.Thirty-six-year-old Ramcharan, his wife, younger brother, sister-in-law and five children had gone to Delhi around seven months ago for working there as daily wagers.Narrating his tales of trials and tribulations amid the COVID-led lockdown, Ramcharan said: “For some days, we survived on ration bought on credit but the shopkeeper soon stopped the credit. This led to the children sleeping on empty stomachs for three days.”Left with no options, Ramcharan said, he sold silver anklets and some other jewellery of his wife and sister-in-law (brother’s wife) and bought an old tricycle cart.All household items were loaded on it and the family set off for home from Delhi at 3 am on May 9 with kids boarding it and other family members trudging along.“I and my brother took turns to pedal the cart reached my village here on the seventh day (Friday),” said Ramcharan.Recalling the long, arduous journey, which he and his family undertook, Ramcharan said: “In the course of 600-kilometre journey, we met both ‘insaan’ (humane people) and ‘shaitaans’ (heartless and wicked ones).“Some took pity on children and gave them biscuits, while some policemen mocked at us and humiliated us for undertaking the journey back home amid the lockdown. What could have we done? We had to reach home anyhow,” he said.“Now that we are back, we will stay here and never venture out to any other place even in dreams,” he added with a sigh of relief.In seven days since buying it, Ramcharan has developed an affinity with his tricycle cart.“This seven-day-old cart is everything for me and my family. Without it, my family would not have been able to reach back home. I am going to treasure it forever,” he said.After the thermal screening by health officials, the nine-member family is in home quarantine, and the villagers are admiring his courage and determination.

16-05-2020||Mukesh Ranjan||Lockdown 4.0 may see more relaxed norms: Govt sources||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 16As the government has been preparing to finalise and announce anytime by Saturday night or Sunday morning the guidelines for lockdown 4.0, indications are there that this phase is likely to see major relaxations.It may include allowing movement of auto-rickshaws, opening of shopping centres and malls and resuming domestic flight operations, but with strict adherence to measures relating to social distancing, wearing of face mask and ban on spitting at public places.Sources in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said the entire gamut of the government, including political leadership and administrative heads, are brainstorming to bring in some kind of normalcy after nearly two months of COVID-19 induced lockdown, which has brought the country to an unprecedented halt.The third phase of lockdown is going to end on Sunday.The sources indicated that the next phase of “much-relaxed” lockdown would be of another two weeks and plans are afoot to allow metro and bus services, barber shops, restaurants, local markets and home appliance repairing shops to open in the green and orange.In case of districts falling under red zone, the MHA sources said, the new guidelines are likely to specify localise “containment zone” and in the rest of the district some relaxed norms may be provided to ease the existing strictness.  To formalise all these measures Home Minister Amit Shah has been holding several rounds of meetings with senior officials of his ministry since yesterday. Before that sources said Prime Minister Narednra Modi held a coordination meeting with the Home Minister, senior officials of the PMO, including his adviser PK Mishra and Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba.     A senior MHA official said, “Many of the states have sent their suggestions to the Centre and have favoured continuation of lockdown at least till May end under National Disaster Management Act (NDMA). The Ministry has taken note of them and working out a detailed guidelines keeping in mind both risk to life and livelihood.”The official, however, said, while some states have supported extension of the lockdown, most have asked for easing restrictions as well as more autonomy in deciding demarcation of areas as red, green, orange zones, which as of now is determined by the Centre.The MHA is especially considering the suggestions of Delhi government which has proposed opening of markets, shopping complexes and operation of buses and metro services with strict social distancing norms, the sources said, while indicating resumption of construction activities in the national capital may be permitted.Even neighbouring Haryana has favoured extension of the lockdown, but has desired permission to decide what activities should be allowed for a gradual return to normalcy.Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha have urged the Centre to extend the lockdown till the end of this month besides keeping air and rail traffic, other than Shramik Special trains, suspended during the period in view of the situation that has emerged following the return of migrants to Bihar from across the country on a large scale.The West Bengal government, which has been on loggerheads with the Centre on various points, has decided to support Home Ministry’s decision to extend the lockdown but wants the states to be allowed to decide on relaxations in their respective areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-4-0-may-see-more-relaxed-norms-govt-sources-85633
16-05-2020||New Delhi||CRPF orders immediate withdrawal of orderlies from retired brass in wake of COVID-19||The CRPF had ordered an immediate withdrawal of scores of its personnel working as domestic help and orderlies with its retired or repatriated officials fearing they might contract COVID-19 in the absence of proper healthcare facilities, officials said on Saturday.The step had been taken in the country’s largest paramilitary force, they said, after reports emerged recently that four jawans posted with a retired Additional Director General-rank officer of another paramilitary force had been infected with COVID-19.The force has directed its northern sector based in Delhi to “immediately withdraw” all orderlies, security personnel, drivers and cooks provided from its regular strength of 3.25 lakh personnel.It has also begun a manpower audit to ascertain the number of men used for extending such privileges, the duration of these attachments and the order under which these postings were authorised.“After a full manpower audit post May 17, only the most essential ones will be allowed to continue once the COVID-19 infection is contained. Action will be taken against unauthorised approvals and the names of officials enjoying these perks illegally will be notified to the Home Ministry,” a top officer, who requested anonymity, said.The official said other Central paramilitary forces such as the Border Security Force, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the Central Industrial Security Force and the Sashastra Seema Bal were expected to issue such directions soon.They said the withdrawal of personnel would also help the force to supplement its already depleted manpower as over 300 personnel from the CRPF units, based in the national capital, had either been infected by the pandemic, quarantined or were on leave.Also, they said, that withdrawal of this jawan-rank personnel was also to make sure that they did not get infected with COVID-19 as they might not be able to take proper care of their health while rendering these duties.Recently, another paramilitary force had admitted four such staffers and a state police personnel to an isolation facility at its camp in Chhawla in south-west Delhi.This five personnel were posted at the residence of a senior officer in Delhi since he retired from service in February.“We do not want a repeat of such an incident. These personnel working as domestic help and orderlies are as vulnerable to the COVID-19 disease as anyone else,” a top paramilitary officer said.A back-of-the-envelope estimate by senior officials of these forces has found that over 100 vehicles and more than 400 orderlies and cooks of these Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) are deputed with various ranks of retired and repatriated officials across the country for varied periods of time.The unofficial estimate put the expenditure of extending these perks at a few lakh rupees every year.The Union Home Ministry had taken note of this abuse of manpower in 2016 and had said such practices ‘create a wrong impression in the public mind and are also against the basic decorum and discipline of the government service, more so of the uniformed forces.”A directive issued on September 21, 2016, on the subject of ‘retention of manpower, vehicle etc by police officers at their residence even after their retirement’ had asked Central and state governments that such facilities should be withdrawn “within a period of one month of the retirement of any police official.”It had said those retired police officials, who did not follow these instructions and enjoy these services by regular paramilitary personnel, “should be made to pay”.“Similarly, action should be taken against the serving officials who do not take timely action to withdraw these privileges from the retired officials,” the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) order had said seeking its strict compliance.

16-05-2020||Washington||India can avoid 72 pc of projected COVID-19 cases by closing red light areas: Report||India can add 17 days of additional delay to reaching the peak of novel coronavirus cases, and prevent 72 per cent of projected new cases by closing down its red light areas till a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, scientists say.Based on modelling studies, the researchers including those from Yale School of Medicine in the US, said closing down these places of sex work may reduce projected COVID-19 death toll increase in India by 63 per cent post the easing of lockdown measures.They said Indians are at a much lower risk of getting COVID-19, if red light areas are kept closed after the lockdown until an effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is developed.The scientists said the findings have been shared with the Government of India, and with various state governments.They have recommended a continued closure of red light areas beyond full nation-wide reopening.They believe this can reduce the number of cases by 72 per cent in a period of 45-days, and delay the peak of COVID-19 cases by 17 days.This delay, according to the researchers, will provide the government more time and opportunities to plan and execute measures to protect public health and economy, as India moves in Lockdown 4.0.There could be a 63 per cent reduction in the number of deaths in the first 60 days after the lockdown ends, if red light areas are kept closed, the report said.According to the National Aids Control Organization (NACO), India has close to 6,37,500 sex workers, and over 5 lakh customers visit the red-light areas on a daily basis, the scientists noted in a release.Their research said that if the red light areas start operating, the disease will spread extremely quickly and infect a very high percentage of sex workers and customers.The scientists said the high transmission rate is because social distancing is not possible in sexual interactions.Infected customers could spread the disease to lakhs of other citizens, the scientists warned.Hence they believe that these red light areas have a combination of factors that can create a major hotspot.This hotspot can create a large percentage of the disease spread after lockdown ends, the researchers said.The report highlights the impact of red light areas across India, and in five Indian cities which are currently in the red-zone.These cities, the scientists said, account for some of the largest red-light areas in the country with large numbers of sex workers.If the red light areas are kept closed, they said there can be a delay in the peak of COVID-19 cases by up to 12 days in Mumbai, 17 days in New Delhi, and 29 days in Pune.With the proposed intervention, Nagpur and Kolkata may also see a peak delay by 30 and 36 days respectively, the researchers said.According to the scientists, the measure may also reduce COVID-19 cases by a fifth in Mumbai, by 27 per cent in Pune, and 31 per cent in New Delhi.In Nagpur they said there may be 56 per cent reduction in the number of projected cases, and by 66 per cent in Kolkata over a 45-day period.COVID-19 deaths may reduce by 28 per cent in Mumbai, 38 per cent in New Delhi, and by 43 per cent in Pune, the scientists said.In the first 60 days, the number of estimated deaths may reduce by more than 60 per cent for Nagpur and in Kolkata, they added.“Our study findings show that there is a strong effect of the red-light area closures, especially immediately following the lockdown,” said study co-author, Jefferey Townsend, Professor of Biostatistics at the Yale School of Medicine.According to Townsend, the purpose of the modelling exercises was not to predict what will happen in the future, but to understand the effect of the intervention on the future.Citing examples of other countries where similar interventions were implemented, the scientists said, strip clubs and brothels were the only businesses that are delineated as indefinitely closed in Australia’s reopening plan.They said Germany and the Netherlands have also closed their brothels to protect citizens from COVID-19.The scientists added that Japan did not close down red light areas in time, and saw an “explosion” in cases because of a red light area which left local hospitals “overwhelmed”.Speaking about the COVID-19 situation in India, co-author of the report, Sudhakar Nuti from the Harvard Medical School said, “The continued closure of red-light areas would build on the successes achieved by the government in lockdown.”                   “Any effort in delaying the peak reduces the amount of stress on the medical system and potentially translates into lives saved,” Nuti explained.“Preventing the potential surge in cases by red light areas reopening will protect gains made by the lockdown,” he added.According to the scientists, the suggested intervention may help potentially save the lives of thousands of sex workers across India.They suggested measures to the government to address the health, safety, and well-being of sex workers in these areas.These include reliefs as part of the government’s financial relief scheme for the poor during COVID-19, and investment in reintegrating sex workers into other occupations given the closure.

16-05-2020||Washington||COVID-19: OCI card holders vent frustration against travel restrictions imposed by Indian govt||Indian-Americans holding OCI cards, mostly their parents, have voiced frustration over the Indian government’s recent decision to temporarily put in abeyance their long term visa amidst the coronavirus-linked global travel restrictions.The OCI (Overseas Citizens of India) card is issued to the Indian-origin people, allowing them a visa-free travel in most of the cases. It also gives them certain privileges like that of an Indian citizen except for buying agricultural land, voting, running for election and working in government.Of all the countries, the Indian diplomatic missions in the US issues the largest number of OCI cards. For instance, in 2019, Indian diplomatic missions in the US issued 90,000 OCI cards. Globally, there are six million OCI card holders.According to the regulations issued by the Indian government last month and updated last week, visas of foreign nationals and OCI cards, that provide visa-free travel privileges to the people of Indian-origin, have been suspended as part of the new international travel restrictions following the COVID-19 pandemic.In many cases, in particular, the minors having OCI cards is creating a difficult situation for their parents who are still Indian citizens.“Please allow Infants (with OCI cards) to travel with their parents (INDIANS) to India from the USA. Indian parents’ visas in the USA are going to expire, but due to the kid’s USA citizenship with OCI card we are not able to utilise flights scheduled by the government of India. Kindly allow minors to travel,” one Fazale Sattar wrote on Twitter.Anitha Vankayala said that her daughter with an OCI card is waiting to come back home.“We never thought this kind of discrimination from government because of our OCI status. Please help us to get back our daughter,” she said.“Modiji, this is definitely not what we looked at when we came back to your call of Reversal of brain drain.. We loved your spirits and came back 9yrs ago.. Please treat OCI’s with aadhar card same as Indians,” T R Sreelakshmi tweeted.“Many OCI holders, all over the world are having a tough time. Forced to close their restaurants & other business. Economic loss is huge,” wrote Constant Gardner.            “Please help our kids who are OCI card holders and stranded as students in the UK, US,” tweeted Madhavi Srihari.“For no fault of mine I am stuck outside the country separated from my family for two months now- is there any sense in this madness? What exactly will you achieve by banning OCI card holders from entering India? Absolutely barn door ridiculous,” rued Binayak Chanda on twitter.Preethi Gorjala sought help for her son.“Please Help. My son, an OCI card holder who grew up in India and presently studying in the US is stranded and not able to get back home due to the ban. Please allow OCI card holders also to get back home,” she pleaded.Ravi Puvvala said that he is an OCI card holder and currently stuck in Paris on the employment front and waiting to travel India in priority.“I am desperate to join my family (newborn) in India, They are struggling back home in India without me in this pandemic situation,” he said.However, Indian-American activist Sunanda Vashisht defended the Indian government.“OCI card holders are not Indian citizens. They are of Indian-origin and OCI is a long term visa. GOI is rightly prioritising Indian citizens. If there are few urgent cases, embassies can look into that but OCI card holders en masse cannot and must not be included in evacuations,” she said on Twitter.“Sir we are residents of India with Indian passports please help us get back our stranded son in America who holds an OCI card,” pleaded Srithi Reddy.One Simpi argued on Twitter that OCI is permanent residency.“No country has betrayed its permanent resident.. not even Indians who have Permanent residency of the USA (Green Card). We are only being made fools by our own Indian govt,” she said.Balakrishnan Shanmugam said that current restrictions for OCI card holders to travel to India are impacting parents whose kids are OCI card holders. Mahendran Mahesh wrote on twitter that his wife and six months old baby are stuck in Chennai.

16-05-2020||New Delhi||The father on the bridge, and the son he wanted to see||PTI's photograph of a man on the phone, his face twisted in grief, was circulated widely on social and news media and resulted in help being provided to him to reach his home in Bihar. PTI photographer Atul Yadav recounts his meeting with Rampukar Pandit on a Delhi roadside and the powerful image that captured the tragedy of migrants across India: He was talking on the phone and sobbing uncontrollably on the Nizamuddin Bridge. And I just couldn't drive on.In the last few weeks, I have come across and photographed so many migrants, one more helpless than the other, and honestly, I didn't expect to feel surprised at the sight of a grown man crying. But I was.Inured as we are, his naked grief shook me. It felt personal enough for me to not simply click a picture and move on. I just had to know what was bothering him.His son was unwell and might die, and he just wanted to go back home, the desperate father told me.I asked him where, and the 40-something man just managed to say “udhar” (there) in between sobs, pointing at the expanse of the road stretching across the Yamuna and meandering towards Delhi's border some miles away.It was only much later that I realised home was Bariarpur in Begusarai in Bihar, almost 1,200 km away.He said he worked as a labourer in Najafgarh and, in the absence of any public transport, had started walking home like thousands of other migrants across the country.His journey abruptly came to a halt after the police at the bridge refused to let him go further.The man, broken and defeated, had been stuck at the Nizamuddin Bridge for three days.I offered him biscuits and some water and tried to reassure him. But can any consolation be ever enough for a father scared he won't see his son ever again?I desperately wanted to put this man out of his misery and reached out to police personnel in the vicinity requesting them to let him cross the border.They were reluctant, but since the request came from a media person they said they would ensure he reaches home.I reached home soon after and realised I never did ask him his name or his phone number. I wanted to know if he managed to reach home, if he saw his son if the child as well. I didn't have to wait much.That was a Monday, 5.15 pm.PTI put out the photograph I had taken and it was distributed widely across all media, the anguished father's grief touching a chord in so many people.Once his photograph that I clicked started doing the rounds, several newspapers followed up on his story.And then I learnt. His name was Rampukar Pandit and his son lost the battle of life. It broke my heart. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/the-father-on-the-bridge-and-the-son-he-wanted-to-see-85599

But the virus graph hasn't seen a decline as yet. We want the doubling rate of coronavirus cases to come to 20 days," he said.He said that there was a need to learn from other countries in terms of the handling of the coronavirus situation.The nine-member task force was set up last month to recommend steps to decrease the mortality rate and clinical management of critically-ill COVID-19 patients.The doubling rate in the state is now 11 days. The number of COVID-19 cases in the state till Friday night was 29,100, of the 1,068 have died. Of these, Mumbai accounts for 17,671 cases and 655 deaths.As many as 6,564 patients have recovered and discharged from hospitals.The other hotspots include Pune with 3,141 cases and 172 deaths, followed by Malegaon with 663 cases and 34 deaths, Solapur with 356 cases and 20 deaths, Aurangabad with 683 cases and 20 deaths.In Mumbai, the process to augment the bed capacity in hospital beds is on. The capacity is also being enhanced in the larger Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), officials said.The BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been categorised in three parts-COVID Care Centres (CCC), Dedicated COVID-19 Health Centres (DCHC) and Dedicated COVID-19 Hospitals (DCH).Three facilities—one in MMRDA Ground at Bandra-Kurla Complex and second in NESCO Complex in Goregaon and another one at Global Impact Hub in Thane- are expected to be commissioned in next few days, they said.

16-05-2020||Washington||Trump lauds Indian-Americans scientists, researchers||US President Donald Trump has lauded Indian-Americans scientists and researchers for their efforts in developing medicines and vaccine for the the deadly coronavirus.Trump said the US was closely working with India to tackle the pandemic. "We have a tremendous Indian population in the United States and many of the people that you are talking about are working on the vaccine too. Great scientists and researchers," Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden of the White House on Friday.He was responding to the Indian-American community's appreciation of his fight against the coronavirus.This is the first time that a president has recognised the scientific and research talent of the Indian American community.A large number of scientists are engaged in cutting edge research in various aspects of medical science, including at the National Institute of Health, universities, research institutes and bio-pharma startups.There are an estimated 4 million Indian Americans in the United States, of which about 2.5 million are potential voters in the 2020 presidential elections this November.As a presidential candidate, Trump was the first nominee to hold a separate election rally for Indian-Americans in October 2016 in New Jersey.Since then he has described himself as the best friend of India and Indian-Americans at the White House.According to the co-chair of Trump Victory Indian-American Finance Committee, Al Masson, the president is not just a sensitive guardian to his 325 million fellow Americans, he is also their resolute and humanitarian commander-in-chief."He has brought forth his true empathy and determination -- blended with just the right solutions to fight this "Made in China" coronavirus pandemic. His mission is to save American lives and revive the American economy. By doing whatever it takes," Mason said on Friday.“Trump is unbeatable. His critics and enemies should leave him alone. They should let him focus on fighting for all Americans against the invisible coronavirus pandemic and rebuilding the economy. He is a master at whatever he builds and he believes in the power of prayer,” said Mason.Senior Advisor to Donald J Trump for President, Inc. and National Chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee Kimberly Guilfoyle, in a recent op-ed in The Daily Caller, said Trump has the American people on his side.“At this point, Team Trump has raised over US$ 742 million with over US$ 255 million cash on hand. Since the transition to a virtual national campaign, Trump Victory, in coordination with the Republican National Convention, has made over 20 million voter contacts and added more than 300,000 new volunteers, bringing the total to 1 million volunteers trained and activated,” Guilfoyle wrote.The amount raised by Indian-Americans for Trump's campaign is not available as of now.The coronavirus, which first emerged in China's Wuhan city has claimed over 3,00,000 lives with 4.5 million confirmed infections across the world so far.The US alone accounts for over 87,000 COVID-19 deaths.

16-05-2020||New Delhi||India’s COVID-19 tally crosses 90k as city returnees push numbers in hinterlands||The nationwide COVID-19 tally crossed 90,000 on Saturday with new cases getting detected from Ganjam in Odisha to Patna in Bihar to Thrissur in Kerala, and mostly among people having returned from big Indian cities or even from abroad.Several big urban centres also continued to report large numbers, with just five of them—Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Pune—now taking a share of over 50 per cent in the nationwide count of the deadly virus infection with close to 46,000 cases. These five also account for over half of the nationwide death toll of close to nearly 2,800 so far.Besides, at least 35 migrant workers were killed and many more were injured in road accidents during the day in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh while trying to return to their native places. Most of them had hitched rides in trucks while a couple was in an autorickshaw for a journey running into hundreds of kilometers.Lakhs of migrant workers in different parts of the country had begun walking back to their native places after being rendered jobless, and many of them homeless too, due to a nationwide lockdown, which is in place since March 25.While special trains are being run now by the government and some states have also arranged for buses to take them back to their homes, not all places are said to be connected by these trains and large numbers of people remain on roads.The third phase of the nationwide lockdown is scheduled to end on Sunday and there are expectations that the fourth phase beginning Monday may give significant relaxations for various economic activities even as a complete exit is unlikely given the continuous rise in the number of COVID-19 cases.In its morning update, the Union Health Ministry said the death toll due to COVID-19 has risen to 2,752 and the number of cases has climbed to 85,940, registering an increase of 103 deaths and 3,970 cases in the last 24 hours since Friday 8 AM. It put the number of active cases at 53,035, while more than 30,000 have recovered so far.However, a PTI tally of figures announced by states and union territories, as of 9.15 pm, put the total number of confirmed cases at 90,326, deaths at 2,790 and recoveries at over 33,500.India is the 11th most affected nation in terms of the total number of confirmed cases, while it is eighth largest in terms of active cases after the US, Russia, Brazil, France, Italy, Spain and Peru.However, the total number of cases in Mumbai itself is more than that of many countries, including Poland, Ukraine, Indonesia, Romania, Israel, Japan, Austria, South Africa, Philippines, Egypt, Denmark and South Korea.Delhi also has more cases than Panama and Norway, while even Ahmedabad’s tally exceeds Argentina, Australia, Malaysia, Bahrain, Finland and Afghanistan. Chennai also has more cases than Kazakhstan, Oman and Luxembourg, Thailand and Greece, among other countries.Several countries have begun relaxing their lockdowns, though there have been concerns about re-emergence of the virus spread including in China and several European countries.In India, some states have already said they want the lockdown restrictions to continue further, while Punjab has become the first to extend it till May 31 but without curfew restrictions.Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, however, supported restarting of domestic flights as well as opening of schools and universities, as he stressed on resumption of normal life while dealing with COVID-19. His state reported 33 new cases, including 14 in Gurgaon on the outskirts of the national capital.Worries have also been mounting about a new phase of coronavirus infections with states like Kerala and Goa, which had become virtually free of new infections, have begun reporting new cases while the numbers have started rising rapidly in places like Odisha, Bihar and Assam too in the last few days.Most of the new cases across states are being linked to the influx of people from other states or other countries in special trains, flights and buses.In Odisha, 65 people tested positive during the day, taking its total to 737, and officials said most of these cases are among people who had returned from other states. Ganjam in south Odisha now accounts for the highest number of cases in the state at 277 and most of these people have returned from Gujarat and other states.In Kerala, 11 people tested positive for COVID-19, including four from Thrissur district, three from Kozhikode and two each from Palakkad and Malappuram. All of them had come from outside the state—seven from abroad and two each from Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.Nearly 57,000 people are under observation in the state at present, out of which about 3,000 came to the state through airports, nearly 800 from sea ports, over 1,000 through train and over 50,320 via road.In Tripura also, 11 people, including seven BSF jawans, tested positive on Saturday.Bihar recorded 46 new cases, including in Patna which now has 105 cases. The number of cases in Bihar has risen sharply since the beginning of the month, mainly because of migrants returning to their native places in large numbers by special trains in addition to other modes of transport.According to the state health department, 427 of returnees since May 4 have tested positive for COVID-9. Most of them had come from Delhi, Gujarat and Maharashtra. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-19-tally-crosses-90k-as-city-returnees-push-numbers-in-hinterlands-85565

16-05-2020||---||SC stays Gujarat HC order setting aside minister’s election||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 15The Supreme Court on Friday stayed a Gujarat High Court order setting aside state minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama’s 2017 election from the Dholka Assembly constituency for electoral malpractices.A Bench headed by Justice Mohan M Shantangoudar asked Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod — on whose Chudasama’s election was set aside by the HC — to respond to the petition.On behalf of Chudasama, senior advocates Harish Salve and NK Kaul argued that the HC should have examined the Returning Officer to see if the rejection of 429 votes was done properly or not. In his appeal, Chudasama urged the top court to stay the operation of the HC’s order till pendency of his appeal in the top court.The HC order came after Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod challenged Chudasama’s election from Dholka by a margin of mere 327 votes. The court held that Returning Officer “illegally rejected” 429 postal ballots during the counting of votes, while the victory margin was only 327. It had rejected Chudasama’s request for a stay to enable him to file an appeal.Allahabad HC bans azan by LoudspeakerLucknow: The Allahabad High Court on Friday set aside the orders of the district administrations of Ghazipur, Farukhabad and Hathras prohibiting azan in mosques in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, but disallowed the call for prayer through loudspeakers.

16-05-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Free market access for farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 15Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, at her third press conference today to detail the PM’s Rs 20-lakh crore Covid stimulus, announced Rs 1-lakh crore NABARD-anchored fund to set up modern cold chains and storage centres, and measures to usher in barrier-free agricultural trade as well as boost fisheries, animal husbandry and dairy sectors.Several of the proposals, she conceded, were aired in previous budgets. The Centre also intends bringing in a Central law to remove all barriers in inter-state trade and allow farmers to sell to anyone. It is also looking at a framework law to ensure farmers get predictable prices.Addressing the disappointment due to the absence of direct cash injections, Sitharaman said the government’s philosophy behind focusing on liquidity measures and infrastructure-building initiatives was to empower people rather than give doles. “Entitlements, where due, will be given, but the focus is on making sure that India is helped to stand up on its own by the creation of skills and development of logistics,” she explained.That is why most of the announcements were to set up infrastructure on the ground, she added. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana, announced in the last Budget, allocates Rs 11,000 crore for marine, inland fisheries and aquaculture and Rs 9,000 crore for the development of infrastructure such as fishing harbours, cold chains. A refurbished scheme to vaccinate all cattle will cost Rs 13,000 crore. Another Rs 4,000 crore package is for herbal corridors along the Ganga but it is not clear if it will be dovetailed with a similar component in the Namami Gange programme.A two per cent interest subvention scheme for dairy cooperatives will cost Rs 5,000 crore and government dairies purchased milk for Rs 4,100 crore that otherwise would have been thrown due to the lockdown. A Rs 10,000 crore fund will help local micro enterprises go global with their speciality products such as saffron in Kashmir, ragi in Karnataka and “makhana” in Bihar.On the Rs 1 lakh crore NABARD fund, Sitharaman said the aim was to help those entrepreneurs who are procuring from farms but cannot reach out to global markets because of absence of storage infrastructure. In a step towards administrative reforms, cereals, edible oil, oil seeds, onions and potatoes will be completely deregulated and taken out of the Essential Commodities Act 1955.TRANCHE-IIIRs 1.63 lakh crore Agriculture pushRs 1 lakh cr for aggregators, farmer producer organisations, agri cooperative societies, entrepreneurs and startupsRs 10,000 cr fund to support 2 lakh micro food enterprises go global with their speciality products such as saffron in Kashmir, ragi in Karnataka and ‘makhana’ in BiharRs 20,000 cr Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana for the development of marine and inland fisheries.

16-05-2020||Vibha Sharma||Monsoon likely to hit Kerala on June 5||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 15Contrary to the prediction of private forecaster Skymet, country’s official weather agency India Meteorological Department (IMD) today said the southwest monsoon was likely to hit Kerala on June 5, a delay of four days as compared to its normal onset date (June 1).The prediction is at variance with the Skymet, which has forecasted a May 28 arrival for the seasonal rains with an error margin of two days.The advance of monsoon over the mainland is marked by the onset over Kerala and is an important indicator characterising transition from hot and dry season to a rainy season, eagerly awaited by farmers and general public alike. The rains normally arrive over Kerala on June 1 with a standard deviation of about seven days.The IMD, which has been issuing operational forecasts for onset over Kerala since 2005 using an indigenously developed statistical model with a model error of plus or minus four days, has predicted normal rains but is yet to give the distribution, which has been a major cause of concern over past few years with some regions receiving excess and others stranded with deficit at the end of the four-month season.Meanwhile, according to officials, IMD’s operational forecasts for onset in the past 15 years (2005-2019) have all been proved correct except in 2015.Initial rains are experienced over south Andaman Sea after which winds advance in north-westwards across the Bay of Bengal. Currently, a low pressure area is prevailing in the Bay, which the IMD warns, is very likely to concentrate into a depression and intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 16.Under its influence, adverse weather is likely over the Bay, adjoining Andaman Sea and along and off Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal coasts during the next five to six days.In association with the above system, conditions are becoming favourable for advance of monsoon over south Bay of Bengal, Andaman Sea and Andaman and Nicobar Islands during the next 48 hours, says the IMD.Dates revised||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-likely-to-hit-kerala-on-june-5-85437

Nepal has accepted its territory is to the east of Kali. There has never been an issue about tri-junction… Nepal may have raised the issue at someone else's behest — Gen MM Naravane, Army ChiefThough he did not name China, the hint was amply clear as Beijing was the only interested party to it. Nepal has been protesting after India opened a road on May 8 till Lipulekh pass in Uttrakahand for connecting India with Kailash Mansarover in Tibet. General Naravane was answering questions after a talk, “Covid and Indian Army: Responses and Beyond”, at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses via video-conferencing.One being asked why Nepal was protesting on our road across Lipulekh and why it had decided to set up a border post at the spot, the Army Chief said there was no contradiction in Lipulekh. “We have made a road west of the Kali river. Nepal has accepted its territory is to the east of Kali river. There has never been an issue about tri-junction,” he said. Nepal is protesting that Lipulekh pass is not with India.On a related question whether he saw a link between Lipulekh and recent clashes between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh and Sikkim, General Naravane, in a veiled reference to China, said: “Nepal may have raised the issue at someone else’s behest.” He, however, saw no connection between face-offs and any other events.

16-05-2020||New Delhi||Govt ignorant of farmers’ plight, say union leaders||Leaders of farmer unions are unhappy with the Central Government's announcement of relief package, terming it helpful only for big players. “Farmers have become poorer and more indebted and migrants left stranded during the lockdown but it seems policy planners are either ignorant of farm economy or insensitive to farmers’ plight, they say."It is eyewash," said BKU general secretary Yudhvir Singh. Expecting something simpler and sustainable like relief being provided by countries, like the US and Canada, Yudhvir said direct money should have been given in hands of people.“The government is behaving like a banking service or loan lender. I (farmer) am dying and need help now. What they have announced is for future, most of which will benefit big people involved in agri-business,” he said.Agriculture expert Sudhir Panwar says measures like extension of two-month moratorium on crop loan and increased credit flow may be of advantage in future but at present it shows that the “policy planners in the government are either ignorant of farm economy or insensitive to farmers’ plight.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-ignorant-of-farmers-plight-say-union-leaders-85439
