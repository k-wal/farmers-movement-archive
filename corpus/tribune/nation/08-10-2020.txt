Health Minister should come clean on our posers. If he doesn’t come clean, he is inflicting a fraud on the nation and gullible patients by calling placebos as drugs,” IMA Chief Rajan Sharma said three days after the AYUSH protocol for COVID care was issued.The IMA said Health Minister Harsh Vardhan himself released the document prescribing protocol of prevention of Covid 19 infection and treatment of asymptomatic as well as mild cases of Covid 19 based on AYUSH and yoga.“Health Minister admits that these are based on empirical evidence which means that the evidence is anecdotal and based on individual subjective experiences. We have certain questions,” Sharma said.Noting that science demands “Reproducibility of a claim elsewhere in non-conflict situations and Double Blind Control studies”, IMA asked the Health Minister, a modern medicine doctor, “Is there satisfactory evidence regarding the claims made from studies done on COVID 19 patients based on the above criteria? If so whether the evidence is weak or moderate or strong? The evidence should be in public domain and available for scientific scrutiny.”The Centre’s Ayurveda and Yoga protocol for COVID 19 has recommended Ashwagandha, Guduchi Ghana Vati, Chyawanaprasha among other drugs for disease prevention in high risk groups and in primary contacts of COVID patients and proposed Guduchi Ghana Vati and a combination of Guduchi and Pippali or AYUSH 64 drug for asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients to prevent disease progression to symptomatic and progression from mild to moderate or severe disease.The protocol says Guduchi-Pippali mix and AYUSH 64 tablets can be given to mild COVID patients.The government has, however, clarified that the AYUSH protocol is not a replacement of the national clinical management protocol for COVID 19 and is only in addition to the same, and it should not be used by patients to claim a false sense of security.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/how-many-ministers-have-sought-ayush-care-for-covid-ima-questions-centres-ayush-protocols-152887

They also clicked pictures of the act, she had said.“A case was registered against unidentified persons under relevant sections of the IPC, POCSO Act and IT Act based on a complaint by the victim’s family members,” the SHO said.The chairperson of Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Sangeeta Beniwal, meanwhile, visited the district hospital to meet the girl.Beniwal raised objections that the rape victim was admitted to the general ward.She said the rape victim should have been kept in a separate ward and not in the general ward after which the district hospital authorities shifted the girl to a ‘cottage’ ward.Poonia, meanwhile, met the victim’s family members and demanded speedy action in the case.He said the crime rate has increased in the state and the cases of crime against women are on the rise under the Congress rule.“Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has failed in keeping law and order under control. Crimes against women are increasing and this situation is more dangerous than the corona pandemic,” he said.Poonia said the Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi should visit Rajasthan too.

In the same year, Taiwan too established the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in Delhi.

If you will seek permission to meet your mother, we will allow it,” said the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.“The special leave petition is dismissed. Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of,” the bench said in its order.The counsel appearing for the petitioner told the bench that Ranjith has been in jail for around five years in the case, under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), and he has not seen his mother who is in Kerala.“You should have thought about all this before you did it,” the bench observed.Before the high court, Ranjith had sought bail saying he was only 24 years of age at the time of his arrest and the only charge framed against him is under section 3 of the Official Secrets Act for which maximum punishment is 14 years.In its order, the high court had noted that according to the FIR and the order by which charge was framed against him, the petitioner is accused of having passed on sensitive data to persons who were intending to threaten the sovereignty and integrity of the country.The high court had noted that status report filed by the prosecution showed that various documents have been recovered including WhatsApp messages, chat history, forwarding of a map of the Air Force base etc.The high court had observed that accused ought not to be granted bail at this stage as trial in the case was still underway.The police had earlier alleged that he had shared secret information with intelligence operatives suspected to be backed by Pakistan’s ISI after being honey-trapped.He had joined the Indian Air Force as a leading aircraftsman. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-plea-of-former-iaf-officer-seeking-bail-in-spying-case-152872

The accused and his gang members used to pose as CBI and Crime Branch officers to dupe their targets on Delhi roads.The accused Mukesh and his accomplices used to pick up target passengers at bus stands and ask them about their destination and pretend as if they were also going to the same place.In the meantime, some other gang member would come in a car and offer lift to the target passenger."After covering some distance, the accused used to claim that they were CBI or police officers and flash messages on wireless sets to gain confidence of the target. They would then rob the target of all his belongings," said Bhisham Singh, DCP, Crime Branch.The gang also took ATM cards and pins from the victims. In case the victim refused, they would hold him on gun point.After that they would dump the victim in an isolated place and flee."The gang members would withdraw money using the ATM cards and also purchase goods by swiping the cards in order to spend more than the existing withdrawal limit," the officer added.The accused Mukesh and his associate Tinkle and Girender, both residents of Trilokpuri, have been committing the crime using the same modus operandi.

08-10-2020||Kolkata||Doctors warn Mamata of massive COVID-19 spike post Durga puja||Expressing concern over the unrelenting surge in COVID-19 cases in Bengal, doctors here have written to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, urging her to take stricter measures to restrict public gathering during Durga puja, as it might “lead to a tsunami” of infections.BR Satpati, an advisor at the health department and member of the state’s COVID-19 expert committee, however, asserted that the government was taking requisite measures to ensure people’s safety.Members of Joint Platform of Doctors, in their letter to Banerjee, referred to the steep rise in coronavirus cases in Kerala after the recent Onam festival, and a similar situation in Spain following International Women’s Day celebrations and a football match to make their point.They also attached with the letter a three-day rolling average of the daily number of infections in the city, which showed a significant rise in caseload.“We saw that the number of infections in West Bengal went up after Mahalaya and Vishwakarma Puja. It’s an alarming signal. We have also seen how the situation deteriorated after priority was given to emotions to organise Onam festival, neglecting health protocols in Kerala.“The infection rate in Kerala shot up by 750 per cent, following which section 144 had to be imposed there, the letter, signed by Dr Hiralal Konar and D Punyabrata Gun, joint convenors of the platform, said.The doctors also reminded the chief minister that Ganesh Chaturthi was a low-key affair in Maharasthra this time, and Garba during Navratri has been cancelled in Gujarat, in the wake of the pandemic.“In our state, too, Eid and Muharram were observed indoors. If we do not learn from these instances, and take precautionary measures to maintain health protocols during this Durga Puja, it can be suicidal. The situation may go out of hand leading to a tsunami of cases,” the forum said.The platform further requested Banerjee to ensure that no public gathering takes place during Durga Puja.“We would like to request you (CM) to take necessary steps to stop gathering of people at puja pandals. And people stepping out of their homes must mandatorily wear masks. We believe, at this moment, these are the two major protocols people must follow,” the letter said.Dr Konar, when contacted, said calling off Durga Puja celebrations would have been the ideal thing to do, this year.“We could have not organised the Durga Puja this year amid this pandemic. But that’s not possible. There are so many factors involved. So many people will be exposed. Think about the police personnel, the civic police, the volunteers who will be on the road... this will make them more vulnerable to the disease,” Dr Konar told PTI.He also said that the transport movement should be controlled to discourage pandal-hopping.“We will urge the administration to allow virtual pandal-hopping as that would stop people from going out.People must be encouraged to opt for virtual pandal hopping,” he added.Bengal, till Wednesday, witnessed 5,376 COVID-19- related deaths, while the tally stands at 2,80,504.Satpathi, on his part, said the state was taking adequate steps to ensure safety of all, but people, too, have to be alert and follow the instructions.“See, people have to follow the protocols while going out. We have to be alert. The state has taken all forms of precautionary measures. But if people do not follow them, there will always be a chance of a further spike in cases,” Satpathi stated.Echoing him, Dr Ashutosh Ghosh, another member of the COVID expert team, said maintaining health protocol is the only way forward.“Obviously, we need to maintain physical distance and wear masks. We can already see that people are crowding market places. They will come out during the pujas, too. We must not forget the health protocols or the situation might turn critical,” Dr Ghosh added.

The lawyer added that Sushant Singh Rajput's family seems to be "very vindictive" towards her.Rhea was released on bail on Wednesday, after spending 28 days at the Byculla Jail on drug-related charges in the case.In conversation with NDTV, calling her "Bengal tigress", Maneshinde said that she would ‘fight back’ to restore her tarnished image.He said that Rhea made attempts to stay positive during her time in jail.“I personally went to a jail to see a client after so many years, because she was hounded, and I wanted to see the condition that she was in. I was fortunate to see that she was in good spirits. She looked after herself in the jail. She used to conduct yoga classes for herself and her jail inmates. She adjusted herself in the jail, because she could not get home food because of the pandemic, and she lived with the inmates as if she was a commoner. Being an army girl, she fought the conditions like a battle, and she is ready to face any person who is trying to accuse her and harm her interests,” the lawyer said.“The reason that she was hounded, was just because the family was after her. I don’t know for what reason, the family seems to be very vindictive as far as Rhea Chakraborty is concerned,” he said.“I’ve been saying that the central agencies—the CBI, the NCB, the ED—have been hounding her only because she was the housewife or the live-in partner of this gentleman.”Calling out media channels, he continued, “Media channels, particularly those which were hounding her, were doing it only for the TRPs. They were formatting all this fake news and bogus stories.”He called for the channels to be brought to court.Rhea has been accused by Sushant’s father, in an FIR backed by his family, of abetting the actor’s suicide and misappropriating his funds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/how-rhea-chakraborty-spent-28-days-in-jail-her-lawyer-answers-152861

We stand with the people of Bengal despite the brazen misuse of state power by Mamata didi. Our brave karyakartas compelled her to close the Secretariat. This is an admission that she has lost public confidence”.Alleging misuse of power, Nadda said “Mamata Banerjee’s karyakartas and the government machinery led by her unleashed brute force upon BJP karyakartas in an attempt to prevent them from holding protests against her tyrannical and bloodied misrule in West Bengal”.“The only thing Mamata Banerjee’s government has done better than the previous Left regimes is increase in brutality and political violence against political opponents. Bengal has been burning under her administration, which patronises violent elements.“Beating up peaceful protestors, hurling country made bombs and using water cannon on their protest march show Mamata Banerjee’s frustration because she knows that her days in power are numbered and the people of Bengal have made up their mind to throw out her tyrannical government,” he said.Meanwhile, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, condemning the “barbaric treatment” of the BJP workers by the police, alleged that “water cannons with chemicals were used against the leaders because of which many suffered”.He also questioned the “silence of liberals” over the violence in Bengal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-violence-bjp-slams-mamta-banerjee-claims-chemical-laced-water-cannons-used-against-them-152858

In this amount, how many things could be purchased for our soldiers posted on the Siachen-Ladakh border. Warm clothes: 30,00,000. Jacket, gloves: 60,00,000. Shoes: 67,20,000 Oxygen cylinder: 16,80,000,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.Gandhi alleged that the PM is “only concerned about his image and not soldiers”.When he was asked about the BJP’s criticism of him for using a cushion to sit in a tractor, Gandhi had said in Punjab that the prime minister’s ‘Air India One’ did not just have a cushion but a whole lot of luxury beds for his comfort.Government sources had said that the process for procuring two VVIP aircraft had begun under the UPA government, and the current dispensation has only brought it to a logical conclusion.They noted that the exercise had begun in 2011 and an Inter-Ministerial Group submitted its recommendations in 2012 after meeting for 10 times.Taking a swipe at Gandhi, they had said like most other initiatives of the Congress-led UPA government, he perhaps wants to “disown” this procurement too.

It came to the notice of a farmer, who then informed the authorities.In a statement to the media, the rescue team spokesperson said, "On receiving information, volunteers rushed to the spot and saw the python resting. The team had to struggle a lot before catching it… given that it is 15 years old and 13 feet long, it took four people to carry the rescue operation."So far five pythons have been caught in Srirangapur and Manajipet over a one-month period, owing to heavy rains and overflowing water bodies. Sagar, who led the operation, has rescued nearly 2,000 venomous and nonvenomous snakes from different places.His team also caught a crocodile weighing 180 kg in July at Srirangapuram Cheruvu, which they later released in the Krishna river.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/13-feet-long-python-rescued-from-telanganas-wanaparthy-district-152853

08-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant death case: Is it media's job to advise on probe, asks Bombay High Court||The Bombay High Court asked on Thursday if it was the media's job to proffer advice to an investigating agency about how it should conduct a probe.The remark was made by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni during the hearing of public interest litigations (PILs) against the "media trial" in the actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case."Is it duty of media to advise an investigating agency? It is the duty of the investigating officer to apply his mind (in the probe)," the court said.The judges made the comment when advocate Malvika Trivedi, representing a news channel which has been made a respondent, opposed the PILs.Trivedi opposed the arguments made by senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, the lawyer for a group of former police officers who have filed one of the PILs alleging that the Mumbai police were being maligned by the media in the Rajput case.Trivedi said there couldn't be any gag order on reporting. "How can structured lines be drawn on role of media. What about the Hathras case? Isn't the media's role in the case important?" she asked.The court pointed out that the PILs were not seeking a gag order but only asking for responsible journalism."He (Chinoy) is submitting that the media cannot intervene in investigations or declare who is guilty, who is not," the bench said.Advocate Chinoy argued that the press, particularly news channels, cannot pre-judge someone's guilt, and pointed out a `hashtag' campaign run by a news channel calling for Rhea Chakraborty's arrest in the Rajput case."Can you imagine the damage such a hashtag can do?....It is not the news channel's job to decide on anyone's guilt, or create perception of guilt or to suggest arrest," he said.When in a pending investigation a channel said "arrest x", it crossed all lines, advocate Chinoy added.While the Press Council of India has guidelines for the print media that warn against assigning guilt during ongoing probe, there are no guidelines for channels, he said.The HC asked if the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) had passed any orders on the complaints received against news channels.Advocate Nisha Bhambhani, the NBSA's lawyer, said that most complaints were heard and "an apology had been sought from news channels"."Is apology enough," the court asked.Bhambhani said the NBSA will submit guidelines if required. But advocateRajesh Inamdar, lawyer for another petitioner, pointed out thatmost news channels were not members of the NBSA.The court then sought the Union government's response on the issue on Monday and adjourned the hearing.Rhea Chakraborty, who is facing an abetment of suicide case in connection with her boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput's death, was given bail by another high court bench on Wednesday in a drug case connected to the matter.

08-10-2020||New Delhi||Govt in touch to free 7 Indians kidnapped in Libya||The government on Thursday said it was trying its best to free seven Indians who were kidnapped in Libya last month.The early signs were promising as the kidnappers had got in touch with the Libyan employers of the Indians. The employers were shown photographs of the Indians which suggested that they were safe and sound so far, said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.He, however, regretted that they had landed in harm’s way by ignoring a four-year-old complete travel ban to Libya which is still in force.The seven, from Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and UP, were working for a construction and oil field supplies company and were kidnapped on September 14 while they were on their way to Tripoli airport to catch a flight to India. The men had gone to work in Libya despite a September 2015 advisory which had asked Indian nationals to avoid travelling to Libya in view of the security situation there.Later, in May 2016, the government imposed a complete travel ban irrespective of the purpose in view of the much deteriorated security situation. This travel ban is still in force.The Indian Embassy in Tunisia, which handles matters relating to the welfare of Indian nationals in Libya, has reached out to the Libyan government authorities concerned, as also the international organisations present there, to seek their help in rescuing the Indian nationals.The government is also in touch with their family members and has assured them that it is making all possible efforts, in consultation and coordination with Libyan authorities and the employer, to trace the Indians nationals and secure their release from captivity at the earliest, said Srivastava.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-in-touch-to-free-7-indians-kidnapped-in-libya-152846

On the other hand, Pakistan has failed to respond on core issues pertaining to the case, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at the weekly media briefing on Thursday.The core issues are handing over to India copies of relevant documents related to the case and providing unimpeded and unhindered consular access to Jadhav, said Srivastava while responding to the Islamabad High Court’s observations regarding lack of any attempt by the Indian government to appoint a counsel to represent Jadhav to review his death sentence.Two renowned Pakistani lawyers have turned down the Islamabad High Court’s offer to represent Jadhav as amicus curiae. New Delhi, however, wants Jadhav to be represented by an Indian lawyer which is not possible under present laws in Pakistan.Jadhav has been in Pakistani custody since 2016. After a favourable ICJ order to review his case, India has complained that Islamabad has been creating an “illusion of remedy”. It continues to deny India free and unimpeded access to Jadhav nor does it permit an Indian lawyer to appear for Jadhav in review and reconsideration proceedings.Since 2017, when a Military Court carried out a trial, Pakistan has refused to hand over to India any relevant document, including FIR, evidence, court order, etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-denies-indifference-to-jadhav-case-152842

08-10-2020||Mumbai||Congress has double standards on farm sector reforms: Nadda||BJP president JP Nadda on Thursday accused the Congress of having “double standards” on agriculture sector reforms and called its protests over the three new farm laws as a “cushion seat” agitation.The Congress is vehemently opposing the three new farm laws enacted by the Modi government last month and its leader Rahul Gandhi has been leading protests over the issue.“The Congress party has displayed double standards on farm sector reforms. The party had made similar promises in the past, but is now opposing the same reforms unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Nadda said, addressing a virtual meeting of the Maharashtra BJP.“It took out a tractor rally with cushion seats to protest against it (the new farm laws). Is this the thinking of the Congress towards farmers.“The party, in its election manifesto, had made the same promises (of reforming farm sector), but took out a rally when Prime Minister Modi implemented them, he said.Gandhi came under attack over a cushion he used to sit on a tractor during a rally in Punjab against the new farm laws.The BJP chief said NCP president Sharad Pawar, an ally of the Congress, had taken a similar stance over the laws though the former Union agriculture minister has been advocating reforms in the key sector for long.Pawar himself has been advocating reforms for a long time, but when we did it, we suddenly become anti-farmers, he said.Everyone likes to call themselves as farmer leaders but they do not do anything for farmers. Modiji has set budget for the farm sector at Rs 1.36 lakh crore, which is almost 11 times than what was allocated in 2008-09 (under UPA rule),” Nadda said.BJP workers should know these facts and explain them to people, he said.Parliament had passed The Farmers” Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 during the Monsoon Session.

However, the march here on Thursday, organised under the banner of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), showed no respect to the NDMA stipulations.The march took a violent turn after police prevented them from heading towards the state secretariat, which incidentally is closed for Thursday and Friday for sanitisation.The irate party workers tried to break barriers erected by police and threw stones at them. Police also alleged that there have been instances of throwing of bombs at them by the protesters.One protester, said to be an associate of BJP MP Arjun Singh, was found carrying a firearm.The police, in return, resorted to water cannons and fired tear gas shells, besides lathicharging the workers, to disperse the crowd.Several BJP workers, including state vice-president Raju Banerjee, were injured in the clash.Party workers also set tyres on fire as a mark of protest. Leaders like Arjun Singh, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Locket Chatterjee, newly-appointed BJYM president Tejasvi Surya and Mukul Roy were among those present on the spot.Incidentally, West Bengal’s ruling TMC too organised a women’s rally at Jadavpur in Kolkata on Thursday where the number of participants was substantially more than 100. The objective of this rally was to seek justice for the Hathras victim.When asked, TMC leader Chandrima Banerjee, who was leading the women’s rally, said that the difference between the TMC rally and the BJP march was that the one organised by them was “peaceful” while the one by the BJP was “violent”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-march-to-west-bengal-secretariat-turns-violent-152822

China will be wiped out in 15 minutes. I bow to that teacher who has taught him.

08-10-2020||New Delhi||Same sex couple moves Delhi High Court for getting married under Special Marriage Act||A same sex couple has moved the Delhi High Court seeking they be allowed to get married under the Special Marriage Act saying they have been living together as a couple for 8 years, in love with each other sharing the highs and lows of life, but unable marry as they are both women.A similar plea has been moved by two men, who got married in the United States, but their marriage was not registered under the Foreign Marriage Act of 1969 by the Indian consulate as they were a same sex couple.Both the petitions came up for hearing before Justice Navin Chawla who directed the registry to list them before the bench of the Chief Justice of the High Court which is already hearing a PIL seeking a declaration that same sex marriages be recognised under the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) and Special Marriage Act (SMA).The petitioners are being represented by senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy and advocates Arundhati Katju, Govind Manoharan and Surabhi Dhar.The two women, aged 47 years and 36 years have said that simple things—like opening a joint bank account, buying family health insurance, or securing address proof—which a married couple takes for granted are a struggle for them."Marriage is not just a relationship between two individuals – it brings two families together. But it is also a bundle of rights. Without marriage, the petitioners are strangers in law. Article 21 of the Constitution of India protects the right to marry a person of one's choice and this right applies with full force to same-sex couples, just as it does to opposite-sex couples," they have contended in their plea.The women are part of the team that built north India's leading clinic specializing in mental health and learning disabilities for children and young adults.They have sought that the SMA be declared as unconstitutional to the extent that it does not allow solemnisation of marriage between same sex couples.They have also urged the court to declare that the SMA ought to apply to all couples regardless of their gender identity and sexual orientation and also issue a direction to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate Kalkaji, who is also the Marriage Officer of South East District of Delhi to register their marriage under the Act.The two men, in their plea, have contended that Indian consulate at New York refused their application for registration on the ground of their sexual orientation alone.  "The Indian consulate would have registered the marriage of any similarly placed opposite sex couple," they have contended.The couple, who were in a relationship since 2012 and got married in 2017, have also claimed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, non recognition of their marriage by the laws here continues to disentitle them to travel as a married couple to India and spend time with their families.They have contended that the consulate's decision has violated their rights under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 which the Supreme Court, in Navtej Singh Johar case, had held was guaranteed to LGBT and non-LGBT Indians with equal force. "Further, the Foreign Marriage Act (FMA) ought to be read to apply to same-sex marriages and is unconstitutional to the extent it does not do so," their petition has said.They have also said that "nonrecognition of same-sex marriages is a wanton act of discrimination that strikes at the root of dignity and self-fulfilment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ)couples".

This is the first time the Congress letter writers have issued any joint statement, independent of party platforms, on government policy.These (technology transfer) provisions have been an integral part of the Defence acquisition policy, they said to the government, adding: “We demand that the Government review and reverse these defence sector decisions and policy changes in national interest.” The statement describes proposed privatisation of the 41 Ordnance Factories, changes in the FDI Policy and dilution of the Defence Offsets Policy, including dispensing with the condition of Transfer of Technology in acquisition of weapons and equipment for the armed forces, as “deeply disturbing”, saying the decisions “compromise national security interests and will have long term implications for India’s defence preparedness and in becoming a self-reliant nation”.“These decisions are also in conflict with the Government’s Make in India campaign,” they noted mentioning how 70,000 employees of all 41 Ordnance Factories across India are on a month-long strike in protest against “Corporatisation” of the Ordnance Factory Board.The Congress leaders cited the “failed” example of Privatisation of Royal Ordnance Factories in Britain and said, “This comparison is relevant considering the fact that the Indian Ordnance Factories originate and are successors of the Royal Ordnance Factories.”The signatories to the statement said the 1984 UK Government’s decision to make ROFs an independent commercial organisation triggered an intense debate in British Parliament.“The Government justified that the decision just as the logic has been put forward by the Ministry of Defence and the Finance Ministry as regarding the corporatisation of OFB in India,” the Congress group said.They said the OFB is accountable to the people through Parliament and also CAG.The Government’s must explain in what way the OFB has failed in transparency and accountability in a democratic system with check and balances, they noted, adding that handing over these factories and assets to private sector is bereft of justification and against India’s national interest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/6-cong-letter-signatories-to-govt-review-move-to-privatise-ordnance-factories-152811

However, the airlines were allowed to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights at that time.“Our internal thinking is that we will watch it for another week or 10 days....If the figures (of passengers travelling) continue to be healthy, we would open domestic civil aviation to 75 per cent of the pre-COVID levels,” Puri said at a press conference on Thursday.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country since March 23 due to the pandemic.However, special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral air bubble pacts signed with various countries since July. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/airlines-may-soon-be-permitted-to-operate-75-pc-of-pre-covid-domestic-flights-puri-152806

Nobody will be spared and stringent action will be taken," Singh warned.Hitting back at the Mumbai Police, Republic TV's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami said it was an attempt to target the channel for its coverage of the Maharashtra government.Threatening to slap a criminal defamation case against Singh, he accused the police chief of making "false allegations" against the Republic TV because the channel had questioned him in the investigations of the Sushant Singh Rajput case.Addressing the media, Singh said that following a complaint, one person working for Hansa Research Group Pvt. Ltd., a company which is part of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) was arrested from Malad.He along with another person are accused of misusing confidential data that was entrusted with them for "wrongful gains by various TV channels" which in turn led to losses to advertisers and advertising agencies."Preliminary probe revealed that they manipulated the sampling metering services by inducing the barometer users and paying them periodically to watch particular TV channel/s," Singh said.Some of the people in whose homes these barometers have been installed have confessed that they were paid Rs.500 for keeping their TV sets switched on even if they didn't actually watch.The Kandivali Police Station has registered a case, arrested the two accused persons before a Magistrate Court which has remanded them to police custody till October 9."Param Bir Singh's investigation in the Sushant Singh Rajput case is under a cloud and this is a desperate measure because of Republic TV's reportage on Palghar, the Sushant Singh Rajput case or any other case. This kind of targeting only strengthens the resolve of everyone at Republic TV to push for the truth even harder," Goswami added."Param Bir Singh stands completely exposed today since BARC has not mentioned Republic in any single complaint. He should issue an official apology and get ready to face us in court," said the channel.Republic Media Network's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami's statement pic.twitter.com/axhbJZ47eA  A high-level team led by Joint Police Commissioner Milind Bharambe, DCP Nandkumar Thakur and DCP Akbar Pathan, along with other officers are investigating the matter.An official said that several teams have fanned out across India to nab some other absconders in the matter.The police have said that certain witnesses have come forward confessing that they were given monthly monetary inducements by the accused in the matter.

We are all for foreign carriers operating here. Make no mistake. But I think the time has come for the message to go out loud and clear that it will not be done at the expense of the Indian carriers." "Under the regulated (air bubble) arrangements, we are not insisting on total parity. Even near parity will do," the minister added.After the aforementioned Directorate General of Civil Aviation's (DGCA)decision that led to cancellation of Lufthansa's flights, Air India was forced to cancel all Frankfurt flights till October 14 as Germany withdrew permission for them.Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic.However, special international flights have been allowed since July under the bilateral air bubble pacts formed by India with around 16 countries, including Germany.Puri said, "There is an opportunity in India for all foreign economic entities. But equally, where the commercial advantage is concerned, we also expect our carriers - when they go there (to those countries) - to also get those facilities." In September, Lufthansa was operating around 20 flights per week to India while Air India was operating around three flights per week to Germany."If the (air bubble) arrangement is being carried out only for sixth freedom right, then obviously we would want parity because we have direct flights between us and the US and between us and Canada. And we would like the US and the Canadian carrier (to operate). So, there is no difficulty in negotiation either," Puri mentioned.Sixth freedom right allows an airline to fly passengers from one country to the hub airport in its home country, and then put those passengers on a connecting flight to a third country.A significant number of Indians use European carriers like Lufthansa or Gulf carriers like Emirates to go to the US or Canada.The DGCA told Lufthansa a few weeks back to not carry any sixth freedom passengers on its India-Germany flights.An airline operating flights under an air bubble pact cannot carry sixth freedom passengers from India, as per the DGCA.Aviation Secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola said at the press conference that India and Germany are in talks on how to re-establish the air bubble arrangement between the two countries."We had the first round of talks with Germany on Tuesday. They were held in a congenial atmosphere and they were very constructive talks. They put forth their viewpoint and we put our viewpoint. We are going to meet them in a day or two once again and the air bubble arrangement will be finalised with Germany," Kharola said.

08-10-2020||New Delhi||Sushant Singh Rajput's family questions 'faulty' report; writes to CBI on ‘unprofessional conduct’ of AIIMS doctor||A week after the AIIMS-Delhi submitted its report to the CBI in Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death case to rule out murder, the legal team of Sushant's family has written to CBI Director Rishi Kumar Shukla to claim that the medico-legal report by the AIIMS medical board was "faulty".In the letter, the legal team represented by Varun Singh said: "I have been reading in the media about the forensic report submitted by the AIIMS to the CBI with regard to the opinion expressed by the agency in the matter of Sushant Singh Rajput's death on June 14. I have also seen some doctors on the AIIMS team come on TV and make statements with regard to the forensic examination done by the team."The letter said that despite several efforts to get a copy of the report, there was no response from AIIMS board head Dr Sudhir Gupta."I am accordingly writing this letter on the premise that the news report regarding the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) opinion is correct.""The leaked report, if correct, amounts to drawing a biased and boastful conclusion from insufficient evidence," the legal team said.Raising questions, the letter said that AIIMS was not to do a post-mortem but only to express its opinion on an autopsy report submitted by Mumbai's Cooper Hospital as the AIIMS did not get to examine Sushant's body and thus form a firsthand opinion about the cause of death."Dr Sudhir Gupta has been giving media interviews about the sensitive case right from Day One, questioning Cooper Hospital doctors for the 'dubious' autopsy and Maharashtra Police for a hurried post-mortem and contamination and non-preservation of the scene of crime," the letter added.The letter also pointed to various other infirmities like the post-mortem done at the Mumbai hospital in the night without any Magistrate's order for such an exercise, no videotaping of autopsy, and non-preservation of sufficient viscera for future examination.In the letter, the legal team said that Cooper Hospital doctors' post-mortem report did not mention injuries on the body and thus no opinion on the cause of such injuries. "The protocol necessary to be observed in such post-mortems was not followed, as opined by several forensic experts from all over the world," the legal team observed."There were several other infirmities that could be pointed out by a genuine forensic examination but, somehow, the same were left out by the AIIMS team, as expressed by one of the doctors in his interview telecast by a TV channel," the letter read.The legal team also raised questions on the conduct of Dr Sudhir Gupta."The conduct of Dr Gupta is unethical, unprofessional, and in contravention of government service conduct rules and MCI guidelines. This criminal misadventure on his part has undermined the public trust in a premier institution like AIIMS." "It has created doubts in the minds of millions of people about the fairness of investigation," it further added.The legal team asserted that the AIIMS report, if at all, could have only specified the cause of death, that is, by hanging and could not have gone on to say that it was a case of suicide because that is something which only the CBI can decide after complete investigation."The CBI may also inquire into the circumstances that led Dr Gupta to indulge in such unprofessional conduct that threatens to jeopardise the course of investigation and help wrong-doers escape the clutches of law. It is requested only such medical report that is true appraisal of available evidence is relied upon and not the present one that patently seems to be a fictional concoction to help the culprits," said the legal team.The AIIMS panel report questioned the absence of timing of death in the Cooper Hospital's autopsy report and pointed towards dimly-lit post-mortem room at the Mumbai hospital, sources said, adding that poisoning angle too was ruled out.Sushant's autopsy was done by three Cooper Hospital doctors on June 14 night.The CBI officials have remained tight-lipped on the AIIMS report.Dr Gupta, meanwhile, in a statement said that the AIIMS Medical Board has expressed very clearly and conclusively its final medico-legal opinion in this case.He said that the contents of the opinion shared with the CBI cannot be shared with anyone as the matter is sub judice.A team of AIIMS Forensic Department was roped in by the CBI to give its medico-legal opinion into the death of Sushant.

That's what we are aware of. And, some numbers will be left beyond that,” said Abdullah Abdullah, Chairman of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation, while clearly indicating that Trump’s announcement has caught all stakeholders by surprise.Earlier in the day, Abdullah Abdullah met Prime Minister Narendra Modi who reaffirmed India’s long term commitment to further deepening the historical ties between India and Afghanistan.The two leaders discussed issues of bilateral and regional interest. Dr Abdullah Abdullah briefed the Prime Minster on the Afghan peace process and the ongoing talks in Doha.The Afghan leader admitted that the peace process was going much slower than envisaged but said patience for a long haul was needed because this was the first time that people who had been on the battlefield against each other for 30 years were sitting across the table.PM Modi also reiterated India's commitment towards sustainable peace in Afghanistan and welcomed efforts towards a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire.On Wednesday, NSA Ajit Doval called on Abdullah and discussed the increased levels of violence across Afghanistan and peace and security in the region.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will call on Abdullah on Friday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-offers-kabul-full-support-in-peace-talks-152777

08-10-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 positivity rate in 22 states, UTs less than national average; cumulative rate stands at 8.19 pc||Thirty-five states and Union Territories in the country are performing more than 140 COVID-19 tests per day per million population while 22 states and UTs have COVID-19 positivity rate less than the national average, the Health Ministry said on Thursday.The cumulative positivity rate stood at 8.19 per cent, it said.The national average of COVID-19 tests per day per million population was 865, the Ministry said, asserting that the country had demonstrated an exponential increase in the COVID-19 testing infrastructure since January 2020.“As evidence has revealed, a higher number of testing on a sustained basis has aided in bringing down the positivity rate. The sharp decline in national cumulative positivity rate has demonstrated that the rate of spread of infection is being contained,” the Ministry underlined.The country’s testing capacities have multiplied manifolds. More than 15 lakh samples can be tested every day, it said.“India has performed remarkably on fulfilling the WHO’s advice of 140 tests per day per million population,” the Health Ministry underscored.In its Guidance Note on ‘Public Health Criteria to Adjust Public Health and Social Measures in the Context of COVID-19’, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised this strategy for comprehensive surveillance for suspected cases.“A total of 35 states and UTs have exceeded the advised number of tests. The national average of tests per day per million population stands at 865,” the Ministry said.With 11,94,321 tests conducted for detection of COVID-19 in a span of 24 hours, the cumulative tests in India have crossed 8.34 crore. Higher testing across wide regions leads to early identification of positive cases, prompt tracking through efficient surveillance and tracing, and timely and effective treatment in homes/facilities and in hospitals for the severe cases, the Ministry noted.These measures in tandem eventually lead to lower mortality rate, it said. Seven states and Union Territories (UTs) have reported a positivity rate of less than 5 per cent. This was a result of the successful ‘test, track, trace, treat and technology’ strategy of the central government effectively followed by states and UTs, it said.“The cumulative COVID-19 positivity rate is 8.19 per cent and is on a continuous decline,” the Ministry said. Maintaining the spree of registering more recoveries than the new confirmed cases, 83,011 recoveries were registered in a span of 24 hours as against 78,524 new confirmed cases.A total of 58,27,704 people have recuperated from coronavirus infection, pushing the recovery rate to 85.25 per cent. The recoveries exceed the active cases of COVID-19 by 49,25,279, it said.“The active cases are less than 10 lakh for the 17th day in a row,” the Ministry said.Presently, the active cases comprise merely 13.20 per cent of the total positive cases of the country standing at 9,02,425, according to the Ministry data updated at 8 am on Thursday.“Seventy-five per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and UTs. Maharashtra alone has contributed the maximum with more than 16,000 single-day recoveries,” the Ministry said.It said 79 per cent of the 78,524 new cases recorded in a span of 24 hours are from 10 states and UTs. Maharashtra continues to be the state reporting a very high number of new cases with more than 14,000 cases followed by Karnataka with nearly 11,000 cases.Also, 971 case fatalities due to COVID-19 have been reported in a span of 24 hours. Of these, nearly 82 per cent are concentrated in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.More than 36 per cent of new fatalities are reported from Maharashtra (355 deaths). India’s COVID-19 caseload mounted to 68,35,655 with 78,524 infections being reported in a day, while the death toll climbed to 1,05,526 with 971 people succumbing to the disease in a span of 24 hours, the Ministry data updated at 8 am on Thursday showed.

08-10-2020||New Delhi||Tablighi case: Freedom of speech, expression most abused right in recent times, says SC||Freedom of speech and expression is the “most abused right” in recent times, the Supreme Court has said on Thursday and pulled up the Centre for its “evasive” and “brazen” affidavit on media coverage of the Tablighi Jamaat event earlier this year.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, which was hearing pleas of Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind and others alleging that a section of media was spreading communal hatred over Tablighi Jamaat congregation during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic.“Freedom of speech and expression is the most abused right in recent times,” the Apex Court said.The bench observed this when senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for Jamaat, said the Centre in its affidavit has stated that petitioners are trying to muzzle freedom of speech and expression.To this, the bench said: “They are free to make any averment in their affidavit like you are free to make any argument you want.”The bench was irked over the fact that instead of secretary of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry, an additional secretary filed the affidavit which contained “unnecessary” and “non-sensical” averments with regard to media reporting in Tablighi Jamaat issue.“You cannot treat this court the way you are doing in this case,” said the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.The Apex Court sought an affidavit from the Information and Broadcasting Secretary with details of the steps taken in the past to stop motivated media reporting in such cases.The bench has posted the matter for hearing after two weeks.During the hearing conducted through video-conferencing, the bench said it had examined the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, and section 20 of it deals with the power to prohibit the operation of a cable television network in the public interest.“We want to tell you something, this power is exercisable to the TV programme but not broadcast signal. This Act does not help. The Centre has filed an affidavit in which it has said an advisory has been issued,” the bench observed.Dave referred to the power under the Cable Television Act and said many a time, the government had rightly exercised its power. The bench told Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta that affidavit had been filed by the additional secretary and he had not addressed the allegations.“This is nonsensical averment made,” it said: adding, “This is an evasive kind of affidavit.”In August, the Centre had told the Apex Court that a Muslim body’s attempt to obtain a blanket “gag order” on the entire media to prevent them from reporting Markaz Nizamuddin issue would effectively destroy the freedom of the citizenry to know and the right of journalists to ensure an informed society.The government had said that in the absence of any specific information about any objectionable news published or aired by a specific news channel or agency, the Constitution and the applicable statutes did not give it any authority to unilaterally pass any censure order under the Cable Television Networks Rules.In its affidavit filed in reply to the plea of Jamiat, the Centre had said: “Attempts to seek a blanket ‘gag order’ against the entire media in respect of Markaz Nizamuddin issue will effectively destroy the freedom of the citizen to know about the affairs of respective sections of the society in the nation and the right of the journalist to ensure an informed society.”The Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind has filed a plea in the Apex Court seeking directions to the Centre to stop the dissemination of “fake news” related to a religious gathering at Markaz Nizamuddin and take strict action against those responsible for it.It has alleged that the unfortunate incident of Tablighi Jamaat was being used to “demonise” and blame the entire Muslim community and sought to restrain the media from publishing and airing such reports.The Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Markaz Nizamuddin in central Delhi in March was accused of accelerating the spread of the novel coronavirus, with its attendees allegedly carrying the infection to different parts of the country.

The dynamic, impact-based cyclone warning will be commissioned from this season”, he added.Until now, the IMD gave warnings about the kind of damage expected during a cyclone.Earlier, at a pre-cyclone meeting to review preparedness, take stock of requirements, plan for the cyclone season October-December, 2020 and share new initiatives by the IMD with stake holders, Mohapatra said that during ensuing cyclone season, IMD would start interactive display system to forecast cyclone track and intensity on the GIS platform.Storms during October to December, especially in the Bay of Bengal, ravage the eastern coast and damage property. Pre and post-monsoon months form the cyclone season in the country.The IMD has achieved significant improvement in track, landfall, intensity and adverse weather, including heavy rainfall, strong wind and storm surge forecast.Cyclones are multi-hazardous in nature and thus they cause heavy rain, strong winds and storm surge over the affected region simultaneously and in its wake the associated property loss can be huge.This can be in the form of damage to houses and roads, farms and agriculture lands, public infrastructure, and power and telecommunication lines, adding to the overall economic burden for the affected families, local administrations and state governments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imd-reviews-cyclone-preparedness-to-release-impact-based-warnings-this-season-152771

08-10-2020||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||‘Baba ka Dhaba’: 80-year-old couple's food stall revives as social media takes charge||It has been 30 long years since this elderly couple was selling home-cooked meals, earning only enough for the next day’s preparation. But coronavirus changed everything for them and their life, which was once happy and calm.It then became a battle for survival for them.On Thursday, though, everything changed for the 80-year-old and his family that was on the brink of penury. Social media spun its magic with a video of Prasad tearfully recounting the desperation of the months since the lockdown being shared widely across platforms – and, hey presto, customers made a beeline to eat his food as did camera crews, bloggers and journalists.Baba ka Dhaba, a little blue box in Malviya Nagar in south Delhi, was the cynosure of many eyes across the country, including celebs from showbiz who posted appeals asking people to go there and get themselves a meal.A day after the heartbreaking video, #Babakadhaba was trending on Twitter and the food joint was flooded with more customers than it had seen in 30 years of being in business.“Like everyday, my parents started cooking at 6 am. When they reached the shop at 8.30 am, they found people were already lined up outside.“For the first few hours, we sold only parathas and then prepared more items,” said Azad Hind, Prasad's 37-year-old son.By 12 noon, all items on the menu, comprising chapati, rice, mixed vegetable, and paneer, all ranging between Rs 10-50, were sold out – much to their surprise and stupefaction. Like many other businesses — big and small—Prasad's food stall that he has been running with his wife since the early 1990s hit its nadir during the lockdown and in the weeks that followed. The elderly couple barely made enough to make ends meet and their food was mostly unsold at the end of the day.Their despair came to light when Instagram influencer Gaurav Wasan on Wednesday captured Prasad breaking down as he talked about his struggles in a video shared on his social media account. Overnight, the post spiralled into a movement to help the elderly couple, whose plight struck a chord of empathy in distant corners of the country.Life had become increasingly difficult for the family also because their son Azad lost his job as an office boy.“The earning from the shop was the only way to feed ourselves,” Azad said.Besides Prasad and his wife, the family comprises their three children, two grandchildren and a daughter-in-law.Before Covid-19 took its toll on businesses countrywide, Prasad would make enough to save Rs.4,000-Rs.5000 almost every month. It all dried up in the months since March when India went into lockdown.There were days, Prasad said, when not a single customer turned up.“We realised there was no point in sitting at home, so we opened our shop everyday. Some days we would have a couple of customers, so whatever money we could make was important. Sometimes we didn't even manage to cover the cost of preparing the food,” Prasad, who lives with his family in Jagdamba camp in Sheikh Sarai, said.Today, people not only helped in buying his food but also with rations, he said.Wasan, who posted the video through his Instagram handle @youtubeswadofficial, said he is always on the lookout for lesser known food joints around the city but never did he imagine his post would lead to so much traction.“I am so glad I decided to take the first step to help them. I realised that they made good food…the only thing missing was marketing, and I thought I could use my followers to do that. “With the kind of support this has created, I will continue to focus on other food joints which need help in this time,” Wasan, who has over 1,15,000 followers on Instagram, said. AAP party MLA Somnath Bharti was an early visitor at Baba ka Dhaba. “Visited ‘Baba Ka Dhaba' n hv done d needful to bring SMILE on their faces as promised. Will take care of them n I am starting a drive 2 take care of similarly placed people,” he tweeted.Actors such as Suniel Shetty, Randeep Hooda and Raveena Tandon, retweeted Wasan's video, asking people to support the couple and other local vendors in need during the challenging times of Covid-19 pandemic."Do visit if you are in Delhi! Block B, Shivalik Colony, Opposite Hanuman Mandir, Malviya Nagar, South Delhi. #SupportLocal #BabaKaDhaba," tweeted Hooda."#dilliwalon #dil #dikhao. Whoever eats here, sends me pic, I shall put up a sweet message with your pics ! #supportlocalbusiness #localvendors," posted Tandon."Let's help  put their smile back ... our neighbourhood vendors need our  help to." tweeted Shetty.   Cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin expressed his desire to help.“I am not able to message you, but is there a way I can help that man?? I would like to contribute,” he wrote.Sharing a video of Prasad, satirist Akash Banerjee urged his followers on social media to “stop by” at the food kiosk.The overwhelming support was a ray of hope for other small-scale shopkeepers and hawkers in the vicinity.Raj Rani, a 70-year-old widow who sells towels and handkerchiefs on a pavement in the Malviya Nagar market, said she has barely been making Rs 60 a day. “I have no family…my husband died 20 years ago, and since then I have been running this shop. Earlier I used to still earn enough to support myself, but now there is nothing. Can someone help me?” the Begumpura resident said.Yes, they can. — With PTI Watch the video:This video completely broke my heart.

China occupies the third position. The annual report ranks the world’s biggest emitters of sulphur dioxide,” the report said.As per the report, the biggest emission hotspots in India are thermal power stations (or clusters of power stations) at Singrauli, Neyveli, Sipat, Mundra, Korba, Bonda, Tamnar, Talcher, Jharsuguda, Kutch, Surat, Chennai, Ramagundam, Chandrapur, Visakhapatnam and Koradi.“While credit needs to be given to India for making ambitious strides in renewable energy, contrarily concern arises from the consistent support given to coal-based energy generation,” it said.The report said India had been faring reasonably well in its clean energy transition and had set itself one of the world’s most ambitious renewable energy targets but lack of FGD units in most power plants overshadows it.“Renewable energy capacity has been increasing in India’s power sector, delivering more than two-thirds of the subcontinent’s new capacity additions during the FY 2019-20. However, these efforts are overshadowed by the fact that most of the power plants in India lack flue-gas desulfurisation (FGD) units. The FGD units are critical in the process of reducing emissions,” it said.Avinash Chanchal, Climate Campaigner, Greenpeace India, said renewable energy capacity may have expanded but the air quality is far from safe.“In India, we are getting a glimpse of how reduction in coal usage can impact air quality and health. In 2019, renewable energy capacity expanded, coal dependency decreased and we saw a corresponding improvement in air quality. But our air is still far from safe. We must speed up the energy transition away from coal and towards renewables, for our health and economy. While ensuring just transition of energy, with the help of decentralized renewable sources, we need to prioritize access to electricity for the poor,” Chanchal said.In 2015, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change introduced SO2 emission limits for coal power stations. But power plants missed the initial deadline of December 2017 for the installation of FGD units, the report said.“Though the deadline was extended till 2022, as of June 2020 most of the power plants are operating without compliance to standards. Five years after setting the SO2 emission limits, the Indian government has decided to shut down non-compliant thermal power stations and has also allocated Rs 4,400 crore to tackle the air pollution crisis,” it said.Sunil Dahiya, Analyst, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said, SO2 emissions are affecting the health of millions of people directly and worse through converting to PM2.5.“The most efficient and easiest way to reduce PM2.5 levels is to install FGD and reduce SO2 emissions from power plants as they form a significant fraction of total PM2.5 pollution at different locations across the country. Every single day delay in implementation of prescribed norms and not installing the FGD system is causing huge health and economic damage to our society, it’s time the offenders or non-complying power plants are pulled up for inaction and damage to the society to ensure better implementation moving ahead,” he said.It’s high time that governments reduce investments in fossil fuels and shift to safer energy sources, such as wind and solar, the report said, adding that they must also strengthen emission standards and effectively implement flue gas pollution control technology on coal-fired power plants, smelters, and other major industrial SO2 emitters.In August last year, a study by Greenpeace had claimed that India is the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide, which is produced from coal burning, and greatly contributes to air pollution.Greenpeace India has released an analysis of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) data, saying India has more than 15 per cent of all anthropogenic sulphur dioxide (SO2) hotspots in the world detected by the OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite.

08-10-2020||New Delhi||Remote work make Indian workers feel lonely, stressed: LinkedIn||Two in five professionals in India are experiencing increased stress or anxiety due to the pandemic while one in three professionals believe remote working is slowing career progression, making them feel more lonely and harming work-life balance, a new LinkedIn survey revealed on Thursday.The findings showed that only one in four (23 per cent) professionals in the country were being offered emotional well-being initiatives and flexible work hours by their employers in the early months of the lockdown."The ongoing stress around the 3 Rs -- remote work, return to work, and risk of exposure -- are adversely impacting the mental health of Indian professionals. Companies in India are beginning to bolster their mental health programmes to support their employees in such times," said Ashutosh Gupta, India Country Manager, Linkedin.The economic repercussions of the ongoing pandemic have made Indian professionals vulnerable to job uncertainty, financial instability, and bleak company outlook, while continuing to work remotely in social isolation.The fortnightly LinkedIn 'Workforce Confidence Index' highlighted the need for stronger employer support in these times of distress.The findings reflect that 51 per cent of the Indian workforce is working remotely due to Covid-19, and continues to question the effectiveness of remote work as professionals experience increased stress and anxiety."While 60 per cent of Indian professionals had felt lonely at some point while working remotely, 37 per cent still feel lonely doing it now".The findings also showed that only one in five (21 per cent) professionals were getting more time off through paid or unpaid leaves, while 42 per cent think their companies will not continue to do so after the pandemic."Today, as industries attempt to bounce back, close to 40 per cent of Indian professionals continue to experience financial instability, signalling towards high levels of financial stress and uncertainty prevalent among India's workforce," the survey pointed out.The pandemic has taken a toll on working parents, especially working mothers, as findings show that around one in three working mothers in India are currently providing childcare full time (28 per cent), and working outside their business hours to provide childcare (33 per cent).As India begins to return to work, 50 per cent of professionals still express concerns about the risk of exposure to those who don't take safety precautions seriously."More than one in three professionals are also worried about workplace sanitation, exposure to large groups of people in meetings or in public and uncertain workplace safety guidelines," revealed the survey based on the online responses of 16,199 professionals in the country over the past six months.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/remote-work-make-indian-workers-feel-lonely-stressed-linkedin-152754

The truck was loaded with cosmetics valued at Rs 24.55 lakh. A man, Vikram Chakravarty of the Naujalha village, was also arrested for smuggling.A large number of Nepalese citizens assembled on the border, ostensibly, to protest against waterlogging on the no man’s land between border pillar number 17 and 18 due to a rupture in the irrigation pipeline at Bandarbojh village.Matters escalated to a point that civilian police force had to be called in to control the situation.The SSB officers believe that the border checks along with waterlogging had annoyed some Nepalese residents as this was the route taken by bikers to smuggle goods into India. It has now become slippery and unsafe for travel.The villagers also claimed that some Nepalese residents snatched the mobile phones of two SSB jawans in the presence of the civilian police to prevent them from video-recording the uproarious scene on the border. However, the SSB did not confirm the incident. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tension-at-nepal-border-ssb-jawans-manhandled-152743

The body was buried by her family members on the outskirts of their village, located around 250 km from here, the official said.The police claimed the incident was not reported to them at that time and it came to light on Wednesday when some local media published it.The victim's uncle, however, claimed he had informed the police about it, but no action was taken.The police have now detained three persons and registered a case of gang-rape, the official said.The government has formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) for a probe into the incident, an official statement said on Wednesday.Talking to PTI, Inspector General of Police (Bastar range) Sundarraj P said after getting information about the incident in a village under Dhanora police station limits, Kondagaon Superintendent of Police and other officials rushed there on Wednesday.As per the statement of her family members, on July 19, the girl, who was aged around 17, went to attend a wedding along with them in nearby Kanagaon village, he said."On the same night at around 11 pm, two boys from Kanagaon allegedly dragged her to a nearby forest, where she was sexually assaulted by five others," he said.Next morning, the victim returned home without informing anyone and committed suicide by hanging herself, the official said."Unaware of the incident of sexual assault, the family members performed the last rites and buried the body on the outskirts of their village," he said."The body was exhumed from the grave for post-mortem in the presence of a police team and tehsildar on Wednesday. A case of gang-rape was registered and three accused have been detained," he said.Meanwhile, the girl's uncle told reporters that after the girl committed suicide, two boys from the locality had told him that his niece was sexually assaulted by some men in Kanagaon.Just two days after that, Dhanora station house officer (SHO) had called him to the police station and asked why he did not report the matter to the police, he claimed.He alleged that the SHO had also assured to lodge a case, but no further action was taken.However, the IG said after the girl's suicide, a police team had gone to the village and asked her family members to report the matter if they get any clue about the reason for her extreme step."We learnt that the family was later told about the rape incident by one of the friends of the victim, but they did not approach the police," he claimed.Recently, the girl's father also attempted suicide by consuming poison, but he was saved after he got timely medical treatment. The exact reason behind his suicide attempt was not known, the official said.Meanwhile, the opposition BJP strongly condemned the incident and accused the ruling Congress of failing to protect women in the state."Daughters in Chhattisgarh are not safe right from Balrampur to Bastar. What kind of new Chhattisgarh is this government planning to create?" Leader of Opposition Dharamlal Kaushik said in a tweet in Hindi."This insensitive government does not have consoling words to speak on such horror happening with daughters of the state," he added while demanding immediate arrest of the accused in the case.

According to sources, no evidence was given by Pakistan in its case to get the individuals listed. Similarly, an earlier attempt by Pakistan to list Mistry and Dongara was blocked by the Council around June/July."We believe that UN Security Council continues to be an effective forum for the maintenance of international peace and security and combating terrorism."However, it should also be ensured that the forum is not misused by countries with retaliatory intent to name innocent civilians as terrorist without credible evidence by invoking non-transparent working methods and procedures,” First Secretary and Legal Adviser in India's Permanent Mission to the UN Yedla Umasankar said on Tuesday at the 6th Committee of the UN General Assembly on 'Measures to eliminate international terrorism'.Without naming Pakistan, he said, “India has been and continues to be a victim of terrorism sponsored across our borders. We have had firsthand experience of the cruel link between transnational organised crime and terrorism."Umashankar said India condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and no cause whatsoever or grievance can justify terrorism, including state-sponsored cross-border terrorism."Our fight against terrorism should not only seek to eliminate terrorists and disrupt terror organisations/networks, but should also identify/hold accountable and take strong measures against states that encourage, support and finance terrorism, provide sanctuary to terrorists and terror groups," he said.Umasankar said the fight against terrorism has to be unrelenting and across all fronts and the flow of resources to terror linked entities needs to be completely stopped by collective inter-state efforts.“The international community cannot and should not be selective in dealing with the terrorists groups or in dismantling terror infrastructure. India strongly condemns direct or indirect financial assistance provided by some states to terrorist groups and/or individuals members thereof,” he said.

The three remaining rallies, starting from Hastings, C R Avenue (State BJP office) and Santragachi will be led, respectively, by BJP general secretary Kailash Vijaybargiya, state president Dilip Ghosh and state unit general secretary Sayantan Basu.Christened as 'Nabanna Chalo Abhiyan', the march is a state-level programme and a crucial show of strength by the BJP to build up momentum for the Assembly polls slated to be held in the state early next year.What may dampen the mood of the participants of the march is the announcement last night that the secretariat building, where the offices of the top state government functionaries including Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee are located, will remain closed on Thursday and Friday for sanitisation.“As per decision taken long back and as per standard periodic regular practices, Nabanna will be closed for sanitisation on Thursday(8.10.20) and Friday ( 9.10.20)”, an official communique from the state government announced.'Nabana' was last sanitised barely four days back. Ordinarily, another round of sanitisation is not required to be carried out again on Thursday.In a letter to BJYM state functionaries Prakash Das and Gobinda Roy, the state government also urged them to refrain from assembling near the secretariat building since IPC section 144 was in force in the area. The letter also pointed out that under the National Disaster Management Act promulgated by the central government, political gathering exceeding 100 people was prohibited.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, however, said that they would go ahead with the protest march in any case. He claimed that their programme had made the state government nervous and Nabanna had been shut down as a result.Police have erected barriers at the approaching roads to prevent the protesters from marching to the secretariat.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/empty-west-bengal-secretariat-to-greet-bjp-protesters-on-thursday-152734

The court said Rhea could not be said to have financed or harboured illicit drug trafficking as alleged by the Central agency.The court also observed that she did not have any criminal antecedents, and it was unlikely that she could affect the probe or tamper with evidence while out on bail.Rhea also can’t leave Mumbai without the NCB’s permission and without giving her itinerary for such travel to the Central agency.The HC said simply paying for a particular drug transaction does not qualify as financing (illicit drug traffic), as described under the Act. “The allegations against the applicant of spending money in procuring drugs for Sushant will not, therefore, mean that she had financed illicit traffic,” the court said.The court also dismissed the NCB’s argument that Rhea’s bail be rejected to send out a strong message to the society.“Everybody is equal before law. No celebrity or role model enjoys any special privilege before the court of law,” Justice Kotwal said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bombay-high-court-grants-bail-to-rhea-chakraborty-rejects-showik-chakrabortys-plea-152415

Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne referred to positivity as the main force behind the deliberations, which was at odds with what Pompeo had advocated. The other two participants, S Jaishankar and Toshimitsu Motegi, also kept off China from their addresses.A senior US State Department official, briefing the media, however said Pompeo was right in explicitly criticising China because of Beijing’s “sudden turn toward gross aggression in its entire periphery”. This included the conflict in the Himalayas where something that was handled according to unspoken or unwritten rules in the past has now turned to “people beating each other to death”.Another official said if China thought it was a great power, it should participate in arms control talks as well as use WTO in ways acceptable to everybody.The officials also played down China’s claim of assisting the WHO to fight the pandemic. While the US has put $20.5 billion towards a vaccine, China volunteered $2 billion in April, and “as far as I can tell, we haven’t seen any of that money”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-cites-plas-ladakh-coercion-for-pompeo-attacking-beijing-152435

The courts adjudicate the legality of the actions and are not meant to give shoulder to the administration to fire their guns from.”To emphasise the importance of right to peaceful protest, the Bench headed by Justice SK Kaul quoted Pulitzer Prize winner Walter Lippmann, who said: “In a democracy, the opposition is not only tolerated as constitutional, but must be maintained because it is indispensable.”However, it said, “While appreciating the existence of the right to peaceful protest, we have to make it unequivocally clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied in such a manner and that too indefinitely.”Rejecting the contention of the protesters against the CAA, the Bench said: “The present case is not about one of the protests taking place in an undesignated area, but about the blockage of a public way that caused inconvenience to commuters.” Delhi riots were plot to disturb peace: MosNew Delhi: Nityanand Rai, MoS (Home), claimed that the Delhi riots this year were a “big conspiracy” to disturb peace in the country but security forces like the RAF played a key role in “suppressing elements that spread anarchy”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-occupy-public-space-indefinitely-152559
