Kerala remains one of the top contributors in terms of daily cases and is accounting for more than half of the active Covid cases in the country at present, Bhushan said in the letter.“Despite efforts by the state government on increasing testing, the test confirmation percentage still remains very high (more than 15 per cent), signalling high and widespread transmission. All 14 districts in Kerala have been identified as districts of concern due to high test positivity rates and high case per million reported in the past four weeks,” he added.Further, Thrissur, Kozhikode and Ernakulam have reported more than 4,000 cases per million (10 lakh) population in the week ending August 25, the Union health secretary pointed out.Considering the recent sharp increase in the number of cases, deaths and the test positivity rate after the Onam festivities and the likelihood of this trend continuing for a few more days, he suggested certain measures.Bhushan said the Covid containment zones in the state need to be defined with a special focus on the high-transmission clusters.“Such zones need to be re-defined if the proportion of cases being reported outside of containment zones is showing an increase. Buffer zone around the containment zone needs to be identified clearly and passive surveillance needs to be enhanced to detect any spillover of cases from the containment zone,” he said.He said the contact-tracing efforts should further be scaled up to ensure that at least 20-25 contacts per positive case are identified and all contacts thus identified are put under quarantine.“The district administration needs to ensure strict compliance to MoHFW’s home isolation guidelines and ensure that there is intensive follow up of all such cases under home isolation. Enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour needs to be further intensified,” the Union health secretary said.He stressed on avoidance of mass gatherings and said it needs to be enforced by the district administration.On testing, he said the current positivity rate is high, mandating a further increase in the number of tests conducted to detect the infection, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“Targeted testing needs to be enhanced in containment zones and especially to cover high-risk contacts,” Bhushan said.He also said Kerala should ensure enhanced genomic surveillance in areas of high and sustained transmission.“Samples of all cases of vaccine breakthrough, infections and re-infections need to be sent for genome sequencing positively. Clinico-epidemiological assessment of all such cases needs to be done promptly. Results of such assessments need to be shared with the National Centre for Disease Control,” he said.The Union health secretary said while expanding the coverage of Covid-19 vaccination is required, it is reiterated that a state-specific strategy to complete the second-dose vaccination of the beneficiaries may be adopted.He said other measures such as a graded response action plan at the district level may be prepared and deployed in accordance with the MoHFW’s containment implementation framework for community containment or large containment areas and its advisory on graded restrictions or relaxation measures for Covid-19.“I would like to reiterate that any laxity in ensuring strict adherence to the five-fold strategy of ‘Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate and Ensuring Covid Appropriate Behaviour’ may result in further surge in Covid-19 transmission in Kerala and its neighbouring states,” the Union health secretary cautioned in the letter.

The attached immovable assets include a bungalow in Lonavala, three land parcels and three flats in Jalgaon district of Maharashtra, they added.Noting that the properties are in the name of the three accused in the case—Eknath Khadse, Mandakini Khadse and Girish Chaudhary, the officials said, the ED move came in connection with a Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) land deal case in Pune.Chaudhary was arrested by the ED last month and has been in judicial custody since. The ED has questioned Khadse twice so far, and has summoned his wife Mandakini Khadse several times, but she has so far not appeared before the agency citing health issues, officials said.Eknath Khadse was a minister in the previous Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra. Before he quit from the government in June 2016, he faced a series of charges including the allegation of the MIDC land scam.His critics pointed to a conflict of interest in the MIDC land deal as he was the revenue minister back then. Eknath Khadse quit the BJP in 2020 and joined the NCP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-5-73-crore-linked-to-ncp-leader-eknath-khadse-302880
27-08-2021||Mumbai||Decision on OBC quota in a week: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||All political parties have agreed to restore the reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in local governing bodies and a decision would be taken in a week's time, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Friday.He was speaking at an all-party meeting held on the issue at the Sahyadri Guest House of the state government here. Another meeting would be held next Friday, he said.The state government is trying to find a way to restore political reservation for OBCs in Maharashtra after the Supreme Court read down the earlier provision.“We all have agreed to reinstate the OBC quota in local governing bodies. The state government will study the suggestions made by various political parties. All of them have also opposed holding civic polls till the quota is reinstated," Thackeray was quoted as saying in an official release.“The next meeting will take place on next Friday (September 3) and we will take some decision by then," the chief minister added.BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis told reporters after the meeting that the state government should focus on compiling empirical data of OBC population as per the Supreme Court-mandated `triple test'."The Supreme Court has not struck down the OBC reservation, but only read down a provision. It means that if the Maharashtra government completes the triple-test procedure, political reservation can be restored. The state government should focus on it," the former chief minister said.A backward classes commission, one of the requirements of the triple-test, has already been set up, he said.Quantification can be done on the basis of sample and there is no need of an OBC census, Fadnavis added.In 2019, the then BJP-Shiv Sena government allotted political reservation to OBCs.But in March 2021, the Supreme Court read down section 12(2)(c) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 which had provided 27 per cent reservation to OBCs as it breached the 50 per cent ceiling on overall quota.Fadnavis also said that if the 50 per cent cap continued, OBCs will get 27-35 per cent reservation in 20 districts and 22-27 per cent in ten districts.The issue of five other districts was more tricky as the OBC population in these districts is small, he added."We need to take up the issue before a bench of nine judges, which will take five to seven years to give its verdict. We may need to pass a new act for the five districts to protect OBC reservation there," the BJP leader said. Incidentally, afterwards Fadnavis met chief minister Thackeray at the latter's chamber at the guest house for about 20 minutes.

27-08-2021||Mumbai||Sena linked to BJP by Hindutva, newcomers like Rane spoiled relations: Raut||The Shiv Sena and BJP are linked by the "bond of Hindutva" but newcomers like Narayan Rane spoiled the relations between the two parties, Sena leader Sanjay Raut said here on Friday.Veteran BJP leaders such as Devendra Fadnavis or Chandrakant Patil never used violent language about the Sena, and the two parties were together for 25 years before falling out in 2019, he added, while hitting out at Union minister Rane who joined the BJP in 2019.Earlier this week, Rane, a former Sena leader himself, sparked off a row with his remark about slapping Maharashtra Chief Minister and Sena president Uddhav Thackeray for what he claimed as the latter's ignorance of the year of India's independence.His remarks led to protests across the state and Rane was arrested on Tuesday before getting bail a few hours later."BJP and Shiv Sena had difference of opinion over some issues, but our relationship never turned bitter. The leaders who joined the BJP in the last few years have spoiled the relationship. Their notoriety is similar to that of Bangladeshi and Pakistani infiltrators who disturb our social harmony," Raut told reporters here."We (Sena and BJP) never attacked each other or had such a bitter relationship. The way Narayan Rane is acting, he is displaying animosity. What kind of person the BJP has appointed to improve our relationship," he added.The Shiv Sena was with the BJP for 25 years and the relations between Sena founder late Balasaheb Thackeray and Atal Bihari Vajpayee as well as LK Advani were cordial, Raut said."The relationship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Thackeray is also cordial," the Rajya Sabha member added.The Sena is connected with the BJP by the "bond of Hindutva", and the leaders who have been with the saffron party for a long time never talk about attacking the Sena Bhavan (Shiv Sena headquarters) or slapping Uddhav Thackeray, Raut said.“Be it Devendra Fadnavis, Chandrakant Patil, Ashish Shelar or Vinod Tawde—these BJP leaders will never use such language against Shiv Sena. The violent language is commonly used by leaders like Prasad Lad, Pravin Darekar and now Narayan Rane,” he said.“Those who joined it recently want the BJP and Sena to continue to fight. These people are the real threat to veteran BJP leaders,” Raut added.Asked about BJP Yuva Morcha deciding to write 75,000 letters to chief minister Thackeray over his alleged ignorance of the year of independence, Raut said, “Be is letter politics or gutter politics, you could not fight with us." Notably, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil had struck a conciliatory note about the Sena earlier this week when he said the two parties had fallen out and contested 2014 assembly elections separately but they did come together again.Rane was expelled from the Shiv Sena in July 2005. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sena-linked-to-bjp-by-hindutva-newcomers-like-rane-spoiled-relations-raut-302873

We have repeatedly said that this government is being run by big corporates. That is why they are not talking to us,” he said.Tikait also accused the government of selling off public sector enterprises.“But they say these are being given on lease. Will one day they give Parliament on lease too?” he posed.About the Centre’s decision to hike the minimum price that mills have to pay to sugarcane growers by Rs 5 per quintal, the BKU leader said they raised the price by 5 paise per kilogramme.The government will have to rescind the three farm laws and give a legal guarantee for minimum support price, Tikait said, adding the farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders will not return to their homes till their demands are met.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised that farmers’ income will double in 2022.“We will also publicize this and sell our produce at double rates from January 1, so the government makes arrangements accordingly,” Tikait said sarcastically.He also alleged that the Central government was bent upon systematically destroying the manner in which farmers grow different crops.“Under pressure from the sugar lobby, they will import sugar and destroy sugarcane growers. They will do the same to farmers growing pulses,” Tikait alleged.The BKU leader also dubbed the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Haryana Amendment) Bill, 2021, passed by the state assembly earlier this week as “anti-farmer”.

We have been to the area, we have interviewed people and we have found a shocking state of affairs. We have put it on record here,” Gonsalves submitted.The counsel for the Faridabad Municipal Corporation said the rehabilitation policy has since been finalised and it will be placed on record and a copy will also be shared with the petitioners. He said the policy has been finalised after considering the suggestions given by their counsel.Asking the state and the corporation to file their responses on the application, the Bench posted it for hearing next month.The corporation’s counsel told the Bench that they had already demolished around 10 farm houses and other unauthorised structures on the forest land in the area.The top court had on June 7 ordered the Haryana Government and the Faridabad Municipal Corporation to remove “all encroachments”, consisting around 10,000 residential constructions, in Aravali forest area near the village, saying “land grabbers cannot take refuge in rule of law and talk of fairness”Parikh referred to a report filed earlier by the Forest Department of Haryana before the National Green Tribunal and said a total of 123 properties are located on forest land."There are two ways of doing it. We start investigating on all factual matters right now or allow them (authorities) to complete the exercise, give compliance certificate and only thereafter go into the aspect which you are raising," the bench said, adding, ''They are prioritising the action".The Bench said it would look into all the aspects after the compliance report was filed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/khori-demolition-sc-asks-haryana-govt-to-respond-to-report-on-woeful-condition-of-those-removed-302868
27-08-2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat to move SC against HC stay on conversion law sections||Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel on Friday said the state government will move the Supreme Court against the High Court's last week order staying certain sections of the contentious law against religious conversion, including its "core" provision. Among other sections, which mainly deal with religious conversion through marriage, the Gujarat High Court had also stayed the operation of section 5, which according to the BJP government, is the "core" of the entire Act and a stay on it effectively stays the entire legislation.Some provisions of the Gujarat Freedom Of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, have been challenged in the high court."The Gujarat government brought this law, popularly known as anti-love jihad law, to save daughters from anti-social elements who try to trap these girls by lying about their income, lifestyle, and religion. Girls learn only after marriage that the man belongs to another religion and earns nothing," Patel told reporters here."Since some people have challenged the provisions of the new law, the High Court has recently put a stay on the law. However, after consulting legal experts and our Advocate General, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has decided to challenge this stay in the Supreme Court," Patel added.The 2021 law, which penalises forcible or fraudulent religious conversion through marriage, was notified by the BJP government on June 15 this year. The original Act was in force since 2003 and its amended version was passed in the Assembly in April.Last month, the Gujarat chapter of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind filed a petition in the high court claiming that some of the amended sections of the new law were unconstitutional.On August 19, the high court stayed sections 3, 4, 4A to 4C, 5, 6 and 6A of the amended Act pending further hearing, saying if an inter-faith marriage is done without any force, allurement, or fraudulent means, such marriages cannot be termed as "marriages for the purposes of unlawful conversion" as defined in these sections.While other sections deal with conversion through marriage, section 5 of the Act mandates that religious priests must take prior permission from the district magistrate for converting a person from one faith to another.Moreover, the one who got converted also needs to "send an intimation" to the district magistrate in a prescribed form. Non-adherence to these rules would attract up to one year of jail term.On Wednesday, Advocate General Kamal Trivedi had moved the high court to remove section 5 from the stay order.During a hearing on Thursday, Trivedi, on behalf of the state government, told a division bench that section 5 of the Act was there ever since the original law was enacted in 2003 and it has nothing to do with marriage per se.He tried to convince the judges that a stay on section 5 would actually stay the application of the entire law itself, and no one would approach the authorities for seeking permission before getting converted.However, the division bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav had turned down the state government's plea seeking modification of its August 19 order. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-to-move-sc-against-hc-stay-on-conversion-law-sections-302867

It claimed that Amitabh Thakur took money from Atul Rai for fabricating false evidence against the rape victim and maligned her image, inciting the woman to commit suicide.Lucknow Police Commissioner DK Thakur on Friday said the former IPS has been arrested in a case registered after the death of the rape victim.According to police sources, the case has been registered under section 120-B (conspiracy), 195-A (intimidation to produce false evidence), 218 (preparation of false record by public servant to save any person from punishment), 306 (abetment to suicide), 504 (breach of public peace) and 506 (intimidation) against MP Atul Rai and Amitabh Thakur on a complaint of senior sub-inspector Dayashankar Dwivedi in Hazratganj Kotwali on the instructions of the SIT.Reacting to Amitabh Thakur's arrest, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav lashed out at the BJP government in the state."The BJP's politics survives only by creating rifts among the people. Now due to the pressure of the BJP government, the police are compelled to work against the police. Such a treatment to a retired IPS is unforgivable," he tweeted in Hindi.The former Uttar Pradesh cadre IPS officer on Friday morning had announced that he would soon form a new political party.Amitabh Thakur was given compulsory retirement ahead of time by the government and he had announced to contest against Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in the assembly elections to be held early next year.He was given compulsory retirement on March 23 in "public interest" following a decision taken by the Union Home Ministry. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-ips-officer-amitabh-thakur-held-for-abetting-suicide-of-ballia-rape-victim-her-friend-302862

27-08-2021||Vijay Mohan||Researchers discover rare occurrence of triple black holes merging to form center of newly discovered galaxy||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 27Indian researchers have discovered a rare occurrence of three super massive black holes from three galaxies merging together to form an active galactic nucleus, a compact region at the center of a newly discovered galaxy, which has a much-higher-than-normal luminosity.Super massive black holes are difficult to detect because they do not emit any light, but can reveal their presence by interacting with their surroundings. When the dust and gas from the surroundings fall onto a super massive black hole, some of the mass is swallowed by the black hole, while some of it is converted into energy and emitted as electromagnetic radiation that makes the black hole appear very luminous.They are called active galactic nuclei (AGN) and release huge amounts of ionized particles and energy into the galaxy and its environment. Both of these ultimately contribute to the growth of the medium around the galaxy and ultimately to the evolution of the galaxy itself.A team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, along with a researcher from College de France, Chaire Galaxies et Cosmologie, Paris, while studying a known interacting galaxy pair, labelled NGC7733, and NGC7734, detected unusual emissions from the centre of NGC7734 and a large, bright clump along the northern arm of NGC7733.Their investigations showed that the clump is moving with a different velocity compared to the galaxy NGC7733 itself. It was inferred that this clump was not a part of NGC7733; but a small separate galaxy behind the arm. This galaxy was named NGC7733N.The study, published as a letter in the journal, Astronomy and Astrophysics, used data from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board the first Indian space observatory, ASTROSAT, as well as data from the European integral field optical telescope mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile and infrared images from the optical telescope (IRSF) in South Africa, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology today.The data and images also supported the presence of the third galaxy by revealing star formation along with the tidal tails, which could have formed from the merger of NGC7733N with the larger galaxy. Each of the galaxies hosts an active super massive black hole in their nucleus and hence form a very rare triple AGN system.According to the researchers, a major factor impacting galaxy evolution is galaxy interactions, which happen when galaxies move close by each other and exert tremendous gravitational forces on each other. During such interactions, the respective super massive black holes can get near each other. The dual black holes start consuming gas from their surroundings and become dual AGN.Many AGN pairs have been detected in the past, but triple AGN are extremely rare and only a few have been detected so far using X-ray observations. However, the IIA team expects such triple AGN systems to be more common in small merging groups of galaxies. Although this study focuses only on one system, results suggest that small merging groups are ideal laboratories to detect multiple super massive black holes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/researchers-discover-rare-occurrence-of-triple-black-holes-merging-to-form-center-of-newly-discovered-galaxy-302842

27-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi High Court asks Centre to respond to pleas by FB, WhatsApp challenging IT Rules||The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre to reply to pleas by Facebook and WhatsApp challenging the new IT rules for social media intermediaries requiring the messaging app to “trace” chats and make provisions to identify the first originator of information.The pleas have challenged the new rules on the grounds that they violate the right to privacy and are unconstitutional.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice asking the Centre, through the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, to file reply on the petition as well as the application for stay on the implementation of the Rules.The court listed the matter for October 22.The counsel for the Centre said the main advocate was not available and sought an adjournment which was opposed by senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for WhatsApp and Facebook, respectively.The Facebook owned company, WhatsApp, in its plea said the requirement of intermediaries enabling the identification of the first originator of information in India upon government or court order puts end-to-end encryption and its benefits "at risk".WhatsApp LLC has urged the high court to declare Rule 4(2) of the Intermediary Rules as unconstitutional, ultra vires to the IT Act and illegal and sought that no criminal liability be imposed on it for any alleged non-compliance with Rule 4(2) which requires enabling the identification of the first originator of information.WhatsApp said the traceability provision is unconstitutional and against the fundamental right to privacy.The plea said the traceability requirement forces the company to break end-to-end encryption on its messaging service, as well as the privacy principles underlying it, and infringes upon the fundamental rights to privacy and free speech of the hundreds of millions of citizens using WhatsApp to communicate privately and securely.It said WhatsApp enables government officials, law enforcement, journalists, members of ethnic or religious groups, scholars, teachers, students, and the like to exercise their right to freedom of speech and expression without fear of retaliation.“WhatsApp also allows doctors and patients to discuss confidential health information with total privacy, enables clients to confide in their lawyers with the assurance that their communications are protected, and allows financial and government institutions to trust that they can communicate securely without anyone listening to their conversations,” it said.

27-08-2021||Kolkata||Classical musician couple worried about fate of instrumental music students in Afghanistan||Classical Indian music instrumentalist couple Pt Abhishek Adhikari and Dr Murchana Adhikary Barthakur, who taught sitar and sarod to their students in Afghanistan, are now living with worries about their students after the Taliban take over of the country and the deadly explosion at Kabul Airport.They are in touch with some of their Afghan students through Facebook Messenger.The couple had been associated with the Afghan government run institute of instrumental music - Afghanistan National Institute of Music - from 2012 till 2019 October and afterwards quit from the institute and returned to India.They were reverentially addressed, as Ustad Abhishek and Ustad Murchana in Afghanistan.After 2019 at personal initiative the duo continued to impart online music classes to eager female and male students in Kabul till things came to a standstill due to Taliban take over of Kabul in mid-August.Pt Abhishek told PTI from somewhere in north India, "our students are scared to practice or listen to music as Taliban is against music. Secretly few of my students, living in the same neighbourhood, gathered at one's residence to listen to Indian classical music audio kept with them. They did that after closing the door and windows and ensuring not a single decibel goes out.""As they informed me about this, I asked them to be always careful about their life and safety," the affable music teacher couple who had been visiting the Kabul Institute twice a year from 2012 and from 2015 onwards shifted there till the 2019 departure said.Stating he was trying to contact his students after hearing about the deadly airport blast on Thursday, Pt Adhikari on Friday said his worries have increased about the safety and well being of the well-wishers and friends based there."Till now, my students are safe. I had immediately contacted them after getting to know about the blast at Kabul Airport. But I am trying to get more updates," he informed.The classicist said he had been told by the institute director the other day that he wishes all the music teachers and students can leave Kabul, but that seems to be fraught with uncertainty currently as the Taliban doesn't want Afghan nationals to leave.When they took over Kabul this time, the Taliban initially claimed they would not do any harm to artistes, professionals, that they would not prevent women to carry on their professions. They would not take away personal liberty, he said.However, going by the reports pouring in from there in the past few days, "it seems even if there are moderate voices in the militia, that has been taken over by the hardliners who strictly believe that music and art should not be practiced and women should live indoors," he added.The couple used to go to Afghanistan as guest teacher twice a year from 2012 to 2015. From 2015 to September 22, 2019 they were there as permanent Sitar and Sarod faculty.The institute had around 350 students interested in Indian classical instrumentals. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/classical-musician-couple-worried-about-fate-of-instrumental-music-students-in-afghanistan-302806

The petitioner is stated to be one of the persons in the said crowd," the court order stated."A citizen cannot be subjected to externment for raising his grievance against the government. On this count also, the externment order needs to be set aside," Justice Upadhyay said.While giving relief to the petitioner, the court also noted that of the two FIRs mentioned by the Ahmedabad police in its externment order, Siddiqui had already been acquitted in the case lodged in 2018.

27-08-2021||New Delhi||68% class 11 & 12 students prefer higher studies in home country: Survey||About 68 per cent over 3,000 class 11 and 12 students who participated in a recent survey said they preferred higher education in their home country, a sharp increase of 24 percentage points from last year.More than 6,600 students between grades 9 and 12 from 2,000 schools across India and South Asia responded to the survey titled Student Quest Survey Report.Overall this year, 25 per cent of the total students are planning to go abroad for higher studies, which is four percentage points lower than last year. The survey was conducted by Shiv Nadar University, Noida, and International Career and College Counseling (IC3) Institute, a volunteer organisation that provides support to high schools around the world through guidance and training resources for high school administrators, teachers and counsellors.Among grade 9 and 10 students, 49 per cent preferred to study in their home countries, while 24 per cent were undecided, said the report, highlighting the importance of counseling in early grades and making the right information available to students as they evaluate their options.According to the Student Quest Survey, students begin thinking about their career and related job prospects early -- in high school itself."Seventy-one per cent of the students have already started thinking about their future employment. The top three factors in choosing a university include the institution's placement record, rankings, and program design. Ranked fourth were fees, followed by location and the quality of faculty members," the survey report said.It said the quality of faculty as a factor for choosing a university was low-ranked by grade 9 and 10 students, while those in grades 11 and 12 ranked it significantly higher."When choosing a particular program, three factors seem to be most significant: about 35 per cent of the respondents said that they would choose a program based on their interests, 27 per cent favoured future job prospects, and 21 percent give the highest importance to their own perceived strength in a particular area of study," the report said.As much as 83 per cent of the students choose “quality of education” as the biggest reason to choose universities outside of their home countries."Students, who are on the verge of adulthood, have to make crucial decisions that can shape their careers and, indeed, lives. Understanding how that choice is made, who influences that, what information they use, what factors play important roles, will not only help institutions, schools and universities alike to design better programs and processes, but will also enable us to help these students alleviate their anxiety and make better choices," said Partha Chatterjee, Professor and Head – Department of Economics, Shiv Nadar University. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/68-class-11-12-students-prefer-higher-studies-in-home-country-survey-302803

The apex court said identification of such children was the “starting point” to find out their needs and their welfare is of paramount consideration.“Even if there are 1,000 children without their parent, just imagine what is going to happen to them. They can be pushed to child labour. They can be landing themselves to hands of undesirable elements in the society. We don't know what will happen to them. These are vulnerable children.

The first explosion took place at nearby Baron’s Hotel and as French intelligence was posting warnings about a second blast, another explosion occurred at the gate of the airport manned by US troops.Suicide bombingsISIS to blame?MEA flays bloodbathIndia has strongly condemned the bomb blasts at the Kabul airport. “We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of those killed in this terrorist attack. Our thoughts and prayers also go out to the injured,” said the MEA in a statementThere was also firing at an Italian military aircraft taking off from Kabul airport. Hours later, a Taliban vehicle hit an IED, leaving several dead. The blasts were believed to be suicide attacks and a US official said the ISIS (Khorasan) was “most definitely involved”.Social media posts showed images of body parts and the dead and injured being carted away to hospitals while the blast scene was littered with crumpled plastic water bottles, scarves, footwear and food packets. The first explosion was captured on camera in the form of a huge black column rising from the hotel into the Kabul night sky. The Pentagon described the two blasts as part of a “complex attack” with the second one claiming the lives of several US soldiers. But it said evacuation operations will continue till August 31. The explosions are expected to impact the evacuation of foreign nationals, including Indians, which External Affairs Minister Jaishankar said remained the top priority of the Indian government. Western nations had warned earlier in the day of a possible attack.The suspicion for the attack has fallen on ISIS, and not the Taliban, which is deployed at the outer periphery of the airport and its Badri 313 battalion too has taken casualties.Sources here said the ISIS (Khorasan) is the obvious suspect because the blasts may have been intended to show up the Taliban’s inability to provide security in Kabul as well as target the Americans.Meanwhile, Taliban spokesperson Dr M Naeem said, “The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns the bombing that targeted civilians at Kabul airport… will strictly repel the crimes of evil circles.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/50-die-in-multiple-blasts-at-kabul-airport-302494

Scindia, while briefing media on the issue, said the new rules aimed at simplifying procedures and reducing compliance burden for drone operation. “We are all set to usher in a new era of drone usage in India… Our aim is to make India a global drone hub by 2030,” he said.The minister said the new drone rules were very likely to make air taxis traversing the airspace in the coming days.“Air taxis are being researched and invented globally and many startups are coming up…. That time is not far when taxis that you see on roads, you will see in the air under the drone policy. I believe this is very much possible,” he said. Under the new rules, the regulator has done away with too many approvals and the number of forms to be filled to operate drones has been reduced from 25 to 6.PM Narendra Modi tweeted to highlight the significance of the new rules. “The new drone rules usher in a landmark moment for this sector in India. The rules are based on the premise of trust and self-certification. Approvals, compliance requirements and entry barriers have been significantly reduced,” the PM said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-drone-policy-notified-air-taxis-may-be-a-reality-soon-says-jyotiraditya-scindia-302509

After a few days of marriage, the woman’s husband and her two in-laws allegedly started harassing her for dowry.The woman later lodged a complaint at the Bemetara police station of Bemetara district against the three.After investigation, a charge-sheet under section 498-A (dowry harassment), 377 (unnatural offences), 376 (rape), 34 (common intention) of the IPC was filed against them. After providing opportunity of hearing to counsels of both the parties, a trial court had framed charges against the applicants under these sections, the order said.The trio, including woman’s husband, approached the High Court seeking to set aside the order of the trial court and discharge them from the charges, including that of rape against him.“Counsel for the applicants submits that the complainant and the applicant No. 1 (man) are legally wedded wife and husband, therefore, none of the ingredients to constitute the offence punishable under Sections 376 and 377 of the IPC are spelt out against him, because, in India, marital rape is not recognized and the same is not an offence in view of Exception II of Section 375 of the IPC,” the HC said.The counsel had prayed that the impugned order be set aside and the applicants be discharged from charges brought against them, it said.After hearing, the HC had reserved its order on August 13 and it was  delivered on Monday (August 23).The order said, “Exception II of Section 375 of the IPC, referred to above, makes it clear that sexual intercourse or sexual act by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape.”  The judge said charge under IPC section 376 (rape) against the man was erroneous and illegal.“In this case, complainant is legally wedded wife of applicant No. 1, therefore, sexual intercourse or any sexual act with her by the husband would not constitute an offence of rape, even if it was by force or against her wish. Therefore, charge under Section 376 of the IPC framed against the husband is erroneous and illegal. Hence, he is entitled to be discharged from the charge under Section 376 of the IPC”, it said.“In the instant case, the complainant has reported that the husband has many times, without her consent, made unnatural physical relation with her. Therefore, I do not find any infirmity or illegality committed by learned trial court in framing the charge under Section 377 of the IPC against the husband,” the HC said.The HC said no illegality has been committed in framing other charges against the accused.“Consequently, the instant revision is partly allowed. The applicant No. 1 (husband) is discharged from the charge framed against him under Section 376 of the I.P.C. This Court finds that trial Court has not committed any illegality in framing the charge under Section 377 and 498-A/34 of the IPC against all the applicants, it added.

27-08-2021||New Delhi||Mandatory to register drones under new rules; will help identify rouge drones: Officials||The new rules on drones make it mandatory that these devices are registered and agencies will be able identify those which are rogue through tracking mechanisms, senior government officials said on Thursday.The Drone Rules, 2021, were issued on Wednesday and they supersede the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Rules, 2021, which had come into force on March 12.In the absence of a drone policy, these devices were not registered and also there were no demarcations on where they should be flown, Principal Scientific Advisor K Vijay Raghavan said.The new norms prescribe registration of all drones and there will be a specific tracking mechanism. Those whose drones are not registered will be identified right away, he said during a press conference.Responding to a question on misuse of drones and security risk, Civil Aviation Secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola said, “We have the facility to identify a rogue drone and this is what these rules provide for.”He explained that every car has a registration number and there is a mechanism to know who owns it.“Something similar will happen with drones. The rules have a provision that in the future, each drone will have an identification. The first challenge is to identify a good drone and a bad drone,” Kharola said.“Once a bad drone is identified there are protocols in place. It is not only the Civil Aviation Ministry, but other ministries and agencies are working together to ensure that once such an identification is done how to deal with that,” he said.In a separate press conference, Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said the Defence Ministry, the Home Ministry and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security have been working together so that “counter rogue drone technology” can be developed and adopted quickly.The Civil Aviation Ministry has eased rules regarding drone operations in the country by reducing the number of forms that need to be filled to operate them from 25 to 5 and decreasing the types of fees charged from the operator from 72 to 4.Kharola said the Drone Rules 2021 has classified areas in zones where drones can fly—red (restricted areas and airport premises), yellow zone (5 to 8 kms from yellow zone and can fly with permission) and green zone (no permission required for operation).He said the first version of the drone rules came in 2017 and it was the first attempt to regulate their use. It was found that it was not very comprehensive, so a second attempt was made in the beginning of this year. But the approach was regulatory, Kharola said.But then with larger consultations with stakeholders, it was found that an enabling environment has to be provided for drones to be developed and manufactured, he said, adding that this paved the way for new rules.The new guidelines are based on three key important principles—trust (in manufacturers and operators), self-certification and non-intrusive monitoring, he said.Raghavan said the new rules will help stimulate avenues like medicine delivery and even vaccines in far flung areas.

Many members of our community from various parts of the world have already arrived to attend the same. Unfortunately, the Taliban has denied them access to the Kabul Airport," the statement quoting Partap Singh (Afghan Origin), President of Gurdwara Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji in New Mahavir Nagar, said.Guljeet Singh (Afghan Origin), president of Gurdwara Guru Nanak Sahib Ji at Vikaspuri said it is sad to note that our brothers and sisters from Afghanistan aren't being allowed the pilgrimage."Each year, our Afghan origin community organises tours to India to visit historical gurdwaras. After suspension of commercial international flights from Afghanistan due to the political situation, we had requested the Indian government to facilitate their attendance at the celebrations."Regret to note that last night the pilgrims were turned back by Taliban security forces from the airport after waiting for more than 15 hours in their convoys," the statement quoting Singh claimed.Meanwhile, several gurdwaras across India, including those in Simla, Bhopal, Kanpur and Jammu organised 'sukran ki ardas' to express gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government for ensuring the return of three copies of the Sikh holy book Guru Granth Sahib that were flown in from Kabul on Tuesday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taliban-denying-afghan-hindu-sikh-pilgrims-to-come-to-india-claims-indian-world-forum-302439

The exercise will provide an opportunity for participating navies to derive benefit from each other's expertise and experiences," Indian Navy Spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said.The US 7th Fleet said the first phase of the exercise is an opportunity for the four Indo-Pacific navies to operate together to strengthen their skills in "combined maritime operations, anti-submarine warfare operations, air warfare operations, live-fire gunnery events, replenishments-at-sea and cross-deck flight operations." "Malabar 21 is an excellent opportunity to conduct multi-national training to hone warfighting and maritime security skillsets," said Capt. Chase Sargeant, Commander, Task Force (CTF) 71 of US 7th Fleet."US destroyers closely integrating with our partners and allies builds the foundation for regional security and stability that benefits all Indo-Pacific nations," he said.In an interactive session at the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command Admiral John Aquilino on Wednesday spoke about key challenges facing the Indo-Pacific and delved into China's rapid military build-up including in the maritime domain.Admiral Aquilino also hinted at the possibility of increasing the number of participants at the Malabar naval exercise if leaders of the four participating countries concur with it.Following India's invitation, Australia participated in the Malabar exercise last year that effectively made it a drill by all four member nations of the Quad.China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise, as it feels that the annual wargame is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region.The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent member of the exercise in 2015. This annual exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019.Last year, the exercise was hosted in two phases in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.There have been mounting global concerns over China's growing military assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region.India, the US, Australia, Japan and many other like-minded countries are working towards ensuring a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/four-day-malabar-wargame-begins-off-coast-of-guam-in-western-pacific-302393

27-08-2021||---||‘Disloyalty' by Biden led to army collapse, says Afghan general||New Delhi, August 26The general heading the Afghan Special Forces command when Kabul fell on August 15 has blamed US President Joe Biden for the sudden folding up of the Afghan Army.Gen Syed Sami Sadat, a three-star general, surfaced in the columns of an American newspaper after 13 days of absence from the social media where, as the Commanding General, 215 Maiwand Afghan Army Corps, he had posted regular updates about battles with the Taliban.For the past tree and a half months, he fought “non-stop” in Helmand Province against an escalating and bloody Taliban offensive. “We held them back and inflicted heavy losses” and then I was called to Kabul to head the Special Forces. “But the Taliban were already entering the city and it was too late,” he wrote while describing his state as exhausted, frustrated and angry.Accepting the criticism that the Afghan army lost its will to fight, Gen Sami says this was mainly because of a growing sense of abandonment by the US and the “disrespect and disloyalty” reflected in Biden’s tone over the past few months.The Afghan Army was not blameless. It was beset by cronyism and bureaucracy. “But we ultimately stopped fighting because our partners already had.”The general does not agree with the criticism of the Afghan Army by Biden and his Western allies. The Trump-Taliban agreement created a situation where the Taliban was emboldened. Then the recent political divisions between Washington and Kabul “strangled” the army, said Gen Sami, without elaborating.Just before he went off the Internet, Gen Sami in a voice message on August 12 had said the “Pakistani mercenary militia” had been defeated in Helmand and that clearing operations were being carried out. Helmand's capital, Lashkargah, fell the next day.However, some questions remain on his claims of pushing back the Taliban on August 12 when the group had already captured nine out of 10 districts of Helmand eight days earlier and the province was considered as good as gone. Also, the General does not explain how his Corps collapsed within a day of claiming to have inflicted heavy losses on the Taliban, as also killing a couple of Al Qaida fighters.As per the general's account, his forces had beaten back the Taliban. Independent accounts also confirm the Afghan forces had a good fight but only at Lashkargah city while nearly the entire rural belt of Helmand Province had come under Taliban control including the vital border crossing of Spin Boldok.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disloyalty-by-biden-led-to-army-collapse-says-afghan-general-302335
27-08-2021||New Delhi||SC gets nine judges after two years, including 3 women||The Supreme Court will get nine judges, including three women judges after two years as the government on Thursday notified their appointments after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his nod to the decision.The appointments will take effect from the date the judges assume charge of their respective office, the Department of Justice said in separate notifications. The new judges are likely to be sworn in at the earliest.One of them—Justice BV Nagarathna of the Karnataka High Court—is likely to become the first woman CJI in 2027.Other eight names recommended for elevation are: Karnataka High Court Chief Justice AS Oka, Gujarat High Court Chief Justice Vikram Nath, Sikkim High Court Chief Justice Jitendra Kumar Maheshwari, Telangana High Court Chief Justice Hima Kohli, Kerala High Court judge CT Ravi Kumar, Madras High Court judge MM Sundersh, Gujarat High Court judge Bela M Trivedi and senior advocate and former Additional Solicitor General PS Narasimha.Besides, Justice Nagarathna, Justice Vikram Nath and Narasimha will also go on to become the CJI, if the line of succession is not disturbed.The top court is currently functioning with 24 judges against a sanctioned strength of 34, including the CJI. Once the nine new judges take over, the working strength of the top court will reach 33, leaving only one post vacant.Ending a two-year-long deadlock, the Supreme Court Collegium had on August 17 recommended nine names for elevation to the top court and the government had approved them.The Collegium’s decision had come five days after the retirement of Justice RF Nariman who was said to have insisted on elevation of Tripura High Court Chief Justice Akil A Kureshi before any other name was considered.Due to the stalemate, the Collegium failed to recommend any names for appointment of judges to the Supreme Court after August 28, 2019 when it had made the last recommendation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-gets-nine-judges-after-two-years-including-3-women-302328
