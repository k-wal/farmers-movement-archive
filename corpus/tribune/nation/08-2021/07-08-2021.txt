I got support and good wishes from a lot of people." The PM then jokingly made a reference to his home town Panipat."Panipat ne paani dikha diya," Modi laughed."You had to work harder for one year because of the delay in Olympics and the Covid-19 lockdown. You also battled a shoulder injury (in 2019). You have done wonders despite all these obstacles, it is all hard work," he added.Chopra acknowledged that the task wasn't easy for him."Bohot mushkil tha sir (It was difficult)," he said.Modi spoke about Chopra's confident body language, which was eye-catching during the Olympic finals but something that the PM said he noticed before he left for the Games."I saw confidence on your face the day I spoke to you," he said."I only wanted to give my 100 per cent," responded the champion.Modi told Chopra that he has inspired a generation of youngsters with his achievements."You have inspired the young generation. We have shown good performance in sports where we are not normally good. Sports is essential for the country. It's a moment of honour for your family."I will see you on August 15. Many congratulations," PM Modi said.India finished its Olympic campaign with an unprecedented seven medals, including two silver and four bronze medals.

07-08-2021|| New Delhi||Learning loss due to school closure would’ve weakened fundamental knowledge of students: Parliamentary panel||The learning loss of more than one year due to prolonged school closure in wake of Covid-19 pandemic would necessarily have weakened the foundational knowledge of students, especially in the subjects of mathematics, sciences and languages, at the school level, a Parliamentary panel has noted.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports in its report “Plans to bridge the learning gap caused due to school lockdown as well as review of online and offline instructions and exams and plans for reopening of schools” has noted that the learning loss is likely to impair cognitive capabilities of students.  “The learning loss of more than one year would necessarily have weakened the foundational knowledge of the students especially in the subjects of mathematics, sciences and languages at school level. This learning loss is a big deficit and is likely to impair the cognitive capabilities of students,” the panel said in its report tabled in Parliament on Friday.“This might have a debilitating effect on vulnerable sections of the society like poor and rural students, marginalized sections of society and young women who might have been unable to connect to any form of digital education during the pandemic. This needs to be addressed and immediate remedial steps required to be taken,” the report said.The panel stated that school closures have put children’s learning, nutrition, mental health, and overall development at risk and some students, particularly girls, are at the risk of never returning to school. “In fact long closure of schools will lead to children not returning to schools and potential for children getting engaged in labour and early marriage. Therefore, the immediate need is to bring children back to school,” the report said.The committee also recommended that since the digital and online mode of education is going to be the new normal even after the pandemic subsides, efforts to technologically empower every school and students across the country may be aggressively pursued and additional funds allocated for the purpose, as per requirement.“The committee recommends that a comprehensive assessment to collect data of the post-Covid situation leading to the learning loss due to school lockdown may be under taken by the Department of School Education and Literacy to cover the areas of concern,” it said. The panel headed by Vinay P Sahasrabuddhe advocated that a credible, fair and transparent system of continuous assessment throughout the year may be developed and put in place even when normal functioning of schools re-commences, so as to meet any future emergent scenarios.“This system should be over and above the final board examinations and would aid in helping students and teachers get a correct perspective of their learning curve and course correct wherever required. “Guidelines for internal assessment, practicals, project work, particularly for classes 10 and 12, be formulated and circulated for strict implementation in every school at the Centre and in States and UTs, be it government, government-aided or private, in order to ensure objective and uniform standard of assessment across the country,” the panel report said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/learning-loss-due-to-school-closure-wouldve-weakened-fundamental-knowledge-of-students-parliamentary-panel-294465

07-08-2021||New Delhi||Railways plans to go green with hydrogen-fuelled trains||Taking a big leap towards going green, the Indian Railways has decided to introduce the country's first hydrogen-fuelled train.Initially, the hydrogen fuel-based technology will be introduced on the 89 km long Sonipat-Jind route. The Railways has also floated tenders for retrofitting the existing DEMU rakes into a green fuel-based train. A Railway Ministry spokesperson said that the transporter, as part of the National Hydrogen Energy Mission, has taken a leap forward in the development of hydrogen fuel cell-based power movement to kick off the concept of Hydrogen Mobility in the country. He said that this will be done by converting or retrofitment of existing DEMU rakes.The official said that the loco pilot of the locomotive will not face any problem as there will be no change in the driving console.Highlighting the national transporter's plan, the official said, "Initially, two DEMU rakes will be converted, and later two Hybrid narrow gauge locos will be converted base on Hydrogen Fuel Cell power movement." He said railways had invited bids for hydrogen fuel cell based technology by retrofitting DEMU in the 89 km Sonipat-Jind Section of Northern Railway. He explained that the retrofitting of diesel powered DEMU and converting it into hydrogen fuel powered train set will not only save costs to the tune of Rs 2.3 crore annually by converting from diesel to hydrogen, but also save the carbon footprint (NO2) of 11.12 kilo tons per annum and particulate matter of 0.72 kilo tons per annum."After conversion, the train will run on hydrogen fuel, the greenest mode of transport as hydrogen can be generated by electrolysing the water from solar energy," he said.The official said that after successful implementation of this pilot project, all the rolling stock which will operate on diesel fuel after electrification can be planned to be run on hydrogen fuel.Another railway ministry official said that as a pilot project, the hydrogen-powered passenger train would be operational in the Northern zone.The official said that for the first time, two motor coaches with 1,400 horsepower (HP) each would haul the 10-coach hydrogen-powered passenger train.He said that the train would be running through a push-pull method using two motor coaches being retrofitted with hydrogen kits. The railways floated a tender in the last week of July and the bidding would take place from September 21 to October 5 this year. There would be a pre-bid meeting with the interested bidders on August 17 to address queries on the project.So far, Germany and Poland are using this method of power generation in railways. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/railways-plans-to-go-green-with-hydrogen-fuelled-trains-294430

It was proposed to be moved last year, but many of us had underlined the anti-people aspects of the draft legislation, and at least I had detailed out all the salient pitfalls of the Bill in a letter to you on June 12, 2020,” she wrote. Banerjee had written to Modi on June 12 last year, expressing outrage over the draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020, which, she said, was an attempt by the Centre to “destroy” the country’s federal structure. She claimed that the Bill aims to make the entire state electricity grid an appendage of the National Grid. “I am stunned to hear that the Bill is coming back without any consideration for our reservations, and in fact with some graver anti-people features this time,” she added.

07-08-2021||Washington||Expedite process of issuing visas to international students: Senators to US govt||A bipartisan group of influential senators on Friday urged the Biden Administration to accelerate the process of issuing visas to international students, a move likely to benefit thousands of Indians who want to join their classes this Fall.In India, for instance, in Delhi, only emergency visas are currently being issued by the US Embassy, as a result of which a large number of Indian students are uncertain about their academic future for the next session beginning this Fall. There are over 1,00,000 Indian students in the US and they contribute significantly to the American economy.“We write to express our concerns regarding the slow pace of processing student visas as we continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” two dozen senators wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Tony Blinken.“In order to welcome international students and scholars in the Fall, as competitor countries are doing, we urge the State Department to provide predictable and consistent consular services, maximise alternatives to in-person visa interviews by providing waivers and virtual interviews, extend visa eligibility waivers, authorise staff overtime and increase hiring, and initiate meaningful engagement with outside stakeholders and agencies,” they said.“We are at a critical point in the academic calendar when international students and scholars must make visa appointments and plan their travel to the United States,” they added.               The senators further said while some US consulates are reopening, most are still operating at lower capacity levels and there remains limited access to visa appointments.Prospective students cannot be certain about whether their visas will be processed in time for them to travel to the United States to begin their studies, the senators wrote.“While we appreciate that a National Interest Exception for international students has been created, the processing of these visas in a timely way continues to be a challenge. International students coming to the United States provide significant and essential value to the higher education system and our economy,” they stressed.Data from the Association of International Educators shows that more than one million international students at US colleges and universities during the 2018-2019 academic year contributed USD 41 billion to the country’s economy.Furthermore, bringing international students to the United States enriches the educational experience of domestic students that would be more difficult to achieve through online formats.There are also practical barriers to online learning by international students while physically outside the United States such as not all countries have reliable electricity or internet access and time zone differences require some students to appear online for classes in the middle of the night, the senators said.There are also countries that limit access to certain information or websites while the US also bars the sharing of certain information with other countries, they added.

Some high frequency indicators are also looking up again during June-July.”Sees consumer price inflation at 5.7%The consumer price-based inflation (CPI) is projected at 5.7 per cent during 2021-22, with 5.9 per cent in Q2; 5.3 per cent in Q3; and 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22. CPI inflation for Q1 of FY 2022-23 is projected at 5.1 per cent.“Our expectation is that activity is likely to gather pace with progressive upscaling of vaccinations, continued large policy support, buoyant exports and benign monetary and financial conditions,” Das said, adding, “Today, we are in a much better position than in June.”“Yet the need of the hour is not to drop our guard and remain vigilant against any possibility of a third wave, especially in the background of rising infections in certain parts of the country,” the RBI Chief cautioned. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI has retained its GDP growth projection of 9.5 per cent for 21-22.Meanwhile, a senior RBI official said the Central Bank may come out with some kind of digital currency model in near future, probably by year-end. Das reiterated that the RBI’s priority would be “to promote growth within the framework of financial stability” and is concerned that any departure from the present pro-growth monetary policy may kill the nascent recovery.The RBI has also decided to conduct two more auctions of Rs 25,000 crore each this month under the G-sec Acquisition Programme (GSAP).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rbi-keeps-key-rate-unchanged-retains-gdp-projection-at-9-5-294164

We are fulfilling that word,” said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while moving the legislation for consideration and passage amid the din.Also read: Editorial: Retrospective taxShe said there were 17 such cases prior to 2012 for which the law was retrospectively applied. “Of these, two went to the court and the claims could not be pursued further. As promised by then FM Jaitley, in principle we don’t believe in this. However, we couldn’t act on this even in 2014 because there were two cases going on,” she said.According to Sitharaman, like former FM Jaitley said, the government waited for them to reach a logical conclusion, which was arrived in September 2020 in one case and in December 2020 in another.Its significanceWill impact retro tax cases of at least two big companies—Cairn & VodafoneWill boost confidence among potential investorsAMAZON WINS CASE The SC has ruled in Amazon’s favour, upholding the order of S’pore arbitrator against a Future Group-Rel Retail deal.

The impasse over the other friction point — PP 15, also referred to as Hot Springs — and the Depsang Bulge, a 972-sq km plateau, remains.Infra, temporary structures razedDisengagement was carried out on August 4 and 5All temporary structures and allied infrastructure of both sides were dismantled and mutually verifiedTroops have been in a faceoff situation in these areas since May last year. “The disengagement process (at PP-17A) was carried out over two days (August 4 and 5). The troops of both sides are now in their respective permanent bases,” the Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Friday.“All temporary structures and other allied infrastructure created in the area (along the LAC) by both sides have been dismantled and mutually verified,” said the MoD. The landform in the area has been restored by both sides to the pre-standoff period, the statement added.“As per the agreement, both sides have ceased forward deployments in this area in a phased, coordinated and verified manner,” the Ministry of Defence said.The Tribune was the first to report in its edition dated August 3 that ‘Gogra disengagement’ was agreed upon at the July 31 meeting of commanders. The 832-km LAC in Ladakh is undefined on the ground with both sides making claims and counterclaims.“This agreement (on disengagement) ensures that the LAC in this area will be strictly observed and respected by both sides, and that there is no unilateral change in status quo,” the MoD said.Following the disengagement, the next steps would include a graded, time-bound and complete “de-escalation and de-induction”, entailing pulling back of troops and war equipment to the pre-April 2020 home bases.The disengagement at Gogra was the first positive move along the LAC since February 10 this year, when the disengagement was carried out along the banks of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake.

He claimed Taliban commanders had initially threatened the caretaker and later forced him to take it down from its rightful place.The armed men, he said, forced the caretaker to remove the Nishan Sahib from its assigned place and tied it to a tree so that it cannot be viewed as a distinct symbol from afar.The gurdwara, located in Chamkani area of Paktia, was once visited by Guru Nanak.It has Guru Sahib’s Prakash and is maintained by a dozen Sikhs families that remain in the region.The gurdwara was in the news in July 2020 when Nidan Singh Sachdeva, a leader of the Hindu and Sikh community in Afghanistan was abducted from the gurdwara. The wider region called “Loya Paktia” has been a Mujahideen and then a Taliban\Haqqani Group stronghold since the early 1980s. India had then blamed the Haqqani Group and the Lashkar-e-Toiba for the massacre.Sachdeva’s kidnapping had followed a massacre of 30 Sikhs in Gurudwara Guru Har Rai in Kabul in May last year. At that time, India had offered all possible assistance to the affected families of the Hindu and Sikh community of Afghanistan.The frequent targeting of the Sikh community has seen the one-lakh-strong Sikh and Hindu communities reduced to just a few thousands.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-condemns-removal-of-nishan-sahib-from-gurdwara-thala-sahib-in-afghanistan-293962
07-08-2021||New Delhi||Indian, Chinese armies complete disengagement in Gogra in eastern Ladakh||After nearly 15 months of the face-off, Indian and Chinese armies have completed the disengagement process and restored the pre-standoff ground position at the Gogra friction point in eastern Ladakh, in yet another forward movement towards the overall improvement of the situation in the area.Announcing the development, the Indian Army said the disengagement process was carried out on August 4 and 5, and all temporary structures, as well as other allied infrastructure created by both sides, have been dismantled, and mutually verified subsequently.The disengagement process at Patrolling Point-17A or Gogra was carried out in line with the outcome of the 12th round of military talks that took place on July 31 at Chushul-Moldo meeting point in eastern Ladakh, the Army said.“As an outcome of the meeting, both sides agreed on disengagement in the area of Gogra. The troops in this area have been in a face-off situation since May last year,” the Army said in a statement.“As per the agreement, both sides have ceased forward deployments in this area in a phased, coordinated and verified manner. The disengagement process was carried out over two days: August 4 and 5,” it said.The Army said the troops of both sides are now in their respective permanent bases.Both sides had carried out partial disengagement in Gogra as well as Hotsprings. However, the process was not completed following fresh skirmishes along the South bank of Pangong Tso areas.“All temporary structures and other allied infrastructure created in the area by both sides have been dismantled and mutually verified. The landform in the area has been restored by both sides to the pre-standoff period,” the Army said.The disengagement process at Patrolling Point-17A (PP 17A) took place around five months after the two sides carried out a similar exercise on the North and South bank areas of Pangong lake when they withdrew troops and weapons from the friction points.“This agreement ensures that the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in this area will be strictly observed and respected by both sides, and that there is no unilateral change in status quo,” the Army said.“With this, one more sensitive area of face-off has been resolved. Both sides have expressed commitment to take the talks forward and resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in the Western Sector,” it said.The eastern Ladakh is referred to as Western Sector by the government.“The Indian Army along with ITBP is totally committed to ensure the sovereignty of the nation and maintain peace & tranquillity along the LAC in the Western Sector,” the Army said.With the completion of the disengagement in PP 17A, the focus now shifts to Gogra as well as Depsang and Demchok.Sources said both sides have created a buffer zone in PP-17 A where no patrolling will be carried out by both sides.In the 12th round of military talks, the two sides agreed to resolve the pending issues at the remaining friction points in an “expeditious” manner.A joint statement released after the talks said the two sides had a “candid and in-depth exchange” of views relating to the disengagement and that the meeting further enhanced mutual understanding.India has been insisting that the resolution of the outstanding issues, including at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra, is essential for the overall ties between the two countries.The 12th round of military talks took place over two weeks after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar firmly conveyed to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that the prolongation of the existing situation in eastern Ladakh was visibly impacting the bilateral ties in a “negative manner”.The two foreign ministers had held a one-hour bilateral meeting on the sidelines of a conclave of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Tajik capital city Dushanbe on July 14.In the meeting, Jaishankar told Wang that any unilateral change in the status quo along the LAC was “not acceptable” to India and that the overall ties can only develop after full restoration of peace and tranquillity in eastern Ladakh.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-chinese-armies-complete-disengagement-in-gogra-in-eastern-ladakh-293959

So, judges are threatened mentally also by sending messages on whatsapp, SMS. Complaints were made but the CBI has done nothing... No change in the CBI’s attitude... Sorry to observe that...,” a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.“It’s a new trend in this country. If an adverse order is passed, the judiciary is maligned. Unfortunately, there’s no freedom for a judge to complain. Even though judges complain to the police or the CBI they don’t respond. IB, CBI aren’t helping the judiciary at all. I’m making this statement with a sense of responsibility,” the CJI said.The comments came during the hearing on a suo motu PIL proceedings initiated by the CJI on judges’ safety in the wake of alleged murder of a judge in Dhanbad, Jharkhand last month.District and Sessions Judge-8 of Dhanbad Court, Uttam Anand, was out on morning walk at around 5 am on July 29 when he was hit by a vehicle from behind near the district court, reports quoting the local police said. An auto-rickshaw driver took him to a nearby hospital where he succumbed to his injuries, reports said. A purported CCTV footage of the incident suggested Anand was deliberately hit from behind.“Look at this unfortunate case of the death of a young judge. This is the state’s failure. This area has coal mafias and security should have been provided to the society and residences of judges,” the CJI noted.“It’s time some strong measures are put in place,” Attorney General KK Venugopal said, sharing the top court’s concerns.“When cases involving gangsters and high profile accused are taken up, the judges often get calls that We know which car they are traveling in,” Venugopal said.The Bench issued notice to the CBI—which has taken over the probe into the Dhanbad judge’s death following an order issued by the state government—and posted the matter for hearing on Monday. It asked states to file their responses by August 17 on the larger issue of safety and security of judges and creating a special force for security of courts and judges.Jharkhand Advocate General Rajiv Ranjan told the court that the state had formed a 22- members SIT and they had apprehended the driver of the vehicle. “We also took a decision to hand over the case to the CBI. They have taken it over and we already assisting,” he submitted“So you washed off your hands?” the CJI commented.“There may be cross border implications and a serious matter....so we handed it over to the CBI,” Ranjan said.A day after a judicial officer was allegedly killed in Dhanbad, Jharkhand, the Supreme Court had on July 30 taken suo motu cognisance of the matter and directed the state’s Chief Secretary and Director General of Police to submit a status report on the probe into it within a week.However, it had clarified that the Jharkhand High Court would continue to monitor the case while the top court would deal with the larger issue of safety and security of judicial officers across India.The Bench said it had come across several instances of attack on judicial officers and lawyers inside and outside the court premises and wanted to address the larger issue of safety and security of judicial officers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judges-safety-ib-cbi-not-helping-judiciary-says-supreme-court-293939

07-08-2021||Vibha Sharma||Lok Sabha passes law to nullify retrospective tax||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 6The Lok Sabha on Friday passed without any discussion the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, that aims to nullify the relevant retrospective tax clauses introduced in 2012 to bring past indirect transfer of Indian assets under the ambit of taxation amid Opposition protests on the Pegasus snooping controversy and the three central farm laws.“The Bill is being brought to keep up the word given by former Union finance minister Arun Jaitley under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, keeping up the commitment of the BJP that we don't believe in a retrospective collection of tax. We are keeping that word,” said Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while moving the legislation for consideration and passage amid the din.The House also passed in a jiffy the Central Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2021, before Rajendra Agarwal, who was in the Chair, adjourned the House till Monday. The legislation seeks to amend the Central Universities Act, 2009, to provide for the establishment of a university in the union territory of Ladakh.Speaking on the Bill, Dharmendra Pradhan called it a “historic occasion for the region”. The Centre had announced the establishment of the new university after the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, he said.Earlier, Sitharaman, while providing the background of the Bill and of retrospective taxation in the country, invoked Jaitley to call it a promise fulfilled.Sitharaman said that after coming into power in 2014, Jaitley “clearly made a commitment here in the House that we do not believe in applying the law in retrospect and we would certainly form a high-level committee which will look into all such cases”. She said that between 2014 and today, the high-level committee dealt with this matter and “we have not had one claim based on the amendment made in 2012”.The FM said for the cases prior to 2012, for which it was retrospectively applied, there were 17 such cases. “Of these, two went to the court, which were stayed, and the claims could not be pursued further.“As promised by Arun Jaitley, in principle we do not believe in this. However, we couldn't act on this in 2014 because there were two cases going on,” she said.According to Sitharaman, like Jaitley said the government waited for them to reach a logical conclusion which was arrived in September 2020 in one case and in December 2020 in another.The cases were studied by the government, and consultations held with the Law Ministry. However, because the Budget session was contracted, the government could not take up many activities then, she said.“We have come to the next available session, which is the monsoon session, which is now, to keep up the word given by Jaitley and keeping up the commitment of the BJP, that we don't believe in a retrospective collection of tax. We are fulfilling that promise,” she said.The amendment had attracted widespread criticism, especially from international quarters, on the grounds that the retrospective effect militates against the principle of tax certainty with some also calling it “a sore point with potential investors”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-passes-law-to-nullify-retrospective-tax-293909
