17-08-2021||Indore/Dewas (MP)||Congress concerned with welfare of only one family: Jyotiraditya Scindia||In a swipe at the top Congress leadership, Union minister and BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia on Tuesday said the opposition party is concerned with the welfare and progress of “only one family”.He was speaking at a gathering at Dewas after launching  ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ of his party from the Madhya Pradesh town.“We know about development. We work for the welfare of the poor. On the other hand, Congress is engaged in uplifting only one family. This is the difference between the BJP and Congress,” Scindia said.Congress and other opposition parties throttled the democratic system by not allowing Parliament to function when important bills were scheduled for discussion during the monsoon session, he alleged.“If opposition thinks that (prime minister Narendra) Modi will bow down before their injustice, then the people of the country and BJP will give a befitting reply to them….People will never forgive Congress for its behaviour in the Rajya Sabha,” Scindia said.Under Modi’s leadership, the country is successfully curbing the spread of coronavirus, he said.Speaking to reporters, Scindia said the much-awaited bill on Backward Classes Reservation (reinstating the power of identifying backward classes with the states) was passed in Parliament in the recent session.“Why this was not done in the last 70 years,” he asked.Scindia, who quit the Congress last year and was made civil aviation minister in the recent cabinet expansion, landed at Indore’s Devi Ahilyabai Holkar airport in the morning to embark on the three-day Yatra.There were chaotic scenes as a large number of BJP workers turned up to welcome him.He formally launched the yatra after performing puja on the banks of the Kshipra river at Dewas, a local BJP leader said, adding that a motorcade of about 1,000 vehicles was accompanying him.A video surfaced on social media showing several cars parked at the exit of the airport, causing traffic snarls, and a man saying angrily that the crowds that gathered to welcome Scindia created problem for the public. Speaking to reporters at Indore after his arrival, Scindia said he would try his best to take India forward in the civil aviation sector under prime minister Narendra Modi’s leadership.He also thanked Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda for his inclusion in the cabinet.Scindia, who is visiting the Malwa-Nimar region for the first time after becoming a Union minister, attended various programes in Dewas and Shajapur.Madhya Pradesh Water Resources Minister and his supporter Tulsiram Silavat was among those who welcomed him at the airport.Former Bhopal mayor and in-charge of Scindia’s yatra Alok Sharma said he performed puja at the Kshipra river and launched the yatra. At Dewas he also visited renowned classical vocalist late Kumar Gandharv’s residence and paid his tributes.Another newly-inducted Union minister from Madhya Pradesh, SP Singh Baghel, arrived at Datia on Monday and performed puja at the famous Peetambara Peeth shrine before embarking on Jan Ashirwad Yatra.Addressing a press conference in Gwalior, Baghel said prime minister Modi “gave identity” to MPs of SC, ST, and OBC communities by inducting them in the cabinet.“But the opposition parties did not even allow the introduction of a newly inducted minister in the House,  defying democratic traditions,” he said.Virendra Khatik, another Union minister, will set out on Jan Ashirwad Yatra in Gwalior district on Wednesday, a BJP spokesperson said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-concerned-with-welfare-of-only-one-family-jyotiraditya-scindia-298562
17-08-2021||---||Judges’ safety: SC imposes cost of Rs 1 lakh on several states for not filing affidavits||New Delhi, August 17The Supreme Court on Tuesday imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh each on several states, including Kerala, for their failure to file affidavits in a case relating to protection of judges and court complexes.A Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana -- which was annoyed over non-filing of responses by several state governments – allowed them to file their affidavits in 10 days subject to payment of Rs 1 lakh each with the Supreme Court Bar Association Advocates’ Welfare Fund.If they failed to file their affidavits within 10 days, “…we would be compelled to seek the presence of the Chief Secretaries of the concerned States,” the Bench said.The Bench asked if the Centre was willing to raise a force like CISF or Railways Protection Force for judges and judicial officers in the country.On behalf of the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the top court that it may not be “feasible” and “advisable” to have a national level security force like the RPF or CISF to guard judges across India.“We have said it may not be advisable or feasible to have a national level security force like CISF (Central Industrial Security Force) for judges,” Mehta said.The top court was hearing a PIL on safety and security of judges, lawyers and court complexes across India in the wake of alleged murder of a judge at Dhanbad in Jharkhand. It had sought affidavits from states detailing steps taken to ensure the judges’ safety and security.The Bench also allowed the Bar Council of India to be a party to the matter and file its response and listed it for hearing after 10 days.Mehta said the Union Ministry of Home Affairs had in 2007 issued guidelines. “We have issued guidelines and they are placed on record. Instead of creating a specialised or dedicated police force there is need to ensure fuller implementation of the guidelines of the MHA by states and union territories (UTs),” he said.As the Bench asked Mehta to call a meeting of all the states and take a decision to solve the problem, the Solicitor General said the meeting of either home secretaries or state police chiefs may be called.“You (Centre) are the best person to get this done. States are now saying they do not have funds for CCTVs. These issues you have to resolve between you and the states. We don't want these excuses,” the Bench said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judges-safety-sc-imposes-cost-of-rs-1-lakh-on-several-states-for-not-filing-affidavits-298558

17-08-2021||New Delhi||Plea in HC challenging Rakesh Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police chief, hearing on Wednesday||A plea has been filed in the Delhi High Court challenging the appointment of Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner and extension of his service by one year.The petition is listed for hearing on Wednesday before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh.The 1984-batch IPS officer, serving as the director general of Border Security Force, was appointed Delhi Police Commissioner on July 27, four days before his superannuation on July 31.The petition sought quashing of July 27 order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs appointing Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him.It further sought to initiate steps for appointing Delhi Police Commissioner strictly in accordance with the direction issued by the Supreme Court earlier.“The impugned orders (of MHA) are in clear and blatant breach of the directions passed by the Supreme Court of India in Prakash Singh case as (i) respondent no.2 (Asthana) did not have a minimum residual tenure of six months; (ii) no UPSC panel was formed for appointment of Delhi Police Commissioner; and (iii) the criteria of having a minimum tenure of two years has been ignored,” said the plea filed by Delhi-based advocate Sadre Alam.It claimed the High-Powered Committee comprising the Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister and the Leader of Opposition, in its meeting held on May 24, 2021, rejected the Central government’s attempt to appoint the same IPS officer (Asthana) as the CBI Director on the basis of the “six-month rule” as laid down by the Supreme Court in Prakash Singh.The appointment of Asthana to the post of Commissioner of Police, Delhi must be set aside on the same principle, it said.A petition with similar prayers has already been filed before the Supreme Court by NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation’, urging to direct the central government to produce the July 27 order it issued, approving the inter-cadre deputation of Asthana from Gujarat cadre to AGMUT cadre.The petition, moved by advocate Prashant Bhushan, has also urged the apex court to set aside the Centre’s order to extend Asthana’s service period.Another contempt plea in the apex court by advocate M L Sharma has been filed against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for appointing Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner in alleged violation of the judgement in Prakash Singh case.In his petition, Sharma has said that according to the apex court’s judgement of July 3, 2018, the process of appointment should begin three months prior to the vacancy and the person being appointed must have a reasonable period of service left.Besides the contempt action, the plea has sought a declaration from the apex court that the appointment of Asthana be held illegal “being contrary to the judgment dated July 3, 2018”.The top court had issued a slew of directions on police reforms in the country and ordered all states and Union Territories not to appoint any police officer as acting Director General of Police (DGP). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-hc-challenging-rakesh-asthanas-appointment-as-delhi-police-chief-hearing-on-wednesday-298550

The commandos came along with the Embassy staffers along with other Indian nationals," ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said.The commandos were taken away in brown-coloured ITBP buses from the Hindon airbase to the quarantine facility.A senior officer said the commandos also carried along their personal AK series assault weapons, bullet-proof jackets, helmets, communication gadgets, ammunition and three sniffer dogs.Thirty diplomats including Indian Ambassador to Afghanistan Rudrendra Tandon, 99 ITBP commandos and 21 civilians were onboard the C-17 Globemaster aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) that took off from the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul this morning and made a halt at the Jamnagar airforce base before touching down at Hindon in Ghaziabad near here in the evening, he said.There were four journalists among the 21 civilians, he said.The ITBP had deployed over 300 commandos for security duties in Afghanistan.The force was first deployed to secure the premises of the Kabul Embassy, diplomats and staffers in November, 2002.It later sent its additional detachments to similarly guard Indian consulates located in Jalalabad, Kandhar, Mazar-e-Sharif and Herat.The detachments from the consulates have already been withdrawn after they were shut recently due to the current crisis in the country and also due to negligible footfall as the coronavirus pandemic gripped the globe.The ITBP also was deployed to secure the Delaram-Zaranj road project that was executed by the Border Roads Organization (BRO) between 2005-08.A number of ITBP commandos were also killed in various terrorist attacks that took place during these duties and many of them were decorated with gallantry medals. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/99-commandos-3-sniffer-dogs-land-as-entire-itbp-detachment-returns-from-afghanistan-298549

17-08-2021|| Hyderabad||Telangana government announces Rs 10 lakh for every Dalit family in state||Telangana has taken the lead by announcing welfare for the Dalits that could improve the lot of those belonging to this stratum of society by announcing a Rs 10 for every Dalit family in the State.  Called the Telangana Dalit Bandhu scheme, the scheme has been described by Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) as “not merely an initiative aimed at Dalit empowerment, but a movement that should sweep the entire country for the betterment of the down-trodden communities”. Under Dalit Bandhu, every Dalit family in the State would be given Rs 10 lakh to start a business venture of their choice, without any bank linkages or facing the stress of having to return the money.  The Rs 10 lakh that would be deposited directly into the accounts of Dalit families will serve as capital to start a business, with the end goal being the economic empowerment of the entire SC community.  KCR announced the scheme at Shalapalli on the outskirts of Huzurabad, ahead of the yet to be announced Huzurabad by-poll. The constituency had fallen vacant after former state Health Minister Etela Rajender resigned from the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) party after he was stripped of his portfolio. He has since joined the BJP, and winning the by-poll has become a matter of prestige for both Etela and KCR. Telangana has a sizeable Dalit population, and according to the 2011 census, Dalits constitute 15.44 per cent of the people in State and STs 9.34 per cent. In Seemandhra, the Dalits account for 17.10 per cent and have a considerable influence on Telangana politics. Launching the scheme, KCR said, “Dalit Bandhu will bring about a qualitative change in the lives of SCs in the next four to five years. Though the scheme was planned for launch more than a year ago, it was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We will implement the scheme on the lines of Rythu Bandhu”. The entire SC population in the State, government employees included, will be eligible to avail the benefits of the scheme just as they are benefitting from the Rythu Bandhu programme for farmers. The scheme was being implemented as a pilot project in the Huzarabad Assembly constituency, where Rs 500 crore has already been released for its implementation. Another Rs 2,000 crore would be released soon to cover more than 21,000 Dalit families in the constituency within the next two months.The chief minister said his detractors had always raised doubts over all his initiatives ranging from the Telangana movement to free power and Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme to Mission Bhagiratha. But all these had greatly benefitted the people of the State.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-government-announces-rs-10-lakh-for-every-dalit-family-in-state-298535
17-08-2021||New Delhi||False rape allegations cannot be made to settle personal scores, need to be dealt with iron hand: HC||The Delhi High Court has said false allegations of molestation and rape cannot be made at the drop of a hat to settle personal scores and need to be dealt with an iron hand.Justice Subramonium Prasad, who was hearing a plea to quash an FIR alleging commission of offence of rape on the basis of a compromise between the parties, stated that besides resulting in loss of judicial time and time spent by the police in the investigation, false allegations of rape may destroy the life and career of the accused.“The accused in a false case of rape loses his honour, cannot face his family and is stigmatised for life. Allegations regarding offences such as one under Section 376 IPC cannot be made at the drop of a hat - in order to settle personal scores,” said the judge in his order dated August 16.Observing that there was an alarming increase in false cases of rape and offences “only to arm-twist the accused”, the court opined that “people who make such false allegations of rape cannot be permitted to go scot-free”.“False claims and allegations pertaining to cases of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Such litigations are instituted by the unscrupulous litigants in the hope that the other party will capitulate to their demands out of fear or shame. Unless wrongdoers are not made to face the consequences of their actions, it would be difficult to prevent such frivolous litigations,” the judge remarked.The court added that the problem of false allegations can be solved, or at least minimised, to a certain extent, if exemplary cost is imposed on the litigants for instituting frivolous litigations.While refusing to quash the FIR in the present case, the court said while it was not commenting on the merits of the allegations, if it is found that the allegations were not true, action should be taken against the prosecutrix and others who were instrumental.It noted that the parties involved in the present case had initiated cross-cases against each other for offences under Section 376 IPC.The court also said that quashing FIR for offences like rape on the basis of compromise will encourage the accused to put pressure on the victims and would open doors for the accused to get away with a heinous crime which cannot be permitted.

The Government of India is committed to provide enough vaccines to the states,” he told a press conference following the review meeting.On the prolonged second wave of the pandemic in the Northeast, the minister said the peak in the region was seen much later than the rest of India and so it was taking time to decline.“In the last two weeks, the cases have started declining in the Northeast and this is a good sign. All the states took various steps to contain the second wave and it is ending now,” Mandaviya said.

It gives the readers an insight into her life, how she dealt with her parents' arrest, and how she overcame her depression and anxiety.Indrani Mukerjea, who was arrested in August 2015, is facing trial for allegedly killing her daughter Sheena Bora.Bora (24) was allegedly strangled to death in a car by Mukerjea, her then driver Shyamvar Rai and Sanjeev Khanna in April 2012. Her body was burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district."This book is not a plea for sympathy, attention or anything else. I can't put into words what made me decide to write this book, all I can tell you is that I did. Certain things happen in one's life that you can't quite anticipate or prepare for....At the epicentre of the whole fiasco were my parents, and what got lost in the chaos was me," writes Vidhie in the book.It all began unfolding in 2015, on the eve of Vidhie's 18th birthday, when her mother was arrested for alleged murder of Bora."That day, I began to be seen as the child of the devil herself by so many people .. If losing one parent wasn't enough, four months later, Dad was brutally taken from me and thrown into prison on aiding and abetting charges, which threw me off a cliff, one hand clinging on," she recalls in the book.Vidhie's father, former media baron Peter Mukerjea, who was arrested for allegedly being part of the conspiracy, is currently out on bail granted by the high court earlier this year."From being a sheltered, privileged and loved child, I was suddenly thrust into an unforgiving world, alone, confused and devastated," she added.According to the publishers, the book, which can also be seen as a "self-help book", is a story of "resilience, of kicking this world right back in the face"."A cruel twist in reality that was both permanent and without warning. Vidhie wandered the globe in a bid to escape these surreal circumstances, backed by the unrelenting friendships of anxiety and depression. It was a journey that would lead to a profound appreciation for the beauty this world has to offer, even in the face of an ugliness no one should ever know," they said in a statement. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/daughter-of-indrani-mukerjea-pens-memoirs-298530

17-08-2021||New Delhi/San Francisco||Nearly 2 million terrorist watchlist records leaked online||A cybersecurity researcher has discovered nearly two million terrorist watchlist records, including "no-fly" list indicators, which were left exposed online last month.The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not remove them until three weeks later.Cybersecurity researcher Bob Diachenko came across a plethora of records that were exposed online."On July 19, I discovered a terrorist watchlist containing 1.9 million records online without a password or any other authentication required to access it," Diachenko said in a LinkedIn post on Monday.The watchlist came from the Terrorist Screening Center, a multi-agency group administered by the FBI."The TSC maintains the country's no-fly list, which is a subset of the larger watchlist. A typical record in the list contains full name, citizenship, gender, date of birth, passport number, no-fly indicator, and more," he wrote.The cyber security researcher reported the matter to the Department of Homeland Security, which acknowledged the incident."The DHS did not provide any further official comment, though," he said.The files were indexed by multiple search engines in an easily readable format. The exposed server was taken down about three weeks later, on August 9.The list was left accessible on an Elasticsearch cluster that had no password on it.The terrorist watchlist is made up of people who are suspected of terrorism but who have not necessarily been charged with any crime."If it falls in wrong hands, this list could be used to oppress, harass or persecute people mentioned on the list and their families. It could cause any number of personal and professional problems for innocent people whose names are included in the list," Diachenko said.There have been several reports of US authorities recruiting informants in exchange for keeping their names off the no-fly list. Some past or present informants' identities could have been leaked.The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) was set up by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2003.The TSC maintains a watchlist of suspected terrorists. The notorious no-fly list is a subset of the TSC watchlist. The watchlist is supposed to be classified, with access only granted to "agencies and officials who are authorised to conduct terrorist screening in the course of their duties".Prior to 2015, the watchlist was completely secret.

They now want an Army man as CM who will not spend his tenure filling his coffers but serve them," Kejriwal said at a public meeting in Dehradun, adding that his party will soon announce the first list of candidates for the assembly elections.He said under Kothiyal's leadership, AAP will make Uttarakhand the global spiritual capital for Hindus and open avenues for employment for the state’s youth.Kothiyal is  former principal of Uttarkashi-based Nehru Institute of Mountaineering. Presently, he runs an institute to train youths and motivates them to join the armed force.The choice of retired army personnel as Chief Ministerial candidate for Uttarakhand by AAP leadership is a strategic move.

17-08-2021||New Delhi||IIT Madras crosses 1,000-mark in patents generated by researchers and faculty in India, abroad||Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras has crossed the 1,000-mark in patents generated by it in India and abroad, officials said.The number of patents filed by the institute has also doubled in the last five years, with the US accounting for the highest number of patents filed outside India.As on March 31 this year, the total number of patents filed in India was 1,204 and the total number of international patents filed was 529. Of these, 155 patent applications were filed in the US. IIT-Madras bears 70 per cent of the cost of filing foreign patents with the inventor bearing the rest."Another significant factor was the large number of international patents (218) filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). The PCT assists applicants in seeking patent protection internationally for their inventions. By filing one international patent application under the PCT, applicants can subsequently seek protection for an invention in all the countries that are party to the PCT (153 countries, as on date)," said Ravindra Gettu, Dean, Centre for ICSR.Gettu said the Centre has undertaken many initiatives in the recent years to drive this increase in patents being filed in India and abroad."A dedicated IP Cell has been established at the Centre for Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research (ICSR), which conducts intellectual property (IP) awareness programme regularly to sensitise students or faculty on the importance of IP protection and monetisation," he said.Gettu said the institute has enabled patent filing through awareness campaigns among faculty members and students. "The processes have also been made easier and faster, without interfering in publications and thesis completion, which are often the primary focus of our researchers. Monetisation of IP is also a recent focus area to promote patenting and fund more developments," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-madras-crosses-1-000-mark-in-patents-generated-by-researchers-and-faculty-in-india-abroad-298510
17-08-2021||New Delhi||You are all winners and role models, PM Modi tells Tokyo-bound para athletes||"You are all winners and role models," Prime Minister Narendra Modi told India's top para athletes, who are set to compete in the upcoming Tokyo Paralympics.Modi virtually interacted with 10 athletes, including 2016 Rio edition gold winners Devendra Jhajharia and Mariyappan Thangavelu, and urged them to compete without pressure.He also spoke with the family members and coaches of the para-athletes. The Paralympics will be held between August 24 to September 5."In spite of all the difficulties in your lives, you did not lose heart and kept on fighting. By your hard work and strong will, you have reached this stage against all odds. You are going the represent the country in the biggest sporting stage," Modi said."You all are winners and role models. You should not play with pressure. I hope you all will give your best and medals will follow. You will make the country proud." India is sending a 54-member team -- the largest ever -- in the upcoming Tokyo Paralympics with hopes that the country will produce its best ever performance.The team has some of the brightest medal prospects like Jhajharia, seeking his third Paralympics gold (after 2004 and 2016) in F-46 javelin throw, Mariyappan (T-63 high jump) and world champion Sandeep Choudhary (F-64 javelin throw).India will compete in nine sports. Mariyappan, who had won a gold in the last edition in Rio, will be the flag bearer of the Indian contingent during the opening ceremony.Besides Jhajharia and Mariyappan, other para-athletes who took part in the interaction with the Prime Minister were Jyoti Balan and Rakesh Kumar (para archery), Soman Rana (para athletics), Palak Kohli and Parul Parmar (para badminton), Prachi Yadav (para canoeing), Sakina Khatun (para powerlifting) and Singhraj (para shooting).The Prime Minister said he is hopeful that the para athletes will create history at the Games.Talking about the overall development of a sporting culture in the country, Modi said the number of Khelo India Centers will be increased to 1000 from current 360 to tap local talent and groom them, especially in the rural areas."Our villages and remote areas are full of talent and the contingent of para athletes is a living example of that. Today the country is trying to reach the players, special attention is being paid to the rural areas."     "Equipments, grounds and other resources and infrastructure are being made available to the sportspersons. The country is helping its sportspersons with an open heart."We have to keep on improving our ways and system to develop sports culture in India, shed fears of earlier generations."       Modi said earlier giving facilities to 'Divyang Jan' was treated as part of welfare activities, but it is now considered as part of responsibility of the country."Laws like ‘The Rights for Persons with Disabilities Act' and initiatives like ‘Sugamya Bharat Campaign' are changing lives and giving confidence to numerous talents all over the country," Modi said. Sports Minister Anurag Thakur wished the athletes good luck, noting that para-athletes have performed impressively in the international events in the last few years."We have won 12 medals so far in the Paralympics. Our athletes have done very well in the international events in the last few years."I hope they will give their best and win laurels for the country."                India will start its campaign on August 27, with men's and women's archery events.

17-08-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court issues notice to Centre on Pegasus snooping row||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 17The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to respond to the petitions seeking an SIT probe into alleged snooping on politicians, journalists and activists using the Pegasus spyware.Issuing notice to the Centre, a Bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana posted the matter for further hearing after 10 days.The notice was issued after the Centre said it was willing to share details on the controversy with an expert committee but didn't want to make such information public due to national security implications."We need to think how to go ahead with the matter," the Bench said while issuing the notice.The Bench, however, made it clear that it didn't want the Centre to divulge information prejudicial to national security.An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware. It had also been reported that phones of a former judge of the Supreme Court and its registrars were allegedly intercepted using the spyware.Around 10 petitioners, including the Editors Guild of India and senior journalists N Ram and others, have sought an independent probe into the alleged snooping on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO's spyware Pegasus.During the hearing on Tuesday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Bench - which also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Aniruddha Bose - that it didn't want to file an additional affidavit in the matter as national security aspects were involved.Mehta, however, said, the Centre was willing to place the necessary details before the expert committee it proposed to set up to examine the issue.Maintaining that several kinds of softwares were used by agencies to check anti-national and terrorist activities, Mehta said no government would make public what software it's using as terror networks could misuse such information to escape tracking.The top court had on Monday sought to know if the Union Government wanted to file an additional affidavit clarifying if Pegasus spyware was used to snoop on politicians, journalists and activists even as it had said it could not compel the Centre to file such an affidavit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pegasus-snooping-row-298487

They were angry as the woman did not cut her relations with women from another family, with whom they are having a long-standing dispute. We have arrested all the four accused on the charges of assault and criminal intimidation," said Joysar.The victim woman was discharged from a hospital after treatment.As such incidents happened in the past too, Dahod police have launched a special awareness drive in rural areas.As part of the awareness campaign to stop violence against women, police had put hoardings at 100 places, said Joysar, adding theatre artists are also roped in to write and perform plays to spread awareness among tribals. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-tribal-woman-thrashed-four-held-after-video-clip-goes-viral-298486

Santosh Dev twice (1989 and 1991) went to the Lok Sabha from Tripura and five times from Assam’s Silchar,” Bhowmik, who along with several other Congress leaders quit the party and joined the TMC last month, said.Santosh Dev went to Tripura at the instance of the then PM, Rajiv Gandhi, and successfully managed a victory in the state in the 1988 Assembly elections. TMC functionaries in Tripura capital Agartala, however, say Santosh Dev, who died in 2017, still has admirers in Tripura.

The Congress denied receiving the letter.Dev (48) was Congress Lok Sabha MP from Assam’s Silchar in the 16th Lok Sabha. She lost the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Silchar and was named Mahila Congress chief.Sibal aims at Cong leadership: ‘Eyes wide shut’While young leaders leave, we ‘oldies’ are blamed for our efforts to strengthen it. The Congress party moves on with: Eyes Wide Shut. — Kapil Sibal, Congress leaderThe exit, yet in line with the recent ones of Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasada and previously Himanta Biswa Sarma, had some Congress leaders attack the top party brass for failing to act.Latent anxieties in the grand old party surfaced again today with former minister Kapil Sibal taunting the party saying it had eyes wide shut.“Sushmita resigns from primary membership of our party. While young leaders leave, we ‘oldies’ are blamed for our efforts to strengthen it. The party moves on with: Eyes Wide Shut,” Sibal tweeted, in his most caustic remarks on the Congress in recent times.Sibal, who hosted non-BJP leaders last week, has been in the eye of a storm for “acting out of line”.Though not new for the Congress, Sushmita’s exit has the party worried as it marks the first major switch within the opposition camp from Congress to TMC instead of Congress to the BJP. The move undermines Congress’ position within the non-BJP camp at a time when the TMC remains its principal challenger in the leadership race ahead of the 2024 General Election.“This exit is not routine. It opens doors for disgruntled Congress leaders who want to fight the BJP but believe that the Congress is not the right forum to do that. The fact that Sushmita saw TMC as a greater force than the Congress is a problem,” said a Congress functionary.Sushmita said she met TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee in Kolkata today and was “impressed by the vision and clarity he had about the party’s future”.

I can’t go by the trickery played by them. Due to oil bonds, the burden has come on our government, that’s why we are unable to reduce prices of petrol and diesel,” the minister told mediapersons during an informal interaction.Regretting that the Modi government did not issue a White Paper on the subject when it came to power in 2014, Sitharaman said, “The exchequer is burdened by interest payment on oil bonds floated by the UPA government. The present government has paid over Rs 70,000 crore in interest on oil bonds over the last five years.”The UPA government issued bonds to state-owned oil companies to make up for the difference in the artificially depressed retail prices of fuel and the actual imported cost. At that time, the oil price was over $100 per barrel in the international market.“If I didn’t have the burden to service those oil bonds, I would have been in a position to reduce excise duty on fuel,” she maintained.The minister said while the income tax portal was still not perfect, it was better than what it was. She was hopeful that the bugs in the new income tax portal would be sorted out over the next few days.“I have been reminding Infosys constantly… and Nandan Nilekani has been messaging me with assurances that it will be sorted out,” she said.Minister’s claim||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nirmala-sitharaman-rules-out-excise-duty-cut-on-fuel-298156

17-08-2021||---||CJI NV Ramana: Passing Bill without debate to reverse verdict on tribunals ‘serious’||New Delhi, August 16The Supreme Court on Monday made certain critical remarks against the Tribunals Reforms Bill, 2021, passed by Parliament without any debate, reviving the provisions struck down by the top court in Madras Bar Association’s case.“We have not seen any discussion in Parliament. Of course, Parliament has the prerogative to make laws. At least we must know why the government has introduced the Bill despite being struck down by this court... I have not come across any debate, which took place in Parliament (on the Bill). Please show us the debate — the reasons and all that,” a Bench led by CJI NV Ramana asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. The Bench, however, clarified it’s not commenting on Parliament’s proceedings.The tribunals Bill, passed by Parliament in the monsoon session abolishes nine appellate tribunals and revives provisions of an ordinance regarding conditions of service and tenure of tribunal members and chairpersons struck down by the top court.The Bench expressed concern over “disturbing trend” of the government not complying with its directions to fill vacancies in various tribunals. “It’s a serious issue... tribunals have to continue or shut down,” it told Mehta, who said the process was on for appointments to the Central Administrative Tribunal.The Bench gave 10 days to the Centre to fill the positions of 19 presiding officers, 110 judicial members, and 111 technical numbers in all the tribunals. Referring to a judgment passed by a Bench led Justice LN Rao, the Bench said tribunals can effectively function only if they function independent of executive control, which would inspire public confidence in them. “Can you show us the ministry note citing reasons for the Bill?” the CJI asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-nv-ramana-passing-bill-without-debate-to-reverse-verdict-on-tribunals-serious-298150

We will also get a clear picture,” a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta during the hearing on petitions seeking an SIT probe into the alleged use of Pegasus spyware for snooping. Mehta, who contended there was nothing to hide and the Centre would set up an expert committee to examine all aspects related to the scandal, asked if the petitioners would withdraw their petitions if the government filed an affidavit denying use of Pegasus spyware for snooping.“I ask myself if a one-page affidavit is filed saying Pegasus was not used, will they withdraw the pleas? The answer is no,” Mehta said, adding going into the matter on the basis of unsubstantiated reports may have “national security implications”.“We see you don’t want to take a stand,” the CJI said, deferring the hearing to Tuesday. “If Mr Mehta decides to file an affidavit, then we have nothing to say, or we will hear all of you,” the CJI added.Asserting that the government wasn’t reluctant at all, he said, “If it’s for fact-finding, then I am all for it. But if it’s for sensationalising something which is alien to Article 32, then I can’t help it. It looks like petitioners want to go somewhere else other than what the courts want to see.”On behalf of petitioners N Ram and others, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said the Centre’s affidavit didn’t clarify if the government or its agencies had used the spyware. “We don’t want the government, which might have used Pegasus or its agencies might have used it, to set up a committee on its own,” Sibal said.Sibal said countries such as Israel and France have started probes and the Indian government was saying, “Everything is fine.”An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware. It had also been reported that phones of a former judge of the Supreme Court and its registrars were allegedly intercepted.In its affidavit, however, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on Monday unequivocally denied the allegations levelled by various petitioners who have demanded an SIT probe into the matter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-clear-picture-on-pegasus-298126

17-08-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal second highest in people consuming alcohol: Study||West Bengal ranked second after Uttar Pradesh in terms of absolute number of people who consume alcohol, a joint study by economic research agency ICRIER and law consulting firm PLR Chambers said.According to the study, nearly 1.4 crore people in West Bengal consume alcohol, and this sector is among the top three revenue earners of the state.The price model in the state has been tweaked recently from a free market to a lowest ex-distillery price (EDP) and an increase in taxes has been witnessed, which is a major concern for the industry, the study said.It revealed that steep hikes in the market retail price have resulted in substantial decline of India Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) sales in the state.Therefore, even though the formula for calculation is lowest EDP, the excise duty has been hiked and this issue needs to be studied taking into account how consumers react to price changes, it said.The report found that India is one of the fastest-growing markets for alcoholic beverages globally, with an estimated market size of USD52.5 billion in 2020.The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8 per cent between 2020 and 2023. Production of alcoholic beverages increased by about 23.8 per cent during the period between 2015-16 and 2018-19 and the sector contributed to around 1.5 million jobs and generated around USD 48.8 billion in sales revenue in 2019, the study noted.Yet India is unable to become a large exporter like Chile, Argentina or China, it said.
