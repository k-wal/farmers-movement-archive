I welcome him to the BJP Pariwaar,” the CM said on Twitter.Borgohain, a legislator from Thowra constituency, and Bora were inducted into the party at its state headquarters where Assam BJP chief Bhabesh Kalita was present. Congress secretaries Amit Agarwal and Jubli Poddar Baishya and its media panellist Mriganka Jyoti Barua also joined the BJP.“I was worried about many internal issues in the Congress and these are likely to remain in the party. So, I have decided to switch over to the BJP and will serve people of the state under the leadership of our chief minister,” Borgohain said.He is the second Congress MLA to quit the party in less than three months from the formation of the new BJP-led government in the northeastern state. Four-time MLA Rupjyoti Kurmi had resigned as a legislator and was inducted into the BJP on June 21.He was the lone MLA from the Tea Tribe community in the Congress. Borgohain, who had first become an MLA from Thowra constituency in Sivasagar district in 2011, resigned from the Congress on July 30 citing that the “internal political atmosphere” within the party has been “changed”. He lost the 2016 assembly election but won the Thowra seat in the last polls held earlier this year. He defeated BJP candidate Kushal Dowari by 2,006 votes.The Congress accepted Borgohain’s resignation and wrote to Assam Assembly Speaker Biswajit Daimary to disqualify him as an MLA. He tendered his resignation from the House on Saturday. On July 28, the APCC served a show-cause notice to Borgohain and asked him to clarify his position on the media reports about his plan to join the BJP.Assam Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary Barnali Saikia Bora, who was the OSD to former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, had also resigned from the party.Since Sarma became the chief minister of Assam, several leaders of the opposition party have left it.Sarma had also quit the grand old party and joined the BJP in 2015.Jury Sharma Bordoloi, who was the Guwahati district president of the Congress, had also left the party recently and taken membership of the BJP on July 2.Former minister Rajib Lochan Pegu had resigned as the president of the Majuli district unit of the Congress on July 6, amid reports that he would also crossover to the saffron party. After Borgohain’s resignation from the assembly, the Congress’ strength in the 126-member House has come down to 27, while the BJP has 60 MLAs. The AIUDF has 16 legislators, the AGP nine, the UPPL five, the BPF three and the CPI(M) one. There is an Independent legislator. Two MLAs have died and two others resigned. Former Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who has become a minister at the Centre, is yet to submit his resignation paper in the assembly. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-congress-mla-sushanta-borgohain-ex-cm-tarun-gogois-osd-join-bjp-291431

The daily positive rate in the state is rising, and it was recorded at 0.55 per cent taking the active cases in the state to 9,069. As a result, the state government is contemplating several harsh measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Health officials had advised the government to restrict only fully vaccinated people into public places like restaurants, malls and cinema halls. “Only such stringent measures can prevent a third wave,” officials have told the government.Telangana Director of Public Health G Srinivasa Rao suggested that the state introduce a vaccine pass, allowing only people with such a pass into malls, movie theatres, and restaurants. “In the coming days, to protect ourselves and our children, there could be an informal mandate for people working in and visiting malls and other commercial establishments like restaurants and cinema theatres, that only if you get the vaccine, you will be allowed,” Srinivasa Rao said.  Predicting deep trouble unless such stringent measures are taken, Rao said some countries had already done this along with strictly enforcing Covid-19 protocol that includes wearing masks both outside and indoors.  “In the coming days, surveillance will be intensified at the borders, at airports and railway stations,” he said.  In three districts of Telangana where serosurveillance studies were conducted, 63 per cent of the population was found to have been exposed to the virus, he said, noting that the susceptible population of people who are yet unexposed or unvaccinated need to be more careful.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-may-introduce-vaccine-pass-for-entry-to-public-places-291419

01-08-2021||---||Congress ‘James Bond of spying’ when in govt; Pegasus a ‘fabricated issue’: Naqvi||New Delhi, August 1Attacking the Congress which has been protesting in Parliament demanding a discussion on the Pegasus snooping allegations, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Sunday said the party was “James Bond of spying” when in power and it now wants to waste Parliament’s time over “fake and fabricated” issues.Naqvi, who is the Rajya Sabha Deputy Leader, also accused the Congress and a few other Opposition parties of working with the policy of “rant and run” by making allegations and scooting off.In an interview with PTI, the Minority Affairs Minister said the government is ready to discuss all issues that are related to people and expressed hope that the impasse between the government and the Opposition will be broken allowing Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to function smoothly.Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have failed to transact any significant business, except passage of some bills, amid continued protests by Opposition parties over the Pegasus and farmers’ issues since the Monsoon session of Parliament commenced on July 19. The Opposition and the government are locked in a standoff with the former seeking a debate over the Pegasus issue.The senior BJP leader also rejected talk of the Parliament’s Monsoon session being curtailed and said there was no basis of such “rumours” as the session was scheduled till August 13 and business is listed till then.Asked if a middle path can be found to end the deadlock in Parliament, Naqvi said the Congress and a few other Opposition parties are adopting a “rant and run” formula and are not interested in participating in debate and discussion on people’s issues. “They first said that we want a discussion on corona but then later did not agree to it. They said we want a discussion on farmers and then did not agree on that. There has been the problem of floods in various parts of the country, they are not showing any interest in that also or on the price rise issue that they talk about,” he said. On the Opposition insisting on debating the Pegasus issue, Naqvi said they want to waste Parliament’s time on “fake and fabricated issues that have no identity” .“Without wasting time, IT Minister (Ashwini Vaishnaw) had made a statement and they had an opportunity to get a clarification in Rajya Sabha. But instead of taking a clarification they created a ruckus and adopted a violent attitude,” he alleged.Naqvi said most of the Opposition parties are interested in debate and discussion but unfortunately the Congress is trying to be their self-appointed head and in that attempt it is “propagating its own negative attitude as that of the Opposition”.“They (the Congress) are trying to hijack the thinking of even those opposition parties that are thinking on constructive lines. Congress is trying to become a self appointed leader of the Opposition,” the Rajya Sabha MP said.Naqvi said the Congress also tried to “mislead” people on the Rafale jets issue and wasted Parliament’s time and everybody knows what happened as they were exposed. “These people (Congress) were the James Bond of spying (when in power). They spin a web of spying when in government and when in opposition create a hullabaloo alleging surveillance,” Naqvi said, making a reference to the fictional super spy character that novelist Ian Fleming created on which several movies have been made.In the UPA time, their own finance minister had accused his government of spying on him, he said. “They want to create that atmosphere even now, though there is no substance in these allegations,” the minister asserted on the Pegasus snooping row.An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on a list of potential targets for surveillance using Israeli firm NSO’s Pegasus spyware.Opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, two union ministers—Prahlad Singh Patel and Railways and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw—businessman Anil Ambani, a former CBI chief, and at least 40 journalists are on the list on the leaked database of NSO. It is, however, not established that all the phones were hacked.The Congress and several other Opposition parties are demanding a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the allegations and also asking the government to come clean whether Pegasus spyware was used or not.Naqvi said the government has stated that it is ready to discuss all issues that are related to the people and the Opposition parties should give notices over it on which the Speaker in Lok Sabha and the chairman in Rajya Sabha will decide.The Rajya Sabha deputy leader said the government is reaching out to opposition leaders and there is no communication gap. “In a day, three-four times discussion is happening with opposition leaders but unfortunately what path the leadership of the grand old party wants to adopt is baffling,” he said.Asked about the Opposition’s charge of the government passing bills amid din without debate, Naqvi said they should look at their own history as to how many bills were passed by the UPA amid din.“The din during their time would have been due to Commonwealth,  2G spectrum scams, but they don’t have any issue.  It is an issueless Congress party,” he alleged.“We humbly request the Opposition to participate in debate and discussion. They can give notices on the issues they want to discuss and the speaker and chairman will allot time and day,” he said.On the call for Opposition unity during West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s Delhi visit recently, Naqvi said there are more than one dozen prime ministerial candidates in the Opposition with many leaders trying to project themselves as PM probables.“Opposition unity is good, we have no issues with it but neither they have leadership nor do they have a programme or policy. Their only programme or policy is (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi bashing,” he said.                       Modi bashing will not pay any dividends, Naqvi added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-james-bond-of-spying-when-in-govt-pegasus-a-fabricated-issue-naqvi-291414
01-08-2021||New Delhi||Boundary dispute: Northeastern states’ borders to be demarcated though satellite imaging||The Centre has decided to demarcate boundaries of the Northeastern states through satellite imaging to settle inter-state border disputes that are often becoming a cause of concern and sometimes even leading to violence.Two senior government functionaries said the task has been given to the North Eastern Space Application Centre (NESAC), a joint initiative of the Department of Space (DoS) and the North Eastern Council (NEC).The NESAC helps augment the developmental process in the Northeast region by providing advanced space technology support.The inter-state border disputes have come under fresh focus recently after five Assam Police personnel and a civilian were killed in clashes along the Assam-Mizoram border.The idea for demarcation of inter-state boundaries through satellite imaging was mooted by Union Home Minister Amit Shah a few months ago.Shah had suggested roping in NESAC for mapping the inter-state borders and forests in the Northeastern region and coming up with a scientific demarcation of boundaries between states.The Shillong-based NESAC is already using space technology for flood management in the region.Since there will be scientific methods in the demarcation of borders, there will no scope for any discrepancy and there shall be better acceptability of the boundary solutions by the states, the government functionaries said.Once the satellite mapping is done, the boundaries of Northeastern states could be drawn and the disputes could be resolved permanently, they said.Five Assam Police personnel and a civilian were killed and over 50 others including a superintendent of police were injured when the Mizoram Police opened fire on a team of the Assam officials on July 26 following clashes along the two states’ border.While the Mizoram government claimed that a 509 square-mile stretch of the inner-line reserve forest notified in 1875 under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873 belongs to it, the Assam side insisted that the constitutional map and boundary, drawn by the Survey of India in 1993, was acceptable to it.After a massive tussle in 2018, the border row resurfaced in August last year and then in February this year.However, the escalating tensions were successfully defused after a series of parleys with the intervention of the Centre.On June 5, two abandoned houses along the Mizoram-Assam border were burnt down by unidentified persons, fuelling tension along the volatile inter-state border.Nearly a month after this incident, a fresh border standoff cropped up again with both trading charges of encroachment on each other lands.The major objectives of the NESAC are: to provide an operational remote sensing and geographic information system-aided natural resource information base to support activities on development, management of natural resources and infrastructure planning in the region.It provides operational satellite communication applications services in the region in education, health care, disaster management support, and developmental communication.The other objectives include taking up research in the area of space and atmospheric science and establishing an instrumentation hub and networking with various academic institutions of the region.Also, to enable single window delivery of all possible space-based support for disaster management and to set up a regional level infrastructure for capacity building in the field of geospatial technology.

01-08-2021||New Delhi||Rainfall 7% below normal in July: IMD||After its vigorous revival in the first week of July that saw floods, cloudburst and landslides in several parts of the country, the Southwest Monsoon ended with a seven per cent deficit for the month, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday.The rainfall in July was minus seven per cent which comes to around 93 per cent of the Long Period Average, IMD Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said.Rainfall in the range of 96-104 is normal whereas precipitation in the range of 90-96 is classified as below normal.July recorded extremely heavy rainfall over coastal and central Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka. Several towns and cities in Maharashtra were deluged to very heavy rainfall which resulted in catastrophic events like landslides claiming scores of lives and damaging property.The north Indian states—Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh—also saw cloudburst events that claimed several lives.The national capital too recorded a very good rainfall activity.  But overall, the rainfall recorded for the month was seven per cent less.The IMD had predicted normal rainfall in July.“We had predicted normal rainfall for July which was somewhere around 96 per cent of the LPA. July brings maximum rain over the country, but there was no rainfall activity over north India until July 8 which could have been the reason behind the deficit,” Mohapatra said.The Southwest Monsoon arrived over Kerala on June 3, two days after its normal schedule. But it very rapidly covered the east, west, south and parts of north India by June 19.But after that it entered into a phase that witnessed a spell of no rainfall activity. It started reviving from July 8.The Southwest Monsoon reached Delhi on July 13 after a delay of 16 days and covered the entire country the same day.June received 10 per cent more rainfall than normal. Of the four-month rainfall season, July and August receive the maximum precipitation.Overall, the country has received one per cent less rainfall than normal from June 1 to July 31. The deficit was minus 13 per cent in the east and northeast subdivision of the IMD. Northwest India division which covers north India recorded a two per cent deficit.The south peninsula division which covers the southern states received 17 per cent more rainfall while the central India division that comprises west and central India recorded one per cent more rainfall than normal.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rainfall-7-below-normal-in-july-imd-291401

Now you should also be proud of them and the country,” the health minister tweeted in Hindi.“Have heard that you are also among the 13 crore people who have been administered vaccine doses in the month of July,” Mandaviya said.“But you did not say a word about our scientists, did not appeal to the public to get themselves vaccinated. This means that you are doing petty politics in the name of vaccination. Actually, the shortage is not of vaccines, but there is lack of maturity in you,” he said.The Congress has been raising the issue of shortage of vaccines in the country and has urged the central government to speed up inoculations, saying it is the only way to stop the third wave of Covid-19.The BJP has hit back at the opposition party, accusing it of encouraging vaccine hesitancy. —  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-slams-government-alleging-shortage-of-vaccines-health-minister-hits-back-291399
01-08-2021||Guwahati/Aizwal||Assam-Mizoram border clashes unacceptable, talks only solution: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma||Guwahati/Aizwal, Aug 1 (PTI) Six days after a violent clash between police forces of Assam and Mizoram claimed seven lives and injured over 50 people, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday said such incidents along the inter-state border are “unacceptable” to people of both the states and advocated a resolution through talks.Assam Chief Minister Sarma, who has been charged with criminal conspiracy and attempt to murder in an FIR by Mizoram Police, also spoke of keeping alive the spirit of the North East in a twitter post.The tweet comes after Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to both Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Mizoram CM Zoramthanga telephonically earlier in the day to defuse the border tension between the two Northeastern neighbours.“Our main focus is on keeping the spirit of North-East alive. What happened along the Assam-Mizoram border is unacceptable to the people of both states.“Honble CM @ZoramthangaCM had promised to call me post his quarantine. Border disputes can only be resolved through discussion,” Sarma said in his tweet.Amit Shah speaks to Himanta, Zoramthanga on Mizoram-Assam border tensionDespite an attempt by Shah to resolve the long standing border disuptes between Assam and its neighbours earlier this month through a meeting he chaired, at least six Assam Police personnel and one civilian were killed while defending a disputed boundary with Mizoram and more than 50 people injured, including the police chief of the district of Cachar.The Mizoram police had lodged an FIR against Sarma and six Assam officials under various charges, including charges of attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy, at Vairengte police station.The Assam Police has also issued summons to six officials of Mizoram government, including the deputy commissioner and superintendent of police of Kolasib district, and ordered them to appear at Dholai police station on Monday.However, on Sunday, the Chief Secretary of Mizoram has said the state’s chief minister had frowned on charges levelled against his Assam counterpart and indicated these are likely to be withdrawn.Ready to withdraw FIR against Assam CM Sarma, says Mizoram govtDespite an agreement hammered out on Wednesday night, by the Union home ministry to maintain calm on the border and to allow a neutral central police force to act as peace-keepers, the two states have continued to trade charges of reinforcing police pickets and of not refusing to honour the agreement which calls for pulling back forces from the border.Assamese local organisations which had soon after the clash announced an economic blockade of Mizoram have since lifted their ‘blokade’, but truckers afraid of possible violence have opted to either park their vehicles near the border in Cachar district’s Dholai or to circumvent the troubled boundary by taking a longer route through Tripura.Assam government on Thursday had also issued an unprecedented travel advisory asking people not to travel to Mizoram and advised people from the state working or staying there to “exercise utmost caution.”  Tension along the border with Mizoram in Cachar and Hailakandi districts of Assam have been escalating since October 2020 with frequent incidents of burning of houses and encroachment of land.The two states share a 164.6-km border between Assam’s Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts, and Mizoram’s Kolasib, Mamit and Aizawl districts.Both states have differing interpretations of their territorial border. While Mizoram believes that its border lies along an ‘inner line’ drawn up in 1875 to protect tribals from outside influence, Assam goes by a district demarcation done in the 1930s.--- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-mizoram-border-clashes-unacceptable-talks-only-solution-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma-291396
01-08-2021||Bengaluru||Policy ignition: India’s satellite navigation sector set for higher growth trajectory||India’s satellite-based navigation and augmentation services sector appears headed for a higher growth trajectory with the proposed ignition of a policy push towards effective development, operation and maintenance of such systems.The Department of Space (DoS) plans to devise a “comprehensive and substantive” national policy for satellite-based navigation—the Indian Satellite Navigation Policy - 2021 (SATNAV Policy - 2021).Its draft has now been hosted on the website of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for public consultation after which it would be placed before the Union Cabinet for final approval.It seeks to “Achieve self-reliance in satellite-based navigation and augmentation services with emphasis on assuring availability & quality, enhancing usage, working towards progressive evolution of the services and promoting research & development”.In the last few decades, there has been a phenomenal growth in the number of applications that rely on Position, Velocity and Time (PVT) services provided by space-based navigation systems, it was noted.With the advent of information and mobile phone technology, crores of users across India rely heavily on PVT based applications in virtually every walk of life.Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are space-based navigation systems that provide navigation signals across the globe.Currently, there are four GNSS—GPS from the USA; GLONASS from Russia; Galileo from European Union & BeiDou from China—offering PVT solution globally.In addition, there are two regional navigation satellite systems—NavIC from India and QZSS from Japan offering navigation signals for the defined coverage area.The navigation signals are offered free-to-air for a variety of applications ranging from air, space, maritime and land applications covering tracking, telematics, location-based services (using cell phone and mobile devices), automotive, survey, mapping & GIS and timing.GNSS also offer secured navigation signals exclusively for strategic applications of their respective countries as the free-to-air signals are susceptible to adversaries.There is a need for such secured services exclusively for the Indian strategic community also, according to the draft.The Government of India has, therefore, established a resilient and independent system - Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) which is totally under its control.Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) augment navigation satellite constellations by providing integrity and correction information via geostationary satellites.WAAS of USA, EGNOS of European Union, SDCM of Russia, SNAS/BDSSBAS of China offer these services in their defined coverage area.Government of India has also established a similar SBAS system—GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation-(GAGAN) for the Indian airspace.“Space based navigation /augmentation system is essentially a public good which has to be accessible to all users”, the DoS said.“Such a national infrastructure can only be provided by the Government”.Further, to strengthen Government’s ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative, it is essential to ensure continuity of NavIC and GAGAN services, upgrade the system considering the exponential technological advancements and also continue having the capability to operate in conjunction with other GNSS/SBAS, the draft said.So, it is pertinent to devise a comprehensive and substantive national policy for satellite-based navigation.The objective of the policy is to ensure guaranteed and continuous availability of free-to-air navigation signals for civilian uses and secured navigation signals for strategic uses in the defined coverage area.Another goal is to ensure guaranteed and continuous availability of SBAS for aviation safety in the defined coverage area.There is also a need to work towards progressive evolution of navigation signals and expansion of coverage for enhanced use.Focus would also be on technology development for enhancing the navigation satellite systems, and working towards compatibility and interoperability of Indian satellite navigation and augmentation signals with other GNSS/SBAS signals.Another aim is to promote Indian industry and academia to carry out research and development activities in the field of satellite navigation-based applications with emphasis on societal benefits.There is also a need to work towards facilitating global usage of Indian satellite navigation and augmentation systems, the DoS said in the draft.

01-08-2021||New Delhi||Over 24,000 children died by suicide from 2017 to 2019: NCRB data||Over 24,000 children in the age bracket of 14-18 years committed suicide from 2017-19, with failure in examination being the reason in over 4,000 such cases, according to government data.The consolidated data of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on children’s suicide was recently presented in Parliament.According to the data, as many as 24,568 children, including 13,325 girls, aged 14-18 years, died by suicide between 2017-19.In 2017, as many as 8,029 children in the age group of 14-18 years died by suicide. The number rose to 8,162 in 2018 and then further increased to 8,377 in 2019, it said.The highest number of deaths by suicide among children in this age bracket was reported from Madhya Pradesh at 3,115 followed by West Bengal at 2,802, Maharashtra at 2,527 and Tamil Nadu at 2,035.Failure in examination was given as the reason behind the suicide of 4,046 children, while marriage-related issue was the reason behind the suicide of 639 children, including 411 girls, according to the data.About 3,315 children died by suicide for reasons related to love affair, while illness was given as reason behind the suicide of 2,567 children.Physical abuse was given as reason for 81 children’s death.Death of a dear person, drug abuse or alcohol addiction, illegitimate pregnancy, fall in social reputation, unemployment, poverty and ideological causes or hero worshipping were other reasons given for the death of these children by suicide.Raising alarm over the probability of worsening of situation due to COVID-19 pandemic, child rights activists stressed on inclusion of life skill training in school curriculum and making mental health part of mainstream healthcare and wellness agenda.Commenting on how children’s psycho-social well-being is compromised, especially during times of stress, Puja Marwaha, CEO, CRY-Child Rights and You, said majority of children and adolescents who attempt suicide have a significant mental health issue/challenge, usually depression.“Among younger children, suicide attempts are often impulsive. They may be associated with feelings of sadness, confusion, anger, stress or problems with attention and hyperactivity. Among teenagers, suicide attempts may be associated with feelings of stress, self-doubt, pressure to succeed, financial uncertainty, disappointment, depression and loss. For some teens, suicide may appear to be a solution to their problems,” she said.She further said that issues related to mental health and psycho-social well-being of children and adolescents have increasingly become a crucial health and development priority.“We believe that all children and adolescents have a right to quality mental healthcare and psycho-social support mechanisms, and ensuring their mental well-being can go a long way in helping them grow to their full potential and become productive members of the society,” Marwaha told PTI.“We also urge the government, civil society, communities and families to come forward and join hands in contributing a robust mechanism towards prevention, therapy, treatment, rehabilitation services and inclusion of life skill training in school curriculum to help children and young adults deal with daily life stress and ensure that mental health becomes part of mainstream healthcare and wellness agenda, especially in such testing times,” she added.Akhila Sivadas, executive director, Centre for Advocacy and Research, said the adolescent and life skill education programme that took shape in early 2000 has been through a chequered past with its fortune fluctuating from great support in some phases to strong censure in others.“There was never clarity, consensus and confidence on how young people should be shaped, steered and enabled to deal with the numerous life challenges and predicaments they are likely to face,” she said.“It is not surprising that in the age of the internet without the necessary information, self-efficacy, support from a strong professional and personal ecosystem they are struggling to both understand and cope with and manage the multiple pressures and expectations. The latter has grown by leaps and bounds and not enough effort has been made to help them see through it with timely professional services and support and mitigate its worst fallouts,” she added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-24-000-children-died-by-suicide-from-2017-to-2019-ncrb-data-291384

Hence, I know the earlier UP very well. There was an atmosphere of fear in western UP because of which people were leaving the area, women felt unsafe, the land mafia was grabbing the land of the poor people, incidents of firing in broad daylight and riots were rampant,” Shah said.“In 2017, the BJP promised that we will make UP a developed state and also revamp its law and order. Today in 2021, I can say with pride that Yogi Adityanath and his team have taken UP to the top spot in terms of law and order,” he added.Shah said, “The BJP governments do not work on the basis of caste, families, or for the people who are close to them. The BJP governments work for the development of the poorest person and to revamp law and order.”        Shah credited Adityanath for effectively implementing development and welfare schemes in the state.“Today, in 44 development schemes, UP is on the top spot in the country. Making schemes is very easy, but implementing them, removing the intermediaries, and ensuring the benefits reach the beneficiaries without any bribe is very tough,” he said.Adityanath along with the Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma were present at the function.

Parents in cities value it,” Ansuiya, the first person from her family to have cleared Class 12, told PTI over the phone.“Some of the people in the village and nearby areas have also heard about my result. They are all happy but yet to comprehend the value of my result. But that is how it is,” she added, with a tinge of gloom in her voice.She said her father is a part-time farmer and a part-time labourer while mother is a home-maker. She has three elder brothers, one younger brother and two elder sisters.“The elder brothers studied till Class 8 after which they dropped out to support the family financially and started working as labourers. My sisters have not been to school. Only the younger brother is into studies and took his Class 12 exam this year,” Ansuiya said.The younger brother, who is 17-year-old, studied at a local state board-affiliated school in Mahoba, said the girl, who had been enrolled in Vidya Gyan, a residential-boarding school in Bulandshahr district in western Uttar Pradesh.Talking about her exam result, Ansuiya, who had scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10, said, “I was nervous before the results were announced but I am excited since then. I was hoping to improve on my Class 10 score but had not expected 599 out of 600.”Besides studies, she said she was part of the school Basketball team and a music band and enjoyed painting too.She credited her boarding school, teachers and friends for the extraordinary success. “If I had not got this platform (Vidya Gyan school), life certainly would have been different.”            She also expressed gratitude towards her Mahoba primary school teacher Mohan Lal, who had helped her apply in 2006 for the free of cost boarding school, an initiative of the Shiv Nadar Foundation.“My family was supportive at the time about my getting into a boarding school as I was the only child in the family who had shown some inclination towards education,” she said.Elated with her exam result, the girl said she now plans to go for graduation from the Delhi University and eventually get into the prestigious Indian Administrative Services (IAS).“I got an idea during school about how an IAS officer can work for development of places like my village, which are remote and far-flung. This way, one can work at the ground-level to improve society. I will prepare for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to get into the IAS,” Ansuiya said.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 12 results were announced on Friday.

01-08-2021||New Delhi||Court upholds CBI’s probe that ruled out foul play in Unnao rape survivor’s accident||A Delhi court has upheld the investigation conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that had ruled out any foul play in the Unnao rape survivor’s accident in 2019.In 2019, the rape survivor, her family, and lawyer were travelling in a car when it was hit by an over-speeding truck in Rae Bareli, killing two aunts and leaving her and the advocate critically injured.Pursuant to this, a murder case was filed against expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who was also awarded life-term imprisonment for raping the minor survivor, and nine others after her family filed a complaint alleging “conspiracy” behind the accident.Dismissing these allegations, District and Sessions Judge Dharmesh Sharma held that the objections of the complainant party read like an engrossing thrilling story but were based on mere surmises and conjectures.He further said that there are no grounds to suspect the fidelity, accuracy, and sincerity of the investigation conducted by the CBI and that the agency came out with a plausible version of the incident.Notably, the investigating agency had concluded that there was no evidence regarding criminal conspiracy hatched between those named in the FIR, including Kuldeep Sengar, and the truck driver or the cleaner or for that matter owner of the offending truck.Upholding the probe, the judge stated in an order dated July 31, “I have no hesitation in holding the findings of the CBI in the chargesheet, that there is no case against the accused persons so as to take cognisance and proceed against them under Section 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) read with Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), cannot be faulted.”The sessions judge, however, framed charges against the truck driver for causing death by negligence and doing an act to endanger human life, besides framing charges of criminal intimidation against Sengar and his associates.Besides this, on December 20, 2019, Sengar was sentenced to jail for the “remainder of his natural biological life” in a separate case for raping the minor in 2017.On March 4, 2020, Sengar, his brother, and five others were also convicted for the death of the rape survivor’s father in judicial custody and were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.

The Chinese were learnt to be unwilling to discuss troop build-up in Depsang plains, said an official.Round 12 of Army talksOrganised at the Moldo garrison of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China, it was the 12th round of senior military level talks between the two sides since June 6 last year. Moldo faces Chushul on the Indian side.A formal announcement of the outcome, if any, was expected after the Indian side returned to its base and the decision was conveyed to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). The MEA is the coordinator of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs. The WMCC is a group comprising representatives of the foreign ministries and the militaries of the two sides.Lt Gen PGK Menon, 14 Corps Commander, led the talks from the Indian side. Once Lt Gen Menon along with his team returned to Chushul from Moldo, he was expected to head back to his headquarters at Leh, a 4-hour journey in normal weather conditions.The 12th round of military talks took place over two weeks after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar firmly conveyed to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that the prolongation of the existing situation in eastern Ladakh was visibly impacting the bilateral ties in a “negative manner”.The two foreign ministers had held a one-hour bilateral meeting on the sidelines of a conclave of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Tajik capital city Dushanbe on July 14.In the meeting, Jaishankar had told Wang that any unilateral change in the status quo along the Line of Actual Control was “not acceptable” to India and that the overall ties could only develop after full restoration of peace and tranquillity in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/10-hour-talks-at-moldo-as-india-china-discuss-pullback-of-troops-291036

01-08-2021||NEW DELHI||Exporters seek govt help amid global container crisis||Exporters have called on the government to ask Indian shipping lines to lease containers for them as a worldwide supply chain imbalance has led to skyrocketing freight prices. The shortages are significant for Asian countries as a large number of containers have accumulated in western ports, mainly in the US.No manufacturing unit in countryAt present, container services to and from India are operated by foreign shipping companies. Exporters have asked the government to bring in Indian shipping lines into the business. This will not only help alleviate the problem of delayed shipments for exporters but be a good source of revenue for the companies, said Arun Kumar Garodia, entrepreneur and vice chairman of the Engineering Export Council of India.“The balance in the world market has been disturbed. Asia was the first to recover and started sending shipments but North America and Europe went into shutdown, leading to the piling of containers at their ports. In addition, the manufacturing rate of containers had slowed since 2019 and further fell with the world wide shutdown in early last year,” explained Garodia.India has no container manufacturing unit and is entirely dependent on China. The government was jolted by the persistence of the shortage and has announced that Bhavnagar will be the hub for container manufacturing in India. But so far, one entrepreneur has shown interest and it will take time for the production to go on stream, said a source.The container shortage has jacked up rates by four to six times not only from India but other Asian ports as well, including in China. Exporters in India also have to endure waiting time of 15 days as against just one day earlier. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) has confirmed that a 40 ft container to the US now costs at least $6,000 as against $2,000 earlier. Shipments to Europe now cost $5,000 per 40 ft container as against $1,200 earlier. The shortage has also impacted shipments to North Africa.Till the government steps in or the crisis resolves itself, exporters will have to deal with dented margins due to high freight rates as well as grapple with delayed payment cycles.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/exporters-seek-govt-help-amid-global-container-crisis-291075

Then Permanent Representative to the UN and now Union Minister Hardeep Puri had listed counter-terrorism as India’s main agenda during that time. This time, reflecting Indian foreign policy’s expanding footprints after a decade, maritime security, peacekeeping and counterterrorism will be the focus areas.“It is a singular honour for us to be presiding over the Security Council the same month when we are celebrating our 75th Independence Day,’’ said Tirumurti in a video message. India’s two-year term as a non-permanent member of the UNSC began on January 1, 2021 and will last till December 31, 2022. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-assume-presidency-of-unsc-today-291079
