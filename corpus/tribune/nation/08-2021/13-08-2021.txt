With another judge—Justice Navin Sinha—scheduled to demit office on August 18, judicial vacancy will rise to 10 in the Supreme Court where 69,476 cases are pending.The Collegium consists of five senior-most judges, including the CJI, for appointment of judges to the Supreme Court while it’s CJI-plus two senior-most judges for clearing the names for appointment of judges to high courts.The Collegium has failed to recommend names for appointment of judges to the Supreme Court after August 28, 2019, when it made its last recommendations.Justice RF Nariman—who demitted office on Thursday—had reportedly insisted on elevation of two senior-most HC judges—Karnataka HC Chief Justice Abhay S Oka and Tripura HC Chief Justice Akil Kureshi—to the top court before any other names were cleared for elevation.Because of the stalemate, the Collegium led by the then CJI SA Bobde could not recommend any names for elevation to the top court between November 18, 2019, and April 24, 2021, despite having vacancies.After Justice Narimman’s retirement, the SC Collegium will consist of CJI NV Ramana Ramana, Justice UU Lalit, Justice AM Khanwilkar, Justice DY Chandrachud and the new entrant—Justice LN Rao. Will the deadlock end now?The Supreme Court Bar Association president Vikas Singh said, “The way the Collegium system is functioning, it’s better that we revert to the old system as neither there is transparency nor are they able to decide names for elevation. A large number of vacancies in the Supreme Court and high courts don’t inspire confidence in the Collegium system.”He said the top court has failed to implement its verdict in the NJAC case that had specifically talked about having transparency in the Collegium’s functioning.According to “Vacancy Positions” displayed on the Department of Justice website, 455, i.e., 41.43 percent of 1,098 posts of judges in 25 high courts are vacant.Many of the high courts have 50 per cent or more vacancies. In the Patna High Court—34 of 53, the Calcutta High Court—41 of 72, the Orissa High Court—14 of 27, the Rajasthan High Court 27 of 50, the Telangana High Court 29 of 42 and Delhi High Court 30 of 60 posts remain vacant.Similarly, in the Allahabad High Court 60 of the 160, the Bombay High Court 31 of 94, the Gujarat High Court 24 of 52, the Andhra Pradesh High Court 18 of 37, the Punjab and Haryana High Court 39 of 85 and Madhya Pradesh High Court 24 of 53 posts of judges have not been filled.However, smaller high courts of Sikkim, Meghalaya and Manipur don’t have any vacancies while the Tripura High Court has only one vacancy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-judicial-vacancies-galore-questions-over-functioning-of-collegium-system-297165
13-08-2021||New Delhi||Communal sloganeering at Jantar Mantar: Court denies bail to three, says remarks undemocratic||A Delhi court has denied bail to three persons arrested in connection with the communal slogans allegedly raised during a protest at the Jantar Mantar here, saying one of them can be seen making “scathing” and “undemocratic” remarks.The judge noted that while accused Deepak Singh was seen making the remarks which were “uncalled for from a citizen of this country where principles like secularism hold the value of basic feature imbibed in the Constitution”, accused Preet Singh was seen with him in the rally and accused Vinod Sharma was also present at the venue at the time of the alleged offence.A video allegedly showing anti-Muslim slogans being raised during a protest at Jantar Mantar here was widely circulated on social media, following which the Delhi Police registered a case on Monday.Metropolitan Magistrate Udbhav Kumar Jain refused to release the accused persons on bail on parity with co-accused and former BJP spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay, who was granted bail on Wednesday, saying that they stood on a different footing from him.“In one of the clippings, accused, as identified by the IO (investigating officer) in the video clipping, can be seen making scathing remarks which are undemocratic and uncalled for from a citizen of this country where principles like secularism hold the value of basic feature imbibed in the Constitution,” the judge said in the order passed on Thursday.The judge saw the alleged video clippings and played some part of it in open court also.He said that freedom to express oneself was indeed allowed to be enjoyed by the citizens to the fullest possible extent, yet with every right there was a corresponding duty attached.“The principle behind Section 153A IPC is to preserve religious/ communal harmony and it is the duty of every citizen that while he enjoys his right to express himself, he preserves religious harmony. This indeed is the positive aspect of secularism,” he said.The court said it could not check the veracity of those video clippings at present, which was a matter of appreciation of evidence to be done at later stage.“Besides, there is no time stamp available at this stage on these video clippings for which proper investigation has to be done. This court cannot interfere with the ongoing investigation,” the judge said.The accused persons were represented by advocate Ashwani Dubey.The court had on August 11 granted bail to Upadhyay saying there was nothing on record to show that the slogans were raised on his behest, or that he was present at the spot at the time of the offence.Hundreds of people had attended the protest organised by ‘Bharat Jodo Aandolan’ at Jantar Mantar on Sunday.Shipra Srivastava, media in-charge of Bharat Jodo Aandolan, had said the protest was held under the leadership of Upadhyay.However, she denied any links to those who raised anti-Muslim slogans.Upadhyay too denied any involvement in the anti-Muslim slogan shouting incident.The video allegedly shows a group of people shouting inflammatory slogans and threatening Muslims during the protest at Jantar Mantar. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/communal-sloganeering-at-jantar-mantar-court-denies-bail-to-three-says-remarks-undemocratic-297164

The bus fell into a deep ravine after the explosion. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistans-allegations-against-india-on-terror-attack-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-lies-mea-297153
13-08-2021||New Delhi||Over 50 lakh domestic air passengers in July, 61 pc higher than June: DGCA||Around 50.07 lakh domestic passengers travelled by air in July, 61 per cent higher than the 31.13 lakh who travelled in June, the country’s aviation regulator said on Friday.According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), 21.15 lakh people and 57.25 lakh had travelled within the country by air in May and April, respectively. The sudden drop in domestic air traffic in May was due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic that had badly hit the country and its aviation sector.While IndiGo carried 29.32 lakh passengers in July, a 58.6 per cent share of the domestic market, SpiceJet flew 4.56 lakh passengers, accounting for a 9.1 per cent share of the market, according to the data shared by the DGCA.Air India, Go First (previously known as GoAir), Vistara and AirAsia India carried 6.7 lakh, 3.42 lakh, 4.07 lakh and 1.65 lakh passengers, respectively, in July, the data showed.The occupancy rate or the load factor of the six major Indian airlines was between 53.6 per cent and 74.6 per cent in July, it stated.The occupancy rate for SpiceJet was 74.6 per cent in July, the DGCA noted. The occupancy rates for IndiGo, Vistara, Go First, Air India and AirAsia India were 66.2 per cent, 69.2 per cent, 67.1 per cent, 64.3 per cent and 53.6 per cent, respectively, it added.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the pandemic.India resumed domestic passenger flights on May 25 last year after a gap of two months due to coronavirus.Indian airlines are allowed to operate a maximum of 72.5 per cent of their pre-pandemic domestic flights.The DGCA data mentioned that in July 2021, IndiGo had the best on-time performance of 97.3 per cent at four metro airports—Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai.AirAsia India and Vistara were at the second and third positions at these four airports in July with 96.8 per cent and 95.1 per cent on-time performance respectively, the DGCA said.All airlines in India have opted for cost-reducing measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and layoffs in order to tide over the coronavirus-induced crisis.

13-08-2021||Chennai||DMK government presents first budget, AIADMK boycotts||Given the COVID-19 pandemic scenario, the time is not yet ripe for fiscal consolidation, the Tamil Nadu government said in its revised budget (2021-22) presented on Friday in the Assembly and targeted the previous AIADMK regime for  “half baked” projects to provide economic stimulus and “lax” tax administration.Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, presenting the Revised  Budget Estimates (RBE), said the revenue deficit (2021-22) is expected to go up from the “unrealistic” Interim Budget Estimates  (IBE) of Rs.41,417.30 crore to Rs.58,692.68 crore in the RBE.A fiscal path is being laid to reduce the revenue deficit in a phased manner and thereby enhance the allocation for creation of  productive assets.The government plans to borrow a net amount of Rs.92,484.50 crore during 2021-22, he said.One of the key causes for the loss of revenue is the lax tax administration over the past decade, he said.“We are confident that through improved administration and plugging leakages, revenue collections can be substantially stepped up.”The previous AIADMK government, which was in power from May 2011-April 2021 had presented the interim budget in February this year.This is the first budget by the DMK government, also the first paperless budget in Tamil Nadu, since assuming power in May after a 10-year stint in opposition.The main opposition party AIADMK staged a walkout and boycotted the proceedings.Thiaga Rajan said though estimates pointed to a negative national growth rate of 7.3 per cent, Tamil Nadu’s GSDP is poised for a positive growth at 2.02 per cent (2020-21) at constant prices and it showed the state economy’s resilience.In the guise of boosting capital expenditure to provide economic stimulus during the pandemic, the previous government had sanctioned several “half baked and ill thought out projects in the last minute” in the highways and irrigation sectors and for urban local bodies, the Minister said in his maiden budget presentation.“We have made a careful analysis of such projects. Only genuinely beneficial projects justified on the basis of detailed cost benefit analysis will be implemented.”Accordingly, the overall capital outlay (RBE 2021-22) has been scaled down to Rs.42,180.97 crore from the Rs.43,170.61 crore  provided in the IBE, which is a 2.29 per cent decline.On this basis, the fiscal deficit (2021-22) is estimated to be at Rs.92,529.43 crore in the RBE and at 4.33 per cent of GSDP  it would still be within the overall norms prescribed by the  15th Finance Commission.The total revenue receipts of the state including central transfers, are estimated to be Rs.2,02,495.89 crore in  RBE as against the IBE of Rs.2,18,991.96 crore in 2021-22.The State’s Own Tax Revenue (SOTR), estimated to be Rs.1,35,641.78 crore in the IBE is projected to decrease  to Rs.1,26,644.15 crore in the RBE.The State’s Own Non-Tax Revenue has been estimated at Rs.14,139.01 crore in the RBE, showing a decline of  9.65 per cent compared to IBE.The revenue expenditure is estimated at Rs.2,61,188.57 crore in the RBE revealing a marginal increase of growth of 0.30 per cent over IBE.The Minister said targeted actions would be taken against tax evasion based on advanced data analytics. The total number of roving squads will be increased to 100 and equipped with vehicles and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) reading devices to prevent movement of vehicles without bills.“Stringent action including criminal action will be taken against tax evaders.”An effective Samadhan Scheme would be launched to clear the pending dues of Rs.28,000 crore under Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax and other legacy legislation, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dmk-government-presents-first-budget-aiadmk-boycotts-297146
13-08-2021||Pune||SII chairman Poonawalla against using cocktail of Covid-19 vaccines||Serum Institute of India (SII) chairman Dr. Cyrus Poonawalla said on Friday he was not in favour of administering two different coronavirus vaccines for better efficacy.Poonawalla, whose firm makes the Covishield vaccine, was speaking to reporters after receiving the Lokmanya Tilak National Award here."I am against the mixing of two different vaccines. There is no need to mix two different vaccines," he said when asked about a recent ICMR study that a cocktail of Covishield and Covaxin could generate better immunity."If cocktail vaccines are administered and if the result is not good, then SII may say that another vaccine was not good, vice versa, the other company might say that since you mixed Serum's vaccine, it did not give desired results," Poonawalla said.The efficacy of this approach has not been proven in field trials involving thousands of participants, he added.A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research involving 98 people, 18 of whom had inadvertently received Covishield as the first dose and Covaxin as the second in Uttar Pradesh showed that combining vaccines elicited better immunogenicity. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sii-chairman-poonawalla-against-using-cocktail-of-covid-19-vaccines-297138

He has further submitted that at this stage, he cannot conclusively say as to whether the victim child was raped or not,” the court noted in the order passed on August 12.Disclosure statements of the accused persons before police, unless supported by other evidence, is not admissible under law.Special Judge Ashutosh Kumar, meanwhile, awarded Rs 25 lakh as “interim relief” to the mother of the child for the loss of her daughter’s life.The court, however, did not grant further interim relief on the additional ground of the alleged rape of the victim, in view of the submissions of the IO and “in view of the fact that the investigating agency itself is not sure as to whether the victim was raped or not, the interim compensation qua the same is not allowed at this stage.”          The judge granted the liberty to the parties concerned to move a fresh application regarding compensation for rape, in case the investigating agency collects further material or comes to the conclusion that the victim child was raped.A per the government scheme, the maximum compensation awardable in case of loss of life is Rs 10 lakh. The court granted 25 per cent of the compensation amount as interim relief.The court, meanwhile, sent the four accused, who were all known to the girl’s mother, to 14-day judicial custody.According to the FIR, the minor girl was raped, murdered and then cremated without her parents’ consent.The case was recently transferred to the crime branch of Delhi Police.Delhi Police registered a case against the four accused on the basis of the statement of the minor’s mother, who alleged that her daughter was raped, murdered and cremated without family’s consent on August 1.The accused have been booked under Sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, along with the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the SC/ST Act.

13-08-2021||New Delhi||‘A suitable couple’: Justice Leila Seth and her husband had together pledged to donate organs||Premo Seth, a footwear industry leader and father of celebrated author Vikram Seth, died at 97 recently, but in a noble act he had donated his organs before his death for medical research, his family said.His wife, justice Leila Seth, who had died in May 2017, had also donated her eyes and other organs for transplant or medical research purposes before her demise.“Both my parents had together pledged to donate their organs.  Though, physically we have lost them both, we feel they continue to live on through us (their children and grandchildren) and hope will further continue to live on through science and research, for which they both donated their organs,” their younger son Shantum Seth told PTI over phone on Friday.Incidentally, August 13 is observed as World Organ Donation Day to raise awareness about it and encourage people to donate organs.Premnath Seth, better known as Premo Seth, and by virtue of his distinguished career with shoe-major Bata, was also affectionately called ‘Bata Man’. He died on August 5 due to age-related complications, his son said.Shantum, 64, who is currently in the US, said both his parents were born before India’s Independence and endeavoured to contribute to the nation-building in their own ways.“Dad, who always greeted people with a smile, would have turned 98 this December. Mumma had died aged 86. Both lived a fulfilling life and were pioneers and trailblazers in their own ways. While my mother, who started her legal career as a barrister, went on to become the first woman chief justice of a high court in India, my father benefitted the footwear industry with his able leadership,” he recalled.Shantum, who teaches Buddhist spirituality, said the Seths had a great fondness for Patna as they both spent the early parts of their careers in the Bihar capital.While Leila Seth started her legal practice in 1959 at the Patna High Court, as a young London-trained barrister, and spent 10 years there, seeking a foothold in a field dominated by men, her husband, worked as a manager of the Bata factory in Digha area of Patna.The couple lived in a beautiful colonial-era white bungalow ‘White Pillars’, the official residence of the Bata factory manager in Patna, and were known in the city for being warm hosts. In her autobiography, ‘On Balance’, she has described about their Patna days.“My father was a visionary man and he was actually sent to Patna to close down the factory as it was running into losses. But, instead he turned its fortune around and served the company there for a decade, before moving to Calcutta and then to Delhi,” Shantum recalled.“Our entire family has fond memories of Patna days, but our parents particularly missed the ethos of the city that was in the 60s. My elder brother Vikram too has fond memories of Patna days,” he added.The younger son recalled that Premo Seth was also instrumental in setting up of the Footwear Design and Development Institute (FDDI) in Noida, and also worked with Handicrafts and Handlooms Export Corporation of India, besides serving as a consultant for many firms.“Even at 97, his eyesight was pretty good. And doctors came to take his eyes on the day of his death on August 5, and the next day his entire body was taken. So, like mumma no cremation was held for my father too. We held an online memorial for our parents a few days ago,” Shantum said.Besides, Vikram and Shantum, the Seths are also survived by their daughter Aradhana.Asked how will he remember their parents, Shantum said, “Their values are ingrained in us, whether its justice, fairness, hard work, and not to discriminate, integrity. Both had great human values and had liberal outlook of the world”.            In her stellar career, Leila Seth rose through the ranks to become the country’s first woman chief justice of a high court (Himachal Pradesh) and broke many a glass ceiling in the process while earning respect and admiration, both in the courtroom and outside.She was the first woman from India to have topped the London Bar exam and her younger son Shantum was born there while she was studying after her marriage.The British press had hailed her triumph, describing Seth as ‘Mother in Law’.The eminent jurist, much admired in the field of law and in other professions, had championed sharper legislation for women.Seth was one of the three members of the Justice Verma Committee, which was constituted after the December 16, 2012, gangrape in Delhi, for recommending legal amendments for quicker trials and enhanced punishments for criminals accused of committing sexual assaults against women. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-suitable-couple-justice-leila-seth-and-her-husband-had-together-pledged-to-donate-organs-297133
13-08-2021||New Delhi||BJP rebels in touch with us, but Congress not in a hurry: Harish Rawat||The Congress in Uttarakhand is adopting a wait and watch policy in the wake of the internal rift in state BJP in the run-up to the Assembly elections scheduled early next year.Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister and the chairman of Congress’ campaign committee, Harish Rawat, told IANS, “The Congress is not in a hurry to take any decision on BJP rebels. However, many of them are in touch with us and a final call will be taken at an appropriate time”. Though he did not disclose any names, sources said that those who had jumped ship from the Congress to the saffron camp are eyeing a comeback, while some from the BJP too are looking to join the party, though the Congress will only back those who will prove to be beneficial to the party.Many prominent leaders, including ex-Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, former ministers Harak Singh Rawat, Satpal Maharaj, and Yashpal Arya had left the Congress for the saffron party, but some of them are reportedly upset ever since the BJP last month appointed Pushkar Singh Dhami as the new Chief Minister of Uttarakhand.Rawat alleged that the BJP has changed three chief ministers in the state in recent times and its leaders are fighting for themselves, and not working for the state.Stating that there is no dearth of issues in the state as unemployment and inflation are on the rise, Rawat said the government is in a denial mode, but the public is very much aware of the hardships they are facing.Rejecting BJP’s charge of neglect during the 2013 Kedarnath floods when the Congress was in power in the state and he was the Chief Minister, Rawat said that relief and rehabilitation works were carried out during the Congress tenure.He also said that the BJP should instead talk about its Covid mismanagement and the subsequent rise in unemployment in the state.Rawat further said that ahead of the Assembly elections scheduled next year, the Congress will come up with a roadmap and tell the people how it will work for their benefit.Rawat was recently appointed as the head of the Congress campaign committee in Uttarakhand. He is also likely to be projected as the chief ministerial face in the run-up to next year’s election.Interim Congress President Sonia Gandhi recently appointed Ganesh Godiyal as the party’s Uttarakhand unit chief, replacing Pritam Singh who was named the legislative party leader.Jeet Ram, Bhuwan Kapri, Tilak Raj Behar, and Ranjeet Rawat have been appointed as the party’s working presidents in Uttarakhand.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-rebels-in-touch-with-us-but-congress-not-in-a-hurry-harish-rawat-297131

13-08-2021|| New Delhi||After Twitter, NCPCR demands action against Instagram profile of Rahul Gandhi||After Twitter, apex child rights body NCPCR on Friday asked Facebook to take action against the Instagram profile of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for posting a photo of the family of the nine-year-old girl, who was allegedly raped and murdered in southwest Delhi, saying it violated the law.Also read: Twitter biased, interfering with Indian politics by shutting his account, says Rahul GandhiOn August 4, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) wrote to Twitter, asking it to take action against the handle of Gandhi for posting the photo of the family.The microblogging site blocked the account of Gandhi following the complaint. Twitter has said it has followed the due process as Gandhi’s tweet on the family of the victim was against its rules and the law.In a letter to Facebook on Friday, the Commission said it has come across a video posted on the Instagram profile of Gandhi wherein the identity of the victim minor girl’s family has been disclosed.In this video the faces of the father and the mother of the deceased girl can be clearly seen, which is in violation of the prescribed provisions of law, it added.Instagram, a photo and video-sharing social networking platform, is owned by Facebook.The NCPCR asked Facebook for taking appropriate action against the Instagram profile of Gandhi over violation of provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and the Indian Penal Code, and demanded the removal of the video from the platform.Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, prohibits the disclosure of identity of a child in any form of media and Section 23 of the POCSO Act, 2012, also states that no information or photo of a child should be published in any form of media which could reveal the identity of the child. This information under Section 23 of the POCSO Act includes his/her name, address, photograph, family details, school, neighbourhood or any other particulars which may lead to disclosure of identity of the child.“Therefore, posting of the video of the minor victim’s family on social media platform-Instagram has been observed by the Commission to be a violation of Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, Section 23 of the POCSO Act, 2012, Section 228A of the IPC and the guidelines of the Hon’ble Court as well.“In view of the same, the Commission deems it appropriate to take suo-moto cognisance under Section 13(1) and notice under Section 14 of the CPCR Act, 2005 in this matter,” the NCPCR said.“Accordingly, the link to the Instagram video is being forwarded for taking appropriate action against the Instagram profile of Rahul Gandhi for violation of provisions of JJ Act, 2015, POCSO Act, 2012 and IPC and removal of the Instagram video from the platform,” it added.Gandhi last week met the family of the nine-year-old girl and asserted that he is with them on the path to justice and “will not back down even an inch”.Later, he posted a picture of his meeting with the girl’s parents on Twitter and wrote in Hindi, “Parents’ tears are saying only one thing their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice. And I am with them on this path to justice”.The girl died under mysterious circumstances when she went to get water from a cooler at a crematorium in the Old Nangal area in southwest Delhi. The girl’s parents alleged that she was raped and her body forcibly cremated by a crematorium priest who had falsely claimed that she was electrocuted.Hundreds of locals, including the victim’s parents, have been staging a protest near the site of the incident, demanding capital punishment for the accused.

13-08-2021||Johannesburg||Gupta family was ‘ensconced’ in state capture: South African President Ramaphosa||South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has conceded for the first time that divisions within the ruling African National Congress prevented appropriate action against the influential Gupta family from India for their alleged involvement in massive state capture.While appearing before the State Capture Commission on Thursday as the deputy president and president of South Africa, Ramaphosa, while referring to the Gupta family, said key people were strategically placed and that played a role in fully capturing the state.“They had ensconced themselves quite neatly into the various structures. They had acceptance; they had approval, and they had access; so yes, the red flag having been raised, it was not heeded. We should say that,” Ramaphosa said, referring to the relationship between former President Jacob Zuma and the three Gupta brothers accused of siphoning billions of rands from state entities and provincial governments.Ramaphosa admitted before the Commission that there had been attempts by some party members to caution the African National Congress (ANC) about the relationship.“Yes, I think a red flag was raised and the level of alertness should have been there. I think that with the Gupta family, we were blind-sighted by the fact that this family were friends to the ultimate leader of our party.“But there were occasions when for instance Transport Minister Fikile (Mbalula) mentioned it in the National Executive Committee (of the ANC).”Ramaphosa lauded Mbalula for being “brave” to raise at that level the fact that the Guptas had informed him months before his appointment that this was imminent, long before Zuma actually made the appointment.Several other former ministers have also testified at the Commission about similar situations.Ramaphosa also commented on the infamous landing of a planeload of guests from India for the lavish wedding of a family member at a national key point.“When the plane landed at air force Waterkloof base, the then Secretary-General (Gwede Mantashe) spoke out against this almost immediately and when I had the occasion when the Gupta brothers came to ANC headquarters to discuss this and other matters with us, I was one who specifically raised this and said that this should never have happened as it put our president, who is your friend, in great difficulty,” Ramaphosa said.“There was contestation in the party about how we deal with these matters – the factionalism, the division in the party and how you react to acts of corruption,” he added.The Commission has been hearing evidence about how the Gupta brothers also influenced key top positions at institutions such as national electricity supplier Eskom and transport authority Transnet, which are now in dire straits following years of looting.The Guptas are currently believed to be in self-exile in Dubai, with South African authorities having started extradition proceedings for them to be returned to face criminal charges.The three Gupta brothers – Ajay, Atul and Rajesh—and their wives and children came to South Africa from Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, in the 1990s as democracy dawned with the release of Nelson Mandela to grow their business empire.From a humble shoe store at a shopping centre, they established a multi-million rand empire in information technology, media and mining, much of it through what is being uncovered now as having been done through irregular activities using their closeness to Zuma.Zuma last month started serving a 15-month prison sentence after the country’s apex Constitutional Court found him guilty of contempt of court for his repeated failure to return to the Commission, from which he walked out during a hearing last year.A separate criminal case against Zuma and French arms manufacturer Thales relating to alleged kickbacks paid to Zuma was again postponed on Tuesday after Zuma was admitted to the hospital last Friday for an undisclosed illness.The matter has been going on for over a decade now, with repeated delays as Zuma, who has denied all the charges, changed lawyers several times and also called for prosecutors to recuse themselves because of alleged bias.

13-08-2021||New Delhi||Air India’s record-breaking pilot Zoya Agarwal selected for UN project||Captain Zoya Aggarwal, who in January this year crossed another milestone by commanding an all-women team to pilot Air India's longest non-stop commercial flight from US's San Francisco to India's Bengaluru, says that the main motto of her life is to make an "impact" on the lives of lakhs of youths to dream big.The United Nations has chosen Aggarwal as its Spokesperson for Generation Equality. On International Youth Day, the UN also featured India and Air India to spread awareness amongst the youth. This is a big moment for India as the UN has featured for the first time a pilot from Air India on its global platform. This is the first time ever that UN women has kicked off world youth day with India.It’s a rare privilege & honour as an Indian to be chosen as spokesperson for #generationequality Thank you @UN_Women for feting meAs a crew commander,I hope I can inspire compatriots & women across globe to follow their dreams fearlessly & soar higher 🙏🏼@PMOIndia @MoCA_GoI pic.twitter.com/tWQnlO9TRpIn an interview to IANS on the International Youth Day, Aggarwal, who has been featured by the UN said, "I was just eight years old when I saw an aeroplane flying while sitting on the terrace of my house. And there and then I decided to fly a plane and to touch the stars."   She said that as a kid, she started preparing to fulfil her dreams. Agarwal said that she had to face a lot of resistance as she came from a very humble and conservative family. "But for me it was possible," she said, adding, "I believed in myself and went for my goal and told my parents, eventually to become a pilot."  She said that as she was the only child of her parents, her mother was in tears while her father was nervous, and then he asked her to get admission in college thinking that she will forget about her dream to be a pilot. She said that she went to St Stephen's in Delhi and then completed her Science degree and side by side also got herself enrolled for the aviation classes in the remaining days time."And I needed a prove that I can achieve my goal and of course I needed the support of my parents, without whom I couldn't have done that. I also had a piggy bank in which I have been saving for last 17 years which I contributed for enrolling into the aviation classes," she said."I remember when I had to complete my assignments I used to study even under the street lights when there were power cuts. I then topped in my college and then my parents also felt that I needed to get enrolled for the pilot course to achieve my goals."I was fortunate that my parents agreed and then took a loan. And I was the fifth girl to fly in Air India in 2004. At that point of time to get into Air India was very tough. For seven vacancies there were over 3,000 applicants with more experience than me. But despite the things that were against me I was lucky to get in," she said."My father also had a heart attack, just three days before my exam of Air India. He was in tears in the ICU before I was going for the exam and he was upset because I was going without him. He was nervous that how tough it was for children to compete at such an early age," she recalled.She said that her first flight was from Delhi to Dubai. Agarwal in 2013 was the youngest woman to fly the Boeing 777 in the world. "In 2021 I became the first ever woman captain to fly over the north pole with an all women crew, creating world history. That flight created a number of records and also put India on the world map," she said.Agarwal was among the first few pilots and cabin crews to volunteer for the Vande Bharat Mission to evacuate Indian nationals from all across the world in view of the Covid pandemic. "After the Covid pandemic became serious in the US, I  volunteered, it was a call of duty. Our first Vande Bharat flight from the US's San Francisco to India's Mumbai with all Indian consulate staff was on Mother's Day. I was away from my mother but I was fortunate to reunite hundreds of families with their mothers," she said."And when our flight landed in Mumbai the passengers cheered for me and even the people at the airport wearing their face shields were applauding for us with tears in their eyes," she recalled. "It was an opportunity to rise to the occasion and that was the inspiration as these memories will go to our graves with us," Agarwal said.And the message through my entire journey is that if a girl from a humble background can do this, it will inspire lakhs of youths whether men or women to dream big in their lives, she said. She added that she keeps on getting letters and DMs on Instagram where the people say that they had lost hope but after coming to know of my story they want to do something. "There must be a reason why people are following me. There must a reason that God has given me an opportunity to serve mankind. And then I got to the United Nations, which is like my another dream coming true, as I always wanted to work for it as it gives a wide platform to inspire people."My goal in life is to make an impact on the lives of the people and the UN is the best place where I can do that meaningfully," she added.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-indias-record-breaking-pilot-zoya-agarwal-selected-for-un-project-297099
13-08-2021||---||Twitter biased, interfering with Indian politics by shutting his account, says Rahul Gandhi||New Delhi, August 13Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday targeted Twitter for locking his handle, alleging that the platform was biased and was interfering with the Indian political process.Also read: BJP mocks Rahul Gandhi over his Twitter account suspensionTwitter transfers India head Manish Maheshwari to US“By shutting down my Twitter they are interfering in our political process. A company is making its business to define our politics. And as a politician I don't like that,” Gandhi said in a recorded video statement.Gandhi said the locking of his account is an attack on the democratic structure of the country.“This is not an attack on Rahul Gandhi. This is not, you know, simply shutting Rahul Gandhi down. I have 19million-20 million followers. You are denying them the right to an opinion. That’s what you are doing. So this is not only patently unfair, this is their breaching the idea that Twitter is a neutral platform. And for the investors this is a very dangerous thing because taking sides in the political contest has repercussions for Twitter,” he said.The Congress leader said Indian democracy is under attack and the opposition is not allowed to speak in Parliament.“The media is controlled. And I thought there was a ray of light where we could put what we thought on Twitter. But obviously, that's not the case. It’s obvious now that Twitter is actually not a neutral, objective platform. It is a biased platform. It's something that listens to what the government of the day says,” he alleged.Gandhi said, “As Indians, we have to ask the questions ‘Are we going to allow companies just because they are beholden to the Government of India to define our politics for us? Is that what this is going to come to? Or are we going to define our politics on our own?’ That's the real question here.”Twitter India, which has locked the handles of several Congress leaders, on Thursday said the action had proceeded due diligence.The accounts remain suspended because the account holders have yet to delete “unlawful pictures of the family of a minor Dalit victim allegedly assaulted and murdered in Delhi last Sunday,” Twitter sources said.The company said the tweets were found in violation of the juvenile justice law that protects the privacy of minor victims in all manners.The accounts of Congress leaders and workers have been locked to “hide these tweets until the account holders delete them”.The Congress has not taken down the tweets so far and has said Twitter has not applied its rules uniformly and many BJP leaders and statutory commissions that posted similar pictures continued to operate through their handles without any action.Among temporarily suspended Twitter accounts are those of Congress Party, Rahul Gandhi, Randeep Surjewala, Ajay Makan, KC Venugopal, Sushmita Dev, Manickam Tagore and Jitendra Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitter-biased-interfering-with-indian-politics-by-shutting-his-account-says-rahul-gandhi-297096

They are now waiting for the bodies to be traced so that the last rites of their dear ones can be performed.Edit: Tragedy in the hillsThe death toll in the landslide went up to 14 with the recovery of four more bodies today. Thirteen persons have been rescued so far, while over 20 are still missing. Relatives allege the focus of rescue agencies was on reopening the national highway and not tracing the bus. A JCB machine reached the accident spot from the Chaura side around 6 pm, they say. A case should be registered against the officials concerned for the delay, a victim’s relative said. Geet Ram said his son Mehar Chand, who was returning from his in-laws’ house, was still trapped in the bus. “Our hearts are sinking with each passing minute as hopes of survival are diminishing,” he said.Ravi Kumar said his brother Prab Lal could not be traced so far. The family was waiting with a bated breath for a news about him, he said.Congress MLA from Kinnaur Jagat Singh Negi said action should be taken against officials found responsible for the delay.Kinnaur DC Abid Hussain Sadiq said the entire area was surveyed using drones and rescue operations were conducted in a planned manner.Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur, who visited the spot, said shooting stones hampered the rescue work.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kinnaur-landslide-toll-14-over-20-missing-hope-fades-296845

They expressed deep concern over the disruptive behaviour of some MPs and strongly felt that such unruly behaviour should not be accepted and appropriate action should be taken,” Vice-President Naidu’s office said today, clearly hinting that a committee could be set up to probe the recent unsavoury incidents in the Rajya Sabha.The development came after the Opposition and the government separately petitioned Naidu today. The government sought a “high-level probe and exemplary punishment for unruly opposition MPs”, calling their behaviour deplorable and anarchist, while the Opposition slammed the government for “stonewalling Pegasus discussion and causing a deadlock in Parliament”.Eleven opposition parties (minus TMC, NC, AAP, BSP) marched in protest over the “murder of democracy” today and later met Naidu, accusing the government of bringing outsiders as marshals to “manhandle” MPs.The government later fielded eight ministers led by Leader of the Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal, who rejected the accusations that outsiders were stationed as marshals in the Upper House and asked the Opposition to apologise for its behaviour.Goyal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi accused the Opposition of “breaching all limits of parliamentary propriety in the RS and coming prepared to stall the monsoon session from day one”.The government said the Opposition protest today was an attempt to deflect attention from the action that would “evidently follow their violent acts which cannot be addressed by present House rules and need a high-level probe.”Goyal urged Naidu to form a committee on the lines of the one ex-Speaker Somnath Chatterjee formed in 2005 to probe the cash-for-query scam.Oppn: Outsiders manhandled MPsEleven Opposition parties marched in protest over the “murder of democracy” and later met VP Venkaiah Naidu, accusing the Centre of bringing outsiders as marshals to “manhandle” MPs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stonewalled-claims-oppn-chair-mulls-probe-against-unruly-mps-296846

But merit always comes first,” he said, adding, “It’s time more direct appointees are elevated to the Bench”.He said these seven years were the most gruelling years of his life. “It is no cakewalk. When I was on this (lawyer) side I had no concept of what was on the other side. I have been on both sides. This side (judges) is much more difficult. You have to read much more. I enjoyed writing judgments and at the end, it worked out well,” he said.Attorney General KK Venugopal, who mentored Justice Nariman as a lawyer and was described by the latter as his “guru”, heaped praise on praise on his “disciple”.Born on August 13, 1956, Justice Nariman was appointed as a Supreme Court judge on July 7, 2014. He disposed of over 13,500 cases and delivered historic verdicts, including those on declaration of privacy as a fundamental right, setting aside of IT Act provision empowering arrests, decriminalising consensual gay sex and permitting women of all ages to enter Kerala’s Sabarimala temple.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lion-who-guarded-judiciary-cji-on-justice-nariman-296847

13-08-2021||Mona||A web series strikingly close to Pegasus drama||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 12It’s one of the top-trending shows, earning an IMDb rating of 7.2 and its popularity is soaring by the day. Released on August 6, “Hit & Run” —- a tale of spy games between the US and its closest ally Israel — comes close on the heels of the Pegasus controversy. “Hit & Run” is winning viewers not just with its intriguing plot that plays between safe houses and public spaces but also because it appears to be strikingly close to reality. The reality of Pegasus, a highly sophisticated spyware developed by Israeli company NSO that is capable of ‘zero-click’ attack. Pegasus software has allegedly been used to tap about 300 devices in India and thousands across the world, including those of top politicians and journalists.The plot of the Netflix series has an uncanny likeness to the Pegasus spyware attacks. The Pegasus software was allegedly used to snoop on French President and other top politicians of the world, while the web series has Israelis using Remote Access Trojan (RAT) to spy on the US President and his family. The plot moves around intelligence agencies tracking a journalist, who’s aiming for a big exposé involving powerful politicians.The plot builds an ominous steeplechase between all-powerful CIA agents and the fierce Mossad. The notebook of a dead agent has an encrypted code hinting that despite being America’s biggest ally, Israel is tapping POTUS, his daughter and son-in-law through RAT. Friends or foes, the distinction is hard to make in the spy show.Strikingly close to current times, ‘Hit & Run’ seems to blur the lines between reality and fiction. A story set in Israel, with murky connections spread across countries, each episode unfolds the plot that swiftly moves from a happy family to a world of espionage. An American dancer Danielle Wexler Azulai (Kaelen Ohm), sharing home with her husband Segev Azulai (Lior Raz), an Israeli tour guide, is to go to New York for an audition, but a hit-and-run cuts her life short. Her grief-stricken husband with a stint in special ops finds himself a target as he tries to uncover the accident landing up in New York.Lior Raz (Doron Kavillio in ‘Fauda’) is a treat for his fans with his burly body, intense looks and a measured act. The first season with an ending that hints at season 2 has strong women characters — Dani, a successful dancer with renowned Batsheva Dance Company and a capable agent; fierce police detective Tali Shapira (Moran Rosenblatt) living life on her terms; and a committed journalist Naomi Hicks (Sanaa Lathan).SPY games‘Hit & Run’ seems to blur the lines between reality and fiction.

13-08-2021||---||Kulbhushan Jadhav was lured by ISI: Book||New Delhi, August 12A forthcoming book, “Spy Stories: Inside the Secret World of the RAW and ISI”, by two American authors has detailed their active involvement in a back channel connection between India’s top security managers and their Pakistani counterparts.Highly respected Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark, who have written well received books on the region, made startling claims on Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Pulwama and Pathankot attacks, Burhan Wani and the Mumbai attacks.On Jadhav, for which the primary source is a middle-level ISI officer gone rogue, the authors write that he was not an Indian intelligence officer but after basing himself in Iran, he was outraged by the Mumbai attacks and had offered his services to the intelligence services. The Pakistanis had spotted him meeting RAW men and had baited him by using a Baloch strongman with connections in Iran.The authors claim that the ISI had got them to tell NSA Ajit Doval that it was not involved in the Pulwama attacks. It was the handiwork of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) which had planned it in Afghanistan and was intended to start a regional war. But Doval and Deputy NSA Rajinder Khanna disbelieved the Pakistani messages and India decided to carry out the Balakot air strikes to “humiliate the Pakistan military”.They were told by a former RAW officer that the Pathankot airbase attack by four JeM terrorists was facilitated by “corrupt local police officers” but the NIA charge-sheet has no mention of that.Burhan Wani’s whereabouts were known to the security forces but they did not deliberately kill him for a long time as they used him as `flypaper’ to trap other militants, they claim.The book also dwells on the 1999 Indian Airlines’ flight IC-814 hijack, which Doval says was a “diplomatic failure”.The authors have quoted from interviews by Doval, Khanna, former Defence Intelligence chief Lt Gen Vinod Khandare and former IB chief Asif Ibrahim. They have also claimed that Saudi Arabia has played the role of mediator between India and Pakistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kulbhushan-jadhav-was-lured-by-isi-book-296885
13-08-2021||Kanpur (UP)||Decades after anti-Sikh riots, UP cops examine crime scene again||A special investigation team is re-examining the scene of a crime decades after two men were allegedly murdered and their bodies set on fire in their house here during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.Crucial evidence, including blood samples, has been lifted this week from a locked house in city’s Govind Nagar, attacked by a mob during the anti-Sikh riots that followed the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi.The SIT, formed by the Yogi Adityanath government on the orders of the Supreme Court, entered the locked house with a forensic team on Tuesday, Superintendent of Police (SIT), Balendu Bhushan said.After Delhi, Kanpur was among the worse-hit by the violence. Teja Singh (45) and his son Satpal Singh (22) were killed on November 1, 1984.The SIT has got the statement of Teja Singh’s surviving son, Charanjeet Singh—now 61 and a resident of Delhi—recorded before a special magistrate.The witness narrated the horrific episode and disclosed the identities of those allegedly involved in the murders.The surviving members of Teja Singh’s family had sold off the Kanpur house and moved first to Punjab and then Delhi. A Kanpur sub-inspector filed the FIR.SP Bhushan said the crime scene was undisturbed as the new occupants stayed on the first floor. The ground floor rooms where the murders took place remained locked.The SIT entered the house in the presence of an eyewitness to the attack who lived in the same area.Bhushan said the forensic science laboratory determined that the blood samples collected were of human beings, which confirmed that killings had taken place there.Earlier this year, the SIT had collected blood samples from a house in Kanpur’s Naubasta area. It too had been locked up after a similar attack.The Uttar Pradesh SIT was formed to revisit cases filed after the 1984 riots.The Kanpur SSP provided the SIT with a list of 40 cases of serious nature.  Of them, the Kanpur Police had filed charge sheets in 11 cases and final reports in the remaining 29, which lacked substantial evidence.But the accused were acquitted in all 11 cases with the trial court citing lack of evidence.“We have sought permission from the state government to file an appeal against the judgment of lower courts in five cases,” Bhushan said. “We are still waiting for the government nod.” The SIT also started further investigations in the 29 cases closed by Kanpur Police and hopes to file charge-sheet in some of them.

13-08-2021||New Delhi||Red Fort gears up to host Independence Day celebrations||The historic monument of Red Fort in the national capital is gearing up to host the nation’s Independence Day celebrations on August 15. All security arrangements including extra precautionary and preventive measures against Covid-19 are being put in place to ensure a seamless event.A two-day vaccination camp was organised for all the staff present in the Red Fort in a step towards taking guard against the coronavirus whose first wave last year and the second wave earlier this year went on to create rampage.The Prime Minister hoists the flag every year on Independence Day and addresses the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.The security personnel and other staff engaged in security near the Prime Minister will be tested for Covid-19 two days before August 15. Also, those who have not been vaccinated will be given the jabs.Similar to last year’s arrangements, limited chairs have been placed this time as well. The chairs of all the leaders sitting around the Prime Minister have been installed, maintaining a distance of two yards.Students of NCC will be called on Independence Day, although their number will also be limited.According to the information, athletes who won medals at the Tokyo Olympics will also get a place near the Prime Minister this time. A separate corridor has been made for their movement and arrival.Meanwhile, tight security arrangements are being put in place.The Delhi Police have put up containers (around 15-20) outside the main gate of the Red Fort for security reasons.Security agencies have already issued an alert on August 15. The Delhi Police have taken this step in view of the farmers’ agitation and threats from the Khalistani terrorists.In view of Independence Day, Delhi Police and central security agencies have made strict arrangements.Apart from this, an anti-drone radar system will also be used, so that no drone of any kind can fly around the Red Fort. The system has a range of up to 5 km.Delhi Police have also pasted posters of terrorists around the Red Fort. The name and address of six terrorists have been mentioned in the posters.The police are also wary of the potential challenge posed by the farmers sitting on the Delhi borders, who are protesting against the agricultural laws. On January 26 this year, on the occasion of the Republic Day, things turned ugly and violent as the farmers’ agitation was at its peak during that time. Keeping these episodes in mind, all efforts are being made this time to avoid any kind of negligence.

Many countries, including the US, don’t insist on being vaccinated. They want a RT-PCR test done before boarding the plane. “At the moment, it is an India issue. They [the US] are not allowing people who have stayed for a length of time here to go to the US directly. The general practice is testing based rather than vaccine based.”He also acknowledged the issue about vaccines at some places, saying that Europe started the problem by exempting people only with certain kinds of vaccination from quarantine. “We got Covishield in. Covaxin is still a problem.  Maybe in September, we should get some kind of indication,” he said.The solution was a vaccination certificate on the lines of the ‘Yellow Fever’ certificates where there was no insistence on a particular type of injection. “I do see it as a challenge. Some countries try to get across their viewpoint that their vaccine is a must to deal with them. There will be a push and pull out there,” the Minister observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-working-to-ease-overseas-travel-curbs-jaishankar-296721

Others present included Special Envoys of “Troika Plus”—the US, Russia, Pakistan and China—besides representatives of the Taliban, the Afghan government and host Qatar.In New Delhi, the MEA said the government continued to closely monitor the situation with a special eye on the Afghan Hindu and Sikh minorities.The embassy in Kabul continues to remain in touch with Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members and last year had facilitated the travel to India of 383 members of the two communities.“We will ensure provision of all necessary assistance to them,” assured MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.Asked about contacts with the Taliban, Bagchi said, “The government is in touch with various stakeholders. I won’t say anything beyond this.”On Pakistan’s role in fuelling the violence in Afghanistan, the MEA spokesperson said, it should be stopped if it is happening. India has been actively discussing with others the need to stop “malign influences” from jeopardising the ongoing talks.“The world knows what kind of role Pakistan has played and what they have done,” he observed.Russian Special Envoy Zamir Kabulov outlined the world community’s three primary goals in Afghanistan—achieve a ceasefire, resume inclusive intra-Afghan dialogue, and form an interim coalition government with elections to be held two years later.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/afghanistan-appeals-for-emergency-unsc-session-296715
13-08-2021||New Delhi||‘Losing one of the lions of Indian judiciary’, says CJI on superannuation of Justice R F Nariman||“We are losing one of the lions of the India judiciary,” Chief Justice N V Ramana said on Thursday while paying glowing tributes to Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman on his superannuation after over seven years at the Supreme Court bench.Justice Nariman, who became the apex court judge on July 7, 2014, disposed of over 13,500 cases and delivered historic verdicts including declaration of privacy as fundamental right, setting aside of IT Act provision empowering arrests, decriminalising consensual gay sex and permitting women of all ages to enter Kerala’s Sabarimala temple.The CJI, who sat with Justice Nariman and Justice Surya Kant for the ceremonial hearing at noon, was effusive in his praise and broke the convention by permitted all the desirous lawyers, besides Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and SCBA President Vikas Singh, to say few words in the honour of his retiring colleague.“His judgments like the one in the Shreya Singhal case (by which section 66A of the IT Act empowering police to arrest for social media posts was set aside) has left a permanent mark on legal jurisprudence. Personally I am a little overwhelmed at expressing my thoughts. On his retirement, I feel we are losing one of the lions of the Indian Judiciary,” he said.“We have seen just now the overwhelming response from the cross-section of the Bar. I do not want to detain you for long, as I reserve my comments for the Supreme Court Bar Association function in the evening,” Justice Ramana said.The CJI referred to the excellent academic background of Justice Nariman and said he was made a senior advocate at the age of 37 years in 1993 by the then Chief Justice M N Venkatachaliah by amending the rule which fixes 45 years as minimum age for granting such a designation to a lawyer.The CJI said that Justice Nariman had an “extremely successful practice” for over 35 years as a lawyer and was only the fifth lawyer to be directly elevated to the Bench of the apex court.At the outset, in the absence of Attorney General K K Venugopal, the Solicitor General delivered his farewell speech in the virtual function and recalled the fact that Justice Nariman was the first lawyer briefed by him in the apex court.“Today is a very special day. Not only for us, but for me as well, as Justice Nariman was the first-ever counsel I briefed in the Supreme Court,” Mehta said, adding that the retiring judge has “exceptional brilliance and integrity “on varied subjects such as religions and constitutions”.“I wish your Lordship a happy, healthy and fulfilling life ahead and in the third innings of his life,” the law officer said.“Thank you Solicitor,” Justice Nariman replied.Senior advocate and Supreme Court Bar Association President Vikas Singh also wished him a happy post-retirement life and said, “To be here as a President of the Bar when Justice Nariman is there is a privilege. We should be grateful to Justice Lodha (former CJI who had recommended Justice Nariman for judgeship) who recommended the name of Justice Nariman.”          The seven-year tenure for a person like Justice Nariman is not enough, he said, adding that his tenure has brought glory to the institution.Former SCBA president and senior lawyer Dushyant Dave also spoke at the occasion and thanked the CJI for granting him the opportunity to speak for bidding farewell to “one of the most popular judges of the Supreme Court”.“Justice Nariman has served the country and the Constitution brilliantly,” he said.He was an “absolute symbol of a very, very fair and compassionate judge” who was kind to all lawyers and very encouraging to the young members, Dave said.The CJI then specifically asked the lawyers, who were logged into the video-conferencing facilities, to speak if they wished so.Lawyers like Ranjit Kumar, P S Narasimha, R Basant, Siddharth Dave, K V Vishwanathan, Aishwarya Bhati, Ardhendumauli Prasad, Shivaji Jadhav and Joseph Aristotle also spoke at the occasion.Justice Nariman, born on August 13, 1956, became a senior lawyer in 1993 and Solicitor General of India on July 27, 2011, before being elevated as the judge of the apex court on July 7, 2014.

13-08-2021||Aditi Tandon||Current rules not enough, need high-level probe, exemplary action against unruly MPs in Rajya Sabha: Govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 12The government and the Opposition were on a war path on Thursday, with top ministers demanding high-level probe and exemplary action against unruly Opposition MPs in the Rajya Sabha a day after the monsoon session came to a close.Terming Opposition protests today as attempts to deflect attention from action which would follow their misconduct in the Rajya Sabha, the government said Opposition actions in the House were “so deplorable that these could not be addressed with present rules.”“Violent acts of the Opposition on August 4, August 9 and August 11 are not ordinary. These are extraordinary acts with deep implications. The act of the MP who climbed the table and threw a rule book at the Chair could have been a murderous assault had someone been sitting in that Chair. Current House rules are not adequate to address such misconduct which breached all limits. We appealed to Rajya Sabha Chairman today to set up a high-level committee like the one set up by former Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, study all CCTVs and probe the intentions of the Opposition, their violent approach and arrogance of one family that they alone have the right on the country. All this must come out. The fact is, the Opposition had no intentions to run the House from day one and their actions bore that out,” Minister of Commerce, Food and Textiles and leader of Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal said, noting that RS witnessed competitive Opposition in the House which meant that if an AAP member had climbed up the table, Congress MPs would also have to follow suit in the wake of Punjab Assembly elections.Rejecting the Opposition charges that outsiders were deployed for Rajya Sabha security yesterday, Goyal said: “Eighteen male and 12 female marshals were deployed to protect the Chair, table and House property in the light of what happened on August 4 when some women MPs damaged RS property while trying to enter the chambers and wounded a female security officer. Only 30 marshals were on duty in the Rajya Sabha yesterday.”The government released footage of a female marshal being pushed by two Congress MPs — Devi Nehtam and Chhaya Verma in the Rajya Sabha yesterday and asked “what direction does the Opposition wish to give to Parliamentary democracy.The government also said that the Congress and TMC “had no intention to run the Parliament from day one.”“Indications that this session would be a washout had been given to us right at the very start on the day of the all-party meeting. The TMC and Congress later told us no matter what we do the session would remain washed out. They also threatened us that if we brought more Bills a more disastrous situation (than what was seen on August 4, 9) would happen,” said Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi.The government today sought an apology from the Opposition MPs for their unruly behaviour on August 4 (when some TMC MPs after being suspended damaged house property and injured a female security officer while forcibly entering RS); August 9 (when AAP member Sanjay Singh and Congress’ Partap Bajwa and Ripun Bora climbed the table of the Rajya Sabha with Bajwa throwing the rule book at the chair), August 11 (when some Opposition MPs allegedly assaulted a female marshal).“Let alone apologise they are brazening it out with a street protest. This is just a deflection to preempt action against them for their misconduct which we deplore,” said Goyal.Joshi earlier said the Opposition was unable to accept the people’s mandate favouring PMNarendra Modi as they considered the seat of governance their “birth right.”The government is seeking a committee on the lines of the one former Speaker Somnath Chatterjee  hadset up to go into the conduct of MPs involved in the cash-for-question scam.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/current-rules-not-enough-need-high-level-probe-exemplary-action-against-unruly-mps-in-rajya-sabha-govt-296672
13-08-2021||Aditi Tandon||Govt stonewalled them, 11 Opposition parties tell Rajya Sabha chairman||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 12Bitterness witnessed throughout the Monsoon Session of Parliament on Thursday was seen again with the government and the opposition at daggers drawn over the issue of washout of the Parliament proceedings.While leaders of 11 Opposition parties minus TMC submitted a memorandum to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu accusing the government of stonewalling them in Parliament, Union ministers Piyush Goyal, Pralhad Joshi and MA Naqvi separately met Naidu demanding action against the opposition MPs for “gross misconduct in the Rajya Sabha”.The government is gearing up for a major political offensive against the opposition, which in a letter to Naidu said, “The government stonewalled the Opposition demand for discussion in the monsoon session. It has become abundantly clear that the present government does not believe in parliamentary accountability and was running away from debate on Pegasus which resulted in a deadlock.”The Opposition said it had been repeatedly requesting the government to sincerely engage with the Opposition parties to break the impasse, but the government remained arrogant, insincere and obdurate. It is the government which is squarely responsible for the stalemate as it has refused to accept the opposition’s demand for an informed debate in both the Houses, it added.“The government used its brute majority to push through its legislative agenda in violation of established procedures, conventions and spirit of parliamentary democracy. To divert attention from its own conduct and actions, the government has unleashed a state-sponsored, malicious and misleading campaign by blaming the combined Opposition for the disruption of Parliament. What happened in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday was shocking, unprecedented, sad and an insult to the very dignity of the House and humiliation of the members of the august House. Without any provocation from the Opposition, outsiders who were not part of Prliament security were brought in to manhandle the Opposition leaders and members, including women parliamentarians who were only protesting against the government’s conduct, highhandedness and muzzling of the voice,” alleged the opposition leaders.They condemned the “authoritarian attitude and undemocratic actions” of the government saying, “We remain committed to continuing our struggle against the assault on parliamentary democracy and agitate on the issues of national importance and people’s concern.”The statement was signed by Mallikarjun Kharge, Leader of Opposition, Rajya Sabha; Adhir Ranjan and Anand Sharma of the Congress, Sharad Pawar of NCP, TR Baalu of DMK, Ramgopal Yadav of SP, Sanjay Raut of Shiv Sena, Tiruchi Siva of DMK, Manoj Jha of  RJD, Elamaram Kareem of CPI(M), ET Mohammad Basheer of IUML, Binoy Viswam of CPI, NK Premachandran of RSP and Thomas Chazhikadan of Kerala Congress (M).The opposition said the Monsoon Session of Parliament was deliberately derailed by the government. The opposition accused the government of not allowing discussions on issues, including Pegasus, farmers’ agitation, inflation, and deteriorating economic situation.Meanwhile, seven ministers will launch a counter-offensive against the Opposition. They are Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan, Prahlad Joshi, Bhupendra Yadav, Anurag Singh Thakur, Arjun Ram Meghwal and V Muraleedharan. They will hold a press conference at 2 pm.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-stonewalled-them-11-opposition-parties-tell-rajya-sabha-chairman-296644
13-08-2021||Aditi Tandon||Wednesday's events in Rajya Sabha were nothing short of murder of democracy, say protesting Opposition leaders||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 12A day after marshals were deployed in the Rajya Sabha during the passage of the insurance amendment bill, a united opposition on Thursday questioned the excessive use of security personnel in the House describing it as a “murder of democracy”.Leaders of 15 opposition parties, including Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, SP’s Ram Gopal Yadav, Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut, CPM’s Elamaram Kareem, CPI’s Binoy Viswam, DMK’s Tiruchi Siva among others will shortly meet Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to lodge a protest.After a meeting in the chamber of leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on Thursday all opposition members marched to Vijay Chowk where they accused the government of muzzling the opposition voice in Parliament.“The parliament session is over, and frankly, as far as 60 per cent of the country is concerned, no parliament session was held because their voice was crushed, humiliated and yesterday in Rajya Sabha it was physically beaten. This is nothing short of murder of democracy,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said.Gandhi said the opposition raised the issue of Pegasus and sought a debate on it but the government refused.“We raised farmers’ issue outside Parliament because we were not allowed to speak inside. We raised the price rise issue outside because we were not allowed to speak inside. We are not allowed to speak in Parliament. Therefore, we are before you today. What happened in Parliament is nothing short of a murder of democracy,” said Gandhi.NCP leader Praful Patel quoted his party chief Pawar as saying that he had never seen in 55 years of his political life the visuals seen in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut alleged the government imposed “martial law” in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.“Opposition has not had the time to say what it wanted. Our voice was not allowed to reach you. We saw democracy being murdered in the Rajya Sabha yesterday. Private people dressed as marshals tried to assault women MPs. ‘Martial law’ was imposed and I felt like I was standing on the Pakistan border,” said Raut.All leaders targeted the government saying they would take the battle to the streets.Tiruchi Siva said he had never witnessed what he experienced in the Rajya Sabha yesterday.“Government didn’t consider any of our issues. GIC amendment bill was rushed. RSTV blacked us out,” he said.Kareem said security used in the Rajya Sabha yesterday were goons and not marshals.“RSTV is not showing what we are asking. Yesterday, they behaved like goondas. They were not marshals, they were goondas. They manhandled our women MPs. We will take this matter to the people,” he said.RSP’s NK Premchandran said the responsibility of washout of Parliament lies with the government.Gandhi later alleged that the PM was “selling the soul of India to a few industrialists”.Meanwhile, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, Leader of Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal and deputy leader MA Naqvi met M Venkaiah Naidu ahead of the opposition meet with the chairman, as daggers are drawn over yesterday’s events in the Rajya Sabha.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wednesdays-events-in-rajya-sabha-were-nothing-short-of-murder-of-democracy-say-protesting-opposition-leaders-296629
13-08-2021||---||Twitter accounts of Congress, Surjewala, Venugopal, Maken locked||New Delhi, August 12The Congress on Thursday said the party’s official handle and several accounts of its leaders and volunteers had been locked by Twitter and alleged that the micro blogging site was acting under pressure of the government.Former party chief Rahul Gandhi’s account already stands suspended.The Congress alleged that accounts of seniors leaders general secretaries Randeep Surjewala, KC Venugopal, Ajay Maken, AICC Assam in charge Jitendra Singh, Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev, MP and Lok Sabha whip Manickam Tagore had been suspended among those of many others.The party also said close to 5,000 accounts of party workers had been suspended for sharing pictures of family of the minor victim of alleged rape and murder in Delhi.The Twitter action followed a notice from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to act against Gandhi’s handle for violating privacy laws for minor victims. Juvenile justice act prohibits revelation of pictures of minor victims of crime and their families.Twitter says Gandhi, Cong a/cs blocked for violating rules                 Meanwhile, Twitter on Thursday reasoned blocking of several accounts of Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, for posting an image that it said violated its rules and the action was to protect individuals' privacy and safety.When contacted, a Twitter spokesperson on Thursday said the company's rules are enforced judiciously and impartially for everyone in its service."We have taken proactive action on several hundred Tweets that posted an image that violated our Rules and may continue to do so in line with our range of enforcement options.

13-08-2021||Sriharikota (AP)||GSLV fails to place earth observation satellite into orbit||ISRO's GSLV rocket on Thursday failed to inject into the orbit the country's latest earth observation satellite EOS-03 due to a failure to ignite the cryogenic stage of the launch vehicle, prompting the premier space agency to declare the mission could not be achieved as intended.However, the first and second stages of the rocket had performed normally, the Bengaluru-headquartered Indian Space Research Organisation said.In a notification, ISRO said, "GSLV-F10 launch took place today at 0543 hrs as scheduled. Performance of first and second stages was normal. However, Cryogenic Upper Stage ignition did not happen due to technical anomaly. The mission could not be accomplished as intended."According to ISRO, the cryogenic upper stage ignition was scheduled to take place 4.56 minutes after the lift-off.A formal announcement was also made at the Mission Control Centre by the range operations director, stating, "Performance anomaly observed in the cryogenic stage. The mission could not be accomplished fully." ISRO Chairman K Sivan said, "(the mission) could not be fully accomplished mainly because there is a technical anomaly observed in the cryogenic stage. This I wanted to tell all my friends." ISRO, after facing hurdles caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, resumed its launch operations for the rocket to place the satellite with an objective to provide near real-time imaging of large areas of the country at frequent intervals and quick monitoring of natural disasters.As the 26-hour countdown concluded on Thursday, the 51.7-metre tall rocket with four stages lifted off majestically at 05.43hrs, leaving behind a trail of thick orange-coloured fumes.The four-stage rocket was the first to carry a four-metre dia 'Ogive Payload Fairing' at the top of the vehicle to accommodate larger payloads.The rocket was supposed to place the EOS "an agile state-of-the-art satellite into the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit, 19 minutes after lift-off.Thursday's unsuccessful attempt to launch the satellite came in the wake of scientists postponing the earlier planned missions earlier.The satellite, originally titled GISAT-1 weighing 2,268 kg was slated to be launched on March 5, 2020 but it was postponed a day before the lift-off due to 'technical reasons'.The Covid-induced lockdown further delayed the mission and once again it was scheduled for a March 28, 2021 launch but a 'minor issue' with the satellite forced yet another postponement.The objective of Thursday's mission was to provide near real-time imaging of large area regions at frequent intervals, for quick monitoring of natural disasters, episodic events and obtain spectral signatures for agriculture, forestry, water bodies as well as for disaster warning, cyclone monitoring, cloud burst and thunderstorm monitoring.Before Thursday's launch, ISRO had launched Brazil's earth observation satellite Amazonia-1 and 18 co-passenger satellites in February this year.    Thursday's mission is the eighth flight with indigenous cryogenic engine, 14th flight of the GSLV and also marks the 79th launch vehicle mission from Sriharikota.Previous launches of GSLV rockets include the GSLV-MkIII-M1/Chandrayaan-2 mission in July 2019 while GSLV-F11 successfully placed GSAT-7A in December 2018. An earth observation satellite - EOS-01 - was launched in November 2020 by polar satellite launch vehicle PSLV-C49, ISRO said.ISRO had made arrangements to watch the launch through its various social media platforms.
