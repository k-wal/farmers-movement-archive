Sena MP Sanjay Raut also advised him to “learn how to behave and stop disrespecting a sitting Chief Minister who is equal to the Prime Minister when it comes to protocol and dignity”.Rane, meanwhile, said even Thackeray had used unparliamentary words while referring to BJP leaders Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath. The Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in the Narendra Modi Cabinet thanked cadres and colleagues for standing by him and claimed that he had not said anything wrong. “I am not afraid of anyone and I am not backing out. My words were an expression of anger against the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) who forgot the year of India’s Independence,” he was quoted as saying.Rane has been touring the Konkan region to strengthen the BJP’s foothold ahead of crucial civic body elections, including to the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), due in February 2022.With Rane becoming the first incumbent central minister to be arrested by the state police in the last 20 years, the relations between the two former allies have hit a new low.Incidentally, late Murasoli Maran and TR Baalu are the other sitting central ministers to be arrested, in 2001.This is also not the first time Rane had targeted the CM and the Sena. He had also levelled allegations against Uddhav’s son, Aaditya Thackeray, on having links with the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narayan-ranes-arrest-day-after-war-of-words-continues-as-sena-bjp-ties-hit-a-new-low-302003
25-08-2021||---||We expect you to wait, SC tells West Bengal Government on Pegasus inquiry panel||Satya PrakashTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 25The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it expected the Justice Madan B Lokur Commission of Inquiry set up by the West Bengal Government not to proceed further as it would take up next week petitions seeking an SIT probe into Pegasus snooping scandal.“In all fairness we expect you to wait...we will hear it with the other matters sometime next week, “ a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana told senior counsel AM Singhvi—who represented the West Bengal Government. “If we are hearing other matters, we expect some restraint,” it added.The Bench—which had issued notice to the Centre on August 17 on petitions seeking an independent probe into alleged snooping on politicians, journalists and activists using Pegasus spyware—said the issue was likely to have pan-India impact.As Singhvi said nothing big was going to happen in the next few days, the Bench said, “You are forcing us to pass an order”. He urged the court not to pass any orders saying he would convey it to the West Bengal Government.The Bench clubbed the petition filed by NGO ‘Global Village Foundation Public Charitable Trust’ against Justice Lokur Commission of Inquiry set up by the West Bengal government with other petitions on Pegasus controversy.The West Bengal Government defended its decision to set up the commission of inquiry contending the Centre was “non-committal and evasive” on the issue.At the very outset, senior counsel Harish Salve submitted on behalf of ‘Global Village Foundation Public Charitable Trust’ that there can’t be two parallel inquiries.”Please see nothing is done in the proceedings there (Justice Lokur Commission) while this court is hearing the matter,” Salve submitted.Initially Singhvi opposed Salve’s submissions but later he said he would convey the court’s feelings to the state government.On August 18, the court had issued notices to the Centre and the West Bengal Government on the petition against the setting up of the commission of inquiry.An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware. It had also been reported that phones of a former judge of the Supreme Court and its registrars were allegedly intercepted using the spyware.Around 10 petitioners, including the Editors Guild of India and senior journalists N Ram and others, have sought an independent probe into the alleged snooping on eminent citizens, politicians, and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO’s spyware Pegasus.The Centre had earlier told the court that it will set up an expert panel to look into the Pegasus scandal even as it unequivocally denied allegations of snooping.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-expect-you-to-wait-sc-tells-west-bengal-government-on-pegasus-inquiry-panel-302002

In order to nab the conman our man met the fraudster as a job aspirant,” said a senior Army official.This is the second such instance in nine months. In November 2020 three fraudsters, including a jewellery trader from Ramgarh town, were arrested by the Jharkhand Police in coordination with the Army following inputs by the military intelligence that they were cheating youths from Punjab with false promises of recruitment in Punjab Regimental Centre which is one of the oldest regiments of the country, the police said.

He is an offspring of pug dog. He was rejected by the people of Konkan and Mumbai. Now ‘Beimaan Janata Party’ (referring to the Bharatiya Janata Party) has domesticated this dog to attack others. But I want to tell the BJP that it should be beware of this dog as it will bite you...He could never belong to anyone, so how can he be yours?” Bangar, who is also Sena’s district president, alleged.He also criticised Rane saying, “Even if you spit on the sun, it won’t reach there. The sun can’t be covered with two hands. The world has seen that our CM (Uddhav Thackeray) is the best.” Bangar warned Rane saying, “We have the strength to come and bash you at your house. Keep your police protection aside. I will come alone and make you bite the dust...” Talking to PTI, the Sena MLA said if someone speaks wrong things against CM Uddhav Thackeray, it would not be tolerated.Rane had said during the ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ of his party on Monday that he would have slapped Thackeray over the latter’s “ignorance” of the year of India’s independence.His remarks kicked up a row and Rane was arrested on Tuesday afternoon and taken to Mahad in Raigad district, 165 km from Mumbai, where an FIR was registered against him over the remark. However, he was granted bail by a court at Mahad late night. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rane-is-dog-kept-by-bjp-to-attack-others-but-will-bite-his-own-party-shiv-sena-mla-301987
25-08-2021||Indore||MP: Bangle seller who was assaulted in Indore arrested on molestation charges||A 25-year-old street vendor of bangles who was beaten up in Indore city of Madhya Pradesh a few days ago by a group of people has been arrested for allegedly touching a girl inappropriately and also for forgery,  police said on Wednesday. Taslim Ali was thrashed in Govind Nagar here on Sunday for using a `fake' name while selling bangles to women in the locality. Four persons were arrested in connection with the assault. Ali, a native of Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh, himself has now been arrested under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act for allegedly touching a 13-year-old girl inappropriately, Indore Superintendent of police Ashutosh Bagri said.A police team has been sent to Hardoi to verify the two Aadhaar cards with different names recovered from Ali's bag, he said, adding that a burnt voter's identity card was also found in which the name of his father was mentioned as "Mohan Singh".Ali was produced through video link before special judge for POCSO cases Suman Shrivastav who remanded him in judicial custody till September 3, sources in the public prosecution department said.According to the police, a Class 6 student had lodged a complaint at Banganga police station here alleging that Ali had introduced himself as “Golu, son of Mohan Singh” when he arrived at her house to sell bangles on Sunday, and after describing her as “very beautiful”, he tried to touch her inappropriately.As per Ali's own complaint lodged at Central Kotwali police station on Sunday, five to six persons, who were part of a mob, started beating him up after asking his name. They also snatched away Rs 10,000 in cash, a mobile phone, Aadhaar card and other documents besides bangles worth over Rs 25,000, he alleged.A video of the assault also went viral on social media.On Tuesday, Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra had said that "those who carry two-three different identity cards are criminals". "Those who hide their names are criminals. Police have registered a case against those who have beaten up the man and arrested them,” he said," responding to AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi's allegation that the BJP government in MP was shielding the accused who beat up Ali.This comes at a time when there is a marked increase in crimes against Muslims in India.  — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-bangle-seller-who-was-assaulted-in-indore-arrested-on-molestation-charges-301985
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||DRDO developing new electro-optical system to detect drones||With close monitoring of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) movement becoming imperative in the backdrop of the government opening up the skies to privately owned UAV’s and the growing security threat posed by rouge drones, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is developing a new electro-optical system for tracking such flying objects.The project is being undertaken by Instruments Research and Development Establishment (IRDE), Dehradun, which has recently embarked on another project to develop an electro-optical system for coastal and harbour surveillance.This is the second known project by DRDO to develop a surveillance system to track drones. Last year, the Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) at Bengaluru had fielded a counter-drone system which had been deployed as part of the security cover for Republic Day and Independence Day celebrations in the capital.LRDE’s system has also been demonstrated to the armed forces as well as border guarding forces. The technology for its manufacture has been transferred to the industry for commercial production.According to DRDO sources, the system to be developed by IRDE is required to detect a four-feet long UAV flying at about 300 kph from a distance of 3 km and a drone having a size of about one foot and flying at about 70 km from a distance of 2 km.The system will employ thermal Imagers, high-resolution video cameras, laser illuminators and laser range finders to detect and track drones. It will also be capable of being integrated with airspace surveillance radars. Given the small size, the miniscule radar signature, the low operating altitude and the slow speed of most drones, conventional air defence systems or standalone equipment are not effective to detect them. DRDO sources said that a combination of several types of systems including electromagnetic and radio emission, the reflection of microwave, infrared and visible light through optical instruments is required to detect, track and identify drones. Options to neutralize them include soft-kill such as jamming or hacking their radio signals or hard-kill like shooting them down.While small drones are increasingly being used to carry out commercial or personal tasks such as the delivery of goods, aerial survey or photography over the past few years, the threat of drones being used by terrorists, rogue elements or hostile nations has also enhanced significantly. The recent incident in which two drones were used to cause explosions inside the Jammu Air Force Station is a stark example of the threat posed by drones, which allow a perpetuator to reach any target in any location without exposing himself to personal risk.Besides, cross border smuggling of weapons, narcotics or contraband, espionage and intelligence gathering through drones is another area of concern. While there are frequent reports of drones being spotted in border areas, an Air Force officer revealed that after the airstrike on terror camps in Balakote across the Lien fo Control, a number of unidentified drones were spotted in the vicinity of the Srinagar Air Force Station, which may have been used to gather information on activity inside the airbase, which was then the hub of IAF operations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drdo-developing-new-electro-optical-system-to-detect-drones-301981

While several states began partial reopening of schools, there was a complete closure again in April when an aggressive second wave of Covid-19 hit the country.With an improvement in the Covid-19 situation again, several states have begun reopening schools now even as concerns have been expressed over the staff and teachers not being completely vaccinated.“In addition to the plan to provide vaccines to every state this month, more than 2 crore vaccine doses are being made available. We have requested all states to try to vaccinate all school teachers on priority before Teachers’ Day, which is celebrated on September 5,” Mandaviya said in a tweet in Hindi.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a high-level meeting on Wednesday with all states and Union Territories to review the progress of the Covid-19 vaccination drive.At the meeting, the states were advised to focus on enhancing second dose coverage as well as immunization of school teachers and staff, both government and private.States were apprised on prompt utilisation of Emergency Covid Response Package (ECRP) funds and also advised to ensure compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviour and other precautionary measures ahead of the upcoming festival season.Bhushan stressed on having a definite district-level plan to increase the coverage of the second dose.In line with the announcement made by the Union health minister, more than 2 crore additional vaccine doses will be dispatched to the states from August 27 to 31 to vaccinate school teachers and non-teaching staff on a priority basis, an official release said.States and Union Territories may use Unified District Information System of Education data and co-ordinate with the state education departments, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Navodaya Vidyalaya Sangathan and others providing a necessary fillip to this vaccination programme, it said.With the 50 per cent fund of ECRP-II package already disbursed to the states and UTs, they were advised to process procurement and supply orders immediately to procure equipment, machinery, beds and drugs in a time-bound manner.At the meeting, the states were also requested to make a month-wise expenditure plan and oversee corresponding physical progress on the ground.

They are not marrying in your presence. Software does not permit (virtual presence) is your problem,” remarked the judge.Since the Delhi government was yet to file its affidavit in the matter, the court granted three days’ time to it to do so.Counsel appearing for the couple urged the court to not grant any adjournment on the next date of hearing.“I’m saying this is final opportunity (to file counter affidavit),” the judge said.Counsel for the couple submitted that all relevant documents have already been filed and the witnesses were ready to physically appear before the official concerned.She also claimed that registration through video conferencing mode was being carried out by certain officials in the city.In the present case, the couple claimed that they have been married in 2012 and were currently residing in USA.The couple sought directions to the Delhi government to accept their online application for registration of marriage under the Delhi (Compulsory Registration of Marriage) Order, 2014 and permit them to appear before the concerned authority for purposes of registration of their marriage through video conferencing.The court had first sought a response from the Delhi government on July 16.The matter would be heard next on September 6.

School managements need to keep sanitisers and hand wash in their premises," Chudasama said.In the beginning of July, the state government had allowed reopening of schools for Class 12, colleges and technical institutions in the wake of a significant drop in new coronavirus cases.On Tuesday, Gujarat recorded 14 fresh cases of coronavirus, which took its tally of infections to 8,25,330, while the death toll remained unchanged at 10,079 as no fatality was reported during the day, as per official data.

25-08-2021||New Delhi||Not opposed to withdrawal of “malicious” cases but govt must seek approval of HCs: SC||The Supreme Court Wednesday said state governments had the power under law to withdraw “malicious” criminal cases and it is not against withdrawal of such cases but they should be examined by the high courts concerned.The top court also expressed concern over inordinate delays in investigation and conclusion of trial in cases lodged by Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation against Members of Parliament and MLAs/MLCs and asked the Centre to provide necessary manpower and infrastructure.A bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana and Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant said it would pass a detailed order on the issue and pointed out that it was not saying anything or expressing any opinion on the investigating agencies like ED or CBI as it would lower their morale but they should ensure that the trials are completed expeditiously.“We don't want to say anything about investigating agencies as we don't want to lower their morale. Else, their report speaks volumes. There are over 200 cases in these courts. Sorry to say Mr Tushar Mehta, these reports are inconclusive. No reasons have been given for not filing charge sheets for 10 to 15 years. Simply, attaching properties worth crores of rupees does not serve any purpose,” the bench said.The top court is hearing a PIL filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyay seeking life ban on lawmakers convicted in heinous criminal cases and speedy disposal of cases against them.At the outset, senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, appointed as amicus curiae in the matter, told the bench that the status reports of CBI and ED on cases against lawmakers are “disturbing” and “shocking” which need “surgical treatment” for expediting the trial.

25-08-2021||Kochi||Kerala HC to examine whether weddings under SMA can be solemnised online||A larger bench of the Kerala High Court will examine whether a wedding under the Special Marriage Act (SMA) can be solemnised online via video conferencing.Justice P B Suresh Kumar, who had heard arguments on the issue, referred it to a larger bench for consideration.The order came on the pleas by several petitioners, who have contended that personal physical presence of the bride and groom is not necessary for solemnisation of nuptials under the law.The state government, on the other hand, is not in favour of online solemnisation of marriages under the Act.It has contended that solemnisation of marriage was mandatory prior to registering it under the SMA and therefore, presence of the two sides and the witnesses is required before the Marriage Officer.It has also said that if an online mode of solemnisation was permitted, it would mandate maintaining of an electronic register of marriages and setting up an online mode of payment, both of which are not in place presently.It has further contended that another requirement for solemnisation of the marriage was that at least one of the two parties has to be resident of the area within the territorial limits of the Marriage Officer for minimum 30 days prior to issuing the notice of the intended nuptials.Therefore, two persons living abroad cannot have their marriage solemnised online if they do not satisfy the residence requirement.The petitioners, represented by advocates A Ahzar, Jawahar Jose and V Ajith Narayanan have contended that when marriages under SMA can be registered online, therefore, solemnisation too does not need physical presence of the parties involved.They have claimed that there are various judgments which say that appearing via video conferencing is akin to being present in person with the sole difference that parties cannot be touched.They said that under SMA the marriage can be solemnised by any means, like exchange of garlands or shaking of hands, as long as both parties make the declaration that they take each other as the lawfully wedded husband and wife.They also said that signatures can be submitted via digital format and the same was recognised under the Information Technology Act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-hc-to-examine-whether-weddings-under-sma-can-be-solemnised-online-301911

There will be a strong reply."Narayan Rane was arrested on Tuesday following his remarks that he would have slapped Chief Minister Thackeray for what he claimed as the latter's ignorance of the year of India's independence.He was granted bail by a court at Mahad in Raigad district on Tuesday night."Satyamev Jayate" (truth always prevails), the Union MSME minister had tweeted after getting bail.He faces four FIRs in Maharashtra over his remarks, which triggered a political row and protests across the state on Tuesday.

25-08-2021||Mumbai||Narayan Rane’s arrest justified, but custodial interrogation not necessary, says Maharashtra court||A court at Mahad in Maharashtra while granting bail to Union Minister Narayan Rane said his arrest over his controversial remarks against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was “justified”, but his custodial interrogation was not necessary.The order was passed by the court on Tuesday night and a detailed copy of it was made available on Wednesday.“Considering the reason for arrest and other reasons, I found that the arrest is justified,” magistrate SS Patil said in the order.The court noted that while a few sections under which Rane was booked were non-bailable, they were not punishable with life or death.“Considering these factors, no prejudice would be caused to the prosecution if the accused is released on bail,” the court said, adding that "the accused shall not commit a similar type of offence".Rane was arrested on Tuesday afternoon from Ratnagiri district in Maharashtra following his remarks that he would have slapped Chief Minister Thackeray for what he claimed as the latter's ignorance of the year of India's independence. The Union minister was produced before magistrate Patil at Mahad in Raigad on Tuesday night.The police sought his custody for seven days, which the court refused and remanded him to judicial custody till September 4. Rane's advocates then moved a bail application.The plea was heard and Rane was granted bail on a surety of Rs 15,000. He was directed to appear at the office of Superintendent of Police in Alibaug (Raigad) on August 30 and September 13.Rane's advocate Rajendra Shirodkar argued that the police had not followed the mandate of law laid down under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which says in cases where arrest is not warranted, the police ought to first issue a notice/summons to the accused for questioning.However, the court in its order noted that in this particular section there are grounds given when the police officer can arrest a person without notice/summons.The magistrate, while refusing to grant Rane's custody to the police, noted that the alleged statement of the accused (Rane) was made before the media.“The informant (complainant in the case) himself alleged in the FIR that the accused made the statement before the media and it was viral on social media. Considering the nature of the offence, I do not find it necessary to hand over the accused in police custody,” the magistrate said in the order.While arguing on Rane's bail plea, Shirodkar told the court that the accused was a senior citizen with roots in society and hence would not abscond.

However, the rampant violation of child rights in the form of child trafficking and child labour is still going on.The flash point for the Commission's notices was the Rajasthan government authorities' contradictory versions in a complaint to it about the alleged child trafficking of girls between eight and 15 years of age in Udaipur, Dungarpur and Banswara districts of the state. These children were allegedly sold for Rs 500 to Rs 3,000. Even a commission of Rs 50 was charged on every deal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rights-panel-issues-notices-to-centre-and-states-seeking-details-of-action-taken-against-those-employing-child-labour-301888
25-08-2021||New Delhi||Default settings in Microsoft tool exposes 38 million users' data||A default permissions settings in Microsoft Power Apps might have exposed data of 38 million users online, cybersecurity researchers reported.According to security research network UpGuard, the types of data included personal information used for Covid-19 contact tracing, vaccination appointments, social security numbers for job applicants, employee IDs, and millions of names and email addresses.UpGuard notified 47 entities of exposures involving personal information, including governmental bodies like Indiana, Maryland, and New York City, and private companies like American Airlines, J.B. Hunt, and Microsoft, for a total of 38 million records across all portals."The number of accounts exposing sensitive information, however, indicates that the risk of this feature—the likelihood and impact of its misconfiguration—has not been adequately appreciated," the UpGuard team said in a blog post.Microsoft Power Apps are a product for making "low code", cloud-hosted business intelligence apps.Power Apps portals are a way to create a public website to "give both internal and external users secure access to your data."Users can create websites in the Power Apps UI with application capabilities like user authentication, forms for users to enter data, data transformation logic, storage of structured data, and APIs to retrieve that data by other applications."Our conversations with the entities we notified suggested the same conclusion: multiple governmental bodies reported performing security reviews of their apps without identifying this issue, presumably because it has never been adequately publicised as a data security concern before," they added.There is, however, no evidence that the data has been exploited.On May 24, an UpGuard analyst first discovered that the OData API for a Power Apps portal had anonymously accessible list data, including personally identifiable information.The owner of that application was notified and the data secured."That case led to the question of whether there were other portals with the same situation—the combination of configurations allowing lists to be accessed anonymously via OData feed APIs, and sensitive data collected and stored by the apps," the team noted.As reported by Wired, Microsoft has now changed the default permissions settings responsible for the exposure. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/default-settings-in-microsoft-tool-exposes-38-million-users-data-301887

As other terror groups are beginning to muster in the Horn of Africa and reawaken movements elsewhere, we believe the African Union should be invited to attend individual G-7 meetings when appropriate,” the lawmakers said.“This would promote a regional shift for governments and ensure that the spillover effects of Afghanistan which could destabilise neighbouring countries are constantly monitored by those closest to the likely areas of threat," they said.The export of terror, whether in South Asia, the Middle East, East Africa, or any other part of the world, should be met with swift and decisive action,” the statement said.The G-7 is an intergovernmental political grouping of seven countries comprising the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.

I insisted on submission of evidence," Annamalai said."When he said he would release the video, I tersely replied 'go ahead'," Annamalai said in a statement, recalling the conversation the youtuber had with him recently.The youtuber claimed he had several videos involving many leaders, Annamalai said and added, "this only raises suspicion over his intention, which is highly condemnable."     He expressed hope that Raghavan would legally face the allegations and prove himself.Referring to the controversial video, Raghavan claimed "it has been released to tarnish my image and that of my party."     "Today, I met the state president Annamalai and consulted him. I resign from all my party responsibilities. I deny the allegations. I will face it legally.

To say that skin-to-skin contact is required (to attract POCSO Act) will mean an accused wearing gloves getting an acquittal. The judge clearly didn’t see the far-reaching consequences,” Venugopal told a Bench led by Justice UU Lalit. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reverse-bombay-high-court-skin-contact-verdict-in-pocso-case-attorney-general-to-superme-court-301550

Major Wazir Akbar, an Afghan army commando who has joined the Panjshir fighters, said the counterattack at Anjuman Pass claimed many victims.In Kabul, Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid called on “our brothers in Panjshir” for talks while a Taliban leader confirmed that a delegation will “meet with Ahmad Massoud himself and a number of other people who are involved in the Panjshir case.”Mufti Anamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban Cultural Commission, said: “Efforts are being made very intensively.” Mujahid also said “the ones that are there (Panjshir) and have some reservations, we are talking to them”.Even before the Taliban takeover of Kabul, leaders of Panjshir province had been calling on the Afghan government in Kabul to give them more autonomy.Ahmad Massoud, one of the Resistance-2 leaders, has said its forces have adequate stores of ammunition and arms to withstand a Taliban assault.Panjshir is surrounded by Badakhshan, Takhar and Baghlan provinces, which are under Taliban control.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taliban-to-send-team-to-panjshir-for-talks-301552

They also arrested two left-wing extremists in Dantewada while ‘planning’ to plant improvised explosive devices (IEDs).Officials in the security forces said after the encounter in forest areas of Gompad and Kanhaiguda in Sukma district, bodies of two Naxals were recovered with arms/ammunition/explosives and their camping material.The gunfight took place at around 8 am in a forest area, which is over 450 km from the state capital Raipur, when a joint team of security forces was out on an anti-Naxal operation, they said.Personnel belonging to the District Reserve Guard (DRG) of Chhattisgarh Police, the CRPF and its elite unit Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) were involved in the operation, that was launched based on the inputs about the movement of Naxals inside the forest. Blood stains found at the site indicated that many other Naxals were either injured or killed in the face-off, but the rebels managed to take them inside the forest, the officials said.The identity of the killed ultras was yet to be ascertained, but prima facie, one of them seemed to be Kawasi Hunga, who was active as the Konta area LOS (local organisation squad) commander of Maoists, the officials said.Meanwhile, two Naxals, each carrying a reward of Rs 2 lakh on his head, were arrested when they were allegedly planning to plant IEDs to target security forces in Dantewada district of the state, the officials said.“Two tiffin bombs were recovered from the possession of the arrested ultras. A patrolling team of the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and local police nabbed Pandu alias Mangu Madvi (23) and Hurra alias Korma Sodi (22) on Monday near Hiroli village under Kirandul police station area,” Dantewada Superintendent of Police Abhishek Pallava is reported to have said.Arms, explosives seized||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-naxals-gunned-down-in-sukma-another-two-held-in-dantewada-301553

The PM is giving free gifts to select industry friends and launching an assault on the future of the youth. The sale of assets will create monopolies and a day will come when the young people will have no jobs because few business houses that are left will not feel the obligation to create jobs.”Noting that the Congress is not against privatisation, but against blanket privatisation, Rahul asked why strategic sectors such as the railways and those that are progressing such as the roads and power transmission should be privatised.“The Congress is not against privatisation, but our policy had some logic. We never privatised strategic sectors. We privatised chronic loss-making entities and ensured monopolies are not created,” Gandhi said, flanked by former Finance Minister P Chidambaram who urged people to debate the development.“Is it fair to make money by seeking rent on national assets?” Chidambaram asked.Gandhi listed the assets selected for privatisation and said, “I need not say to whom which asset will go. That is evident. The BJP used to say the Congress did nothing for 70 years and here they are selling off everything that was built in 70 years.”TMC opposes leasing toy train services to pvt players||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monetisation-will-create-monopolies-enslave-people-rahul-gandhi-301554

A review of government work was held,” AICC in-charge of Chhattisgarh PL Punia said after the meeting.Rahul met Baghel and Deo separately to discuss their concerns. Deo and his camp want the party top brass to execute the previously agreed upon power-sharing formula of rotation of the CM’s post after the state government completed half of its term.The state government completed 2.5 years in June 2021 with Deo and his supporters urging the high command to honour their promise made in December 2018 after the party won Chhattisgarh comfortably.Baghel on his part appears firmly in the saddle with the leadership anxious about mounting anxieties on both sides. Sources said more meetings would be held in the coming days to resolve matters between Baghel and Deo. Deo, the serving health minister, has already signaled his impatience over unfulfilled promises.With troubles in Chhattisgarh mounting, the Congress is now embattled in all three states it rules on its own – Punjab, where CM Amarinder Singh and state chief Navjot Sidhu are at loggerheads; Rajasthan where CM Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot are engaged in power-sharing negotiations and Chhattisgarh where Deo wants the CM’s post rotated.Another Cong rift out in open||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chhattisgarh-cm-bhupesh-baghel-minister-ts-singh-deo-meet-rahul-gandhi-amid-power-tussle-301555

It ordered the accused to surrender.The Bench — which had on Monday taken strong exception to the Uttarakhand and Allahabad High Courts passing orders for protection from arrest “without application of mind” despite its directions to high courts to use their inherent power sparingly — enumerated several parameters to be considered by high courts for grant of bail.The top court said high courts needed to consider if there were prima facie or reasonable grounds to believe that the accused has committed the offence; nature and gravity of the accusation; severity of the punishment in the event of conviction; and danger of the accused absconding, if released on bail.Character, behaviour and standing of accused, including his/her antecedents; likelihood of the offence being repeated; reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being influenced and danger of justice being adversely affected have to be duly considered while deciding bail pleas, it noted.“This is a serious matter. The FIR was registered under Section 302 of IPC. Just see the anxiety of the High Court, it directs that the person should surrender by August 10 and the bail be decided on the same day and if the bail application is rejected, then the sessions court should hear the bail plea the same day,” the top court had on Monday said while hearing a petition against an order of Uttarakhand High Court on a petition seeking quashing of the FIR in a murder case.SC stays demolition of 5K ‘jhuggis’ in GujaratThe SC on Tuesday ordered status quo on the demolition of around 5,000 ‘jhuggis’ in Gujarat for a railway line project.

"It is shameful that the CM does not know the year of Independence. He leaned back to enquire about the count of years of Independence during his speech. Had I been there, I would have given (him) a tight slap," Rane was quoted as saying.BJP chief JP Nadda said, "The arrest of Union Minister Narayan Raneji by the Maharashtra Government is in violation of constitutional values. We will neither be scared nor suppressed by such actions. These people are troubled by the immense support the BJP is getting during the Jan Ashirwad Yatra. We will continue to fight democratically and the yatra will continue.”Terming it as “absolute vendetta”, Former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “We strongly condemn this gross misuse of police force and suppression. Sharjeel Usmani is free and Narayan Rane arrested! This is their Hindutva.”Rane’s remark had evoked sharp reactions from Shiv Sena cadres. They put up posters in Mumbai and other places calling him a “kombdi chor” (chicken stealer), a reference to the poultry shop Rane ran in Mumbai’s Chembur area five decades ago.

Speaking at the UN Human Rights Council’s (UNHRC) special session on “Serious human rights concerns in Afghanistan”, Indian diplomat Indra Mani Pandey called upon all parties concerned to allow unhindered access to international assistance because “stability in Afghanistan is linked to the peace and security of the region”.Opinions page: Spotlight on Pakistan: India should be in no hurry to decide on our attitude towards the TalibanUNHRC chief Michelle Bachelet sought a mechanism to closely monitor Taliban’s actions following credible reports of serious violations by the insurgent group, including summary executions of civilians and Afghan security forces. A fundamental “red line” will be the Taliban’s treatment of women and girls and freedom of self-expression and employment, she added.The special sessionwas convened following a joint request by Pakistan, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and Afghanistan. Unsurprisingly, the draft resolution penned by Pakistan is mildly worded, doesn’t name the Taliban and doesn’t call for a fact-finding mission.

Sensing US firmness in pulling out, India and Russia have decided to set up a permanent bilateral channel for consultations to discuss Afghanistan.“It is important for the two strategic partners to work together,’’ said an MEA readout of the 45-minute conversation between PM Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.PM Modi had on Monday conferred with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Afghanistan. Along with Italy and Spain, Berlin is playing an important role in evacuations from Kabul and has soldiers on the ground.Separately, NSA Ajit Doval flagged to his BRICS counterparts, including from Russia and China, cross-border terrorism by groups such as Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) which enjoy state support and threaten peace and security.Their activities tend to slip under the radar during global talks on terrorism in the region and were flagged by Doval at the virtual meeting of “BRICS High Representatives Responsible for National Security”, which he had hosted.CIA Director meets Taliban top leader CIA chief William Burns travelled to Kabul this week for talks with Taliban leader Mullah Baradar, US media reported as the US came under pressure from allies to extend withdrawal deadline78 more evacuated from AfghanistanIndia on Tuesday brought back 78 persons, including its 25 nationals and some Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, from Dushanbe, a day after they were evacuated from KabulTaliban to send team to Panjshir for talksOn a tense day around Panjshir when the resistance forces stalled Taliban march, reports said the insurgents agreed to send a team for talks with Ahmad Massoud||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-wont-extend-pullout-date-g7-for-safe-passage-beyond-august-31-301561
25-08-2021||New Delhi||Covid in India maybe entering some kind of stage of endemicity: WHO’s Soumya Swaminathan||Covid-19 in India may be entering some kind of stage of endemicity where there is low or moderate level of transmission going on, Chief Scientist of the World Health Organisation Dr Soumya Swaminathan said.The endemic stage is when a population learns to live with a virus. It’s very different from the epidemic stage when the virus overwhelms a population.On clearance to Covaxin, she said she is fairly confident that the WHO’s technical group will be satisfied to give Covaxin clearance to be one of its authorised vaccines and that could happen by mid-September.In an interview to journalist Karan Thapar for news website The Wire, Swaminathan said given the size of India and heterogeneity of population and immunity status in different parts of the country, it is “very very feasible” that the situation may continue like this with ups and downs in various parts of the nation.“We may be entering some kind of stage of endemicity where there is low level transmission or moderate level transmission going on but we are not seeing the kinds of exponential growth and peaks that we saw a few months ago,” Swaminathan said.“As far as India is concerned that seems to be what is happening and because of size of India and heterogeneity of population and immunity status in different parts of country in different pockets, it is very very feasible that the situation may continue like this with ups and downs in different parts of the country, particularly where there are more susceptible population, so those groups who were perhaps less affected by first and second waves or those areas with low levels of vaccine coverage we could see peaks and troughs for the next several months,” she said.She said she hopes that by the end of 2022 “we would be in that position that we have achieved vaccine coverage, say 70 per cent, and then countries can get back to normal”.On prevalence of Covid among children, Swaminathan said parents need not panic.“We can take from the sero survey and what we learnt from other countries also that while it is possible that children could get infected and transmit, children luckily have very mild illness most of the time and there is a small percentage that gets sick and get inflammatory complications and few will die but much much less than the adult population...But it is good to prepare... preparing hospitals for paediatric admissions, paediatric intensive care is going to serve our health system in many ways for other illnesses children have but we should not panic about thousands of children crowding into ICUs,” she said.On use of drugs like Remdesivir, HCQ or Ivermectin for treatment, she said as of now, there is no evidence that HCQ or Ivermectin have any role to play in reducing mortality or morbidity in people infected with the virus or actually preventing people from getting infection, so therefore there are no grounds on which recommendations can be made in use of either of these drugs for treatment or prevention.“Solidarity trial showed Remdesivir does not reduce mortality, it may have a marginal benefit in subgroup of patients who are ill enough to need oxygen but not ill enough to be on ventilation so there may be a marginal benefit but certainly Remdesivir does not do much in stage of moderately or severely ill patients. It is also very expensive. Drugs like Dexamethasone and Oxygen are the two essential ones that save lives,” she added.On clearance to Covaxin, she said the decision can be made hopefully by mid-September.“The Bharat Biotech submitted their data in the third week of July which was the first data set, then there was an updated data set that came in the middle of August. The committee has gone back to the company with some questions which they must be in process of answering now. I think the technical advisory group that ultimately approves will meet in the first 10 days of September and so we are hoping it happens soon after that,” she said.“So by the middle of September I am thinking, and the reason it took longer was because of back and forth and the need for more data requested from the company and this is the usual process. People think it is taking longer for Covaxin than for others but that is not the case... each company that applied for EUL (Emergency Use Listing) had taken this period of 4 to 6 to 8 weeks to get all the data needed,” she said.On the third wave, she said no one has a “crystal ball” and it’s impossible to predict a third wave.“It will be impossible to predict when, where the third wave will be upon us and if at all a third wave will come. However, you can make an educated guess on some of the variables that have an impact on transmission,” she said.On booster doses, she said there are both scientific and moral, and ethical reasons for not rushing into boosters.“...so it would also be in self interest of countries who have excess doses now to send those doses out through Covax to countries that desperately need them,” she said.On vaccine passport concept, she said, “We do not believe that vaccination has to be a prerequisite at least at the global level to do things like travelling because we haven’t given everyone an opportunity to get vaccinated there is so much inequity in access to vaccines, so the first thing is to get rid of the inequality then you can allow people vaccinated to relax certain measures.” Vaccine passports are for allowing international travel to those fully vaccinated against coronavirus.

We want the state to verify what the medical condition is,” the Bench said, posting the matter for further hearing September 6.Singh said Kumar was earlier treated by a doctor at a private hospital and he could be treated there only.“I have serious reservations about private hospitals and these powerful accused,” senior advocate Dushyant Dave said on behalf of the complainants.He pointed out that the top court had in September last year dismissed Kumar’s interim bail.When Singh said that Kumar is in a “very precarious condition”, Dave said that in March last year he was examined by an AIIMS board.The Supreme Court had on September 4 last year dismissed Kumar’s interim bail plea, saying "This is not a small case... We cannot grant you bail.” It had also declined his plea for hospitalisation, saying his medical reports suggested he didn’t need to be sent to a hospital.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-cbi-to-verify-medical-condition-of-former-congress-leader-sajjan-kumar-jailed-in-1984-riots-case-301438

Evacuees were flown in from Kabul on an @IAF_MCC aircraft,” he said on Twitter.On Monday, India brought back 146 of its nationals to Delhi in four different flights from the Qatari capital Doha, days after they were evacuated from Kabul by NATO and American aircraft.India has stepped up efforts to evacuate its citizens as well as its Afghan partners from Kabul in view of the deteriorating security situation in the Afghan capital and other parts of the country after the Taliban swept to power last week.On Sunday, India evacuated 392 people including two Afghan lawmakers in three different flights under the evacuation mission.The Taliban seized control of Kabul on August 15. Within two days of the Taliban’s capture of Kabul, India evacuated 200 people, including the Indian envoy and other staffers of its embassy in the Afghan capital.The first evacuation flight brought back over 40 people, mostly staffers at the Indian embassy on August 16.The second aircraft evacuated around 150 people including Indian diplomats, officials, security personnel and some stranded Indians from Kabul on August 17.India carried out the evacuation missions in coordination with the US and several other friendly countries.The Taliban swept across Afghanistan this month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities, including Kabul, in the backdrop of the withdrawal of the US forces.

25-08-2021||Mumbai||Union minister Narayan Rane arrested after ‘would have slapped Uddhav Thackeray' remark||Union minister Narayan Rane was arrested on Tuesday after sparking off a row over his remarks about slapping Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for what he claimed was the latter's ignorance of the year of India's independence.Rane was taken into custody by police in coastal Ratnagiri district, where he is travelling as part of the Jan Ashirwad Yatra, an official said.Rane was taken to the Sangameshwar police station after being taken into custody, the official said.There were reports that the BJP leader complained of high blood pressure and sugar levels and a doctor was called to examine him.“It is shameful that the chief minister does not know the year of independence. He leaned back to enquire about the count of years of independence during his speech. Had I been there, I would have given (him) a tight slap,” Rane said in adjoining Raigad district on Monday.The former chief minister claimed Thackeray forgot the year of independence during his August 15 address to the people of the state. Thackeray had to check the year of independence with his aides midway during the speech that day, Rane said.Rane on Tuesday defended his remarks against Thackeray, saying he hasn't committed any crime by making them.On media reportage of his 'imminent arrest' in the case, Rane said—hours before his arrest—that he was not a ‘normal' man and cautioned the media against such reportage.“I haven't committed any crime. You should verify and show it on TV or else I will file a case against you (media). Despite not committing any crime, the media is showing speculative news about my 'imminent' arrest. Do you think I am a normal (ordinary) man?” Rane said.Rane's remarks drew sharp reactions from Shiv Sena, whose workers put several posters in Mumbai and other places, calling him a ‘kombdi chor'केंद्रीय मंत्री श्री नारायणराव राणे यांच्यावरील कारवाई ही सूडबुद्धीने केलेली आहे.पोलिस यंत्रणेचा दुरूपयोग करीत होत असलेल्या या दडपशाहीचा मी तीव्र निषेध करतो.शर्जिल उस्मानी मोकाट आणि नारायण राणे यांना अटक!हे आहे नवे हिंदूत्त्व आणि असा आहे नवा महाराष्ट्र !!!#NarayanRane  (chicken stealer), a reference to the poultry shop he ran in Mumbai's Chembur area five decades ago, during the initial part of his over four-decades-old stint with the Bal Thackeray-led party.Activists of Shiv Sena and its youth wing staged protests in various cities across Maharashtra against Rane.In Pune's Deccan Gymkhana area, Sena workers slapped posters of Rane with footwear. Yuva Sena workers staged a demonstration in Hadapsar.A stone was hurled at a mall located on JM Road in Pune, a police official said.In Amravati, Sena workers vandalised the BJP office located in the Rajapeth area and also set various posters installed in front of the office on fire in protest against Rane's remarks.No BJP office-bearer or party worker was present in the office at the time of the incident.Sena activists poured petrol, brought by them in bottles, on the posters installed outside the office and set them afire around noon. They also hurled stones at the office.Heavy police security was deployed outside Rane's residence in Mumbai in the wake of his remarks against Thackeray, an official said.BJP workers gathered outside Rane's residence on Juhu Tara Road in Santacruz (West) in the morning in support of their party leader.Shiv Sena workers carrying placards and shouting slogans against Rane assembled in Juhu area.Police personnel, including women cops, were deployed outside Rane's residence to prevent any untoward incident, the official said.Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil distanced himself from Rane's remarks. “I am not defending Rane's comments, but I will also not express regret," Patil said.Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the BJP does not support Rane's comments, but the "party stands behind him 100 per cent".Alleging that the state police force was being used as a tool for "vendetta politics", the former chief minister said there should be law and order and "not Taliban-like governance".Union minister Ramdas Athawale said Rane didn't intend to insult Thackeray and will clarify his statement."Rane only meant that Thackeray is not doing anything for the development of Maharashtra and he seldom steps out of his residence 'Matoshree' in Mumbai to understand the problems faced by the people. Rane meant that such a chief minister does not have the right to occupy the chair. This was his feeling," he said.Shiv Sena MP Vinayak Raut wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding sacking of Rane over his remarks against the Maharashtra chief minister.Raut said it was beyond his comprehension what message Rane would give to the society when he himself was using such language."It is also an insult to the prime minister of this country,” Raut said in the letter.Talking to reporters later, Raut said Rane should resign from the Modi ministry.Nashik Police Commissioner Deepak Pandey on Tuesday issued orders for the immediate arrest of Rane and a team of city police left for Konkan region.Rane approached the Bombay High Court, challenging the FIRs registered against him in parts of Maharashtra over his remarks against Thackeray, and sought protection from arrest.The BJP leader also sought an interim order granting him protection from arrest or any coercive action.The petition was mentioned before a division bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar, seeking an urgent hearing on Tuesday itself.The bench, however, refused to hear it and said mentioning (of the petition) was not allowed and asked the lawyer to follow the procedure."File an application before the Registry department seeking urgent hearing and then we will consider," the court said."Everyone has to go through the process. Don't make us do the job of the Registry," the HC said.The petition has challenged three FIRs lodged against Rane in Pune, Nashik and Mahad in Raigad.A court in Ratnagiri rejected Rane's anticipatory bail application.'Unconstitutional'BJP national president JP Nadda and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis both condemned the arrest."Maharashtra government's decision to arrest Narayan Rane against constitutional values. We won't be cowed down by such actions," Nadda said in a tweet. Fadnavis called the arrest "vendetta" and a "misuse of state machinery". — Agencies महाराष्ट्र सरकार द्वारा केंद्रीय मंत्री नारायण राणे जी की गिरफ़्तारी संवैधानिक मूल्यों का हनन है। इस तरह की कार्यवाही से ना तो हम डरेंगे, ना दबेंगे।भाजपा को जन-आशीर्वाद यात्रा में मिल रहे अपार समर्थन से ये लोग परेशान है।हम लोकतांत्रिक ढंग से लड़ते रहेंगे, यात्रा जारी रहेंगी।||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-minister-narayan-rane-arrested-after-would-have-slapped-uddhav-thackeray-remark-301411
