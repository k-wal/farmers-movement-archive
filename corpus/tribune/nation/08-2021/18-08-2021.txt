The court fixed September 28 as the next date of hearing in the case. Earlier, the court had allowed impleadment applications filed by petitioners seeking permission to add central and state governments as party to the petition. They were then added as respondents in the petition. According to the petitioners, an order passed by a court in Varanasi in April directing the ASI to conduct the survey of the land was illegal and without jurisdiction. According to the petitioners, the Allahabad High Court had reserved its judgment on the maintainability of the suit pending in the Varanasi court, which has been hearing the contentions of the opposite party (the Temple Trust). On April 8, the Varanasi court had ordered a five-member committee, comprising two Hindu, two Muslim members, and an archaeological expert, to oversee the "comprehensive physical survey" of the centuries-old Gyanvapi mosque complex. The plea in the case had contended that the mosque was a part of the temple. The original suit was filed in 1991 in Varanasi district court seeking restoration of the ancient temple at the site where the mosque currently stands. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petitions-seeking-stay-on-survey-of-gyanvapi-mosque-allahabad-hc-asks-centre-up-government-to-file-reply-in-3-weeks-299049
18-08-2021||New Delhi||Navies of India, Australia ink document for boosting cooperation in Indo-Pacific||The Indian and Australian navies on Wednesday signed a document that provides for consolidating shared commitment to promote peace, security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.The defence ministry said the document, 'Joint Guidance for Australia-India Navy to Navy Relationship', is aimed at ensuring a shared approach to regional and global security challenges. "The document would be pivotal in consolidating the shared commitment to promote peace, security, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region," it said. The document was firmed up a ceremony held virtually between Indian Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh and Vice Admiral Michael J Noonan, Chief of Navy of Australian Navy. In June last year, India and Australia elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed a landmark deal for reciprocal access to military bases for logistics support during an online summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison. The Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) allows militaries of the two countries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies, besides facilitating scaling up of overall defence cooperation. The Australian Navy was part of the Malabar naval exercise hosted by India in November last year. The navies of the US and Japan were also part of it. "The document is aligned to the 2020 Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreed by the prime ministers (of the two countries) and aims to ensure shared approached to regional and global security challenges," the ministry said in a statement. It said the joint guidance would serve as a guideline document to showcase the intent of both the Navies to work together bilaterally and multilaterally. "The broad scope of the guidance is focused on developing mutual understanding, cooperate for regional security, collaborate in mutually beneficial activities and to develop interoperability," the ministry said. "The highlights of document include close cooperation in regional and multilateral fora, including Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), Western Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS), Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and Expert Working Groups subordinate to the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus framework," it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/navies-of-india-australia-ink-document-for-boosting-cooperation-in-indo-pacific-299046

It asked him to serve the copy of the petition to the Centre and the West Bengal Government.Mishra said the petition challenged the West Bengal Government notification issued last month appointing the commission to probe into the snooping allegations on the ground of jurisdiction.“The problem is there is some inconsistency in your affidavit. You say you want an inquiry, at the same time you are opposing the Commission of Inquiry. In your affidavit and in your petition, you must be consistent,” the Bench noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-sc-refuses-to-stay-west-bengal-government-notification-setting-up-commission-of-inquiry-299044

18-08-2021||New Delhi||India should have publicly engaged with Taliban earlier: Natwar Singh||India should have publicly engaged with the Taliban before they took over Afghanistan, former External Affairs Minister K Natwar Singh said on Wednesday and favoured establishing diplomatic ties if they function as a responsible government going forward in the war-torn country.Singh, who was the foreign minister in UPA-I and also served as India’s Ambassador to Pakistan besides holding other senior diplomatic positions, said India should adopt a “wait and watch” approach for the time being but noted that the Taliban that have taken over seems to be a “better lot” than those that ruled there two decades earlier.In an interview with PTI, 92-year-old Singh said India was quite close to President Ashraf Ghani “who has run away” but the situation has “altered drastically” now.Though the situation is not “adversarial”, even a semblance of friendship has disappeared and that is why the Indian government is “very careful”, he added.The Americans have to take a lot of blame because US President Joe Biden, by pulling out his troops, made it easy for the Taliban to walk in, Singh said.His remarks follow Taliban insurgents sweeping Kabul after the US-backed Afghan government collapsed and President Ghani fled the country on Sunday, bringing an unprecedented end to efforts made by the US and its allies to transform the war-ravaged nation in the last two decades.Asked if India should have engaged with the Taliban earlier, Singh answered in affirmative and cited Americans’ example of holding talks with the group.“If I was the foreign minister, I would have had contact with them. I would have gone out of my way and told my intelligence agency to make a contact quietly,” said the former Congress veteran, who was the external affairs minister from May 2004–December 2005. A few years later, he had quit the Congress.Citing the example of Americans having contact with Cuba at Guantanamo, he said India should have engaged with the Taliban as “we can’t leave the field open to Pakistan and China”.On whether, like China, India should also have engaged with the Taliban leadership publicly, the former minister said at least at the foreign secretary level, India should have kept contact with the Taliban publicly.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had met Mullah Baradar at Tianjin last month and sought to prevail on him to build a “positive image and establish a broad and inclusive political structure that suits Afghanistan’s national realities”.Singh said the Taliban, not the present lot but the one that ruled earlier, openly had said they were anti-Hindu. They are still much closer to Pakistan, but that doesn’t mean that Islamabad can dictate terms to them, he added.“Pakistan financed them, then Americans armed them. It is a very complex situation but at the moment we are not a player,” he said.Singh said India spent USD 3 billion on Afghanistan in the last 10-12 years, building roads, hospitals, schools and whatever little industries they have.“All that is gone (with the Taliban coming). Violence has already started, they beat up a few people. But they are a better lot than those 30 years ago, they are more educated, they are more aware of the world. They have also become conscious that the world opinion matters,” Singh said.He noted that the present lot of Taliban will be more careful but India was not a priority for them.Asked if India should recognise them if they stick to their words that they will not allow Afghan soil for activities inimical to any other country, Singh said, “I think we should, absolutely. We can’t choose a government of another country and if they are functioning as a responsible and a reasonable government, there is no reason (not to recognise) because we have a stake in Afghanistan.”The former foreign minister also asserted that the priority should be to evacuate Indians who want to come back.On the Modi government’s Afghanistan policy, particularly after 2019, Singh said, “I say this with due respect to the present government, we have not taken as much interest as we should have. If I were a foreign minister, I would have sent for Hamid Ansari, a former Indian envoy to Afghanistan, to consult him on this crisis.”“I would have said, let us wait and keep well informed. There are other friendly countries who are there, they can let us know,” he said.Talking about India’s Afghan policy over the years after independence, Singh said India was a major player in Afghanistan 30-40 years ago but that changed in the later years.“Jawaharlal ji, Indira Ji and Rajiv (Gandhi) were very interested in relations with Afghanistan and they had personal relations with the heads of state and government. When V P Singh and Narasimha Rao took over, they did not know much. Things have now altered... We have consul general’s office in some places but we don’t carry enough weight with the Afghan government for the last 20-30 years,” he said.Asked about the Modi government’s performance on the foreign policy front, Singh said they have not made any bloomer.“I think (S) Jaishankar has been quite active, meeting people, and is a very balanced individual. But I think the impression that goes around is that the prime minister’s secretariat is also active in foreign policy. Don’t know how true this is but this is the general impression,” he said, adding that he was not commenting whether it was a good or bad thing.

The younger of the two has said that they were drugged within the hospital premises, taken outside the hospital, and confined at an unknown location for several days.Both sisters went missing from the hospital on August 7. While the younger has managed to reach the police, the elder sister is still missing. The Hyderabad Police have arrested four men, including a lab technician.The two sisters had arrived at Gandhi hospital accompanying the husband of one of them, who was admitted for treatment of a liver disorder. According to the statement given to a local news channel, the younger sister has said that she was drugged within the hospital premises on August 7 and had no recollection of the events after that. She was found lying naked, unconscious in the hospital premises on August 14.A technician with the Radiology department, their relative, and a few of his colleagues are the prime suspects in the case. Surprisingly, the husband of one of the sisters was informed by the technician that one of the sisters was found in a naked and unconscious in the hospital premises.The police got into action after a women’s organisation formed a fact-finding team and probed the disappearance. Initially, a complaint was lodged at Mahbubnagar, but the Mahbubnagar police did not pay heed to the request for a zero FIR. They were redirected to the Chilkalguda police station in Hyderabad, where an FIR was finally registered on August 16.Police inspector G Naresh told the media that the technician identified as Uma Maheswar and three others had been taken into custody based on the complaint, and an investigation has been taken up.Sources at the hospital have unofficially said that the medical examination of one of the women who alleged sexual assault on her and her sister had not found any evidence of assault or struggle. The second woman is still missing.Meanwhile, the five-member women fact-finding team who went to enquire about the incident at the Gandhi Hospital were taken into preventive custody by the Lalaguda police on Tuesday for trying to interfere with the functioning of the police.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sisters-abducted-from-hospital-allege-sexual-assault-299026

18-08-2021|| Madurai||Madras HC bats for more functional autonomy for CBI||The Madras High Court has batted for more functional autonomy for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), without any government control, and bring the premier agency on par with departments that report directly to the Prime Minister.Charging the agency with dragging its feet whenever the court wanted to hand over serious cases, saying it lacked the resources and manpower to take up the probe, the Madurai bench on Tuesday said this has "been parroted" for a long time before the court whenever it wanted to hand over the investigation of certain cases to the CBI. The agency should be made independent with functional autonomy without the administrative control of the government.Its director should be given the power of the Secretary to the government and should report to the Prime Minister or the Minister concerned, Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice B Pugalendhi said. There was a need to have a special act to provide statutory status to the CBI, they added.The court was hearing a plea from petitioners in Ramanathapuram district in Tamil Nadu, seeking to transfer the probe into a case of cheating depositors of Rs 300 crore to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the CBI."This ground (lack of resources and man power) has been parroted time and again before the court", the judges said.The court said the CBI lacked sufficient financial administrative powers and that it should be vested with ex-officio powers of the Secretary to the government.The judges suggested that the premier agency has to be elevated to such heights that it can be equated with the US' FBI and the Scotland yard.There is no doubt that the conviction rate of the cases probed by CBI was 60 per cent, but it needed to be enhanced, the court said.The courts handed over cases to CBI because they had faith in them. Sometimes cases were handed over even without the State's consent, the bench said.The judges wanted the agency to file a well-thought-out policy within six weeks for permanent recruiting of Cyber forensic and financial audit experts. The Government should clear pending proposals pertaining to CBI infrastructure development.The court also directed the central forensic science laboratory to clear cases pending as of December 2020. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madras-hc-bats-for-more-functional-autonomy-for-cbi-299021

The industry producing and consuming HFC will be phasing out as per the agreed schedule under and transition to non-HFC and low global warming potential technologies.HFC phasedown is expected to prevent the emission of up to 105 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases, helping to avoid up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of global temperature rise by 2100 while continuing to protect the ozone layer.The phasedown implementation will involve synergies with ongoing government programmes and schemes of the Government of India with the objective to maximize the economic arid social co-benefits, besides environmental gains.There would be scope for domestic manufacturing of equipment as well as alternative non-HFC and low-global warming potential chemicals to enable the industry to transition to the low global warming potential alternatives as per the agreed HFC phase down schedule. In addition, there would be opportunities to promote domestic innovation for new generation alternative refrigerants and related technologies, according to the statementWhile HFCs do not deplete the stratospheric ozone layer, they have a high global warming potential ranging from 12,000 to 14,000, which have an adverse impact on climate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/national-strategy-for-hydrofluorocarbons-phasedown-by-2023-299013
18-08-2021||New Delhi||R-Value remains over 1 for Himachal, shows study||The reproduction number for coronavirus remains worryingly over 1 for Himachal Pradesh even though the R-number steadily declines for the rest of the country, a recent study by Chennai's Institute of Mathematical Sciences showed. A study by researchers at the institution shows that the reproduction number, or R number—a parameter used to measure the spread of disease and shows how quickly an illness is spreading in a certain population—has been on a steady decline for India after it fell under 1 in the first week of August. “India’s R has fallen to around 0.9,” Sitbara Sinha, who is leading the research, told PTI, citing their data.Entry into Himachal only through registration on e-covid softwareIf R is under 1, it means the number of newly infected people is lower than the number of infected people in the preceding period and the disease incidence is going down.However, Himachal Pradesh continues to have an R value of above 1, although it reduced in the last few days, while Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand still have R very close to 1, Sinha said. The R-value of Kerala, which has the highest number of active cases in the country, is now below 1 after a gap of seven months, signalling a relief to authorities who have been struggling to bring down the injection levels in the state.The northeastern states seem to have finally come out of the second wave, Sinha said.The R-value between August 14-16, calculated by the researchers now stands at 0.89.The R-value for Maharashtra, another state which has a high number of cases, is 0.89, the data shows.Among the major cities, the R-value of Mumbai was lowest (0.70 from August 10-13), followed by Delhi (0.85 from July 31 to August 4), Bengaluru (0.94 from August 15-17), Chennai (0.97 from August 15-17). However, the R value remains high for Kolkata (1.08 from August 11-15), Pune (1.05 from August 10-14),The Reproduction number or R refers to how many people an infected person infects, on average. In other words, it tells how ‘efficiently’ a virus is spreading.A smaller R indicates the disease is on a decline. Conversely, if R is greater than 1, the number of infected people is increasing in each round - technically, this is what is called the epidemic phase.After the devastating second wave that saw hospitals and health infrastructure being overwhelmed by the patients infected by SARS-CoV2  coronavirus, the R-value started to decline.During the March-May period, thousands of people died due to the infection while lakhs were infected.In its bulletin on Wednesday, the Ministry of Health said India saw a single-day rise of 25,166 new Covid-19 cases, the lowest in 154 days, taking the tally to 3,22,50,679.The national recovery rate was recorded at 97.51 percent, the highest since March 2020. Less than 50,000 daily cases have been reported for 52 consecutive days.From June 20 to July 7, the R-value stood at 0.78.

According to the JMCI Report, the Renkoji authorities were not willing to allow a DNA test of the alleged remains."In his statement, he pointed out that the chief priest of Renkoji Temple, Reverend Nichiko Mochizuki, had written to Indian embassy in Tokyo in 2005 insisting that the remains be returned.Bose, an IT consultant, further quoted excerpts from a letter written by Mochizuki, whose father is known to have received the purported remains of Netaji in September 1945, to make his point.According to the excerpt, Mochizuki told the embassy, "I felt that if I accepted the proposal for DNA testing and the remains are eventually returned to India, my father's soul and spirit could finally be at rest. In this way, I agree to offer my co-operation for the testing." The translation of the chief priest's original letter was commissioned by Madhuri Bose, Netaji's grandniece.Renkoji Temple authorities were fully supportive of a DNA test on the remains, Bose maintained."It is time to seize the opportunity missed by Justice Mukherjee to conduct a DNA testing procedure on the reported remains of Netaji. There is every reason to believe that this entire process would be fully acceptable to and supported by the Renkoji Temple authorities, as well as by the governments of both Japan and India,” the IT consultant stated.Bose had in 2015 met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Berlin to raise the demand for declassification of all secret files related to the freedom fighter."Subhas Bose did not belong just to his family. He had himself said that the whole country is his family," the grandnephew had said back then.Earlier, Netaji's daughter Anita Bose Pfaff had also requested the governments of India and Japan to make arrangements to bring her father's purported remains back home. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/netajis-kin-seeks-dna-test-of-ashes-kept-at-japans-renkoji-temple-299006

She was brought to the police station where she told officials that she had left home to stay with her girlfriend out of her own choice," Police Circle Officer (Swar) Dharam Singh Marchal told PTI."Subsequently, families of both the students were called for a meeting by the police, after which the younger girl decided that she wanted to stay with her friend. Several members of both the families, including the girls were present during the meeting," the officer said.According to officials, the family of the younger student had initially told the police that she is under 18 years of age.However, Marchal said the girl pursuing BA is aged 19 while the one in MA is two or three years elder to her and both belong to financially "not so good" families."Both the girls are adults, aged over 18 years. It is their decision on whom to live with, and we cannot interfere," the Circle Officer said.Same-sex relationships and live-in relationships are considered taboo by many, despite courts of law recognising such couples as legitimate.The Supreme Court had in May 2018 held that an adult couple had the right to live together even without marriage, and had legalised gay sex in a landmark ruling in September the same year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/missing-noida-girl-found-in-live-in-relation-with-ma-student-cops-say-cant-interfere-in-their-decision-299005
18-08-2021||New Delhi||Centre’s Rs 11,000-crore push on palm oil to reduce dependency on imports||To reduce the country’s dependence on imports the Cabinet on Wednesday approved Rs-11040 crore outlay for a centrally sponsored scheme, the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP), with a special focus on the northeast region and the Andaman and Nicobar Island. Due to the heavy dependence on imports for edible oils, it is important to make efforts for increasing their domestic production in which increasing area and productivity of oil palm plays an important part, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said, briefing about the decision taken at the Cabinet meeting headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Tomar said this is in line with the vision to infuse ‘aatmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) in the country. There was a detailed discussion on “doubling farmers’ income” at the meeting, I&B Minister Anurag Thakur added.Under the scheme, the Centre will ensure that farmers are not affected by market fluctuations, said Tomar. A financial outlay of Rs 11,040 crore has been made for the scheme, out of which Rs. 8,844 crore is the Centre’s share and Rs 2,196 crore State’ share and this includes the viability gap funding also, he said.“It is proposed to cover an additional area of 6.5 lakh hectare till 2025-26, thereby reaching the target of 10 lakh hectares ultimately.  The production of Crude Palm Oil (CPO) is expected to go up to 11.20 lakh tonnes by 2025-26 and up to 28 lakh tonnes by 2029-30,” the Agriculture Minister said.“The scheme will immensely benefit the oil palm farmers, increase capital investment, create employment generation, shall reduce the import dependence and increase the income of the farmers,” he added. On why a biodiversity-rich area like the northeast was used to plant “monoculture crop”, Tomar said a study recommended that 28 lakh hectares of land in the country is viable for its production of palm oil out of which 9 lakh hectares is in the northeast.“This land is not being diverted out of some other crop. Even today around 98% of CPO is being imported. We need to go towards high-yielding crops like palm oil and reduce dependency on imports. Scientists are working on increasing productivity of other oilseeds like mustard, sunflower, peanuts.” he said.“For harnessing the potential of palm oil production, in 2020, an assessment made by the Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research (IIOPR) had given an assessment of around 28 lakh ha.  There is huge potential in oil palm plantation and subsequently production of CPO. At present only 3.70 lakh hectares is under Oil Palm cultivation. Oil palm produces 10 to 46 times more oil per hectare compared to other oilseed crops and has a yield of around 4 tonnes oil per hectare  Thus, it has enormous potential for cultivation,” he said.Meanwhile, the scheme covers a price assurance, known as the Viability Price (VP), to farmers for raw material to protect them from the fluctuations of the international CPO prices and volatility. A   substantial increase has been made for planting material for oil palm from Rs 12,000 per ha to Rs 29000 per ha. Special assistance at the rate of Rs 250 per plant will also be given to replant old gardens for the rejuvenation of old gardens.“The government is committed to bringing prosperity in the homes of farmers, increasing their incomes, and ensure that they get attracted to expensive crops. Several departments are working on it,” he said in response to a question on the ongoing agitation against the three farm laws. “The agitation is not the topic for today. However, I must say that farmers have worked hard and done their duty despite Covid 19 and the lockdown and the government has also fulfilled its commitment to them”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centres-rs-11-000-crore-push-on-palm-oil-to-reduce-dependency-on-imports-299002

18-08-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena dubs Maharashtra Guv Koshyari as ‘political agent’ of Union Home Ministry||The Shiv Sena on Wednesday termed Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari as a “political agent” of the Union Home Ministry, in the wake of delay in the nomination of 12 persons, recommended by the state government, as members of the Legislative Council from his quota.An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said the state government recommended the 12 names around eight months back.“A midwife at the Raj Bhavan should clear the doubts about how many more months it would take for the delivery (signing the file concerned),” it said in sarcastic remarks.Everybody was happy when Koshyari had climbed the Sinhagad fort (in Pune) at the age of 80, but he is trying to “bring down the democratic and constitutional fortress”, the edit alleged.NCP chief Sharad Pawar, whose party shares power with the Shiv Sena and Congress in Maharashtra, has already noted that the state chief minister had sent reminders to the governor, but “he (Koshyari) could have forgotten it because of his advancing age,” it quipped.“The governor is the Union Home Ministry’s political agent, is the easiest definition according to us. His mind is not clean as he is not clearing the file of 12 nominees as MLCs from his quota. He is clearly under pressure from the ‘top’ for not signing on the file,” the Sena claimed.The Marathi daily also said it is the “constitutional duty” of the governor to sign on proposals sent by a state cabinet.“It doesn’t suit the dignity of his post if he breaks the constitutional framework...and by postponing the appointment of the 12 nominees, the governor and the BJP have turned themselves into a laughing stock,” it said.The Marathi daily also said when a senior Congress leader prodded Koshyari about the issue of nomination of MLCs at a recent function in Pune, the governor wondered why the leader was so inquisitive when the state government was not insisting about it.“With this, the governor has put himself in an awkward situation. This comment does not suit his position as governor of the state. Does he want (people) to stand outside the Raj Bhavan and clang ‘thalis’ to seek his attention over the file related to the nomination of MLCs?” the Sena sought to know.He (Koshyari) has “lost his social stature because of his own acts”. Even the Bombay High Court and senior leaders like Sharad Pawar are openly pointing fingers at his actions. The people of Maharashtra are not bitter with him, but as a governor, his acts are “against the Constitution,” it claimed.The examples of West Bengal and Maharashtra have shown that the use of Raj Bhavan cannot help in toppling a government, it added.

18-08-2021||Bhopal||MP: Farmers’ leader threatens to move court against IMD’s ‘wrong’ predictions||A farmers’ union leader in Madhya Pradesh’s Malwa region has threatened to move court against what he claimed as the IMD’s “wrong” predictions leading to crop losses for cultivators in recent times.However, a senior scientist of the India Meteorological Department said farmers might have been “misled”, as a private weather service predicted early monsoon this year, in contrast to forecast of the IMD (an agency of the Ministry of Earth Sciences of the Government of India).He also said that cultivators should check whether the information was coming to them from genuine sources.“In most of the cases, the weather predictions released by the IMD have failed. This has led to huge losses for farmers,” Bharatiya Kisan Sangh’s Malwa prant (region) spokesman Bharat Singh Bais claimed while talking to PTI on Wednesday.He said they were planning to move court against the IMD’s “wrong predictions” and a final decision in this regard will be taken soon.Bais, an Ujjain-based farmers’ leader, said at times, farmers prepare themselves for sowing as per the IMD’s weather forecast.“But the failed predictions led to huge losses and sown crops got damaged, as it happened during the recent rains. About 300-400 hectare of land was lying unused (without sowing) in Ujjain district alone due to the IMD’s wrong rain predictions,” he said.In such a situation, farmers cannot trust the IMD’s forecast, he added.Bais said in the US and other countries, weather predictions are precise and people can prepare themselves according to them.“In India, the government is spending huge money, but the weather predictions are coming out to be wrong,” he claimed.Bais said he was collecting the data of losses incurred by farmers due to the “wrong weather predictions” of the state’s MeT department.The data of wrong forecasts in the past two-three years was also being collected, he informed. “After collecting the data, we will take a decision about moving court against the IMD by next month, after holding a meeting,” he said, adding that at present, he and his associates are engaged in organisational elections.Bais also said they had earlier staged a protest against the IMD’s “wrong predictions” and it yielded results.When contacted, a senior scientist of the IMD’s Bhopal centre refuted the allegations and told PTI that farmers might have been “misled” by the weather forecast from more than one source.“The farmers should at least check that all weather-related information is coming to them from genuine sources. A private weather forecast service predicted early monsoon arrival, in contrast to the IMD’s predictions. This might have led to the problem,” he said.In several districts, some self-proclaimed weathermen were making forecasts as if they were IMD’s representatives, which was leading to confusion, he said.“There is no truth in such allegations. This is not the problem of farmers...rather, some ‘netas’ (leaders) had earlier staged a protest to get compensation,” he said.The scientist also said that media should also be cautious while publishing weather-related predictions.

Shinde allowed an interim order preventing Kundra's arrest till August 25, when the next hearing is scheduled.Earlier, Kundra had sought anticipatory bail in the FIR lodged by the Mumbai Police Cyber Crime Cell in connection with the alleged porn racket case, claiming he was falsely implicated.He further contended that there is no evidence to link him against the HotShot App and was being made a 'scapegoat'.However, late on July 19, Kundra was nabbed in a similar complaint registered by the Crime Branch in 2021 for which he was sent to custody.Last week, after a lower court rejected his anticipatory bail plea, he moved the Bombay HC which has granted him interim relief against arrest for a week. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/porn-case-raj-kundra-gets-interim-relief-from-arrest-till-august-25-298961

All care was taken to ensure their fitness, health and wellbeing.The dogs, along with their handlers, Kishan Kumar, Bijender Singh and Atul Kumar, were among the 99-member ITBP contingent that was evacuated by the IAF from Kabul under trying circumstances yesterday.The dogs are presently at the ITBP’S camp at Chawala in New Delhi.“Depending on the force’s requirements and operational commitments, they would now be redeployed for border guarding duties or anti-naxal operations or other routine security duties,” an officer said.Aged 5-7 years, they were trained at ITBP’s National Centre for Training Dogs at Bhanu near Chandigarh.ITBP’s Inspector General (Training), IS Duhan has also felicitated the dogs and their handlers for their dedication and tireless efforts in securing Indian assets overseas.The ITBP was first deployed to secure the premises of the India embassy in Kabul and protect diplomats and staffers in November 2002.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/back-after-a-gruelling-stint-in-kabul-itbp-k-9s-to-redeploy-on-domestic-duties-298959
18-08-2021||New Delhi||Speculations, reports in media on judges' appointment process very unfortunate: CJI||Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Wednesday termed "very unfortunate" certain "speculations and reports" in the media about the Collegium meeting regarding appointment of judges in the Supreme Court.CJI Ramana, while speaking in the ceremonial function to bid farewell to Justice Navin Sinha who is retiring, said the process of appointment of judges is sacrosanct and has dignity attached to it and the media must understand and recognise its sanctity."On this occasion I want to take the liberty to express my concern about certain speculations and reports in the media. You are all aware we need to appoint judges to this court. The process is ongoing. Meetings will be held and decisions will be taken. The process of appointment of judges is sacrosanct and has certain dignity attached to it. My media friends must understand and recognise the sanctity of this process," he said.The CJI said that as an institution, the apex court holds the freedom of media and the rights of individuals in high esteem and today's reflections in some sections of the media, pending the process, even before formalising the resolution is counter-productive."There were instances of deserving career progression of bright talents getting marred because of such irresponsible reporting and speculation. This is very unfortunate and I am extremely upset about it," he said.The CJI also lauded the “tremendous amount of maturity and responsibility” displayed by majority of senior journalists and media houses in showing restraint and not speculating on such a serious matter.        "Such professional journalists and ethical media are the real strength of the Supreme Court in particular and democracy in general. You are part of our system. I expect all the stakeholders to uphold the integrity and dignity of this institution," he said.The head of the judiciary was referring to media reports which said the Collegium, headed by the CJI, is understood to have recommended nine names for appointment as judges in the top court.

18-08-2021||New Delhi||‘May destroy evidence’: Police oppose Natasha Narwal’s plea seeking modification of bail condition||Delhi Police on Wednesday opposed JNU student Natasha Narwal’s plea, seeking modification in the bail condition asking her not to leave the national capital without the court’s permission, stating that she may destroy evidence.Narwal, an accused in three north-east Delhi riots cases, sought modification of a 2020 bail order in which she was directed to not leave Delhi, saying she has to travel outside for research purposes for her Ph.D and to visit her native place but has to seek the court’s permission every time.During the hearing, Additional Public Prosecutor Rajeev Krishan Sharma opposed the plea and told the court that Narwal is a conspirator and may destroy evidence or run away if the condition of not leaving Delhi is changed.“So much evidence may get destroyed. We have great suspicion and apprehension. The investigation is still going on,” the prosecutor, representing the police, told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat.Sharma further said that there are conspiracy charges against her and a conspirator is always the most dangerous person as they can destroy the evidence and save themselves.“Tomorrow if they go abroad or run away, who will catch them?” he asked.The prosecutor added, “When they were conspiring to spread the riots, they were also doing Ph.D. Many people died. The court can understand what they are doing in the name of Ph.D.”            He said that Narwal must move an application and inform the police whenever she is going outside the city.“Because of this condition, they are not able to cause havoc and destroy evidence. Kindly consider the gravity of the case,” he requested the court.Meanwhile, advocates Kunal Negi and Adit S Pujari, representing Narwal, told the court she is an accused in three cases but the court while granting bail in the other two matters, did not impose any such condition on her.“There is no such condition even in the conspiracy case. We will inform the IO prior to travel if the condition is modified,” they emphasized.Narwal, along with several others, has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the case and they are accused of being the “masterminds” of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.

18-08-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court dismisses Maharashtra govt plea against CBI probe into transfer, posting of cops by Anil Deshmukh||The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh seeking to quash the FIR lodged against him by the CBI in the corruption case.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah dismissed the appeal of Deshmukh against the July 22 order of the Bombay High Court saying “no case for interference with the high court verdict is made out”.The bench said that there is “no error in the judgement” of the high court.During the hearing, senior advocate Amit Desai, appearing for Deshmukh said that in the complaint of advocate Jaishri Patil, various allegations were made and the High Court has read into the things, which were never averred.The bench told Desai that he cannot say that investigation is invalid when it has been ordered by a constitutional court.“If the CBI investigates a person on the direction of the court, can the government of India or state government say that you cannot investigate my officer. If this argument is accepted then the entire purpose of directions by the top court gets defeated,” the bench said.                           Justice Chandrachud said that there are certain categories of cases especially if the person is holding a high office, where the apex court in its verdict observed that there should be preliminary enquiry so that he is not targeted unnecessarily or is subjected to frivolous complaints.“Here in this case also the High Court did not straight away order the CBI to lodged a FIR but directed that preliminary enquiry be conducted. This was not case where murder was committed and court directed for probe,” the bench said. Desai contended that pursuant to the direction of the High Court, the matter was transferred to the CBI and when cognisance is taken, it is the duty of the probe agency to apply its mind. The bench said that after hearing the parties, the high court considered ordering preliminary enquiry by CBI which is as per the judgement of this court.“The reason for which the high court directed the court to order a preliminary enquiry was that there were allegations that could have shaken the foundation of police force and citizenry as a whole,” it said. Desai while referring to the verdicts of top court said that section 17A of Prevention of Corruption Act protects the public servant from harassment as it provides for previous approval for prosecution. The bench told Desai, “In our opinion what section 17A does is to protect the right of the offender by adding that requisite permission of the state government is needed before launching prosecution. However, when the enquiry is ordered by the court, there is already a safeguard against harassment”.The top court said that applying section 17 A would actually negate the basis of the order of the high court, which was of the opinion that in the public interest, an investigation is needed. Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, appearing for CBI, said that the high court felt that a cognisable offence is made out and hence ordered for a preliminary enquiry to shield a person from any undue harassment and direction was given to CBI Director to act in accordance with law.He said that the high court had recorded in the order about the disinclination of the state government to investigate the matter.“An inquiry was ordered and it was upheld by the Supreme Court. Registration of Regular Case is a culmination of the preliminary inquiry,” he said. The bench then ordered dismissal of the appeal filed by Deshmukh.On July 22, the high court had refused to quash an FIR registered against Deshmukh by the CBI, saying the central agency’s probe was ongoing and any interference by the court at this stage was uncalled for. It had dismissed Deshmukh’s argument that the contents of the FIR against him did not disclose any actual commission of offence.The FIR was registered against Deshmukh and some unidentified persons on April 24 on charges of corruption and misconduct following a preliminary inquiry that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducted in compliance with a HC order.The inquiry was initiated on the basis of a complaint lodged by lawyer Jaishri Patil in the aftermath of allegations of corruption levelled against Deshmukh by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.Deshmukh had claimed the ongoing CBI inquiry against him was illegal since the central agency had not taken prior sanction from the Maharashtra government to prosecute him.The CBI’s FIR said Deshmukh had knowledge of the reinstatement of former API Waze, an accused in a case of bomb scare near the Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, and the NCP leader used to exercise undue interference in transfers and postings of Maharashtra police officers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-dismisses-maharashtra-govt-plea-against-cbi-probe-into-transfer-posting-of-cops-by-anil-deshmukh-298947

But that can be done only with the permission of the competent authority. There is nothing wrong...

He, however, said the Centre was willing to place the necessary details before the committee of “neutral experts” it proposed to set up to examine the issues.Maintaining that several kinds of software were used by agencies to check anti-national activities, Mehta said no government would make public what software it was using as terror networks could misuse such information to escape tracking.“Let the competent authority take a decision as to what extent and what information is to be disclosed and then the next course of action can be evolved,” the Bench said, fixing the matter for further hearing after 10 days.Security in mindSolicitor General Tushar Mehta says no government will make public what software it uses as terror networks can misuse such information to escape tracking.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-notice-to-centre-on-pleas-for-pegasus-probe-298599

Abdul Ghani Baradar, tipped to be the new Afghanistan President, left Doha for Kabul.The Taliban, having received global condemnation for violence amidst calls to be inclusive, announced “general amnesty” for government officials, asking them to return to work.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan with full dignity and honesty has announced a complete amnesty for all Afghans, especially those who were with the opposition or supported the occupiers for years and recently,” a member of the Taliban’s cultural commission announced. Evacuation flights from Afghanistan resumed after the US-controlled airport was cleared of the crowd and sanitised.Afghan TV channels were also allowed to broadcast programmes featuring female anchors, while some women activists in Kabul were permitted to demonstrate for greater participation in decision making.Indian Embassy officials on Monday night contacted the insurgent group’s leadership with which they had recently become acquainted. As a result, the Indian Air Force’s C-17 Globemaster dispatched to Kabul on Monday finally left for India in the morning.The plane landed at Jamnagar for refuelling as it took a detour to skirt Pakistani airspace and then landed here in the afternoon with Ambassador Rudrendra Tandon and other India-based personnel.“We’ve not abandoned the people of Afghanistan. We’ll continue our interaction… can’t say in what form. Situation is changing,” said Tandon after landing in Jamnagar.The MEA has set up a special cell for maintaining accurate information about all Indians currently in Afghanistan. “Those already in Afghanistan were urged to return immediately, while others were advised not to travel there,” the MEA said.The virtual rolling up of the Indian embassy came a day after the Union Home Ministry introduced a new category of electronic visa to fast-track applications of Afghans wanting to enter India.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who is in New York to participate in UNSC events, tweeted: “Movement of the Indian Ambassador and the Embassy staff from Kabul to India was a difficult and complicated exercise. Thank all those whose cooperation and facilitation made it possible.”Addressing anxieties of those left behind, he said India was working out arrangements for their evacuation in association with partner countries.Emergency e-visa for Afghan nationals India has announced a new category of emergency e-visa for Afghan nationals who want to come to India. The MHA said all Afghan nationals, irrespective of their religion, could apply for the “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” online. The visa would be valid for six months. Jaishankar, Blinken discuss Afghan situation Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, who is in the US, discussed the latest developments in Afghanistan with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. “Underlined the urgency of restoring airport operations in Kabul. Deeply appreciate the American efforts underway in this regard,” he tweeted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-new-contacts-with-taliban-aid-kabul-embassy-evacuation-298589

Lalthlangliana told PTI that the incident occurred at around 2 am at the disputed Aitlang area bordering Assam’s Hailakandi district when three residents of Vairengte town went there to collect meat from a friend, a resident of Bilaipur in Assam, who invited them to come.One person was injured in the firing by Assam Police personnel who were guarding the inter-state border, he said.Reaction from the Assam side is not yet available. Tensions between the two neighbouring northeastern states escalated last month, reaching a flashpoint on July 26 when six policemen from Assam and one civilian died.At the core of this is a border dispute that is over a century old.

18-08-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||India's new contacts with Taliban aid evacuation of Kabul embassy||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 17Amid high drama, the Government on Tuesday airlifted its Ambassador to Kabul and rest of the diplomatic staff to Delhi and plans to shift several hundred loyal Afghans some of whom are understood to have moved to neighbouring countries for the time being.The evacuation of the mission on Monday night just after midnight was enabled due to New Delhi's newly established  back channels with Taliban, said sources.The C-17 Globemaster aircraft of the Indian Air Force carrying around 150 people, including diplomats, officials, security personnel and some stranded Indians, landed at the Hindon airbase near the national capital at around 5 pm after a brief halt at Jamnagar in Gujarat.It is the second evacuation flight as another C-17 aircraft brought back around 40 people from the Hamid Karzai International (HKI) Airport in Kabul on Monday as part of India's emergency evacuation mission that was carried out following coordination with relevant authorities including US officials handling security at the airport in the Afghan capital.Sources said the deteriorating security situation put the Indian envoy and 132 others to great inconvenience in trying to reach Kabul airport. The arrival and departure of a large number of military aircraft from western countries got bunched up as operations were suspended following gunfire near the airport leading to the Indian plane staying in Kabul more than warranted.The virtual rolling up of the Indian embassy came a day after the Union Home Ministry had introduced a new category of electronic visa to fast-track the applications of Afghans wanting to enter India. With the virtual closure of the Indian Embassy in Kabul, India's extensive outreach that once included four consulates has been terminated for now.At the moment, envoys of Turkey, Russia, Iran, Pakistan, Central Asian countries and China remained in Kabul.Addressing the anxieties of those left behind, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who reached New York to participate in the UNSC events, said New Delhi is working out arrangements for their extraction with its partner countries.The US, left flatfooted by the Taliban’s surge, was working the phones. As part of this effort, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to Jaishankar besides the Foreign Ministers of several European countries, Pakistan, Russia and China.The nuances of Blinken’s conversations differed. State Department readouts said he discussed the developing situation with his counterparts from India and Pakistan. With the Chinese and Foreign Ministers, he also dwelt on the efforts to bring American, Chinese and vulnerable Afghans to safety. To EU, NATO, Turkey and the UK, he expressed his appreciation for bringing American citizens to safety and assisting vulnerable Afghans.Also left on the sidelines by the speed of Taliban’s takeover, British PM Boris Johnson called up French President Macron to summon an extraordinary G7 meeting on Afghanistan.Blinken began working the phones shortly after US President Joe Biden addressed criticism over the US getting blindsided in Afghanistan.“I am now the fourth American president to preside over war in Afghanistan. Two Democrats and two Republicans. I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth president…The buck stops with me,’’ said Blinken in a televised address while calling Afghanistan as ``the graveyard of empires’’.“I know my decision will be criticised, but I would rather take all that criticism than pass this decision on to another president of the United States - yet another one - a fifth one.’’“I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you. The truth is: This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated. So what's happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight,’’ he reasoned.“So I'm left again to ask of those who argue that we should stay: How many more generations of America's daughters and sons would you have me send to fight Afghans - Afghanistan's civil war when Afghan troops will not? How many more lives - American lives - is it worth? How many endless rows of headstones at Arlington National Cemetery?’’ he asked, while reiterating, “I wasn't going to ask them to continue to risk their lives in a military action that should have ended long ago. Our leaders did that in Vietnam when I got here as a young man. I will not do it in Afghanistan.’’Biden felt no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable, united, secure Afghanistan, What's happening now, could just as easily have happened five years ago, or 15 years in the future."Biden said the US would lead with diplomacy, international influence and humanitarian aid. “We will continue to speak out for the basic rights of Afghan people, for women and girls – just as we speak out all over the world,” he said.
