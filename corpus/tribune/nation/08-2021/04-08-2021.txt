If the work goes in accordance with the plan, then the ruling BJP will receive a shot in the arm before hitting the campaign trail.The sources added that there will be 160 columns on the temple's ground floor, 132 columns on the first floor and 74 columns on the second floor.The top of the sanctum sanctorum will be 161 feet from the ground floor and will be constructed with Rajasthan stone and marble.The temple design was finalised considering the changes that have taken place in the last three decades and the aspirations of devotees, the sources said.Following a Supreme Court verdict paving the way for the temple's construct at the site, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the formation of the Shri Ram Janm Bhumi Teerth Kshetra Trust on February 5, 2020 in Lok Sabha for the temple's construction and management.Nripendra Misra, former principal secretary to the prime minister, is the chairman of the construction committee. The temple's construction began following a religious ceremony attended by Modi at the site last year.Sources said before starting the construction activities, the main challenge before the Trust was to finalise the temple's design and drawings for longevity on the pattern of most ancient temples. The trust decided that steel will not be used in its construction.In the masterplan, they said, special focus has been given to the conservation and development of the heritage structures like 'Kuber Tila' and 'Sita Koop'.The other structures include pilgrim facilitation centre, museum, archives, research centre, auditorium, 'gau shala', 'yagya shala', administrative building and 'sant niwas' among others. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ram-temple-to-open-for-darshan-to-devotees-by-2023-end-sources-292978

04-08-2021||New Delhi||Code of Conduct on South China Sea should be consistent with UN convention: EAM||India stressed on Wednesday that the Code of Conduct on the South China Sea should be fully consistent with the relevant UN convention and that the negotiations on it should not prejudice the legitimate rights and interests of the nations that are not party to the discussions.In a virtual address at a meeting of the East Asia Summit (EAS), External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also highlighted the growing convergence of approaches on the Indo-Pacific region among different members of the grouping.Separately, Jaishankar also addressed a meeting of the ASEAN-India foreign ministers during which he touched upon a range of issues, including connectivity, and said India is looking forward to an early review of the “trade in goods agreement”.“Stressed that Code of Conduct on the South China Sea should be fully consistent with UNCLOS 1982. Should not prejudice legitimate rights and interests of nations not a party to discussions,” Jaishankar tweeted about his meeting with the foreign ministers of the EAS member countries.China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea, a huge source of hydrocarbons. However, several ASEAN member countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei, have counterclaims.India has been pitching for a rules-based order in the region, including through upholding adherence to international law, especially the UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea).In his address at the EAS meeting, Jaishankar also supported the “ASEAN five-point” consensus on Myanmar and welcomed the appointment of a special envoy.The external affairs minister also spoke about the growing COVID-19 challenge faced by ASEAN and conveyed India’s support and solidarity.Jaishankar described the discussions at the ASEAN meeting as “substantive and fruitful”.In a series of tweets, he said much of India’s interests and relationships now lie to its east, which is a testimony of its ties with the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).The external affairs minister also emphasised on accelerating connectivity projects and particularly talked about the trilateral highway and Kaladan projects.The ambitious India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway is expected to boost connectivity among the three countries.The Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project is being viewed as India’s gateway to Southeast Asia.Jaishankar also sought convergence between the ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific (AOIP) and the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) proposed by India.On the coronavirus pandemic, he said India and ASEAN are “strong partners in Covid response: medicines or oxygen, equipment or logistics”. Jaishankar also proposed 2022 as the ASEAN-India friendship year for the 30th anniversary of the ties between the two sides.The ASEAN is considered to be one of the most influential groupings in the region, and India and several other countries including the US, China, Japan and Australia are its dialogue partners.The ties between India and the ASEAN have been on an upswing in the last few years with the focus being on ramping up cooperation in the areas of trade and investment as well as security and defence.The EAS is the premier forum in the Asia-Pacific region to deal with issues relating to security and defence. Since its inception in 2005, it has played a significant role in the strategic, geopolitical and economic evolution of East Asia.Apart from the 10 ASEAN member states, the EAS includes India, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Russia. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/code-of-conduct-on-south-china-sea-should-be-consistent-with-un-convention-eam-292976

Kalra and his recovery agent Ranjit Kumar... I paid for their entire lodging-boarding, local travel, etc, but they did nothing,” the husband said.It did not end here and they virtually compelled him to take them for a darshan at the Vaishnodevi Temple in J&K before returning to Aurangabad - all at his expense.“We returned after 4 days with no arrests made as promised. On the contrary, the two police constables Laxman Rathod and Ghorpade disappeared for a couple of hours to meet the two accused and thereafter, they tried to dilute our strong case,” he alleged.In the meantime, the IMS agents allegedly created a fake profile on Facebook, posted photos of the couple, painted the woman as of “loose character” and “available for paid sex”.“We informed the police but it took them several weeks before any result. By then, our reputation was ruined in society,” she said.Despite repeated attempts by IANS, Kalra and Kumar were not available on their five mobile numbers provided in the police FIR.The couple is sore that despite so much evidence handed over, the Aurangabad police have invoked mild sections and booked only one person so far.“The IMS owner is the main culprit but the police are going soft on him. Why? Was any arrangement worked out when the two constables met him in New Delhi?” the husband asked.The duo has demanded that the Aurangabad police take up the matter most seriously, slap more serious charges against the IMS CEO and the agent to prevent similar recurrences with other peopleIANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bank-agent-seeks-sex-from-maharashtra-woman-for-unpaid-credit-card-dues-292973

Four people, including the priest, have been arrested.Only the burnt legs of the girl were recovered from the crematorium.Since Monday, the agitated locals had blocked a stretch of road in the area demanding justice for the girl, who was allegedly raped and killed on Sunday.The parents of the girl, along with several others, staged a sit-in near the site of the alleged crime on Tuesday and demanded capital punishment for the culprits.The girl lived with her parents in a rented house in front of the crematorium. Around 5.30 pm on Sunday, she went to get water from a cooler at the crematorium.Around 6 pm, the crematorium’s priest, Radhey Shyam, and two-three others called the girl’s mother to the spot. Showing the girl’s body to her mother, they claimed that she got electrocuted while getting water from the cooler.There were burn marks between her left wrist and elbow, and her lips were also blue.The priest and the others dissuaded her mother from making a PCR call, saying police will make a case out of it, and during post-mortem, doctors will steal the girl’s organs, so it was better to cremate her.The girl was cremated but subsequently, her parents alleged that it was done without their consent. A crowd of around 200 villagers gathered at the crematorium and the police were informed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dalit-girls-death-delhi-police-transfers-case-to-crime-branch-292972
04-08-2021||New Delhi||Pegasus snooping scandal: SC to take up petitions seeking probe on Thursday||The Supreme Court will take up nine petitions seeking a probe into the alleged snooping on politicians, activists, and journalists through the use Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware on Thursday.The petitions filed by Editors Guild of India; noted journalists N Ram and others;  journalists Paranjoy Guha Thakurta; SNM Abdi; Prem Shankar Jha; Rupesh Kumar Singh; and Ipsa Shatakshi; and advocate ML Sharma are listed for hearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana.The Editors Guild of India has sought a special investigation team (SIT) probe into the scandal while Ram demanded a judge-led probe into it.“Freedom of the press relies on non-interference by the government and its agencies in reporting of journalists, including their ability to securely and confidentially speak with sources, investigate abuse of power and corruption, expose governmental incompetence, and speak with those in opposition to the government,” the Editors Guild of India submitted.The citizens of India have a right to know if the government is infringing upon the limits of their authority under the Constitution and what steps have been taken to safeguard their fundamental rights, the Guild contended.On Monday, five journalists had moved the top court seeking direction to the Centre to disclose all material/documents pertaining to the use of spyware on them. Claiming to be directly affected by the use of Pegasus spyware, petitioners Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, SNM Abdi, Prem Shankar Jha, Rupesh Kumar Singh, and Ipsa Shatakshi contended that it violated their fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.The Guild said all attempts to seek accountability and enforce Constitutional limits through Parliamentary processes have been stonewalled.“Through their intransigence, the Respondents have deliberately avoided public debate on this issue and have provided obfuscated answers, forcing the Petitioner to approach this Court,” read the petition which challenged the validity of electronic surveillance, hacking and use of spyware, and the existing legal architecture for surveillance, in light of the gigantic leaps in technology and surveillance capabilities.The Guild said journalists were tasked with enforcing the public's right to be informed, accountability and to an open and transparent government and to be able to fulfil this role, freedom of the press must be safeguarded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-snooping-scandal-sc-to-take-up-petitions-seeking-probe-on-thursday-292971

04-08-2021||New Delhi||‘Forcible’ cremation of Dalit girl in Delhi ‘reminiscent of Hathras’, says CPI(M)’s Brinda Karat||The “forcible” cremation of the nine-year-old Dalit girl who was allegedly raped and killed in Delhi was reminiscent of last year’s Hathras incident, CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday and demanded urgent action in the case.The CPI(M) politburo member, who met the mother of the victim in the morning, said although four people have been arrested in this case, the role of the Sadar Thana Cantonment area police was “shocking, to say the least”.               The girl died under mysterious circumstances when she went to get water from a cooler at a crematorium in the Old Nangal area of southwest Delhi last Sunday. Her parents alleged that she was raped and her body was forcibly cremated by a crematorium priest who had falsely claimed that she was electrocuted.Hundreds of locals, including the victim’s parents, have been staging a protest near the site of the incident, demanding capital punishment for the convicts.Police had on Monday said that based on the statement of the victim’s mother, rape charges have been added in the FIR. Four people, including the priest, have been arrested.In her letter to the Union home minister, Karat said the victim was “forcibly cremated by the criminals when the mother was in a state of trauma and shock”.“The community is also enraged because according to custom, young girls are buried and not cremated. Therefore, the lie being spread that the mother agreed to the cremation is criminal enough and reminiscent of what happened in the Hathras case.”   In the Hathras incident, a 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men on September 14 last year and she died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital.She was cremated in the dead of the night on September 30 near her home in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras. Her family alleged they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out “as per the wishes of the family”.“There (in Hathras) the police themselves cremated the victim. Here (Delhi) the police refused to act in time. Secondly, instead of helping the family members who were in a state of shock, the police detained them at the police station for several hours. This is inhuman and totally illegal.“Third, the family were not given the FIR until there were protests from the community. Also, the police did not use the correct sections including those under the POSCO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and the Prevention of Atrocities (Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes) Act,” Karat said in the letter.She said that it is “regrettable” that Shah had not intervened yet in this case although the Delhi Police is directly under the Union Home Ministry.“My request is that you kindly ensure that justice is done. The parents cannot be ever compensated for the loss of their beloved daughter. But the government is duty-bound to ensure them financial support. I also request you to take immediate action against the police personnel involved. The message of justice for the child must go out loud and strong,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/forcible-cremation-of-dalit-girl-in-delhi-reminiscent-of-hathras-says-cpims-brinda-karat-292964
04-08-2021||New Delhi||Home ministry recommends disciplinary action against former CBI director Alok Verma||The Union home ministry has recommended disciplinary action against former CBI director Alok Verma for allegedly misusing his official position and violating the relevant service rules, officials said on Wednesday.They said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has written to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), the nodal ministry for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), to take necessary disciplinary action against Verma.The action, if approved, may include temporary or permanent forfeiture of Verma’s pension and retirement benefits, the officials said.During his stint in the CBI, Verma, a 1979-batch (retired) Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, was engaged in a bitter fight with Gujarat-cadre IPS officer and his deputy Rakesh Asthana over corruption charges.Both Verma and Asthana had accused each other of corruption.Asthana is the Delhi Police Commissioner now.“Verma has been accused of misusing his official position and violating service rules. Necessary action has been recommended against him by the home ministry,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity.The home ministry is the cadre controlling authority for IPS officers.The DoPT has forwarded the MHA’s recommendation to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the recruitment body for IPS officers, the officials said.The UPSC needs to be consulted before imposing penalty on IPS officers, they said.Verma took over as the CBI chief on February 1, 2017 for a fixed two-year tenure.However, he was removed from the post on January 10, 2019 and posted as the director general of Fire Services, Civil Defence and Home Guards—a less significant portfolio.Verma did not accept the offer and wrote to the government, saying he should be considered as deemed superannuated as he has completed 60 years age of superannuation on July 31, 2017.

As many as 115 officials from 73 countries, including 10 heads of state, 20 speakers of Parliament, 11 foreign ministers as well as 10 other ministers and envoys will attend.Iran is vital to India’s connectivity to the west because of the Chabahar port where New Delhi has invested. The port supplies connectivity to Afghanistan, Central Asia and will probably be a part of the North-South International shipping hall that connects Mumbai with Moscow.Iran is also vital in the settlement of the Afghan issue. Besides hosting an estimated 20 lakh Afghan refugees, Tehran will also be keen to ensure that its Shia compatriots in Afghanistan are not targeted by the extremist elements in the Taliban.This is a cause to which India also subscribes too since it has got ties with the Shia Hazara leaders of Afghanistan especially in Heart.Iran earlier this week issued an advisory, calling on Iranian citizens to immediately leave cities outside the capital of Afghanistan as the security situation is deteriorating following the Taliban’s insurgency.However, Iran is also in the crosshairs of Israel and the UK on suspicions that it was involved in a recent attack on a petroleum products tanker managed by an Israeli-owned company.Realising the importance of Iran in the Afghan equation, Jaishankar recently stopped over in Tehran to call on the new President-elect as well as hold talks with Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-to-attend-iran-president-elect-raisis-swearing-in-ceremony-292960

We are hopeful about opening by August 13."The owner of Basusree single screen, Sourabh Basu said the 1,000 capacity halls will open on August six with two shows."There will not be any evening or night shows. And the 1000 seating capacity will be halved with no two spectators sitting side by side," he added.The West Bengal government allowed the theatres to start screening movies following Covid protocols from July 31, three months after ordering them to shut down in view of the surging Covid-19 cases in the second wave of the pandemic.However, none of the functional single screens, numbering around 40-50, and multiplexes in Kolkata opened on that day, an official of Eastern India Motion Pictures Association said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/multiplex-to-reopen-with-new-hollywood-flick-in-kolkata-292947
04-08-2021||New Delhi||UNSC inches closer to involvement in Afghan peace talks||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will quarterback India’s efforts to bring Afghanistan on the UNSC agenda rather than allowing the situation to drift in the absence of an anchor where nations can reconcile differences and urge the Taliban to enter into meaningful peace talks.Jaishankar is expected to be in New York towards the middle of this month when the expectations are that the UNSC would have moved some way in taking up the issue of Afghanistan by way of a discussion and resolution.India is already backing the efforts of Estonian and Norway, the “penholders” in UNSC on Afghanistan, for moving forward on Afghanistan. Both countries, coincidentally, lost soldiers to Taliban attacks in Afghanistan.Three recent developments indicate that the stage may shift from Doha which sources here do not believe was conducive to negotiations.The Taliban made the mistake of attacking a UN compound in Herat which gave the opportunity for the Indian Permanent Representative TS Tirumurti to marshal support for a condemnatory statement. Seizing the opportunity, the statement went further by expressing deep concern about the Taliban’s military offensive and the number of reported serious human rights abuses and violations in communities affected by the ongoing armed conflict across the country. More importantly, the statement declared that the UNSC members do not support the restoration of the “Islamic Emirate”, thus directly opposing this demand from the more extremist Taliban factions.Second, the Afghan Foreign Minister Hanif Atmar has also been appealing for UNSC discussions on Afghanistan, most recently in a phone call to Jaishankar. For a Government in Kabul that will run its military on western assistance, this is a call none of them can ignore, said sources here.Third, the White House’s unequivocal backing to the Kabul regime with messages of support being delivered frequently indicates its distaste to matters being decided on the battlefield. Tuesday, in yet another phone call, US Secretary of State Antony Binken called up Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to discuss the need to accelerate peace negotiations, as a follow up to his US President where Biden hosted him at the White House.More instructive is the Pakistani reaction to the close US-Afghan parleys, pointed out sources. Islamabad is chafing at the lack of high-level contact between the political leaders with Pakistan NSA Moeed Yusuf complaining that “the US President hasn’t spoken to the PM of such an important country who the US itself says is make-or-break in some cases, in some ways, in Afghanistan — we struggle to understand the signal, right?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unsc-inches-closer-to-involvement-in-afghan-peace-talks-292946

04-08-2021||Ahmedabad||Activists, writers oppose Centre's Sabarmati Ashram makeover plan||A group of activists, writers, Gandhians and former IAS and IPS officers on Wednesday opposed the Union government’s plan to ‘develop’ the historic Gandhi Ashram here, claiming that it will harm its sanctity. It was an attempt to “take over Gandhian institutions”, they said in a statement.Among around 130 signatories to the statement were Gujarati writer Prakash Shah, historians Rajmohan Gandhi and Ramchandra Guha, musician TM Krishna, retired high court judge A P Shah, Admiral (Retd) Laxminarayan Ramdas, former IAS officer Sharad Behar, former IPS officer Julio Ribeiro, senior lawyer Anand Grover and activists Harsh Mander, Shabnam Hashmi, Yogendra Yadav and Teesta Setalvad.The Gandhi Ashram on the banks of the Sabarmati river, also known as Sabarmati Ashram, was where Mahatma Gandhi lived between 1917 and 1930 as he led the Indian freedom struggle. It is now managed by the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust.“We must collectively oppose any government takeover of Gandhian institutions, while ensuring that the government continues to use public money for the proper maintenance and upkeep of such institutions, in consultation with eminent Gandhians, historians and archivists from India and around the world,” the statement said.“The present government is all set to reclaim the visual wholesomeness, tranquillity and uncluttered environment of 1949 and make it a world-class tourist destination spread over 54 acres. It has announced a budget of Rs 1,200 crore for Gandhi Ashram Memorial and Precinct Development Project,” it said, citing media reports.“There will be new museums, an amphitheater, VIP lounge, shops, food court among other things in the newly created ‘world class’ memorial as per the newspaper reports. Reports say that the project will be under the direct supervision of the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister,” it added.The plan “severely compromises and trivialises the sanctity and importance of the present-day Ashram and the simplicity of the Ashram will be completely lost”, the statement said.‘Hriday Kunj’, the hut where Gandhi lived with his wife Kasturba, and other historical buildings inside the Ashram will be “pushed into a corner” after the redevelopment, it claimed.The Ashram attracts visitors from across the world even now and there is no need for a make-over, it said, adding that “the most authentic monument of Gandhi and our freedom struggle will be lost forever to vanity and commercialization” if the project went through.

04-08-2021||New Delhi||BJP declared donations worth more than three times of aggregate sum for 5 other parties: ADR||The BJP has declared donations worth more than three times of the aggregate amount for five other parties, including the Congress, TMC and NCP, according to a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms.The report stated that the BJP also disclosed donations from the Amaravati Municipal Corporation, where both the mayor and the deputy mayor are from the saffron party. The party’s declarations also included land received from at least three donors.“The donations declared by the BJP are more than three times the aggregate declared by the Congress, NCP, CPI, CPM and TMC, for the same period (Rs 785.77 crore against Rs 228.035 crore declared by the remaining parties),” it said.The report, prepared by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), focuses on donations received by the national political parties, above Rs 20,000, during the financial year 2019-20, as submitted by the parties to the Election Commission of India (ECI).According to the report, the BJP declared a donation of Rs 4.80 lakh from the Amravati Municipal Corporation.“No details of address, bank name, PAN, among others, have been provided by the party against this donation. A casual search on the internet shows that the aforesaid donor is a Government of Maharashtra local body (as mentioned on their website). It raises questions on the legality of the contribution made by a municipal corporation which is a governing body (whose mayor and deputy mayor are from BJP) to a political party,” the poll rights group said.“The BJP declared 570 donations of Rs 149.875 crore, AITC collected 52 donations worth Rs 7.1035 crore, Congress collected 25 donations of Rs 2.6875 crore and NCP collected two donations of Rs 3.005 crore having incomplete cheque/DD details where cheque number, bank details on which it was drawn and the date on which the cheque was received/ encashed is not provided. Thus, without the complete cheque/Demand Draft (DD) details, it would be a time-consuming process to link the donors against their donations and hence trace the money trail,” the report said.The report said the BJP declared receiving land from three donors of a total value of Rs 1.516 crore.“The three donations are from Jhanjharpur in Bihar worth Rs 36.80 lakh, Rs 50 lakh and Rs 64.88 lakh. Apart from the names, location of donors, PAN details of one donor, no other details have been provided like donors’ address, bank details, PAN of remaining two donors, address and ‘khasra’ (plot) number of land, type of land agricultural/commercial, among others,” it said.The report added that the CPM and CPI also failed to declare the details of cheque and DD (cheque number, bank on which it was drawn and the date) for a total of 39 donations amounting to Rs 1.0786 crore and 29 donations amounting to Rs 52.17 lakh, respectively.

The words: “The parents’ tears ask for only one thing: their daughter, the country’s daughter, deserves justice. And I stand with them in this fight”, accompanied the photo.A notice signed by NCPCR chairperson Priyank Kanoongo says Rahul Gandhi, a former president of the Congress party, violated Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act, which prohibits disclosure of the identity of children, and Section 23 of the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences Act, which lays down procedure for the media to report sexual offences against children.Gandhi said after he met the girl’s parents: “I told them that Rahul Gandhi is standing with them till they get justice and will not back down even an inch".The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has launched an inquiry into the incident that took place in Old Nangal area in southwest Delhi and summoned the city police after the girl's parents alleged that she was raped and her body was forcibly cremated by a crematorium priest who had falsely claimed that she was electrocuted.Hundreds of locals, including the victim's parents, have been staging a protest near the site of the incident in Old Nangal area, demanding capital punishment for the accused.एक पीड़ित बच्ची के माता पिता की फ़ोटो ट्वीट कर उनकी पहचान उजागर कर #POCSO ऐक्ट का उल्लंघन करने पर @NCPCR_ ने संज्ञान लेते हुए @TwitterIndia को नोटिस जारी कर श्री राहुल गांधी के ट्विटर हैंडल के विरुद्ध कार्यवाही करने एवं पोस्ट हटाने के लिए नोटिस जारी किया है। pic.twitter.com/cVquij6jx3  Police had on Monday said that based on the statement of the victim's mother, rape charges have been added in the FIR.

04-08-2021||New Delhi||Indian scientist develops human model to study brain disorders||An Indian scientist has developed human-based models to study neuron development and neuro-developmental disorders such as autism, which can help design treatment strategies for such brain disorders.Yogita K. Adlakha, a recipient of INSPIRE Faculty fellowship instituted by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), has achieved this feat, the DST said on Wednesday.INSPIRE—that stands for Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research Programme—is a scheme by the DST for attracting talent towards science.Since decades, animal models have been used to understand brain-related disorders, and the drugs which function in animal models have failed in clinical trials, therefore Adlakha filled this gap by generating human-based stem cell model to understand brain development and dysfunction at the National Brain Research Centre, Manesar, Haryana.At present, she works as a scientist at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR Bio-cluster, Faridabad."The dearth of human models has led to a lack of knowledge of the pathophysiology of such disorders, an essential requirement for designing their treatment strategies," the DST said.Yogita filled this gap and developed a human-based model that could help study how brain develops, particularly the neurons, and what goes awry during brain development leading to cognitive decline, impairment in language, and social interaction.Along with her group, she derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from human peripheral blood and differentiated them into neural stem cells (NSCs).Since levels of microRNA-137 are less in neuro-developmental disorders such as ASD and ID, her study demonstrates crucial roles of this miRNA during human NSC fate determination with an elaboration of underlying molecular mechanisms. This study was published in the journal "STEM CELLS" recently."My research using DST INSPIRE fund has definitely contributed to expanding the knowledge of neuron development and neuro-developmental disorders such as autism and the role of small non-coding miRNA in brain-specific stem cells fate," Adlakha added.Along with her research group, she established a protocol from India for the first time by generating and producing iPSCs from human peripheral blood. They have further refined the protocol of differentiation of iPSCs into brain-specific stem cells, that is, NSCs.Her group has contributed immensely towards understanding the role of microRNA in the neural stem cell fate, which revealed how certain small non-coding RNAs called microRNA, which do not form protein but regulate expression of other genes, can enhance differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons.Her research has contributed to expanding the knowledge of neuron development and the role of small non-coding miRNA in brain-specific stem cells fate, thereby changing the face of neuroscience and stem cells. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-scientist-develops-human-model-to-study-brain-disorders-292912

04-08-2021||Kochi||Kerala HC extends interim protection from arrest to 3 former police officers, ex-IB official in ISRO conspiracy case||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday extended by a week the interim protection from arrest given to three former Kerala Police officers and a retired IB official in the ISRO conspiracy case.Justice Ashok Menon extended the relief for a week after the counsel for CBI told the court that an Additional Solicitor General would be appearing in the matter.The court then listed the matter for hearing on August 5.The high court had on separate dates granted interim protection from arrest to former Kerala Police officers—RB Sreekumar, S Vijayan and Thampi S Durga Dutt—and ex-Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer PS Jayaprakash who all have moved pleas for anticipatory bail in the case registered by CBI.Besides these four, 14 others, are named as accused in the case registered by the agency for various offences, including criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, and fabrication of evidence, under the Indian Penal Code, in connection with the arrest and detention of former ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan in the 1994 espionage case.Besides Narayanan, two Maldivian women—Mariyam Rasheeda and Fouziyya Hassan—were also arrested and detained in the 1994 case.The two women were jailed for more than three years before they were released.Advocate Prasad Gandhi, appearing for the two women, contended that the accused should not be granted any relief as the Maldivian nationals were harassed, unfairly arrested, and detained for over three years by the officers who investigated the spy case.The counsel for the accused said the alleged conspiracy happened over 25 years ago, and, therefore, there was no need for the CBI to drag on the anticipatory bail pleas.The court said that the accused were sufficiently protected from arrest by an interim order and therefore, they should not be concerned if the matter takes time as it has huge ramifications.All three have moved applications in the high court opposing the anticipatory bail pleas of the accused.The CBI has opposed all the anticipatory bail pleas and has claimed that the false implication of Narayanan in a “concocted case” led to a delay in development of India’s cryogenic technology.The Supreme Court had on April 15 ordered that the report of a high-level committee on the role of erring police officials in the espionage case relating to Narayanan be given to the CBI and directed the agency to conduct further investigation on the issue.The three-member committee, headed by former apex court judge Justice (retd) DK Jain, was appointed by the top court in 2018 after acquitting Narayanan in the case.The top court had also directed the Kerala government to pay Rs 50 lakh as compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo “immense humiliation”.The espionage case pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India’s space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women.The CBI, in its probe at that time, had held that top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan’s illegal arrest.The case also had political fallout, with a section in Congress targeting the then Chief Minister late K Karunakaran over the issue, that eventually led to his resignation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-hc-extends-interim-protection-from-arrest-to-3-former-police-officers-ex-ib-official-in-isro-conspiracy-case-292908
04-08-2021||New Delhi||Rise in Covid cases, R number in some states worrying, but premature to declare third wave: Scientists||The rise in fresh Covid cases and the effective reproduction number—an indication of how fast an infection spreads—in many states is worrying, but don't panic. Instead, mask up and get vaccinated, say experts, stressing that it is too early to declare the beginning of a new wave.In fact, it could be that the second wave is not over, said several scientists who have been closely monitoring India's Covid graph and have noted the surge in a few pockets.In the northeast, for instance, cases have certainly not gone down to the low levels that are being seen in Delhi and other northern states, observed Gautam Menon, professor, Departments of Physics and Biology at Ashoka University in Haryana."In that sense, we are likely seeing a continuation of the second wave rather than the initiation of a new Covid wave distinct from the previous one," he explained.On Wednesday, India recorded 42,625 fresh Covid cases with a daily positivity rate of 2.31 per cent and a weekly one of 2.36 per cent.India's Covid situation is seemingly under control. However, 13 states/union territories recorded a surge in coronavirus infections last week, with Kerala reporting half of India's daily new cases.Last week, Kerala reported 1.4 lakh new Covid-19 cases, around 20,000 more than the previous week.In the week ended August 1, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Mizoram, J&K, Sikkim, and Karnataka also witnessed a rise in cases.With the government warning that the pandemic is “still raging”, there is also an increase in India's effective reproduction number (R) which represents the number of susceptible people one Covid positive person may infect.A recent analysis by researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, found that the effective R number in India has crossed 1 for the first time since May 7.The government on Tuesday also said the R-value is more than one in eight states and UTs, which is a cause of concern.Researcher Sitabhra Sinha, who has been tracking the value of R since the beginning of the pandemic, is alarmed that this rise is not driven by the increase in cases in any particular region but seems to be resulting from several states having R values greater than 1 roughly around the same time.“Apart from Kerala which has had R above 1 for more than a month and the northeastern states where the second wave has not yet subsided after beginning in July, we saw in the past week R increase above 1 in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, and Haryana, and possibly in Uttarakhand,” Sinha, from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, told PTI.“The cities of Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and Delhi also are showing R above 1. This suggests a rise in the active cases that is coordinated across widely scattered regions, which would be hard to contain,” he added.The need of the hour is to press the accelerator on Covid protocols.“We need to be prepared but not overtly panic. It is time people mask up and get vaccinated,” Delhi-based physician-epidemiologist and health systems expert Chandrakant Lahariya told PTI, adding that the numbers clearly indicated the need to be cautious.He noted that COVID-19 cases are mostly being reported from states that had succeeded or avoided transmission earlier. Some of this, he said, is attributable to the high transmissibility of the Delta variant.“We should not be looking at the proportion contributed by a state of the total new cases reported in India. That is not very helpful as we end up comparing the states with better reporting systems with states with weak disease surveillance systems,” the public health expert said.The wave or cycle is of academic significance only. If cases are rising, it does not matter whether that is a continuation of the second wave or the start of the next wave, he said.“The interventions have to be very similar.” Scientist Gautam Menon agreed that while it is too early to declare the third wave, the surge in cases is certainly worrying.“The next few weeks will be critical to see whether the rise in case numbers, currently confined to the south and northeast of India, will spread across other parts of the country where cases have been declining for the past month,” Menon told PTI.Explaining the rise in cases, Menon said the spike in Kerala can be traced to the relatively low levels of seropositivity there, indicating that much of the state has not undergone a prior infection and should therefore be susceptible.“From the few serosurveys that exist for the northeast, a similar situation should hold there,” he added.The results of the fourth national serosurvey by the ICMR have shown that nearly 79 per cent of samples from Madhya Pradesh had antibodies against coronavirus, while the seroprevalence was the lowest in Kerala at about 44 per cent.Sanjeev Galande, dean of the School of Natural Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, Delhi-NCR, was also of the view that it is early to predict whether this is the beginning of the next wave.“The national weekly average hasn't altered significantly. The small increase is seen in a few states. It is too early to predict whether this is indeed the beginning of the next wave,” Galande told PTI.He noted that although the second wave had not completely subsided, the R-value had decreased below 1 in most of the states, and the total number of new cases had come down to 30,000 by July 19, indicating a steady decline.“Due to regional surges, now the daily new cases in India have crossed the 40,000 mark.” said Galante, adding, however, that this is a marginal increase compared to what happened in the month of May.Menon hoped that what may prevent an India-wide wave is simply the fact that a substantial fraction of people in populous northern states, including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, have already been infected in the first two waves of the disease.“This will very likely slow the progress of the disease and should lead to a wave that is blunted in extent compared to the devastating second wave. The current levels of vaccination, although limited, will also help,” he explained.Galande cautioned that other states have to be vigilant and prepare for a rise in the number of cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rise-in-covid-cases-r-number-in-some-states-worrying-but-premature-to-declare-third-wave-scientists-292907
04-08-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand CM launches India's first earthquake early warning mobile app developed by IIT-Roorkee||Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Wednesday launched the country's first earthquake early warning mobile application 'Uttarakhand Bhookamp Alert' developed by IIT Roorkee.Launching the lifeguarding mobile app at the secretariat here, Dhami said considering Uttarakhand's vulnerability to earthquakes, people should be informed about the availability of a mobile application like this.The application is available in two versions, compatible with both Android and iOS platforms.The project was sponsored by the Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority (USDMA).It is a path-breaking achievement for the institute as it is the country's first application for notifying people about earthquake alerts. It can also help tell the location of people trapped inside a structure following an earthquake.Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) is a real-time earthquake information system that can detect the onset of the earthquake and issue warnings before the significant tremors take hold of an area, according to a press release by IIT Roorkee.The physical basis for an earthquake early warning system is the speed of the seismic waves, which propagate after the release of stress from faults movement. The strong ground shaking is caused by shear waves, which travel at about half the speed of the primary waves and much slower than electromagnetic signals. The EEW system exploits this advantage, it said.The programme was initially launched as a pilot project by the Ministry of Earth Sciences for the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. Given its success and the need of the region, the IIT Roorkee's EEW project proposal was extended further by the Uttarakhand government."I take immense pride in sharing that IIT-R has designed an Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) mobile app, for timely dissemination of information regarding an earthquake occurrence in the neighbourhood and the expected time of arrival and intensity at the location to prevent any loss of life," IIT Roorkee director Ajit K Chaturvedi said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-cm-launches-indias-first-earthquake-early-warning-mobile-app-developed-by-iit-roorkee-292905

More teams of the NDRF are coming...five helicopters of the Air Force, including four in Gwalior and one in Shivpuri, have also been pressed into the rescue operations,” the CM said.But, it is a matter of relief that the water level is coming down in some places, he said.Some villages in Sheopur district were completely submerged, but the people stranded there were safe. The Army was reaching those villages for the rescue operations, he said.The Army also reached Datia, where 1,100 people were rescued from 36 villages, he informed.Some people were airlifted from a place in Datia districts where all the main roads are shut due to inundation, he said.“Two bridges in Datia district collapsed due to flooding. A crack emerged on a bridge over the National Highway no. 3, hence it has been closed as a precaution,” he said.Nearly 3,000 people were shifted to relief camps in Gwalior, where 46 villages were affected. In Shivpuri, 800 people were rescued from 22 villages, the CM said.Chouhan further said there was a danger of flooding in Bhind and Morena districts as the water level of the Chambal river was rising due to heavy showers.The level will further go up in these districts as water was released from a barrage over the Chambal river, he said.People from low-lying villages in these districts were being evacuated, he added.Chouhan also said that the infrastructure was completely damaged at several places in these districts.“The telecommunication infrastructure in Morena and other places was completely destroyed due to the floods. I have spoken to officials of the Union telecom ministry in this regard,” he said.Train services between Shivpuri and Gwalior were halted as the rail infrastructure was badly damaged on the section, he said.Chouhan said he spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday and informed them about the flood situation in the state.Earlier in the day, after holding a meeting with officials in the state capital Bhopal, Chouhan left for Gwalior to undertake an aerial survey of the flood-hit districts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madhya-pradesh-rain-fury-over-1-200-villages-hit-by-floods-nearly-6-000-people-rescued-1-950-still-stranded-292899

04-08-2021||New Delhi||India's first indigenous aircraft carrier begins sea trial||In what is a significant step towards making military equipment within India, the indigenously made sea-going aircraft carrier the INS Vikrant, on Wednesday, set out on its maiden sea trial.The 44,000 tonne ‘indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC)’ is being made at the state-owned Cochin shipyard at Kochi, Kerala.The aviation complex will be tested using the Russian MiG 29K jets that will use its deck to take off and land.The carrier is expected to be completely operational by 2022.This will happen in the backdrop of the India-China race to expand their Naval strength. China has two operational and two under-construction aircraft carriers, and plans half a dozen carriers by 2030.India has one operational, INS Vikramaditya, purchased from Russia and the upcoming INS Vikrant.The plan for the third carrier is so far not okayed.The INS Vikrant is the largest and most complex warship ever to be designed and built-in India.With the building of an Indigenous Aircraft Carrier, India joins a select group of nations having niche capability to indigenously design, build and integrate a state-of-the-art Aircraft Carrier.US, UK, Russia, Italy, France and Japan have such capacities. South Korea is pursuing a carrier programme.Proud & historic day for India as the reincarnated #Vikrant sails for her maiden sea trials today, in the 50th year of her illustrious predecessor’s key role in victory in the #1971warLargest & most complex warship ever to be designed & built in India.Many more will follow... pic.twitter.com/6cYGtAUhBK  The Vikrant was scheduled to join the fleet in December 2018 as per approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security, however, it has faced delays.The keel was laid in 2009, and it was set out at sea in 2013. The integration of the aviation complex on board and its mating with other sensors was the key.The propulsion and the complexity of making such a warship added to the delays, which have led to the cost escalating beyond the originally sanctioned Rs. 19,341 crore, the CAG said in its report in July 2016.The Chinese operate its first-ever carrier, the 65,000-tonne Liaoning, which Beijing bought from Russia, refurbished, and commissioned in 2012.

I belong to both the states. If the matter can be settled in mediation, please do that. We can help with that.

And we're trying to provide for more and provide for the capacity of countries like India to be able to produce the vaccine themselves. And we're helping them do that. That's what we're doing now,” he said in response to a question.“And we're trying to…by the way, it's free. We're not charging anybody anything.

Without commenting on the genuineness or sincerity of the message conveyed through an interview by Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, a source pointed out that the statement comes from a considerably low-ranking member as compared to Taliban delegation members that visited Beijing, Moscow and Tehran.“We do not threaten or oppose economic projects by any country. We are in favour of other countries investing in our country. We had a trip to China a few days ago, one of our main demands was that they should cooperate with Afghanistan in trade and investment,” he said in an interview made available by an Afghan news agency.Mujahid is believed to be one of the multiple individuals using the persona to communicate Taliban’s message to Afghan and other international media.

04-08-2021||Dubai||UAE lifts ban on transit flights, including from India and Pakistan||The United Arab Emirates will on Thursday lift a ban on transit flights, including from India and Pakistan, the National Emergency and Crisis Management Authority (NCEMA) said on Tuesday.India and Pakistan are important markets for Emirates, Etihad Airways and other UAE carriers flydubai and Air Arabia.The Gulf state, a major international travel hub, had banned passengers from many South Asian and African states travelling through its airports this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.NCEMA said on Twitter that passengers travelling from countries where flights had been banned would be able to transit through its airports from August 5 as long as they present a negative PCR coronavirus test taken 72 hours prior to departure.Final destination approval would also have to be provided, the authority said, adding that UAE departure airports would arrange separate lounges for transiting passengers.The transit ban had also included Nepal, Sri Lanka, Uganda and Nigeria.Dubai state carrier Emirates welcomed the government's decision to allow travel to resume from the affected countries.There was no immediate comment from other UAE airlines on the announcement, which also eased an entry ban on residents returning from countries where flights had been suspended.NCEMA said a ban on entry to the UAE for passengers from these countries would also be lifted for those with valid residencies and who are certified by Emirati authorities as fully vaccinated.However, they would need to apply for online entry permits prior to travelling and would need to present a negative PCR test taken 48 hours prior to departure.Those working in the medical, educational or government sectors in the Gulf Arab state as well as those studying or completing medical treatment in the UAE would be exempt from the vaccination requirement as would humanitarian cases.

04-08-2021||---||Will safeguard Indian projects, says Taliban||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 3The Foreign Office is yet to react to the Taliban stating that it was not going to threaten the economic projects in Afghanistan of any country, including India provided it stopped providing firepower support to the Ashraf Ghani-led government in Kabul.This is the first time the Taliban has been reportedly conciliatory towards India, although its delegation has gone around to neighbouring countries such as Iran, Russia, and China, handing out similar proposals.Without commenting on the genuineness or sincerity of the message conveyed through an interview by Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, a source pointed out that the statement comes from a considerably low ranking member as compared to Taliban delegation members that visited Beijing, Moscow and Tehran.``We do not threaten or oppose economic projects by any country. We are in favor of other countries investing in our country. We had a trip to China a few days ago, one of our main demands was that they should cooperate with Afghanistan in trade and investment. Our country needs to rebuild and stand on its own two feet, we will continue to support development projects and infrastructure,’’ he said in an interview made available by an Afghan news agency.Mujahid is believed to be one of the multiple individuals using the persona to communicate the Taliban's message to Afghan and other international media.The Taliban spokesman made all the right noises in the interview by denying that the outfit viewed India through the lens of Pakistan. The Taliban wanted "good relations with India as an important country in the region", he assured.“But before we take a stand on India, India is providing military assistance to our opponents, even reports that it has sent some of its pilots for airstrikes to support the Kabul administration, which is against our people and needs to change,” he cautioned, injecting a note of conditionality.On the climate of fear that has led to the closure of three Indian consulates in Afghanistan, he said as far as the Taliban was concerned, there is no threat to the embassy of any country. His observation came when Iran asked its nationals to pull out of all Afghanistan cities except Kabul because of the threat of the Taliban. Last time when the Taliban took power, 10 Iranian diplomats were murdered in Mazar-i-Sharif.Sources here also pointed out that the Taliban’ reported assurance may not be about Indian economic projects but its reconstruction work. There was no mention of the Hajigak iron ore mine or the road from the Iranian border. Instead, the Taliban spokesperson was largely refuting Afghan government’s allegation that a number of projects, including the India-built Salma Dam had been attacked, they said.The sources also said the statements from the Taliban hardly reflected the desire expressed in statements about negotiations, especially with respect to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. “They are still talking of how nothing can prolong Ghani's life, that his time has run-out,” the sources said.New Delhi feels statements from middle-level Taliban leaders need to be taken with a pinch of salt because of the experience of Iran. A Taliban delegation in Tehran had condemned the destruction of public institutions but violence around the Iranian borders continues unabated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-safeguard-indian-projects-says-taliban-292389
