11-08-2021||Mumbai||Oxygen requirement will be criterion for imposing lockdown: Maharashtra CM||The daily oxygen requirement for Covid-19 patients will be the deciding factor for imposing lockdown in future, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday.If the oxygen requirement reaches 700 metric tons, lockdown will be imposed again, he said in a statement.The daily oxygen production capacity in the state is 1,300 metric tons, he said.“During the second wave, when the number of Covid-19 cases showed a steep spike, the demand for oxygen was also very high. Some 500 metric tons of oxygen had to be procured from other states. If the demand goes up to 700 metric tons daily, which is the quantity needed for nearly 30,000 patients, the state will be once again brought under lockdown,” Thackeray said.The chief minister’s statement came in the wake of the government’s decision to ease restrictions by allowing local train travel in Mumbai for fully vaccinated people, and allowing shops, malls, restaurants, gyms and salons to remain open till 10 pm from August 15.The Delta variant of the Covid-19 is spreading fast in other countries like UK and USA, Thackeray said, adding that easing of restrictions is being done very cautiously.“We have to be vigilant against the third wave and various variants of the virus,” Thackeray said.

11-08-2021||---||We do not want to give special priority to senior lawyers: CJI||New Delhi, August 11The Supreme Court on Wednesday said its new system of mentioning cases for urgent hearing before its registrars, instead of its benches, was aimed to ensure that senior lawyers were not given “special priority” over their young lawyers.Justice NV Ramana, who took over as the 48th CJI on April 24, has discontinued the practice of lawyers directly mentioning cases for urgent listing before the top court’s Benches. Now, lawyers are required to mention their cases before the designated registrars.“We do not want to give any special priority to the senior lawyers and deprive the junior lawyers of their opportunities. So this system was made, where all can make the mention before the Mentioning Registrar”, a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana told advocate Prashant Bhushan after the latter raised the issue.Bhushan, who represented NGO ‘Common Cause’ in a coal scam related PIL, said matters remained “languishing” for months despite being mentioned before registrars for urgent listing before benches.”First you go to the Mentioning Registrar, and if it’s disallowed, your right to mention before the Bench is automatic,” the Bench told Bhushan.Maintaining that rejection was not an issue, Bhushan said even if the mentioning of a case was allowed, the case didn’t get listed before the Bench for hearing.“You can automatically mention it if it’s rejected. Present a specific case I will look into it,” the CJI told Bhushan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-do-not-want-to-give-special-priority-to-senior-lawyers-cji-296263

11-08-2021||New Delhi||Situation fluid, Kabul following policy of defending cities||Despite bleak US assessments about the holding power of Ashraf Ghani government in Afghanistan, some Indians have stayed behind in Mazar-i-Sharif city as former warlords and the Afghan Special Forces provide stiff resistance to the Taliban.A Taliban leader said from Doha that India will have to show “impartiality’’ in order to mend fences with his outfit. Repeating what a Taliban spokesman had earlier observed, he wanted New Delhi to stop supporting Kabul with weapons and equipment.Speaking shortly after the Taliban took into control a Mi-35 helicopter gunship gifted by India to Afghanistan after the capture of Kunduz airport, sources here said the Kabul government is adapting the policy of wearing down the Taliban by withdrawing its forces to defend the cities rather than spreading itself thin in the entire country.The airport in Mazar was reported open and civilian flights were operating normally so far, they said.Sources dismissed an unnamed US intelligence official as saying that Kabul will fall in 90 days as a personal projection. The situation is very fluid and nothing can be predicted, they said.Ghani has now turned to men like Abdul Rashid Dostum and Atta Mohammed Noor who had rolled back the Taliban in 2001 though the difference is that the last time it was with the help of US air cover and other assistance from India, Russia and Iran.The Taliban though captured Faizabad, the capital of Badakhshan, which meant that the whole of north-east has come under Taliban control which should facilitate the influx of more fighters from Pakistan, they said.That the Kabul government is largely on its own was made clear by US President Joe Biden asking Afghan leaders to fight for their homeland with the help of significant American air support, food, equipment and salaries to Afghan forces.The Taliban have so far taken or have claimed to have occupied 11 provincial capitals out of nearly three dozen.Meanwhile, UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said reports of violations that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity were emerging from Afghanistan. These included “deeply disturbing reports” of the summary execution of surrendering government troops.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/situation-fluid-kabul-following-policy-of-defending-cities-296253

It is most respectfully submitted that umpteen efforts were made by the Petitioners to get in touch with the Respondents in order to get an idea about the schedule of the counselling. However, there has been no update about the date of the commencement of the counselling,” the plea said.It said the dentists, who are also registered with state Dental Council, have obtained provisional or permanent registration and have also undergone compulsory rotatory internship of a year in an approved or recognised dental college.“That around 30,000 BDS (dental) graduates appeared for the NEET-MDS conducted for admission to over 6,500 seats in the country and till date there has been no update for admissions in PG courses,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/counselling-for-neet-mds-admissions-will-be-held-from-august-20-to-october-10-sc-told-296246
11-08-2021||New Delhi||Left parties in no mood to associate with the TMC||The Left parties are in no mood to associate electorally with the ruling TMC in West Bengal and its arch-rival which wants to emerge as a face of united Opposition against the BJP at the Centre.The development has once again cast a shadow on the stop-start unity of the Opposition.It is important in states where political jackboots are needed to stomp to defeat the BJP-led NDA nationally, including the 2024 General Election.“Any question of Left parties’ electoral alliance with the TMC is hypothetical,” a Central Left leader said, outrightly dismissing the idea.He added, “Mamata Banerjee-led TMC is responsible for allowing BJP to make headway in West Bengal.”Leaders of the Left parties are of the firm view, however, welcome the coming together of 14 political parties, including the TMC and Left parties, to take on the BJP at national level, including in Parliament.“But this does not mean that there is electoral alliance,” CPI(M) chief Sitaram Yechury said on Monday in the context of TMC.“In the last assembly election in West Bengal, the Left parties had wanted to defeat both the BJP and the TMC. The TMC was the beneficiary of the Left campaign against the BJP because the people considered it to be in a position to defeat the communal party,” he added.Yechury’s point was that TMC won in West Bengal by default, and not on a positive mandate of the people. Hence, the TMC would be well advised not to take its popularity for granted.In a meeting here, the CPI(M) central committee (CC) introspected the loss in West Bengal and devised measures to strengthen the party.CPI(M) would, however, strive for Left unity and coming together of like-minded, secular democratic forces against the BJP.Left leaders have taken note of Mamata Banerjee’s visit here during the Monsoon Session of Parliament in the name of uniting the Opposition parties and her meeting also with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.TMC has been trying to project Mamta Banerjee as an alternative to Modi. The feeling among a section of Left leaders is that this is a mere ploy of the TMC to protect its base and retain its seats in the next parliamentary elections in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-parties-in-no-mood-to-associate-with-the-tmc-296243

11-08-2021||Palanpur||Gujarat: BJP MP's purported sleaze video goes viral; cops detain 2 for questioning||Police in Gujarat have registered an FIR against two persons and detained them after a video purportedly showing BJP MP Parbatbhai Patel in a compromising position with a woman went viral on social media even as the parliamentarian claimed the clip was doctored, said an official on Wednesday.The FIR was lodged on Tuesday at the Tharad police station of Banaskantha district on a complaint given by the MP's son, Shailesh Patel, said Deputy Superintendent of Police P H Chaudhary, adding the Local Crime Branch (LCB) is probing the case.Parbatbhai Patel (72), the Lok Sabha MP from Banaskantha, denied any wrongdoing and claimed the video has been doctored, and his face superimposed on the person seen in the clip, while his family alleged a conspiracy to extort money and defame them."In his complaint, Shailesh Patel has alleged that his father's edited video was made viral on social media by the two accused - Magha Patel and Mukesh Rajput (both detained) as part of a pre-planned conspiracy."We have lodged an FIR under sections 389 (extortion), 500 (defamation), criminal conspiracy (120-B) of the IPC and under relevant sections of the IT Act," he said.Evidence collected so far suggests there was a conspiracy to malign the MP's image and extort money from him through the video, said the DySP.In the one-minute video, a man resembling Parbatbhai Patel can be seen hugging a woman on a sofa and getting intimate. It appears they were aware about the presence of some other persons in the room, including the one who was shooting the video.According to Chaudhary, Magha Patel had earlier threatened on his Facebook page that he will "publish a video of Banaskantha's top politician on August 15".Then on Tuesday, the same video, purportedly featuring Parbatbhai Patel, was shared in a WhatsApp group by Mukesh Rajput, he said."Both (Magha Patel and Rajput) were shown as accused in the FIR. They were detained for questioning by the LCB. Evidence given by the complainant and collected from the social media by police primarily establish that there was a conspiracy to malign the MP's image and extort money from him through this video," said the DySP.He added that the video will be sent for forensic analysis to find out its authenticity.Shailesh Patel told reporters that the video has been used for defaming his father and to extort money."Magha Patel has been threatening to release the video for some time. This is an edited video created only to defame my father. This is a conspiracy and the accused had earlier demanded money in exchange for not releasing the video," said Shailesh Patel.Parbatbhai Patel, who had previously served as a minister in the BJP government in Gujarat, claimed the video has been edited by superimposing his face on the person seen in the clip."Everyone knows about my character. I never indulged in any wrongdoings in my entire life. It is possible that my photo was used for making such an edited video."People have been trying to extort money from me since 2016 for this video. I had challenged them to release it if they want to," said the Lok Sabha MP. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-bjp-mps-purported-sleaze-video-goes-viral-cops-detain-2-for-questioning-296237
11-08-2021||New Delhi||Why ‘quiet’ on caste census, Congress asks govt in Rajya Sabha||The Congress Wednesday asked the government why was it “quiet” and “running away” from a caste-based census, which was mooted by a woman MP of the ruling BJP in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday and even by the chief ministers of Bihar and Odisha.A caste-based census is required to assess the exact ground situation because in at least 30 states and Union territories, the reservation for backward classes has crossed the upper limit, the Opposition party said.Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi raised the issue in the Rajya Sabha while initiating a debate on the Constitution (127th Amendment) Bill, 2021, that seeks to restore the power of states to identify and specify the Socially and Economically Backward Classes (SEBCs), which was lost after the Supreme Court’s judgement in the Maratha quota case.Asserting that there is a demand for a caste-based census from all quarters, Singhvi said the exercise is needed because the quota for backward classes has exceeded the determined limits in many state.In 30 states and Union territories, it is more than 50 per cent, he said, while referring to Nagaland and Chhattisgarh in particular.Similarly, while there is a 17-per cent quota for the backward classes in jobs, in reality, their percentage is higher, the Congress leader said.“This brings us to an important issue—a caste census. Why are you running away from a caste census? Your chief minister in Bihar, another chief minister in Odisha and your woman MP said you are going to do this. Why is the government keeping quiet today?” he asked.Singhvi also asked why the government is not saying if it would bring a caste census or not.  “The reason why the government is quiet is that the reservation might increase from 22 per cent to 35 per cent,” he said.He also said the Congress-led UPA government had brought a caste census in 2011 but it had gaps. “There were gaps, I accept that. But we tried,” he said.Speaking about the Constitution (127th Amendment) Bill, 2021, the Congress leader said it is important because 671 castes would have lost reservation if the amendments were not made.He said the government had several opportunities to rectify the law brought in 2018, adding, “Due to arrogance and adamancy, you did not do it.”      Singhvi said even a Parliamentary Select Committee had suggested the amendments to the government to bring more clarity but it was ignored and thereafter, the apex court interpreted it wrongly.“You committed a mistake, even the apex court committed a big mistake. The court ignored the intent of Parliament,” he said.The Congress leader said the government should incorporate one more line in the amendment bill that it will be effective from 2018.Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda supported the bill but sought clarity on the implementation of cap in the reservation. TMC leader Derek O’Brien supported the Bill and appealed that the Prime Minister should be present in the House during the discussion on the Bill.He demanded that the House should also discuss the Pegasus snooping row.The TMC leader also questioned the track record of the government on passing legislations.He alleged “incompetence” on the part of the government for poor legislation.O’Brien said several changes have been made in GST law and alleged that the government did not listen to the opposition on farm laws.“Don’t be in haste. Take our suggestions. Else what happened in West Bengal (assembly election), will happen in the country,” he said.The TMC leader said that his party has studied 98 bills passed by this government and 29 were anti-federal. He also mentioned that the Centre has not given states Rs 6.9 lakh crore.O’Brien also demanded a caste based census.  “Why no caste based census. It’s an obvious question,” he said.Tiruchi Shiva of DMK said the government has brought this amendment bill only out of compulsion.“In all these years of this government rule, this is the first ever time they have mentioned with a view to maintain the federal structure of this country,” he said.“You do everything out of compulsion, not with an intention of upholding the rights of the states or union territories because federalism is not a suitable word to you. You always  concentrate on one language, one nation, one religion, everything one, one, one...,” Shiva said. The DMK leader urged the government to “kindly look into the lifting of the 50 per cent cap on providing reservation. That is very very important.”If the states have to provide duly share of the respective OBC communities in the state, the caste wise census has to be conducted, he said, and asked the government to consider this.“Census should be immediately conducted. You have to concentrate on lifting the  50 per cent cap. But for the reservation, the socially and educationally suppressed classes would not have come up,” he added.Banda Prakash of TRS supported the bill but demanded that the 50 per cent cap on reservation should be lifted and the government should conduct a caste based census for OBC. He also sought “political reservation” in legislature and Parliament.A Navaneethakrishnan of AIADMK also supported the bill that seeks to strengthen federal structure of the country.P V Abdul Wahab (IUML), K Raveendra Kumar  (TDP), Balwinder Singh Bhunder (SAD), Ramji (BSP), Jaiprakash Nishad (BJP), Ramdas Athawale (RPI) and Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati (BJP) also participated in the discussion.

11-08-2021||New Delhi||Amid decline in Covid cases, patients return to hospitals with requests for elective surgeries||As coronavirus cases decline in the national capital, hospitals in Delhi-NCR are seeing patients returning to them for elective surgeries, with some of them saying the current situation is almost similar to the pre-Covid time.However, the medical facilities said patients put forth special demands like less hospital visits and single room stay as they are still fearful of contracting Covid.Dr Gurinder Bedi, director and HOD, orthopedic and joint replacement, Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj, said the hospital OPDs are back to normal and in some cases, even better placed than how they were in the pre-Covid era.The senior doctor said the hospital has seen an increase in joint replacement surgeries, spine surgeries for chronic low backache."There is a colossal change in the last six to eight weeks. There is also a fear of the third wave and people are more pragmatic thinking that there is a window and they should get issues sorted out," he said.Dr Sumeet Shah, director - Minimal Access and Bariatric Surgery - PSRI Hospital, concurred with Bedi and said that there was definitely a dip in the number of elective surgeries during the second wave of Covid but since the number of coronavirus cases have come down significantly the elective surgery numbers are now almost close to the pre-Covid levels."There are multiple reasons for it, people sense that there is a gap in the Covid cases and this provides them the right opportunity to get operated on," he said.Since many patients had already delayed their surgeries, they had reached the point where the surgery could not be delayed further, he said."Like we have seen cases of patients suffering from piles where patients reached to us when their condition became severe with their haemoglobin was as low as five. Consequently, we had to admit them just to restore their hemoglobin level and post that we operated on them,” Dr Shah said."There can be a significant risk in such cases. Similarly, we have patients with gallbladder stone, hernia who delayed their surgeries and reached the stage where it became an emergency kind of situation," he added.Dr Kousar A Shah, COO, Aakash Healthcare in Dwarka, said since mid-May, the hospital has seen a 50 to 70 per cent increase in elective surgeries."The increase has been across all the departments, but some departments like orthopaedics have seen more elective surgeries. Although the number of elective surgeries never went to zero, we are seeing more than 50 per cent to 70 per cent rise now," he added.Dr Nitin Arora, senior consultant, general surgery, Paras Healthcare in Gurgaon, said there has been a 200 per cent increase in elective surgeries."There is an interesting shift in the demands of patients. Earlier, they would say that we should not discharge them early or before they have fully recovered but now they want a minimum stay in hospital and ask whether the surgery can be done early in the day and they can be discharged before night. We are allowing patients to stay at the hospital for less time," he said.Bedi said patients usually want the number of hospital visits to be kept low."A large number of patients are opting for single rooms despite the cost being higher. They also inquire whether the physiotherapy after the surgery can be done at home or the dressing change can happen at their home," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-decline-in-covid-cases-patients-return-to-hospitals-with-requests-for-elective-surgeries-296234

Hence, corrosion of plastic pipes might have taken place between the water treatment plants and outlets, adding microplastics to the treated water,” the scientist said, adding that hazard levels of microplastics has not been established as yet. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nio-study-reveals-presence-of-microplastics-in-tap-water-supplied-to-households-in-goa-296232

11-08-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan writes to UK on moving India from red to amber Covid travel list||Pakistan’s top health official has written to the UK’s health secretary highlighting the “discrepancies” in the British government’s policy to retain Pakistan on the Covid-19 travel red list while moving India to the amber list.Pakistan was placed on the red list in early April and India on April 19 but unlike Islamabad, New Delhi was moved to the amber list on August 5 along with some other countries, prompting an uproar against the government’s decision.“The UAE, Qatar, India and Bahrain will be moved from the red list to the amber list. All changes come into effect Sunday, August 8, at 4 am,” UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted.In the letter to UK’s Pakistani-origin Health Secretary Sajid Javid, Pakistan’s Special Assistant on Health Faisal Sultan juxtaposed the country’s pandemic statistics with those of other countries in the region. The letter has been shared by Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari on Twitter.Sultan said a three three-pronged approach should be used to stop the infected people from traveling. It includes a “valid proof of having received a WHO (World Health Organisation) approved Covid-19 vaccine, a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test (72 hours prior to departure) and a rapid antigen test at the airport, pre-departure.”              Comparing Covid-19 statistics of Pakistan with those of India, Iran and Iraq, Sultan said Pakistan’s daily cases per million people, daily deaths per million people and total deaths per million people were the lowest in the region, while daily vaccinations per 100 people were the highest.He also said the tests being done in Pakistan constituted a large enough sample size to be an accurate barometer of the epidemic.Sultan said in the letter that while surveillance data, on which the UK says its decision is based, was “undeniably important”, the country’s overall track record of managing the pandemic held more significance.He, however, admitted that Pakistan lagged behind the UK in the area of genome sequencing, but added that using genomic sequencing as a performance measure and citing it as a reason to deny travel was unnecessary.It “appears to introduce an unnecessarily larger metric, whereas disease security can be reliably achieved via somewhat more targeted measures,” he said.Pakistan was bothered by the UK government’s decision as a large community living in the UK has roots in Pakistan, and they frequently travel to meet their relatives in Islamabad.The UK’s red list allows entry only to British residents and some student visa holders, subject to a compulsory quarantine at a government-mandated hotel for 10 days at the passenger’s own cost of 1,750 pounds each.A downgrade to amber means passengers are exempt for such a government-run quarantine but must fill in the compulsory passenger locator form to provide an address where they would be undergoing the 10-day self-isolation.Pakistan registered over 4,800 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, taking the total number of active cases in the country to 84,177. The coronavirus death toll crossed the 24,000-mark in Pakistan after the country reported 86 fresh deaths, the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) said on Wednesday.

11-08-2021||Agartala/Kolkata||TMC’s Abhishek Banerjee, others booked in Tripura for obstructing cops from discharging duty||A case has been registered in Tripura against TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, MP Dola Sen, West Bengal education minister Bratya Basu and other senior leaders of the party for allegedly obstructing police officers from performing their duties.Kiran Kumar, the Superintendent of Police (SP) in Khowai district, said a suo moto complaint was filed on Tuesday against the TMC leaders, who had “misbehaved” with officers on duty on August 8.“We booked them on August 10 under Section 186 (obstruction of public servants in the discharge of his public function) and 36 (common intention) of the IPC. The FIR pertains to their entry into the Khowai police station... They will be summoned,” the SP stated.Claiming that the ruling BJP in Tripura was “scared” of his camp’s growing popularity, TMC’s Bengal general secretary Kunal Ghosh, who figures in the list of leaders booked by the police, told reporters in Kolkata, “A case has been wrongfully registered against us. We went there to stand by our party workers. “ “We have the right to arrange for legal defence for our party activists, which was denied to them by the Biplab Deb regime in Tripura. Seeking democratic rights peacefully cannot be equated with obstructing government servants,” Ghosh added.At least 14 leaders and workers of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) were arrested in Khowai district on Sunday, including those injured in an alleged attack by BJP men the day before, for “flouting Covid norms”.Shortly after, Banerjee, who is also West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and the de facto number 2 in the party, flew to Agartala from Bengal to meet the apprehended workers in Khowai police station, along with other leaders.Those arrested were later produced before a local court, which granted them bail.According to the police, the 14 TMC members were nabbed for venturing out after the imposition of night curfew at 7 pm, in violation of the COVID-19 restrictions.In a video that went viral on social media, the TMC national general secretary was seen raising his finger to enquire why his supporters were arrested “after having faced assaults”.He returned to Kolkata the same day after his party workers were released on bail.The Diamond Harbour MP, taking to Twitter, said he was bringing with him to Kolkata the injured party workers, who were “denied medical attention” in Tripura.“Bail granted to all @AITCofficial workers who were arrested in Tripura. Satyameva Jayate! I’ll be taking them to Kolkata as they have sustained severe injuries & were denied medical attention. @BjpBiplab you can keep trying but all your resources will fall short! MARK MY WORDS,” Banerjee tweeted just before flying out of Agartala.TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, who paid a visit to the injured workers in Kolkata’s SSKM hospital, further claimed that the arrested activists were not given basic aid and water for several hours.Earlier this month, the Diamond Harbour MP’s convoy had come under attack during his visit to Tripureshwari temple in Gomati district of the northeastern state.Subal Bhowmik, a leader of the party from Tripura whose name also figures in the FIR, claimed that activists were being harassed and falsely accused of crimes they did not commit.“We didn’t obstruct any police officer from performing their job. It was only after 48 hours they decided to book us under section 186. These allegations are devoid of truth and the police administration is being misused for political gains,” Bhowmik added.Upbeat over its astounding performance in West Bengal assembly polls, the TMC recently announced that it would expand its footprint and enter national politics ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.The party had been trying to gain its foothold in BJP-ruled Tripura, where state elections are scheduled to be held in the first half of 2023.Meanwhile, BJP MLA and leader of opposition in Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari dismissed the TMC supremo’s allegations that they were denied basic medical aid and water, stating that the charges were “baseless” and she should be getting the “highest award for falsehood”.“Hereby refuting baseless allegation of the TMC Supremo that her assets weren’t even provided a glass of water in Tripura. Would request her to accord herself the prestigious Mithya-Shree Award (award for lies). Please accept this request & kindly make us feel obliged,” Adhikari tweeted.

In the event of failure to submit the same, then in the first instance, the crewmember shall be off-rostered from flying duties for a period of one month. In case of subsequent or repeat violations, such crew member’s license or authorisation shall be suspended for a period of three months each time,” draft amendments to rules issued by DGCA this week state. Comments on amendments have been sought from stakeholders by August 25.The Indian Commercial Pilots Association and Air Traffic Controllers Guild had moved the High Court citing safety concerns over the number and manner of conducting of breath analyser tests during the pandemic times.In addition, DGCA has also directed that if a crew member is detected positive for alcohol consumption, the medical officer on duty shall provide the prescribed performa for the crew to submit a declaration whether the second test is to be dome on the same equipment or on an alternate equipment. Under rules, if the breath analyzer examination result is positive, a repeat test is to be carried out within 20 minutes. Alcohol causes hypoxia and reduces an individual’s tolerance with increase in altitude and disturbs the sensor-motor, visual and cortical reaction, resulting in significant deterioration of psychomotor performance and decreases the amount of mental capacity available to deal with many essential tasks involved in the conduct of safe flight.Should an emergency occur in-flight, the crew member under the influence of alcohol may not be capable of dealing with the problem. The level of blood alcohol compatible with safe flying is ‘Zero’, which is also recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tweaking-rules-on-alcohol-consumption-dgca-asks-all-aircrew-to-give-declarations-before-flight-296216

11-08-2021||New Delhi||Centre's push for multi-pronged strategy||The Centre has devised a multi-pronged mechanism for timely payment of wages to workers harnessed under its flagship Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme (MGNREGS).The strategy to prevent delay in payment of the wages to workers includes the timely release of funds by the Rural Development Ministry and payment through the National Electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS) for direct payment into workers' accounts.Also, update guidelines for monitoring of timely payment and enabling appropriate provisions in the Ministry's NREGA portal to monitor timely disbursement of wages.The reason to buff up the measures for timely payment of the wages stems from the government's realisation of the utilitarian role played by the scheme in providing jobs during the Covid pandemic-generated national lockdown, especially to migrants who resorted to reverse migration in droves to their native places.The scheme emerged as a pivotal source for jobs locally amidst the ruins of job losses and loss of livelihood during the lockdown.The employment under the scheme also helped keep up the pace of farming.The economy of the agriculture sector in the country did not slack in spite of the wreck of other sectors during the turbulent periods of the lockdown.Data from the Union Ministry of Labour & Employment says that more than a whopping 1.14 crore inter-State workers returned home during the nationwide lockdown amidst the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.The unofficial figure would be more in the backdrop of umpteen jobs in the unorganised sector in the cities remaining below the official radar.MGNREGS is a demand-driven wage employment programme that provides for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.The financial allocation for the MGNREGS is Rs.73,000 crore at the Budget Estimate stage in the current financial year which is 18.69 % more than the Budget Estimate of the previous financial year ( 2020-21).The Rural Development Ministry has released Rs. 46,705.24 crore so fare during the current financial year to States/UTs for the implementation of the scheme.The Ministry seeks additional funds for the scheme as and when required for meeting the demand for work on the ground.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centres-push-for-multi-pronged-strategy-296201

11-08-2021||New Delhi||Delta variant drives fake Covid vax certificates on Telegram||With the infectious Delta variant of Covid-19 rapidly spreading there has been a mounting pressure to be vaccinated, leading to exponential growth in fake coronavirus vaccine certificates, primarily on Telegram, according to Israel-based cybersecurity firm Check Point.The Check Point Research (CPR) has seen a whopping 257 per cent jump in the number of sellers using Telegram, since March, to advertise fake vaccination cards to those "who do not want to take the vaccine".The advertisements promise the European Union (EU) Digital Covid certificate, and Covid vaccination cards from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the UK National Health Service (NHS), alongside fake PCR Covid-19 tests to anyone willing to pay for as low as $100, down from $200 in March.The number of group on Telegram that advertise fake vaccination cards have increase by 257 per cent, and CPR estimates that over 2,500 groups are currently active.Further, the number of followers on the group has also increased by 566 per cent. Groups now have 100,000 followers each on average, with some exceeding over 450,000 followers, CPR team found.In March, the majority of the fake coronavirus certificates were advertised on the dark net. The shift to Telegram has helped sellers scale their distribution efforts, reaching more consumers, faster, they said."We believe the broader market surge is fueled by the rapidly spreading Delta variant and the stemming urgency for everyone to become vaccinated. In effect, there are people who don't want to take the vaccine, but still want the freedoms that come with proving vaccination. These people are increasingly turning to the darknet and Telegram in scores," said Oded Vanunu, Head of Products Vulnerabilities Research at Check Point, in a statement."Since March, prices for fake vaccination cards have dropped by half and online groups for these fraudulent coronavirus services boast followings of hundreds of thousands of people,"Vanunu added.While vaccination certificates for almost every country are available for purchase, the majority are being sold from European countries.The sellers mostly accept payments through PayPal and cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Monero, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and others). In some cases, Steam, Amazon and ebay gift-cards are also accepted. They list their method of contact as Telegram, WhatsApp, email, Wickr and Jabber, CPR team said.The team advises people not to engage with sellers publishing on such groups or marketplaces published in the Darknet.Countries must internally manage a central repository of tests and vaccinated people, which can and should securely be shared between relevant authorised only bodies within the country; erncrypt all 'green passes' and vaccination certificates, they suggested. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delta-variant-drives-fake-covid-vax-certificates-on-telegram-296177

You will have to surrender," Justice Shircy V said.The accused had contended that the rape complaint was filed five years after the alleged incident occurred in July 2016 and claimed it was a blowback of differences between two factions of the Emperor Emmanuel Church.The prosecution on August 2 had vehemently opposed the plea of the accused on the grounds that his custodial interrogation was required and his phone was also to be recovered.The accused, CC Jhonson, had claimed that he and the victim were part of this church and the rape complaint was filed after he left the church.Johny had held a press conference in June, levelling serious allegations against Kerala Police and a former official of the state women's commission in connection with the investigation into the case of rape of her friend in 2016.Johny had alleged that her friend was raped by Johnson, who took nude photos of her and used them to blackmail the victim. She had also alleged that her friend was being threatened.She had alleged that police, after initially promising action, became inactive due to intervention of highly influential persons in favour of the accused.The police had earlier told the court that the probe was only recently handed over to the Crime Branch on July 5 on the orders of the State Police chief.

Bulk sales evaporated and shrinking income forced families to cut down their kitchen budget by avoiding to buy fine variety of basmati.” Long grain aromatic basmati did not remain first choice of masses, said Arvinder, who has been associated with the business, for the past 34 years.He said the crisis taught us to consolidate small consumer packaging. “Housewives rarely compromise on cost when it comes to healthy and nutritious food for their family members. Thus, its wise to focus on packaging in small quantity.”His grandfather Amar Singh had registered the firm ‘Amar Singh Chawal Wala’ in 1901. “The British used to levy 60 per cent tax and the entire business scenario used to be different altogether,” he said. Later, a young nation offered plethora of opportunities and Arvinder’s father Kartar Singh and uncle Pritam Singh steered the company ahead as per changing circumstances. They had set up a rice mill and floated ‘Lal Qila’ brand in 1963.“I joined the family business in 1986. The same year the company started rice export. Now, we are exporting to 77 countries,” he said.Around 85 per cent to 90 per cent of the basmati procurement is being done from Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur, besides the remaining 10 per cent to 15 per cent was carried out from Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. The company gives employment to 700 persons. The firm has two hi-tech rice mills with a capacity of 535 metric tonne per day, which produce white rice, steamed rice and parboiled rice with state-the-of-art machinery to ensure consistency in every grain. To protect environment, their rice mills use rice husk for producing electricity, which partially fulfil their energy requirement. The company has installed solar plants as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-considerably-brought-down-bulk-sale-of-basmati-rice-arvinder-pal-singh-295824

It said the judges handling such cases shouldn’t be transferred till further orders. The order came from a Bench headed by Justice RF Nariman on petitions seeking contempt action against the parties for not adhering to the top court’s February 13, 2020 directions to make public criminal antecedents of candidates within 48 hours of their selection or not less than two weeks before filing of nominations. “The nation continues to wait, and is losing patience. Cleansing the polluted stream of politics is obviously not one of the immediate pressing concerns of the legislative branch of the government,” said the Bench, which also included Justice BR Gavai.While the BJP, Congress, RJD, JD(U), CPI and the Lok Janshakti Party have to pay Rs 1 lakh each for partial non-compliance, the CPI(M) and NCP have been ordered to pay Rs 5 lakh each for total non-compliance.Holding the eight political parties guilty of contempt of court, the Bench ordered them to deposit the fine in the account created by the Election Commission in eight weeks.“No one can deny that the menace of criminalisation in the Indian political system is growing day by day…This court, time and again, has appealed to the law-makers to take steps for bringing out amendments so that the involvement of persons with criminal antecedents in polity is prohibited. All these appeals have fallen on the deaf ears. The political parties refuse to wake up from deep slumber,” the top court said.The Election Commission had told the court that 469 candidates having criminal antecedents were fielded by 10 political parties in the recently held Bihar Assembly polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-disclosure-on-tainted-picks-sc-fines-bjp-seven-other-parties-295787

I will do it a 100 times again if the govt does not give us an opportunity to discuss the black farm laws and farmers’ stir. I will be happy if the govt punishes me for highlighting the farmers’ cause. — Partap Singh Bajwa, Congress Rajya Sabha MPThe opposition MPs raised slogans and said the relevant notices have not been taken care of. Due to the pandemonium, the House was adjourned till 2.32 pm, then till 3.03 pm. and again till 4 pm and finally for the day.Even as officials in the Rajya Sabha secretariat remained tightlipped over any action to be taken against the MPs for their unprecedented act, indications emerged from the government side that they would press for it claiming that the opposition members broke all barriers of unparliamentary behaviour.AAP MP Sanjay Singh was the first to climb the table when BJD’s Prasanna Acharya was speaking and waved a black cloth at the Chair.After marshals brought Singh down from the table, Congress’ Pratap Bajwa climbed the table and then threw a file at the Chair, but nobody was sitting there. Congress’ Ripun Bora was also seen standing on the table for some time. When the House re-assembled, Sanjay Singh was joined by CPI’s Binoy Viswam, CPM’s V Sivadasan, Congress’ Deepender Hooda, Ripun Bora and Rajamani Patel.The Opposition protested as soon as Bhubaneswar Kalita, who was presiding over the proceedings of the House, called for a short duration discussion on “agricultural problems and solutions”.Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said, “My notice was for calling attention motion on the farmers’ protest, but it was turned into a short duration discussion without taking a sense of the House.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ruckus-in-house-over-farmers-issue-oppn-mps-climb-on-table-295798

Everyone agreed on the need to work together on the anti BJP sentiment,” said SAD MP Naresh Gujral, whose father late PM IK Gujral had attempted the first coalition against then PM Indira Gandhi by hosting stalwarts like NT Rama Rao; Jyoti Basu; Ramakrishna Hegde, Chandrashekhar, Farooq Abdullah, Biju Patnaik and Harkishen Surjeet among others.“That meeting was a significant attempt to forge an anti-Congress coalition. The assassination of then PM Indira Gandhi altered the political dynamics and the Congress won a huge sympathy vote but then we had the National Front and the United Front governments. Both the Left and the BJP supported VP Singh. Contradictions remained but a larger purpose became more prominent,” said Gujral who is learnt to have mentioned at Sibal’s dinner that the Congress needed to be “freed of the control of Gandhis”.The meeting also discussed an outstanding proposal to field a common Lok Sabha candidate of the most dominant state party to defeat the BJP in 2024 – an idea the former finance minister P Chidambaram advocated before 2019 LS polls and the Congress Working Committee discussed but did not take forward.A major outcome of yesterday’s meet was NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s take to have a Maharashtra like Maha Vikas Aghadi experiment in UP and back SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in state elections. It remains to be seen where that would leave the Congress with Priyanka Vadra in charge general secretary of UP.Sibal for his part said the aim of his initiative was to “add to and not subtract from the strengths of the Congress.”“This conversation will only strengthen the Congress since the idea is to come together against a government that is destroying the idea of India,” Sibal said.It is unclear whether, like late IK Gujral’s initiative which was followed by meetings at Hyderabad (hosted by NTR), Srinagar (hosted by Farooq Abdullah) and Kolkata (hosted by Jyoti Basu), Sibal’s dinner meet would have spin offs. But that is what most leaders are hoping for.The dinner that Sibal hosted yesterday was attended by politicians of varied hues namely—NCP’s Sharad Pawar, TMC’s Derek O Brien and Kalyan Banerjee, RJD’s Lalu Yadav, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav, CPM’s Sitaram Yechury, CPI’s D Raja, RLD’s Jayant Chowdhry, BJD’s Pinaki Mishra, NC’s Omar Abdullah, Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut, Akali Dal’s Naresh Gujral, DMK’s TK Elangovan, and leaders of TDP, YSRCP Congress’ P Chidambaram and members of G 23 (Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, Prithviraj Chavan among others).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/decades-after-ik-gujrals-anti-indira-move-kapil-sibal-repeats-history-for-pm-modi-295766
11-08-2021||Bhopal||MP Assembly clears Bill on death penalty, life term in spurious liquor cases||The Madhya Pradesh Assembly on Tuesday passed a Bill prescribing capital punishment and life imprisonment in cases related to deaths caused by consumption of spurious liquor.The bill amending the state Excise Act to enhance punishment in spurious liquor cases was presented by Finance and Excise Minister Jagdish Devda, and the legislation comes in the wake of the death of a dozen people recently.Assembly speaker Girish Gautam declared it passed without any discussion amid sloganeering by Congress legislators who were demanding the implementation of the 27 per cent quota for OBCs in jobs and education announced by the erstwhile Kamal Nath government.The Madhya Pradesh Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was proposed by the state government in the backdrop of the death of at least seven people after drinking spurious liquor in Mandsaur last month. Later, five persons died following liquor consumption in Indore.Under the Bill, provisions of life imprisonment and the death penalty have been made in cases related to deaths due to spurious liquor besides imposing a fine of Rs 20 lakh on culprits, a Public Relations Department official said.Earlier, there was a provision of imprisonment up to 10 years in such cases.Earlier this month, Home Minister Narottam Mishra had said that punishment has been increased, ranging from 10 years to maximum 14 years from the present one year to six years, in addition to fine up to Rs 10 lakh, in cases of "physical damage" caused to victims after drinking poisonous alcohol.He had said in case of seizure of spurious liquor, the jail term for culprits has been increased to six to ten years from the present six months to a maximum of four years.The amendment in the Bill also proposed that people who attack police and excise department teams while they are seizing illicit liquor will be arrested without a warrant. The scope of punishment has been increased in several other provisions also.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-assembly-clears-bill-on-death-penalty-life-term-in-spurious-liquor-cases-295757

11-08-2021||New Delhi||Lok Sabha passes OBC quota Bill that restores states' rights to decide||The Lok Sabha on Tuesday evening passed the 127th Constitution Amendment Bill restoring powers of the state governments to identify and notify their own lists for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs) for quota in jobs and education.The Lok Sabha passed the Bill unanimously. This was the first proper debate of the Monsoon session since it began on July 19.In Lok Sabha, the Bill was passed under special covid distancing norms which meant the Lok Speaker allowed MP’s to vote using slips, and not usual press of a button to register a vote.Given the political implications of the legislation, the Bill was supported by all parties, including Opposition parties stalling the House for days on issues like the Pegasus snooping controversy and the three central farm laws. Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Virendra Kumar described the Bill as historic legislation as 671 castes in the country would benefit from it.“If this Constitutional Bill is not brought, 671 OBCs would not get reservation. All of them will be benefited now,” Kumar said.However, the day was not without its moments.  Initiating the debate, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury extended his party’s wholehearted support to the Bill saying they were participating in the debate because it is an important Bill and voting of three-fourth members of the House is needed.“The government repeatedly blames us for stalling the parliament. We are here to narrate the plight of people,” he said.Amid objections from the Treasury Benches, Chowdhury also slammed the government for “running away” from the debate on the issue of “snooping” through the Pegasus spyware. Criticising the government for the 2018 amendment, Chowdhury said if the government had inserted a suggestion proposed by the Opposition, today’s situation would not have arisen.“You tweaked the Constitution by bringing the 102 Constitution Amendment Bill in 2018 that gave people the opportunity to go to court and finally, the Supreme Court removed the states’ power,” he said.“But you have a brute majority so you thought that you could do whatever you wanted to. However, when the states started raising their voice, you realised your actions were incorrect. Now, in the light of UP, Uttarakhand polls, you have decided to do all this...still, we support the amendment but also demand that owing to cases like Indra Sawhney case, a ceiling of 50 per cent has been given,” he said, adding that the ceiling should be removed as demanded by States like Maharashtra for Maratha reservation.“You should listen to states, make it legal for states to cross the 50 per cent ceiling,” Chowdhury said, a demand that was supported by other parties like the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham and Samajwadi Party.Intervening in the debate, union minister Bhupender Yadav, who chaired the select committee on the Bill asserted that maximum measures to have been taken at a fast pace to ensure justice for Dalits, OBCs, and the poor by the Narendra Modi government.Hitting back, Yadav said the Constitution makers and not the Congress had made a provision for reservation for backward classes. However, when the Congress came to power in 1950 it ruled for 40 years but did not give justice to the backward classes. “When for the first time, a non-Congress government came to power, the Janata Party, the Mandal Commission was created. It had submitted its report in 1980 and you (the Congress) ran the government after that but did not implement it and did not give reservation to backward classes,” Yadav said.The minister said that it was in power from 2004-14 but did not give constitutional status to the commission for backward classes, which was also done by the Modi government.Yadav said Parliament’s intention was that the central and state OBC lists would remain separate. RSP’s NK Premchandra said the Opposition had repeatedly warned the government that its legislation would be interpreted by the court in the manner it was done, but the Centre did not listen and that is why the new bill was needed. Yadav said it is “our job to develop the legislative process” and asserted that the government is fully committed to ensuring justice for the poor, Dalits, and backward classes.The Bill seeks to fulfill the basic aim and spirit of our constitution-makers to build a country in which people get social, economic, and political justice on the basis of equality, he said. The Supreme Court has dismissed the Centre’s plea seeking a review of its May 5 majority verdict that held that the 102nd Constitution amendment took away from the states’ power to notify SEBCs for the grant of quota in jobs and admissions.Once the Rajya Sabha passes it and it gets the President's sanction, the legislation will allow states to notify OBC and SEBCs in the state Assembly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-passes-obc-quota-bill-that-restores-states-rights-to-decide-295725
