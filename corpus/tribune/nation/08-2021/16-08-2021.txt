Of course, Parliament has the prerogative to make laws. At least we must know why the government has introduced the bill despite being struck down by this court...I have not come across any debate, which took place in Parliament (on the bill). Please show us the debate—the reasons and all that,” a Bench led by CJI N V Ramana asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.The Bench, however, clarified that it’s not commenting on Parliament’s proceedings.Tribunal Reforms Bill, 2021 passed by Parliament in the Monsoon Session abolishes nine appellate tribunals and revives provisions of an ordinance regarding conditions of service and tenure of tribunal members and chairpersons struck down by the top court.Lamenting that there was no quality debate in Parliament, the CJI had on Sunday said the “sorry state of affairs” was resulting in passing of laws with a lot of ambiguity and gaps, leading to increased litigation.The Bench expressed concern over “disturbing trend” of the government not complying with its directions to fill vacancies in various tribunals. “It’s a serious issue...tribunals have to continue or shut down,” it told Mehta who said the process was on for appointments to the Central Administrative Tribunal.The Bench gave 10 days to the Centre to fill the positions of 19 presiding officers, 110 judicial members, and 111 technical numbers in all the tribunalsReferring to a judgment passed by a Bench led Justice LN Rao, the Bench said tribunals can effectively function only if they function independent of executive control, which would inspire public confidence in them.“Can you show us the ministry note citing reasons for the Bill?” the CJI asked Mehta who said since the Bill had not attained the status of an Act, it won’t be proper on his part to respond.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-makes-critical-comments-on-tribunals-reforms-bill-passed-by-parliament-without-debate-298089

16-08-2021||Vibha Sharma||Green Hydrogen: India plans big for new-age clean fuel for energy self-reliance and business point of view as an exporter||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 16Ahead of 2021 UN Climate Change Conference COP-26 scheduled later this year, India is planning big on new-age “cleanest” fuel Green Hydrogen for energy self-reliance and reducing dependence on imports and from the business point of view as an exporter.Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday formally announced the setting up of National Hydrogen Mission, putting the zero-carbon fuel at the centre-stage of India’s energy requirements and paving way for a “gas-based” economy in coming years.   “Of every effort being made by India today the thing that is going to help India with a quantum leap in terms of climate is the field of Green Hydrogen. To achieve the goal of Green Hydrogen, I am announcing the National Hydrogen Mission today with this tricolour as a witness. We have to make India a global hub for Green Hydrogen production and export in the ‘Amrit Kaal’,” the Prime Minister said in his Independence Day speech.While several industry majors, including state-run oil companies are turning towards adopting this cleanest form of energy, his words will also assure investors of policy support, say officials. The announcement also comes ahead of COP-26 in Glasgow, where nations will be under pressure to pledge more ambitious climate action, especially on emissions.Energy is integral for any fast-growing economy and India has taken numerous steps, including in new-age fuels, to tackle the global problem of climate change and become self-reliant. Last year in October, Prime Minister Modi outlined a new energy map of India with seven key drivers and one of them was the development of emerging fuels, including Green Hydrogen. The Government also announced the National Hydrogen Mission in the Union Budget 2021 for making a hydrogen roadmap for the country.The Prime Minister set a 2047 deadline for becoming self-reliant in energy. “India has to make a resolution to make India energy independent before the completion of 100 years of independence and our roadmap is very clear for the same. It should be a gas-based economy. “There should be a network of CNG & PNG across the country. There should be a target of 20 per cent ethanol blending. India is moving ahead with a set goal. India has also made a move towards Electric Mobility,” he saidGreen Hydrogen is produced by electrolysing water using electricity from renewable sources. It could supply up to 25% of the world’s energy needs by 2050 and become a 10 trillion-dollar addressable market by then, according to reports.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/green-hydrogen-india-plans-big-for-new-age-clean-fuel-for-energy-self-reliance-and-business-point-of-view-as-an-exporter-298077

16-08-2021||New Delhi||I had to run, else Taliban would have killed me: Afghan intel officer who took last flight to Delhi||"I had to run, else the Taliban would have killed me. Everything ends here. I could not bring my family along," Afghan intelligence officer Asif said in broken Hindi as tears welled up in his eyes, hours after he landed in Delhi.The 41-year-old officer took the last commercial flight from Kabul to Delhi on Sunday to escape "certain death", leaving behind his ailing mother, wife, and an eight-year-old son.A compatriot helped Asif find a modest accommodation—a small room, attached bathroom and a marble slab with a sink that he called kitchen—in Lajpat Nagar for Rs 500 a day."I will try if I can get a room for Rs 200-300,” said the officer, who wanted to be identified as just Asif.Asked if he had food, the officer of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), the national intelligence and security service of Afghanistan, burst into tears.His hands trembled and lips quivered as he took out his passport, an NDS identity card and photographs of his family from his bag."The Taliban are catching us, killing us. They sent us notices, asking us to revolt against the government or die. We lost hope after (President Ashraf) Ghani fled (the country). Hundreds of officers from the security establishment have fled to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and other countries,” he said, as beads of sweat trickled down from his forehead. Asked if his family is safe back home, Asif said he had no information as Internet services have been hit in some areas in Kabul, which fell to the Taliban on Sunday."I got my visa a month before. Ten days ago, we had intel that the Taliban is going to return,” he said. “Pakistan betrayed us... I served my nation for 20 years. This was my life," Asif said before he broke down again, holding some of his pictures in NDS uniform and the security badge.He told PTI he and his colleagues shed their uniform and changed into civilian clothes before boarding a flight to India last night. Air India—the only airline that has been operating flights between India and Afghanistan—operated its last Delhi-Kabul-Delhi flight on Sunday. The flight scheduled for Monday has been cancelled.Asif says women have ditched salwar-kameez for burqas and have been keeping indoors. They will be killed if they don't, he said."Sab khatam (everything is over)... There is no chance we will return to our country ever. Our beloved home is lost. I don't even know if my family will be able to make it to India,” Asif said.Afghanistan stares at an uncertain future as President Ashraf Ghani left the country just before Kabul fell into the hands of the Taliban on Sunday.Sitting in his chemist shop barely a hundred metres away, Yousuf Yousufi, who fled Afghanistan five years ago, is hooked to his mobile screen, watching videos of crowds at the Kabul airport and Taliban fighters storming the Afghan Presidential Palace.Some of the videos that a friend in Kabul sent to him purportedly showed people jostling with one another to get into a plane at the Kabul airport. The burst of machine gun could be heard in another video shot at night, as people ran down the streets.“Taliban forced many policemen to leave our motherland over the years. Else, they would have killed us someday,” the 35-year-old father of three children said."My mother, sister, and brother are stuck there. They have locked themselves inside our home in Kabul. I have not been able to talk to them. The Internet isn't working there,” he said.Yousufi's eyes are swollen and red. He says he hasn't slept well for three days.He says he's stressed and takes a puff of a cigarette before suddenly breaking down, seeing a video that showed a child crying over the body of a woman.“You asked me why I left my family there. I am an Afghan policeman. These children (the ones in the video) are my family. Our leaders abandoned us,” he said. “Everyone has failed us. The United States ditched us... We will be forever indebted if the Indian government for helping us evacuate our family,” Yousufi said.In the adjoining four-storeyed building, Shukriya, 47, recalled the time when she ran a beauty parlour in Kabul.“My parents sold me to a ‘mujahideen' for Rs 4 lakh. He had two more wives. He would not let me go to the market without a burqa and beat me up if I talked to a man,” she recalled.The government helped Shukriya get a divorce and she fled to India with a daughter and a son. "The Taliban are cruel to women. They won't let girls go to school, they abduct and forcibly marry teenagers and stone them to death if they fall in love," she said.Shukriya felt Afghanistan has lost its chance to become a modern, democratic state with the relentless advance of the Taliban. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-had-to-run-else-taliban-would-have-killed-me-afghan-intel-officer-who-took-last-flight-to-delhi-298070

It is changing rapidly even as we speak.”“The situation in Afghanistan is being monitored on a constant basis at high levels. The Government will take all steps to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals and our interests in Afghanistan,” assured the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).The airport in Kabul witnessed grisly scenes that included videos showing people falling to their deaths from an aircraft that had taken off from Kabul airport and lifeless bodies after security forces opened fire on a mob of Afghans trying to enter the airport. Many ran along with taxiing military aircraft hoping to somehow get out of the country.As commercial operations from Kabul airport were suspended on Monday, this has forced a pause in India’s repatriation efforts. The Government is awaiting the resumption of flights to restart the process.Afghanistan’s aviation authority said the national airspace had been released to the military after the Taliban’s takeover but for now the Americans have taken over the airport to facilitate the extrication of their personnel and equipment.“We are in constant touch with the representatives of Afghan Sikh and Hindu communities. We will facilitate repatriation to India of those who wish to leave Afghanistan. There are also a number of Afghans who have been our partners in the promotion of our mutual developmental, educational and people to people endeavours. We will stand by them,” assured the Government.The Government said it was aware that there are still some Indian nationals in Afghanistan who wish to return and the embassy in Kabul is in touch with them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-stand-by-afghan-loyalists-hindus-and-sikhs-assures-govt-298066

Why doesn’t the BJP go ahead and make the change? If renaming solves people’s problems, then the Congress shall support it.”Queried on a letter written by Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray accusing some Shiv Sainiks of stalling important road works, Patole said Gadkari should audit the projects being carried out here and publish a white paper.On being asked about opposition from some groups over the setting up of a sports university in Pune instead of Aurangabad, he said his party felt that such universities should be set up in every district of the state.

16-08-2021||Chandigarh||Researchers develop non-invasive, economical treatment for neglected tropical disease that is second largest killer||Indian researchers have developed a non-invasive, easy to administer and cost-effective therapeutic strategy based on nano-science to counter Visceral Leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease.The drug, unlike present treatment methodology, can be administered orally and is said to have an efficacy of over 90 per cent.Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a complex infectious disease transmitted by the bite of female sandflies. It is a neglected tropical disease that affects millions annually, making it the second most common parasitic killer after malaria.The conventional treatment therapy of VL mainly involves painful intravenous administration, which imposes many treatment complications, including prolonged hospitalisation, high cost, and high risk of infection.Oral drug delivery has big advantages that can help overcome these barriers. With oral routes, however, there are other challenges as more than 90 per cent of orally administered therapeutic drugs have less than two per cent bioavailability and potentially high hepatic and renal toxic side effects.A team led by Dr Shyam Lal from the Institute of Nano Science and Technology (INST), Mohali, has developed a smart and intelligent nano-carrier utilising the natural intrinsic Vitamin B12 pathway present in human body that can mitigate stability challenges and drug-associated toxicity.The team critically evaluated the efficacy and properties of Vitamin B12 coated solid lipid nan-oparticles and their subsequent potential ramification in evading cyto-toxicity and escalating stability.They conceptualised an innate immune defence mechanism to enhance the physicochemical properties of orally administered nano-particles, which can easily navigate through the gastrointestinal tract without being washed away by naturally present mucus barrier.The team’s research minimized the drug’s gastrointestinal side effects, while the natural intrinsic Vitamin B12 pathway enhanced the oral bioavailability and anti-leishmanial therapeutic efficacy by more than 90 per cent.Anchoring Vitamin B12 on the surface of solid lipid nano-particles augmented the stability and targeted delivery of the poorly soluble drugs and also enhanced the therapeutic efficiency with reduced risks of off-target actions.The research showed that Vitamin B12, being an essential lifesaving micronutrient, plays a pivotal role in the body by modulating the toxic side effects associated with the most neglected tropical disease and also works as an innovative and beneficial supplement for its treatment and prevention.It not only reduces the risk of infection but also enhances the immunity of an individual. Moreover, it also improves the bioavailability and targeted delivery by utilizing the natural intrinsic Vitamin B12 pathway present in the human body.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/researchers-develop-non-invasive-economical-treatment-for-neglected-tropical-disease-that-is-second-largest-killer-298057

At a time of disturbing visuals coming out of Kabul airport where people were seen running for their lives and jostling one another to get on to planes, how can the government leave Indians stranded in Afghanistan to their fate. Who is responsible for safe evacuation of Indians if not the Government of India,” asked Congress media head Randeep Surjewala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-secretary-chairs-national-crisis-management-committee-meeting-on-afghan-crisis-298024
16-08-2021||Hyderabad||GMR Group proposes user development fee hike at Hyderabad Airport; Airlines’ body opposes||The Federation of Indian Airlines vehemently opposes a proposal by GMR Group to the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority seeking an increase of the aeronautical tariffs including User Development Fee (UDF) at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport here.The AERA last month issued a consultation paper on the tariff revision for the third control period (April 2021 to March 2026) proposed by GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited that manages the aerodrome, seeking comments from the stakeholders.The airport sought an increase of UDF from the existing Rs 281 to a whopping Rs 608 from October 1, a jump of 116 per cent for departing domestic passengers. Similarly the airport operator sought a 231 per cent hike on international passengers to Rs 1,300 from the current Rs 393.The GHIAL, during the third control period proposed to gradually increase the UDF up to Rs 728 and Rs 2,200 by the end of 2025-‘26 for domestic and international passengers respectively.“In this regard, FIA humbly requests AERA to not implement any increase in the aeronautical tariff in the Third Control Period and defer any increase in the same to the subsequent control period, given the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 on airlines,” FIA said in response to the consultation paper.FIA’s members are IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir, according to its website.At present, the airline operations are barely at 35–44 per cent of the pre-COVID-19 capacity and the passenger traffic at around 30–48 per cent of pre-COVID levels, the airlines body said.As per industry estimates issued by IATA and CAPA, airlines are likely to undergo losses of USD 8.0 billion for the FY 2020-21 and 2021-22 and it may take  two to three  years for airline operations to reach the pre-COVID-19 level, in terms of number of flights and passengers, it said.Also, with limited financial support from the government, airlines are constrained to implement severe cost control measures to sustain its operations, it added.“In the given circumstances, it is imperative that AERA does not take any steps, including by way of increase in aeronautical tariff, during the Third Control Period, which precipitates any further adverse financial impact on the airlines,” FIA further said.Justifying the tariff increase, GHIAL said it is making heavy investments on capacity expansion.However, FIA said under the current scenario post-Covid, all non-essential capital expenditure should be put on hold or deferred, and only such capex deemed critical from a safety or security compliance perspective may be undertaken by the airport.

While young leaders leave we ‘oldies’ are blamed for our efforts to strengthen it. The Party moves on with: Eyes Wide Shut,” said Sibal in perhaps his most caustic remark on the Congress leadership in recent times.Sibal, who hosted non-BJP leaders for dinner at his home days ago, has been in the eye of a storm for “acting out of line”.While most members of the G 23 group that previously wrote to the Congress chief for comprehensive party reforms and internal debates have gone silent, Sibal remains a visible and lone crusader and continues to press ahead with alternatives to strengthen the Congress.His well-attended dinner was a step in that direction with Sibal saying, “This conversation will strengthen the Congress. That’s what we want.”Sibal has also been vocal about the need to have a full-time president with a clear chain of command in the Congress.The president elections in the party remain suspended after the Congress Working Committee in its last meeting decided to postpone the agenda in the wake of the Covid surge.“We should have a full-time president,” Sibal says as leaders continue to leave the Congress for brighter avenues as the grand old party appears to be consistent in losing its electoral sheen.Senior leaders feel the party is not debating much and needs to review its position on economic, political and ideological issues rather than centre its energies on anti-Modi narrative.An alternative political agenda that inspires hope is the need of the hour, say several leaders in reference to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s current anti-Modi brand of politics.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congresss-eyes-wide-shut-kapil-sibal-says-after-sushmita-dev-leaves-party-297999

The background depicts a scene from her poem 'Jhansi ki Rani', one of the most iconic poems in Hindi literature, on one side and freedom fighters on the other.In a statement, Google described Chauhan as a "trailblazing writer and freedom fighter" who "rose to national prominence during a male-dominated era of literature".Chauhan was born on this day in 1904 at Nihalpur village in Uttar Pradesh's Allahabad, now Prayagraj."She was known to write constantly, even in the horse cart on the way to school, and her first poem was published at just nine years old. The call for Indian independence reached its height during her early adulthood. As a participant in the Indian Nationalist Movement, she used her poetry to call others to fight for their nation's sovereignty," Google said.Her poetry and prose primarily focused on hardships that the Indian women overcame "such as gender and caste discrimination"."In 1923, Chauhan's unyielding activism led her to become the first woman satyagrahi, a member of the Indian collective of nonviolent anti-colonialists, to be arrested in the struggle for national liberation," the internet search giant said.As part of her contribution to the freedom struggle, Chauhan continued to make revolutionary statements on and off the page and she published a total of 88 poems and 46 short stories.

Efforts to retrieve the mortal remains of the second pilot continue,” a senior Army officer said.The body of the pilot was moved to the Military Hospital, Pathankot, for post mortem and other necessary procedures. The search operation, which continued till about 7 pm, will resume tomorrow morning.   The Dhruv helicopter from an Army Aviation Corps squadron based at Pathankot had taken off on a routine sortie on August 3, when it crashed into the reservoir near Kathua in Jammu region. Only a part of the helicopter’s wreckage was recovered in the initial phase of the search.Divers from the Navy and the Army’s Special Forces have been involved in the search operations using multi-beam sonars, side scanners, remotely operated vehicles and underwater manipulators which have been flown in from Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai and Kochi.Yesterday, the IAF had airlifted a Submarine Rescue Unit of the Indian Navy from Vishakapatnam to the crash site to explore the digitally located wreckage at a depth of approximately 80 - 100 metre.Earlier, a small area of 60 metre by 60 metre had been localised and special sonar equipment flown in from Kochi was employed to enable the search operations to enter the final phase. On August 11, the Army had stated that the wreckage had been identified at a depth of approximately 80 metre from the surface of the reservoir.The expansive reservoir is 25 km long, 8 km wide and more than 150 metre deep. Besides the Army and the Navy, other agencies involved in the search operations include the National Disaster Relief Force, Ranjit Sagar Dam Authority and the local district administration as well as local residents.Sources said this was the second incident involving a Dhruv helicopter from the same squadron in the past about six months. Another Dhruv from a different unit, also based at Pathankot, made a forced landing in the fields last week after suffering an oil leak, sources added.Last week, Neel Joshi, the brother of the other missing pilot, had taken to the social media, highlighting the emotional trauma being faced by the families of the aircrew with search and rescue operations getting prolonged and little information emerging through official channels.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/12-days-after-dhruv-helicopter-crash-body-of-one-pilot-retrieved-from-ranjit-sagar-reservoir-297963

But our reform agenda has to continue and we will keep pushing for it to strengthen the Congress,” he told PTI.The former Union minister said he and his party colleagues are ready to support these efforts in order to revive and revitalise the Congress.He said Gandhi can “jettison” him if he stands in her way, but he would continue to seek strengthening of the Congress for bringing it to the forefront of Opposition unity.“This is not about me, but about a revival of the Congress and bringing it to the forefront of Opposition unity. Without the Congress being strong, there can be no Opposition unity,” Sibal said.“If I stand in the way of bringing unity, it does not matter. It is not about me or any of the Group of 23 leaders. You can jettison me and others, but you should strengthen the Congress,” he added.Sibal said Opposition unity will not come about till the Congress is revived and strengthened.“This project of Opposition unity will fail if the Congress is not strengthened and rejuvenated. I hope the Congress realises the significance of its primacy,” he said.Sibal also expressed concern over reforms not taking place in the grand old party, saying, “it is worrisome”. He said the Congress remains without a regular president and it is a public duty of the party to have regular elected office-bearers.The former Union minister said the time has come for the Congress to put its act together and the party owes it to the people of the country.He said they need to rejuvenate the party and bring it back as a force to reckon with.Sibal’s remarks came ahead of the Congress president’s virtual meeting with Opposition leaders on August 20 to bring about more synergy on important issues before the country.A number of chief ministers of states not ruled by the BJP, including West Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee, Maharashtra’s Uddhav Thackeray and Tamil Nadu’s M K Stalin, and other Opposition leaders are expected to attend the meeting.Sibal had hosted a dinner for top Opposition leaders at his residence on August 9, where they agreed to strengthen Opposition unity in their bid to unitedly defeat the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and other states and in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Recalling the outcome of his dinner meeting with the Opposition leaders, he said, “What emerged from my dinner was a coalition of thoughts and interests focussed on defeating the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha election.” Sibal alleged that the BJP has destroyed the foundations of India and all that the country stood for in 1947.“We need to come together to restore what we have lost since 2014,” he said.The effort, he said, is to put up a single candidate against the saffron party and defeat it in the elections, but it seems that the roadmap ahead is tough as there are many parties that are against each other at the state level.The leaders who were present at Sibal’s dinner included RJD’s Lalu Prasad, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav of the Samajwadi Party, CPI-M’s Sitaram Yechury, CPI’s D Raja, Omar Abdullah of the National Conference, Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena, Sanjay Singh of the AAP and TMC leaders Kalyan Banerjee and Derek O’Brien.Besides, BJD leaders Pinaki Mishra and Amar Patnaik, DMK’s Tiruchi Siva and TK Elangovan, RLD’s Jayant Chaudhary, and leaders of the TRS, the TDS and the SAD were also present at the dinner meet.

16-08-2021||New Delhi||‘Sorry state of affairs’: CJI Ramana on lack of debate in Parliament||Expressing concern over the lack of debate in Parliament and state legislatures, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Sunday said it is a “sorry state of affairs” as the absence of quality debate leaves many aspects of laws unclear and increases the burden on courts.He said that an elaborate discussion during the law-making process reduces litigation as when courts interpret legislations, “we all know the intent of the legislature”.Speaking at the 75th Independence Day function organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association in the lawns of the top court, the Chief Justice exhorted the members of the legal fraternity to participate in public life and share their experience about laws.He said the country’s long freedom struggle was led by lawyers. “Whether it is Mahatma Gandhi or Babu Rajendra Prasad, they were legal luminaries, who sacrificed their property, family and life and led the movement.”           “Most of the members of first Lok sabha and Rajya Sabha were all lawyers and members from the legal fraternity. Unfortunately, we know what is happening now in the Parliament with respect to debates on laws,” CJI Ramana said in his address to the bar members.He said there used to be debates in Parliament on various constitutional amendments and how they will affect the people.“Long ago, I have seen a debate during the introduction of the Industrial Disputes Act and a member from Tamil Nadu used to discuss the law so elaborately as to how the law will affect the working class. It used to reduce the burden on the courts, as when the courts interpreted the law, we all knew the intent of the legislature,” the Chief Justice said.“Now, it is a sorry state of affairs. There are a lot of gaps and a lot of ambiguity in the law-making process due to lack of debates. We don’t know what the intent of the legislature is. We don’t know for what purpose the laws are made. This causes great inconvenience to the people. This happens when members of the legal fraternity are not in the Parliament and state legislature,”he added.The monsoon session of Parliament was short-terminated last week following days of relentless protest by the Opposition over the Pegasus snooping row, farm laws, price rise and other issues.The CJI told the lawyers, “Don’t confine yourself to your profession, earning money and living comfortably. Please think over it. We should actively participate in public life, do some good service and share the experience with the country. Hopefully, goodness will come out of it in the country.”                The Supreme Court has played an active role in the country and has given more than what the Constitution has thought of, but he expects the legal fraternity to contribute more, the CJI added. “There are small issues but around 75 per cent of the people in need of justice have got legal aid. You (lawyers) all should participate in the legal aid movement. On November 26 and 27, we may have two day workshops on Constitution Day on legal aid,” he said.At the outset, the Chief Justice said it is a historic day and an occasion for all to rethink and review the policies to understand “what we have achieved and what we have to achieve in the future”.“Seventy-five years is not a small period in the history of the country but we have to also consider the vast landscape and geographical condition of our country,” the CJI said, while recalling his childhood days when they were given jaggery and and murmura (puffed rice) in school on the occasion of Independence Day.                       “Since then, a lot of development has taken place. Small things given to us in school made us very happy but in today’s time when we have so many facilities, we are not happy. I think this is due to our saturation level,” he said.Supreme Court Judges AM Khanwilkar and V Ramasubramanian were also present on the occasion alongside several lawyers and members of the Supreme Court Bar Association. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was also present on the occasion, said the Chief Justice of India is the ‘karta’ (guardian) of Indian legal family and thus he does not wish to say anything more. “India is a young democracy and when we look around the neighbouring countries and they call themselves democracy and we all know how they have failed. In contrast, we have been able to sustain it the way it was envisioned by the framers of our Constitution,” Mehta said.                  The Chief Justice of India unfurled the National Flag, after which the National Anthem was played by a police band.Supreme Court Bar Association president Vikas Singh welcomed the guests and said that it is a historic day as the country is celebrating its 75th Independence Day. He thanked the Chief Justice and other judges for gracing the occasion. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sorry-state-of-affairs-cji-ramana-on-lack-of-debate-in-parliament-297912

16-08-2021||Vibha Sharma||PM Modi says shrinking farm sizes in villages a challenge||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 15Making small farmers with less than two hectares of land the centrepiece of his Independence Day address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday stressed the need to give maximum benefits of government schemes to those who account for more than 80 per cent of the farming community.Stating that his dream is to make small farmers the pride of the country — ‘Chhota kisan, bane desh ki shaan’ — the Prime Minister said, in coming years, “we will have to increase the collective power of the small farmers of the country. They have to be given new facilities”Significantly, amid the ongoing agitation against the three Central farm laws, the Prime Minister also said that “political will is required to bring in big changes and big reforms”.“Today, the world can see that there is no dearth of political will in India. Good and smart governance is needed to bring reforms. The world is a witness to how India is writing a new chapter of governance,” he said.The Prime Minister said small farmers were not given enough attention in earlier policies which his government was trying to change by increasing their collective power by providing them with new facilities. To the farmers, the Prime Minister assured, reforms were for their benefit. “The decisions are now being taken keeping small farmers in mind. They were ignored in the past. Our dream is Chhota kisan, desh ki shaan”.“We need to focus on major challenges facing the agriculture sector. One challenge is the shrinking farm sizes in villages.“Farmland is shrinking because of increasing population and division of families,” he said, stating that more than 80 per cent farmers in the country have less than 2 hectares of farmlandPrime Minister Modi, who mentioned farmers several times in his speech, talked about various programmes undertaken by his government in this direction. He said policies like Fasal Bima Yojana, increasing the minimum support price (MSP) by 1.5 times, linking farmers with Kisan Credit Card (KCC) for cheaper farm loans, taking solar power schemes till farmland or setting up of Farmer Producers Organisations (FPOs), will all strengthen small farmers in the country.The Prime Minister said that keeping small expenses in mind, the government is implementing the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) under which more than Rs 1.5 lakh-crore have been transferred to bank accounts of over 10 crore farmers.Kisan rails are being operated to ensure farmers were able to transport at less cost to different parts of the country, he said, adding that produce like black rice, turmeric, litchi, are being transported to different regions of the country and some are also being exported.PM Modi also announced the distribution of fortified rice to the underprivileged sections of society, saying that rice provided under any scheme will be fortified by 2024. “Today we see our villages changing rapidly. In the past few years, facilities like road and electricity have reached villages. Today, the optical fiber network is providing the power of data to villages, the internet is reaching there. Digital entrepreneurs are getting ready in villages too,” he said||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-says-shrinking-farm-sizes-in-villages-a-challenge-297904
16-08-2021||Aditi Tandon||I-Day: PM sets goals for centenary of India’s Independence; calls for ‘sabka prayas’ to realise them||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 15Leading the nation into the 75th year of Independence from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the time had come to redefine India and called for “sabka prayas” to take the country to greater heights.Setting national goals for the centenary of Independence in 2047, a 25 year period he called “amrit kaal”, the Prime Minister in a 90-minute address said, “This is the time, the right time, precious time for India. Let’s seize it.”Noting that he was no fortune teller but a firm believer in the fruits of labour, the Prime Minister hailed the current generation as a “Can do generation”, saying, “This generation can do anything, achieve anything. I have full faith in the potential of our youth, our daughters, our farmers, our professionals...For the next 25 years we have to make pledges and touch the pinnacle of diligence and persistence to realise them. This is the time to dream new dreams and I can state with confidence that whoever unfurls the Tricolour in 2047 will announce the realisation of the promises we make today,” said the Prime Minister, in the presence of the Indian Olympic contingent, invited to I-Day celebrations as special guests.Adding the phrase “sabka prayas” to the government’s “sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas” pledge, the Prime Minister said, “Now we have to move towards the saturation of all welfare goals -- 100 pc villages must have roads, 100 pc households must have bank accounts, 100 pc women must have Ujjawla benefits.”Calling for next generation infrastructure, world-class manufacturing and new age technology as the pillars for India’s future, the PM announced two major initiatives that are in the works—PM Master Plan and National Hydrogen Mission.“In the near future, India will launch the Rs 100 lakh-crore PM Gatishakti Master Plan. We have to enhance our manufacturing and exports. Few days ago, the first indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant was launched for sea trials,” said the Prime Minister, emphasising green energy, for which, he said plans were afoot for a National Hydrogen Mission to ensure India’s energy independence by 2047.Delineating his vision for India@2047, the Prime Minister urged manufacturers to pay attention to the quality of their products saying every item they export is India’s brand ambassador.“’Brand India hinges on the quality of your exports,” he reminded industry.To the farmers, the Prime Minister assured that reforms were for their benefits. He spoke of 80 per cent farmers with less than 2 hectare land and said, “The decisions are now being taken keeping small farmers in mind. They were ignored in the past. Our dream is—chhota kisan, desh ki shaan”In another major announcement, the Prime Minister promised to open Sainik schools to girls soon.He described as historic several recent decisions such as the “abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, peaceful settlement of the Ram Janmabhoomi issue; implementation of GST” to say that 21st century India had the capacity to achieve anything.The Prime Minister also said the delimitation commission was working in J&K and elections would be held thereafter.“Today India is solving problems that have been pending for decades. Be it the constitutional status to the OBC Commission or block and district council elections in J&K for the first time since Independence, India is consistently displaying its will to realise its pledges,” he said, adding that Jammu and Kashmir, hill states and northeast will become the bedrocks for India’s future growth.The Prime Minister also stressed the importance of citizen duties saying every Indian must own the national pledges to take the country forward and added that there was no time to lose.He earlier spoke of the declaration of August 14 as the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day as a “very emotional national decision.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-day-pm-sets-goals-for-centenary-of-indias-independence-calls-for-sabka-prayas-to-realise-them-297879
