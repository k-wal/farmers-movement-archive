Jyoti Mirdha’s grandfather, known in state politics as Baba, used to stay in the farmhouse until his death.“Since then, her uncle and father’s younger brother Bhanu Prakash Mirdha has been living here. In 1988, he sold a part of this property from her father’s share to one Bhanwar Lal for the purpose of residential development,” she alleged in her complaint.Jyoti Mirdha further said since they were only two daughters to her father and lived out of Jodhpur, they never knew about this development.Taking advantage of their absence, her uncle fabricated documents and got the property converted from agriculture to residential land, she alleged.In her complaint, she has given the names of 13 persons, including her uncle Bhanu Prakash Mirdha and former tourism minister Usha Punia.Station House Officer, Chopasni Housing Board, Likhmaram confirmed that police received the order of investigation from the court on Thursday.“We have received the complaint and have referred the matter to the DCP (West) for appointment of the investigation officer into the matter,” he said.

We, therefore, are of the view that marital rape is a good ground to claim divorce,” the Bench said.The court dismissed the appeals filed by the husband against the judgement of a Family Court allowing a petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty and dismissing another petition by the husband seeking conjugal rights.“Treating wife’s body as something owing to husband and committing sexual act against her will is nothing but marital rape. Right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity encompasses bodily integrity, any disrespect or violation of bodily integrity is a violation of individual autonomy,” the court said in its order on July 30.In modern social jurisprudence, the court said, spouses in marriage are treated as equal partners and husband cannot claim any superior right over wife either with respect to her body or with reference to individual status.“In this case, the insatiable urge of the husband for wealth and sex forced the respondent to seek divorce. The appellant’s licentious and profligate conduct cannot be considered as part of normal conjugal life. Therefore, we have no difficulty in holding that insatiable urge of a spouse for wealth and sex will also amount to cruelty,” the court said.It said the appellant failed to substantiate imputation of adultery to the respondent (wife).“Unsubstantiated allegations of adultery will also constitute mental cruelty. Therefore, we are of the view that the findings of facts as above clearly establish a ground for cruelty warranting divorce,” it said.In desperation for obtaining a divorce, the court said, she has forsaken and abandoned her monetary claims.“Her cry for divorce has been prolonged in the temple of justice for more than a decade (12 years). She still awaits the final bell to answer her prayers and cry.She is unable to digest the delay involved in responding to a request for the separation. Perhaps we are accountable for her tears,” the court said.“We see this is not a solitary instance. On a day- to-day basis, we see many, many like her. Her whimper touches our conscience,” it said.The couple got married in 1995 and has two children.The court noted that the husband, a doctor by profession, received from his wife’s father 501 sovereigns of gold, a car and a flat at the time of marriage.The Family Court found that the husband was treating the wife as a money-minting machine and that she had tolerated harassment for the sake of marriage, and chose to file a petition for divorce when harassment and cruelty reached beyond toleration.

The interaction also witnessed the participation of Secretaries of more than 20 departments, state government officials, members of Export Promotion Councils, and Chambers of Commerce, said an official news release.The PM urged the stakeholders to put all their efforts to take advantage of the new opportunities created by the changes in the global supply chain in the post-Covid world.Considering the size of the Indian economy and its potential and at a time when the country is moving towards the mission of “Atmanirbhar Bharat”, one of the goals is to increase India's share in exports manifold.“To achieve this we have to make sure that we get access to the global supply chain, so that our business can scale and grow,” suggested the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister said the Government is taking necessary steps at every level to achieve this. Recently, he said the Government has taken a major decision for our exporters to get a boost of about Rs 88,000 crore rupees in the form of insurance cover. Similarly, by rationalising the incentives, exports would be WTO compliant and get a boost.The Prime Minister stressed the importance of stability in doing business. The decision taken by India to get rid of retrospective taxation shows consistency in policies and gives a clear message to all the investors that India is not only opening the doors of new possibilities but has the will to fulfill its promises, he emphasised.The Prime Minister told the Ambassadors that in whichever country they are present, they should act as a bridge for the industry here. He requested the Ministry of Commerce to put in place a system so that there is constant communication between our exporters and our missions.Jaishankar said the Indian Missions need to be globally local to help connect Indian producers with the demand in specific countries. Piyush Goyal said that the global environment is favourable and the industry should look at leveraging comparative and competitive advantages with respect to other countries for increasing our exports.The Heads of Missions gave their inputs and suggestions to increase India’s exports such as setting sector and region-specific trade targets, the need to focus on value addition, quality standards of products, and supply chain diversification.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-asks-indian-envoys-to-promote-indigenous-products-293992

The envoys of UK, US, France, Ireland, Norway and Estonia called upon the Taliban to engage meaningfully and spoke against providing aid to the government that does not respect human rights.India has been the first to say unequivocally a couple of months back that the legitimacy of a government that comes to power by forces in Kabul will be in doubt.France called on the Taliban to end the violence and said they must be held accountable for their crimes and there can be no cloak of impunity surrounding violations of international human rights.The sentiment in the ongoing discussion was that a negotiated settlement should guarantee inclusive governance, human rights protections, especially for women.Many of these countries had their forces in Afghanistan for two decades but were unable to subdue the Taliban.Special Representative of UN Deborah Lyons described Afghanistan as standing at a dangerous turning point. “In the past weeks, it has entered a new destructive phase. Taliban has achieved significant territorial gains,’’ she said while questioning Taliban’s commitment to a political settlement.Just before the discussions began, word came of the Taliban assassinating the director of Afghanistan’s government media center, two days after an aborted attempt on the life of the Afghan acting defense minister.The Taliban in a statement said Dawa Khan Menapal, who was spearheading Kabul’s media outreach against the militant group, “was killed in a special attack’’ by the mujahideen.On Friday, news came of the Taliban on the brink of capturing Zaranj from where India has built a road to Iran for an alternate access to the sea for Afghanistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-recognise-taliban-govt-that-comes-to-power-by-force-say-unsc-envoys-293991
06-08-2021||New Delhi||Hopeful of launching Covovax for adults in October this year, for children in Q1-2022: Serum CEO||Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla on Friday said he is hopeful that Covovax, another Covid-19 vaccine being manufactured by his company in India, will be launched in October for adults and for children by the first quarter of 2022.He also thanked the government for all the support provided to Serum Institute and said the company is always trying to expand its Covishield production capacity to meet the demand.Poonawalla met Home Minister Amit Shah in Parliament and the meeting between the two lasted for 30 minutes.“The government is helping us and we are facing no financial crunch. We are thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for all the cooperation and support,” Poonawala told PTI after his meeting.When asked about vaccines for kids, he said, “The Covovax vaccine for kids will be launched in the first quarter of the next year most likely in January-February.”           Poonawala said he is hopeful that for adults Covovax will be launched in October, depending on DCGI approvals.It will be a two-dose vaccine and the price will be decided at the time of launch, he added.On production capacity of Covishield, the vaccine being manufactured and supplied by Serum in India under a licensing agreement with Oxford and AstraZeneca, he said the present capacity is 130 million doses per month and always try to increase it further.Earlier in the day, Poonawalla also met Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya.The minister tweeted that he had a productive discussion on the supply of the Covishield vaccine with Poonawalla.“I appreciated their role in mitigating #COVID19 & assured continued Government support in ramping up vaccine production,” Mandaviya said.Last month, an expert panel of India’s Central Drug Authority recommended granting permission to Serum Institute of India (SII) for conducting phase 2/3 trials of Covovax on children aged 2 to 17 years with certain conditions, official sources had earlier said.The trials would cover 920 children, 460 each in the age group of 12-17 and 2-11 across 10 sites.The Pune-based pharmaceutical company had submitted a revised protocol for inclusion of paediatric cohort in the ongoing Covovax phase 2 and 3 observer-blind, randomised, controlled study in Indian adults aged 18 years and above to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the jab.In the revised application, SII director (government and regulatory affairs) Prakash Kumar Singh and director Dr Prasad Kulkarni had stated that globally, all adults aged 18 and above are being vaccinated and after this population is protected against Covid-l9, children will remain the most susceptible group.Currently, only those who are 18 or above are eligible for vaccination against the coronavirus.The SII is learnt to have informed that their collaborator, Novavax, Inc, US has already generated a large amount of data in adults in different countries and that the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity data on the Novavax Covid-I9 vaccine are very robust which includes a safety database of more than 50,000 adults with data from Australia, South Africa, UK and USA and preliminary safety data in 2248 children.“Further in the ongoing Phase 2/3 study in India, more than 1400 participants have received at least first dose of the vaccine with no safety concerns reported so far,” the application stated.“This will ensure that a life-saving vaccine can be brought at the earliest for our pediatric population also in addition to the adult population immediately after the grant of Emergency Use Authorisation.The SEC on June 30 had recommended against granting permission to SII for conducting phase 2 and 3 trials of Covovax on children aged 2 to 17 years following which the company had submitted a revised study protocol last week.In August 2020, US-based vaccine maker Novavax, Inc had announced a licence agreement with SII for the development and commercialisation of NVX-CoV2373, its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, in low and middle-income countries and India.

06-08-2021||Tehran||Iran welcomes India’s role in ensuring security in Afghanistan: Iranian President Raisi to EAM Jaishankar||Iran and India can play a “constructive and useful” role in ensuring security in the region, especially in Afghanistan, and Tehran welcomes New Delhi’s role in establishing stability in the war-torn country, newly-elected President Ebrahim Raisi told External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar here on Friday.During his meeting with Jaishankar, a day after he was sworn in as the Iranian president, Raisi underlined that the two countries should take new and distinct steps in the development of bilateral, regional and international relations with a new perspective.This was the second meeting between the leaders of the two nations in one month. Jaishankar had met Raisi, then president-elect, on July 7 during a stopover at the Iranian capital on his way to Russia.During Friday’s meeting, the Iranian president stressed the importance of close cooperation and coordination between the two countries in developing peace and stability in the region.“Iran and India can play a constructive and useful role in ensuring security in the region, especially Afghanistan and Tehran welcomes New Delhi’s role in the establishment of security in Afghanistan,” Raisi emphasised.Raisi’s significant comments on India’s role in Afghanistan was issued by the Iranian president’s office in a press release.“The fate of Afghanistan must be decided by the Afghans themselves, and we believe that if the Americans do not sabotage the situation, this issue will be resolved quickly,” Raisi added.Along with Russia, Iran has been playing a major role in the Afghan peace process that has witnessed a renewed momentum in the wake of the withdrawal of the US forces from Afghanistan.Jaishankar’s visit to Tehran in July coincided with Iran hosting an intra-Afghan dialogue in the country.India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested nearly USD 3 billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the war-ravaged country.India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process that is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.It has also been calling upon all sections of the political spectrum in Afghanistan to work together to meet the aspirations of all people in the country, including those from the minority communities, for a prosperous and safe future.Emphasising that Iran attached special importance to establishing extensive relations with India, Raisi said: “From today on, we should take new and distinct steps in the development of bilateral, regional and international relations with a new perspective.”                He said that the Iranian government will pursue a policy of developing relations with neighbouring countries and the region, especially India.“There are various sectors, especially in the economic and commercial fields, as well as new technologies, that we should use to promote the level of our relations,” he said.Emphasising the need for a joint programme to increase the level of Tehran-New Delhi relations, Raisi said: “By moving in the direction of a joint cooperation programme, we can take steps to bring about different conditions at the level of relations between the two countries in the interests of the two nations”.Welcoming Raisi’s speech at the swearing-in ceremony on the Iranian government’s will to develop relations with neighbouring countries, Jaishankar said: “I will convey your views to the President and Prime Minister of India, and we will try to maximise our cooperation”, the Iranian President’s Office quoted Jaishankar as saying.Jaishankar on his Twitter handle said he held a “warm meeting” with Raisi on Friday.“Conveyed the personal greetings of PM@narendramodi,” Jaishankar tweeted.Raisi, the former judiciary chief who is believed to be close to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was sworn in during a ceremony held at the Majles (Parliament) on Thursday.Raisi, 60, won a landslide victory in Iran’s presidential election in June.“His commitment to strengthening our bilateral relationship was manifest. So too was the convergence in our regional interests,” Jaishankar said, adding that he was “looking forward to working with his team.”     Iran has been a key partner for India in the strategically important Gulf region.The two sides have been jointly focussing on improving connectivity between South East Asia and Central Asia.At a connectivity conference in Tashkent last month, Jaishankar projected Iran’s Chabahar port as a key regional transit hub, including Afghanistan.Located in the Sistan-Balochistan province on energy-rich Iran’s southern coast, the Chabahar port is being developed by India, Iran and Afghanistan to boost connectivity and trade ties.The Taliban has been making rapid advances across Afghanistan by resorting to widespread violence since the US began withdrawing its troops from the country on May 1.The US has already pulled back the majority of its forces and is looking to complete the drawdown by August 31.Raisi assuming Iran’s presidency comes at a time of growing challenges for Tehran, whose economy has been crippled by US-led sanctions.There are also heightened tensions with foreign powers who have blamed Iran for a deadly drone attack on a tanker near Oman last week, which Iran has denied.

What is the purpose of filing 51 volumes? We cannot keep on reading them. We cannot hear such a matter. You want to terrorise us by filing so many volumes,” a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.The Bench, which also included Justice Surya Kant, was hearing petitions against a Bombay High Court verdict with regard to the validity of a tariff order passed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) last year.The purpose of filing 51 volumes seems to be that the judges do not read them, it noted and posted the matter for hearing on August 18 after asking the advocates in the case to file a “convenient compilation” of documents to enable the hearing to proceed.Faced with protracted arguments and written submissions running into hundreds of pages, the top court had last month sought to streamline the process by prescribing limits as to time and number of pages.”I’m left wondering, how do we dispose of an appeal pending for 10 years? How do we justify to a litigant that while suits that began 85 years ago are pending?

It will win in Tripura. There is not an iota of doubt in that.”  Even as there was stunned bewilderment among those present, the former railway minister quickly corrected himself and said “the Trinamool Congress will undoubtedly win the by-elections. BJP will be trounced. “The ‘Maa Mati Manush’ party (TMC) will remain the winner here and open its account in Tripura as well.“BJP will be nowhere in the state. They will be decimated. Mamata Banerjee will continue to helm Bengal,” he added.Roy had defected from TMC, with which he had been associated since its inception, to BJP in 2018 following differences with its supremo Mamata Banerjee and played an active role in the saffron party’s Lok Sabha win in 2019. He had returned to TMC shortly after his victory from Krishnanagar North as a BJP candidate in May this year.BJP spokesman Shamik Bhattacharya said “Mukulda has betrayed his voters in Krishnanagar North. He has lost his credibility. But he has spoken the truth.“The truth has perhaps come from his mouth as he is under tremendous mental stress,” Bhattacharya said adding BJP will continue to press for Roy’s disqualification as MLA.A TMC leader of Nadia district said: “Mukulda had inadvertently referred to BJP first which was a slip of tongue. He actually meant TMC will handsomely in the next by-poll. He also said BJP will be nowhere”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mukul-roy-commits-faux-pas-bjp-greets-it-with-glee-293971

06-08-2021||---||Ceiling of 2.5 per cent on street vendors is grossly inadequate, says Standing Committee report in LS||Shubhadeep Choudhury Tribune News Service New Delhi, August 6The Standing Committee on Urban Development (2020-21) on “Implementation of the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014”, has urged the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA) to explore the possibility of revisiting the ceiling on the number of street vendors at 2.5 per cent  of the population of the city, town, zone or ward.“The Committee consider the figure as grossly inadequate in thickly populated cities like Mumbai, Delhi”, stated the Eighth Report (17th Lok Sabha) of the Committee presented in the Lok Sabha on Friday by Jagdambika Pal, chairperson of the committee.The report noted that even after seven years of enactment of the Act, several states have not carried out vendor surveys, formed Town Vending Committees (TVC) and notified vendors’ zone/market which are essential for the implementation of the Act. The Committee, while seeking reasons for delay, recommended taking up the issue at the highest level and preventing eviction of street vendors without formation of and consultation of TVCs.While asserting that implementation of the Act will go a long way in giving the street vendors an identity, bringing them under formal financial system and enabling them to avail bank finance instead of money lenders at usurious rates, the committee recommended that a monitoring committee at the Central level may be constituted consisting of principal secretaries of the urban development departments of states/ UTs headed by the Secretary, MOHUA for monitoring the implementation of the Act.The report also stated that as the prime purpose of the Act was to prevent street vendors from exploitation at the hands of police, police forces and civic body officials should be sensitised about the Act.The committee also noted with concern that the state government of Meghalaya, having its own Street Vendors Act, was supposed to amend the state Act to conform to the Central Act or repeal the state Act and implement the Central Act in toto. However, it has not done so even after 5 years. The committee sought the latest position in this regard.The report stated that since MOHUA had stated that there was no contradiction between certain sections of the Sikkim Trade Rules, 2011 and provisions of the Central Act, the matter be taken up at the highest level in Sikkim so that street vendors of Sikkim could avail the benefits under Prime Minister Street Vendors Atma Nirbhar Nidhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ceiling-of-2-5-per-cent-on-street-vendors-is-grossly-inadequate-says-standing-committee-report-in-ls-293964

Faults allow relative movement between the blocks which may occur rapidly, in the form of an earthquake, or slowly over a period of time. The length of a fault may vary from just a few meters to several thousand kilometers.Faults can have a large influence on the mechanical behaviour, such as strength and deformation, of soil and rock masses and their assessment is critical seismic zoning and for planning construction of buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, pipelines and railroads.The project, tittled “Active fault, paleoseismic and crustal deformation in north-western and Central Himalayas: An integrated approach towards seismic hazard assessment”, was funded by the Ministry of Earth Sciences at a cost of Rs 5.54 crore. It is expected to be complete by September 2021, according to a statement made by the Ministry in the Lok Sabha today.As per the objective of the project, active faults were identified and mapped using satellite data and ground-truthing was carried out in areas like Central Kumaon Himalayas, Chandigarh-Pinjore, Ropar-Hajipur-Pathankot and Kangra.Studies and identificatiuon of faults and rock deformation in areas covering the Dehradun foothills and Central Himalayas from east of Kaladungi till west of Nepal is still under progress, according to the ministry’s statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/study-validates-five-active-seismic-fault-lines-in-north-west-india-293957

Earlier, Advocate ML Sharma had filed a petition seeking contempt action against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for allegedly violating the court’s order in appointing Asthana as Delhi Police chief.A 1984-batch IPS officer from the Gujarat cadre, Asthana was the Director General of the Border Security Force (BSF) before being appointed as Delhi Police Commissioner. Four days before his superannuation on July 31, the Appointments Committee of Cabinet appointed him as Delhi Police commissioner. He will have a one-year tenure as Delhi Police chief.The latest petition alleged that just four days before Asthana was due to superannuate on July 31, 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted him an inter-cadre transfer from his parent cadre of Gujarat to the Arunachal Pradesh, Goa Mizoram other Union Territories including Delhi Cadre and gave him an extension of service for one year and appointed him as Delhi Police Commissioner.The NGO alleged that both the orders passed by the central government and ACC on July 27 were “completely illegal“ as they violated the top court’s directions in Prakash Singh’s case (2006) on police reforms.According to the judgment, as far as practicable the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) should consider officers with two years of service for such appointments and merit and seniority should be given due weightage, Sharma had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ngo-moves-sc-against-appointment-of-rakesh-asthana-as-delhi-police-commissioner-293946

Subsequently, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath decided to construct a Toy Park in Noida and 100 acres of land was earmarked in Sector 33 of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority area to promote the industry, they said.Altogether 134 companies have so far been allotted land for setting up factories at the Toy Park and construction of their units is likely to begin soon. Those who have acquired land at the Toy Park are Fun Zoo Toys India, Fun Ride Toys LLP, Super Shoes, Ayush Toy Marketing, Sunlord Apparels, Bharat Plastics, Jai Shree Krishna, Ganpati Creations and RRS Traders, they added.According to YEIDA officials, the acquisition of land by major players in the toy industry, such as Fun Zoo Toys India and Fun Ride Toys, is highly significant as they can challenge the monopoly of Chinese toy makers.   The biggest challenge before the government, however, is that of the 4,000 micro, small and medium enterprises in the toy manufacturing business 90 per cent are in the unorganised sector. Therefore, the Chief Minister has taken the initiative to promote the toy industry.According to an estimate, India's toy industry will be worth Rs 147 billion-221 billion by 2024, given the fact that the demand for toys in India is rising at a faster pace compared to the global rate. Against the global average of the demand for toys increasing annually by five per cent, India's demand is rising by 10-15 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/134-companies-acquire-land-in-noidas-toy-park-to-invest-rs-410-crore-293929

Iram cancelled the wedding with Shahzad just hours before it was to be solemnised on Wednesday night, after the accident took place."How can I marry him? If his family is behaving this way in front of my whole family, how will they behave when I will be alone with them at their place?" asked Iram.Soon after the girl announced her decision, her family members broke the groom's car, thrashed his relatives and held them hostage for some time.The police reached the spot and brought the situation under control.An FIR was filed and the woman's uncle has been admitted to a hospital where his condition is said to be stable.Senior sub-inspector Ravindra Palawat of the Kharkhoda police station told reporters that the video footage of the ceremony is being investigated to identify those who opened the fire."An FIR has been filed against the groom, Shahzad, his brother Pappu and Sanu under section 307 (attempt to murder).

The system has failed to discharge its pious duty of protecting a hapless victim of crime,” the judge said in an order dated August 5.The motto of the Delhi Police of “Shanti, Sewa, Nayay” seems to have been belied in the instant case, Additional Sessions Judge added.Nayak was arrested in 2017 when he attacked Jharna, her brother and brother-in-law with a knife. He was released on 90-days interim bail in June 2021.However, the court cancelled the bail on July 31 after observing that he threatened the witnesses of the case and pressured them to withdraw the case.The court asked him to surrender before the jail in two days. According to the police, Nayak murdered his wife before surrendering."Nayak reached the woman's house in the Govindpuri area and strangulated her with a dupatta. He then locked the room and fled," the police said. He has been arrested in the murder case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-man-on-interim-bail-kills-wife-court-says-system-failed-to-protect-hapless-victim-of-crime-293915

But unlike others who oppose CAA, Gogoi favours NRC. NRC, updated only in Assam among all states of the country, is widely believed to be a tool to drive away the state’s Bengali-speaking Hindu and Muslim people.More than 16 lakh people, mostly Bengali-speaking Hindus and Muslims, have been excluded from NRC in Assam as they had failed to produce documents (that could be five decades old or more) to prove their citizenship. A category known as “OI” (original inhabitants) was created to ensure that a more relaxed view was taken in case an Assamese speaker failed to produce similar documents.Mamata is against the updating of NRC. During the recent Assembly elections in West Bengal she used the NRC issue in a big way to claim that if BJP came to power in the state then all those who would fail to produce documents (“like one’s grandfather’s birth certificate and so on”) would be listed as foreigners and sent to Bangladesh.“It will be difficult for Mamata and Gogoi to work out a common ground given their diametrically different stands on the issue of NRC,” Asish Choudhury, a Silchar-based political observer said.Besides Assam, the TMC is also trying to set its foot in Tripura and Kerala. TMC general secretary and Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee visited Tripura on August 2. He told reporters at Agartala that he would soon return there and announce constitution of the party’s state committee.In Kerala also, the TMC has put up hoardings at various places asking people to join the party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/national-register-of-citizens-may-keep-mamata-banerjee-and-akhil-gogoi-apart-293891

We must continue these and also stringently implement public health and social measures,” said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region.Covid vaccines are an important tool in the fight against the pandemic as they are effective, even against the variants of concern, in preventing severe disease, hospitalisation, and death.As of August 6, 618.5 million doses have been administered in the region.As many as 146 million people have received two vaccine doses and are fully vaccinated.The maximum – 489 million doses – have been administered in India, which reached 8.6 million people on day one of its reinvigorated campaign in June, the WHO said.Indonesia, which was the first in the region to launch Covid vaccination drive, has administered 71 million doses, followed by 18 million doses in Thailand.Sri Lanka has administered 13 million doses and has been consistently reaching out to 500,000 people per day with Covid vaccination, recently.Bangladesh is scaling up vaccination, and also preparing to vaccinate Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar.Bhutan has achieved coverage of 70 per 100 population with first dose and 62 per 100 population with two doses of Covid vaccine, the highest in the region so far.The Maldives has vaccinated half its population with two doses and nearly 60 per 100 coverage with one dose of vaccine.Nepal has vaccinated more than 70 per cent of its health and frontline workers and elderly population with at least one dose of the vaccine.Thailand has vaccinated 84 per cent of their health workforce.Commendable efforts are being made by the countries. With more doses available in recent weeks through Covax, all possible efforts need to be made to expand Covid vaccination coverage even further, the Regional Director said, adding that nearly 90 per cent of all vaccine doses available in the region had been utilised.Countries in the region are administering Astra Zeneca, Covaxin, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik V and Pfizer following emergency use authorisation being granted by their national regulatory authorities.“Countries in the Region are striving to achieve WHO’s goal of having 10 per cent of the population fully vaccinated by September-end, 40 per cent by the end of this year and 70 per cent by mid-2022,” the Regional Director said, adding that it is heartening to see the push for vaccination at a time when countries are also battling surge in cases.This is also the time to closely evaluate vaccination coverage data to see who is being left out, where and why. Some people may still not be aware of the benefits of Covid vaccination, some may not be convinced, and some may have concerns. There could also be issues of accessibility, she said.“We need tailored communication approach, just as we do for childhood immunisation, and work closely with communities for uptake of vaccines and successful implementation of public health and social measures,” said Dr Khetrapal Singh.Vaccines are lifesaving but on their own, they are not enough. Implementation of public health and social measures is equally important, she emphasised.“Even after taking both doses of the Covid vaccine, people must continue to wear mask, wash hands, maintain distance, avoid crowded areas. We need to ‘do it all’, especially when most people are not vaccinated and Covid is widespread. This is the only way to curtail transmission of the virus that continues to overwhelm our health systems and impact lives and livelihoods,” the Regional Director said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/half-a-billion-covid-vaccine-doses-administered-in-south-east-asia-highest-489-million-in-india-who-293887

The top court said it was surprising that the Pegasus issue came to light in 2019 and no one made any serious attempt to collect verifiable material about the snooping.On targetAn international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware.“Most PILs are based on newspaper clippings of national and international media,” it noted even as it said, “No doubt that the allegations about Pegasus are serious, if the newspaper reports are correct…Truth has to come out, that’s a different story. We don’t know whose names are there.”The CJI said, “From what I read, this came to light in 2019. There was no serious concern then. We don’t hold anybody at fault for that. The petitioners are resourceful, educated persons. We can’t say what has been said by reputed journalists is merely hearsay or not believable.”The court repeatedly asked the petitioners to explain why no FIR or criminal complaint was filed under the relevant provisions of law if they believed the allegations were true.As it wondered why a number of petitions were being filed two years after the incident came to light, senior counsel Kapil Sibal, representing noted journalist N Ram, said the petitioners came to know about the gravity later.Terming Pegasus as a “rogue technology which enters our lives without our knowledge,” Sibal said, “Journalists, public figures, constitutional authorities, court officers and academics — all are targeted. The question the government has to answer is: Who purchased it? How much was spent? Where was the hardware placed?”Senior advocates Arvind Datar, Rakesh Dwivedi, Meenakshi Arand, CU Singh and Shyam Divan — representing various petitioners — demanded an independent probe into the snooping scandal, terming it an invasion of privacy – a fundamental right declared by the court.The top court was hearing nine petitions, including those filed by the Editors Guild of India and senior journalists N Ram and others, seeking an independent probe into the alleged snooping on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO’s spyware Pegasus.Other petitioners are: advocate ML Sharma, Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas, journalists Rupesh Kumar Singh Singh and Paranjoy Guha Thakurta and others.An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware. It has also been reported that phones of a former judge of the Supreme Court and its registrars were allegedly intercepted using the spyware. The court pulled up advocate Sharma for filing the petition on the basis of newspaper clippings. “This is not the way of filing a PIL. We also read newspapers,” it said. Meanwhile, Former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha on Thursday filed a petition in the top court seeking an SIT probe into the scandal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-allegations-serious-if-true-but-why-no-fir-since-2019-asks-sc-293622

06-08-2021||Kochi||Penile sexual assault between thighs of victim held together amounts to rape: Kerala HC||The Kerala High Court has held that any manipulation of the body of a woman such as penetrative sexual act between the thighs of a victim to simulate a sensation akin to penetration of an orifice is rape.The decision came in an appeal filed by a man against a trial court verdict in a matter that involved unfortunate instances of repeated sexual assault of various degrees on a minor girl by him, who is also her neighbour.“...when the body of the victim is manipulated to hold the legs together for the purpose of simulating a sensation akin to penetration of an orifice; the offence of rape is attracted. When penetration is thus made in between the thighs so held together, it would certainly amount to “rape” as defined under Section 375,” ruled a bench of Justices K Vinod Chandran and Ziyad Rahman on Monday.The court said when penetration is thus made in between the thighs so held together, it would certainly amount to “rape” as defined under Section 375.“In short, considering the intention of the legislature as revealed from the above proposals, followed by the enactment of Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013 and gradual evolution of the concept of the offence of “rape” from time to time, the irresistible conclusion is that, the definition of rape as contained in section 375 would take in, all forms of penetrative sexual assault onto vagina, urethra, anus or any other parts of the body so manipulated to get the feeling or sensation of an orifice,” the court said.The court said this while deciding whether the penetration to “any part of the body of such woman” as mentioned in section 375© of the Indian Penal Code like sexual assaults beyond penile penetration into vagina, urethra, anus and mouth; the known orifices in the human body to which such penetration is imaginably possible is rape.“We have already found that, Section 375 as amended by Act 13 of 2013, widened the definition of “rape” by expanding its ambit beyond the penile penetrative assault into vagina.One of the consequences of such amendment is that, several penetrative sexual assaults, which would otherwise be triable under Section 377, now come within the operative field of Section 375,” the court said.However, Section 377 would still be attracted in cases of penetrative sexual assaults against the order of nature, which are not falling under Section 375, the court said.In its order, the court said it is established from the evidence that, the appellant had committed the offence of rape as he had penetrative sexual act between the thighs of the victim held together; an act of manipulation of the body of the victim to obtain sexual gratification, which culminated in ejaculation.Partly allowing the appeal, the court said as the prosecution failed to provide any evidence to prove the age of the victim, the offences under the provisions of the POCSO Act and also under section 376(2)(i) of the Indian Penal Code are not attracted.“However the sexual acts committed by the appellant is sufficient to attract the offence of section 375© read with section 376 (1) of IPC”, the court said.As he is found guilty of offence under Section 376(1) read with Section 375© instead of Sections 376(2) (i) and 377 by the Sessions Court, the sentence of life imprisonment with the meaning of imprisonment of remainder of natural life, is modified as life imprisonment, the high court said.“The sentences passed by the Sessions Court under Sections 354 and 354A(1)(i) are hereby confirmed. The sentences shall be undergone concurrently,” the court said in the order.

06-08-2021||---||Won’t be intimidated into silence, Kharge says after Parliament security officer complains against TMC MP||New Delhi, Aug 5The Congress-led opposition on Thursday said it would not be intimidated into silence on the Pegasus and farmers’ issues, and would continue to fight for their demand to discuss the two issues.After Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh said Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu was considering a complaint by Parliament’s woman security officer against a TMC member for alleged heckling and loss of property of the House after she was suspended from the day’s proceedings on Wednesday, Leader of Opposition in the House Mallikarjun Kharge said the united opposition would not budge under “attempts to crush their issues by threat, fear or pressure and would continue to fight”.Kharge questioned the suspension of six TMC MPs on Wednesday noting that “they did nothing wrong and only showed placards”.The government, however, maintained that the MPs were removed from the House for their “unruly and violent conduct”.Demanding discussion on the Pegasus and farmers’ issues, Kharge said the government had not yet reached out to the opposition and no formal notice had been sent for any meeting.Kharge cited past instances where Rule 267 discussions were allowed in Rajya Sabha and questioned why the government was escaping the Pegasus debate when several countries had ordered probes.“The disruption in Parliament is over the Pegasus issue. It’s an issue which impinges on national security and citizen freedom and privacy. Press, Army, judges have been named as potential targets. Revelations are coming out one after the other. Why is the government running away? They are saying opposition is not ready and, therefore, the discussion is not happening. Tell me whether any notice has been received from the government. Has Defence minister Rajnath Singh called a meeting? Did Parliamentary Affairs Minister call a meetinf? Has the Leader of the House called anyone? The government is saying the opposition doesn’t want to speak on farmers’ issues, inflation and people’s issues. This is not true,” Kharge said.He questioned passage of 10 bills in one hour saying there is precedence of debates under Rule 267 on several occasions—inflation on August 4, 2010, FDI on December 7, 2012, farmers’ suicide on April 22, 2013, national security on December 8, 2014, agrarian crisis on April 23, 2015, Kashmir issue on August 10, 2016, and demonetisation on November 16, 2016.“Precedent is there of discussions and yet not allowing a debate on Pegasus. No leader has come to speak to us. Informal talks do not mean anything. We suggested Rajnath Singh to call a meeting of leaders of both houses. We have not heard back,” said Kharge, accusing the government of false propaganda.Kharge said papers were torn and tossed under the UPA when Women’s reservation bill and another on reservation in promotions for SCs were piloted but “tolerance was shown”.“The BJP doesn’t even have tolerance. Suspension of six TMC members was wrong. They did nothing wrong. Placards have been used earlier also. If attempts are made to crush and muzzle our issues by targeting us, using threats, fear, pressurise, the Congress and united opposition will not budge and will keep fighting,” said Kharge.Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Bajwa, while addressing reporters, appealed to the PM to repeal farm laws.“Farmers have been sitting on borders for over eight months. Over 500 have died for the cause. The PM has said nothing about these martyrs. The PM says farm laws are for the benefit of farmers but they are not accepting the laws. The PM says his ‘Mann ki Baat’ but has he ever heard farmers’ ‘Mann ki Baat’,” Bajwa asked.Bajwa said the PM should visit Jantar Mantar and speak to the farmers at the ongoing Kisan Sansad.“These laws are death warrants of farmers. The intention is of usurping farm lands and handing them over to MNCs. The Congress will never allow this,” said Bajwa.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-be-intimidated-into-silence-kharge-says-after-parliament-security-officer-complains-against-tmc-mp-293434
06-08-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court to hear on August 10 petitions seeking SIT probe into Pegasus row||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 5The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a batch of petitions seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into Pegasus snooping controversy on August 10 as it asked the petitioners to serve copies of their respective petition on the Centre.A Bench led by CJI NV Ramana said that without the Union Government being present in the hearing it cannot proceed in the matter.During the hearing, the CJI said it was surprising that the Pegasus issue came to light in 2019 and no one made any serious attempt to collect verifiable material about snooping."Most PILs are based on newspaper clippings of national and international media," it noted even as it said, "No doubt that the allegations about Pegasus are serious if the newspaper reports are correct.""From what I read this came to light in 2019. There was no serious concern then. We don’t hold anybody at fault for that. The petitioners are resourceful, educated persons. We can’t say that what has been said by reputed journalists is merely hearsay or not believable," the Bench said.During the hearing, it repeatedly asked the petitioners why no FIR or criminal complaint was filed under the relevant provisions of law if they believed the allegations were true.The top court wondered why a number of petitions were being filed two years after the incident came to light.Kapil Sibal said the petitioners came to know about the gravity later. Senior advocates Arvind Datar, Rakesh Dwivedi and Shyam Divan - representing various petitioners - demanded an independent probe into the snooping scandal.The top court is seized of nine petitions, including those filed by the Editors Guild of India and senior journalists N Ram and others, seeking an independent probe into the alleged snooping on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO's spyware Pegasus.Other petitioners are ML Sharma, Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas, Jagdeep Chokkar, Narendra Mishra, journalist Rupesh Kumar Singh Singh, journalist Paranjoy Guha Thakurta and others.An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware. It has also been reported that phones of a former judge of the Supreme Court and its registrars were allegedly intercepted using the spyware.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-to-hear-on-august-10-petitions-seeking-sit-probe-into%C2%A0pegasus-row-293429
06-08-2021||Beijing||Quarantine wary foreigner tries to enter Indian and other diplomatic missions in Beijing||A French national, who wanted to avoid Covid quarantine after visiting medium-risk areas in China, created a commotion in the high-security diplomatic area here on Thursday when he tried to enter several embassies, including that of India, while being chased by Chinese health officials in PPE kits.After being denied entry by the French embassy in Liangma Qiao here, following an alert that he skipped quarantine rules, he tried to hop over the fences of the embassies of Malaysia, Israel and India, which were guarded by the Chinese military personnel.He was finally caught near the Indian Embassy by Chinese authorities, who briefly closed the roads to prevent him from escaping.As videos shot by bystanders went viral, the Embassy of India quickly put out a notice in Indian community social media groups, refuting rumours that someone from the mission had been picked up by Chinese officials in PPE kits.The issue had been resolved and was handled peacefully, the note said.Chinese authorities also immediately disinfected the place before leaving, it said.According to the notice, the detained foreigner was not Covid positive but had recently travelled to a medium-risk area and wanted to avoid the quarantine regime advised by his residential complex.Beijing and several Chinese cities have stepped up quarantine protocols in the last few days for people who have travelled to areas within the country which have witnessed a spike in Covid cases, especially that of the Delta variant.According to China's National Health Commission, 85 new Covid cases, including 62 locally transmitted cases, and 40 imported cases were reported on Wednesday.The locally transmitted cases were reported from Jiangsu, Hunan, Beijing, Shandong, Henan, Yunnan and Hubei, the commission said on Thursday.The total number of confirmed Covid cases on the mainland reached 93,374 by Wednesday, including 1,285 patients still receiving treatment, and 4,636 had died due to the virus which was first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.

06-08-2021||Lahore||Mob attacks temple in Pakistan's Punjab, damages idols||A mob attacked a Hindu temple in a remote town in Pakistan's Punjab province, damaging idols and burning down parts of it, prompting Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed to express "grave concern" over the incident and fix the matter before court for hearing on Friday.Police said the mob attacked the Hindu temple at Bhong city of Rahim Yar Khan district, some 590 kms from Lahore, on Wednesday in reaction to an alleged desecration of a Muslim seminary by a minor Hindu boy.The eight-year-old Hindu boy last week had allegedly urinated at a library of the seminary that caused tensions in Bhong, where Muslims and Hindus have been living peacefully for decades.A police officer said the boy was arrested last week and booked under the blasphemy laws but subsequently released on bail for being a minor."The attackers were carrying sticks, stones and bricks. They smashed the deities while raising religious slogans," District Police Officer Asad Sarfraz said.He said a part of the temple was also burnt down.Sarfraz said the law enforcement agencies have controlled the situation and managed to disperse the mob. "Rangers have been called and deployed around the Hindu temple," he said.India on Thursday summoned the Pakistani charge d'affaires in New Delhi and lodged a firm protest, expressing grave concerns at this reprehensible incident and the continued attacks on the freedom of religion of the minority communities and their places of religious worship in Pakistan.On Wednesday, ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf parliamentarian Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani posted videos of the temple attack on his Twitter wall, requesting law enforcement agencies to rush to the spot to stop its "burning and vandalising".Vankwani met Chief Justice Ahmed on Thursday and informed him about the attack on the temple.Chief Justice Ahmed "showed grave concern over the tragic incident," said a statement issued by the apex court on Thursday."Taking cognizance of the issue, the chief justice has fixed the matter before court on Friday at Islamabad with the directions to Chief Secretary of Punjab and IGP Punjab to appear along with a report on Friday," the statement said.Meanwhile, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Political Communication, Dr Shahbaz Gill, said that the PM Office had taken notice of the sad and unfortunate incident.Prime Minister Khan had directed the district administration to probe the matter and take strict action against the culprits, he said."Pakistan's Constitution provides freedom and protection to minorities to perform their worship freely," Dr Gill added.Earlier in a series of tweets, Vankwani said, "Attack on Hindu temple at Bhong City District Rahimyar Khan Punjab. Situation was tense since yesterday. Negligence by local police is very shameful. Chief Justice is requested to take action." He further said, "Strict action must be taken against those who attacked Hindu temple at Bhong. In contact with higher authorities. Situation is very critical right now." "Chief Justice is requested to take action, please. Interfaith harmony is need of time," he said.District Police Officer Sarfraz said that some 100 Hindu families are living in the area and police have been deployed there to thwart any untoward incident. He said no arrest has been made so far."Our first priority is to restore law and order and provide protection to the minority community," Sarfraz said.Another police official said the temple has been damaged badly.On Wednesday, Sarfraz said that after a social media post inciting people of Bhong to take revenge for desecration, the mob started gathering outside the temple and attacked it."We will arrest those miscreants who incited people to attack the temple," he said.In December 2020, a century-old Hindu temple was vandalised by a mob in Terri village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Karak district.The apex court, which took notice of the attack, had ordered authorities to start the reconstruction of the temple that was vandalised by the mob and instructed them to recover the money for the restoration work from the attackers, whose act has caused "international embarrassment" to the country.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province, where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by the extremists. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mob-attacks-temple-in-pakistans-punjab-damages-idols-293400
