In 2013, the search for a suitable location was given a new impetus by Channi Kaler of the ASGW, who contacted many Hindu and Sikh institutions to find a resolution.“There are more than three generations of Hindus and Sikhs settled in Wales. The first generation of our community tended to take the ashes back to their motherland. However, the later generations, either born or have lived most of their lives here, prefer to scatter the ashes of their loved ones in Wales, with respect and dignity,” explained Patel.“It has taken some time to get the platform in place due to engineering issues, as well as problems caused by the pandemic, but we now have a permanent and managed location that will be used by the current and future generations of the Sikh and Hindu communities,” a Cardiff Council spokesperson said.The new site is now expected to be accessed by British Hindus and Sikhs from across the United Kingdom, with ASGW already aware of such enquiries from different parts of the country.The Hindu Forum of Britain (HFB), an umbrella group for British Hindus, has worked on this issue over the years.“As a part of the ‘Cremation and Crematoria’ in liaison with the UK government and the Hindu community, the Hindu Forum of Britain has campaigned to improve such facilities and had a few new sites registered with the Environmental Agency for dispersion of ashes,” said HFB President Trupti Patel.The group is now working on compiling a register of all such approved sites around the UK for easier access to community groups.

02-08-2021||Bengaluru||Congolese man's alleged custodial death sparks violence in Bengaluru||A Congolese man's alleged death in police custody sparked violence in Bengaluru on Monday, leaving several policemen injured, police said.Joel Shindani Malu was arrested overnight on suspicion of possessing drugs, Bangalore Police Commissioner Kamal Pant said on Twitter.Pant said Malu complained of chest pains and was moved to a private hospital where he died.Pant said he’d ordered a CID inquiry into the incident.Later in the day, a group of foreign nationals gathered near the police station to protest against the death, Pant said.PTI quoted police as claiming Shindani, who was a student in the city, was detained for possessing 5 gm of Ecstasy pills.Six other Congolese were detained in the violence that sparked after they staged a protest in front of the police station, IANS said in its report.Reuters quoted The Hindu newspaper as saying they were members of the "Pan African Federation", a group set up to protect the rights of African students and professionals in the city. As his compatriots came to know about the incident, they gathered before the police station to protest, alleging Shindani died due to police brutality.All efforts to convince them went in vain and the police undertook a baton charge to disperse them but the protestors retaliated and in the scuffle, many policemen were injured, police claimed.Additional Commissioner of Police Soumendu Mukharjee, who rushed to the spot, said:  "Sub-Inspector Raghupathy had, on a tip-off, arrested Shindani when he came to sell drugs. The police have recovered the material and sent it for testing. One person managed to escape and another was arrested. When he was brought to the police station he did not divulge any details. He had not given any documents."Later, he developed chest pain at the police station. He was immediately shifted to nearby Chirayu hospital. Though he was treated, he died after an hour. To ascertain his identity, the police had to contact their (Congolese) association. When the documents were obtained, it was found that his visa had expired in 2015 and his passport had expired in 2017. No other document was available."  Further procedures are being conducted, as per the National Human Rights Commission's guidelines, into the incident, he said.—     Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congolese-mans-alleged-custodial-death-sparks-violence-in-bengaluru-291877
02-08-2021||Guwahati||Akhil Gogoi demands inter-state border policy by Assam||Assam Independent MLA Akhil Gogoi  Monday demanded an inter-state border policy in Assam and requested Speaker Biswajit Daimary to take initiative in this regard during the ongoing budget session.Gogoi was part of the all-party Assembly delegation led by Daimary that had visited troubled Lailapur in Cachar district, where seven persons, including six Assam Police personnel, were killed in an unprecedented deadly gunfight between police forces of the state and Mizoram.“There is an urgent need for an inter-state border policy to manage our boundaries with the neighbouring states. I request the Assembly Speaker to take the initiative in preparing the policy during the ongoing session,” Gogoi said at a press conference here.For day-to-day operations of the border areas, the policy should have a roadmap  and all developmental work should be carried out according to it, said the chief of Raijor Dal.He also demanded that the Assam government give land pattas to indigenous local people living along the border areas.“After giving land rights the Assam government should develop the area by building roads, providing water and electricity connections and constructing schools and healthcare facilities.“Unfortunately, Mizoram is giving land rights to their people after encroaching almost 7 km inside our (Assam) territory. But Assam government is evicting its own people in the name of clearing encroachment. When there will be no people, other states will obviously capture our land,” he added.Indigenous Dimasa-Burmans, Assamese Mizos, Bengali Hindus and ethnic Muslims inhabit the disputed border areas in Cachar district, Gogoi said.He also criticised the Assam government for failing to get the sympathy of other northeastern states and the rest of India even after losing seven persons during the clash.“We have seen that a sympathy wave was created in favour of Mizoram after the clash. Assam could not capitalise on the development. It is a failure of the Assam government despite BJP claiming that the state has the most powerful CM of all times in Himanta Biswa Sarma,” Gogoi said.The opposition legislator also slammed the state government for failing to ensure Centre’s timely intervention, which could have saved the lives of seven persons.“Our CM Himanta Biswa Sarma surrendered to the Centre. He even said that Assam would leave its land up to Nalbari in lower Assam, including Guwahati, to Mizoram if the Centre enacts a law. This is shocking!” he added.Gogoi also said that seven CRPF camps were set up on the Assam side and three in Mizoram area after the clash.  “This means more areas in Assam are disputed land and we will lose more land,” he said.At least six Assam Police personnel and one civilian were killed while defending the “constitutional boundary” of the state with Mizoram and more than 50 people were injured, including Cachar SP, as the festering border dispute between the two northeastern states erupted into a bloody conflict on July 26. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/akhil-gogoi-demands-inter-state-border-policy-by-assam-291873

She went to the village and was shocked to find the decomposed carcasses of the dogs in a shallow pit on its outskirts.“The killings took place on July 24 and I got information on July 29. I went to the village and saw the decomposed bodies buried in a pit near the pond. Initially, the local police were not willing to file a case under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,” she said.According to Sri Latha, the village panchayat officials had roped in members of a local dog-catcher community, to kill the animals. “The dogs could have easily been sterilised instead of murdering them,” she contends.A case has been registered at on the basis of her complaint at the Dharmajigudem police station, under section 429 of IPC and Section 11(l) of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, a police official said.Meanwhile, the BJP’s national Secretary and co-in charge for Andhra Pradesh, Sunil Deodhar, demanded action against the perpetrators of the brutal act.“Shocking! As result of patronising evils, 300 innocent stray dogs were poisoned & dumped in pits in Lingapalem, Andra Pradesh #AnimalLovers & any sensible human should not let these barbaric killers go unpunished. CM @ysjagan must bring out those guiltily to justice,” he said in a tweet. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/300-stray-dogs-poisoned-in-andhra-village-activists-fume-291870

02-08-2021||New Delhi||Abuse of ‘dead’ Section 66A: SC issues notice to states, UTs on PUCL's plea||As police continue to book people under Section 66A of the Information Technology Act which was declared unconstitutional by it in 2015, the Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to all states, union territories, and registrar generals of high courts on a petition filed by PUCL highlighting the problem."Police is a state subject. We will issue notice and pass comprehensive orders. This can’t continue," a Bench led by Justice Nariman said, listing the matter for further hearing after four weeks.The order came after the Centre submitted that after Section 66A was declared unconstitutional, it was for the states to ensure that cases were not filed under the provision.On behalf of petitioner People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), senior advocate Sanjay Parikh said there are two aspects: the police and the judiciary."We have given detailed suggestions. The Centre has issued directions to the state DGPs. Instructions also need to go to the judiciary," Parikh submitted.Acting on a PIL filed by Shreya Singhal, the Supreme Court had on March 24 declared unconstitutional Section 66A of IT Act, which gave sweeping powers to the police to arrest people for posting “annoying” or “offensive” comments online. The provision prescribed a maximum three-year imprisonment for posting offensive and annoying messages on computer-like devices.The Supreme Court had on July 5 expressed shock and surprise at police invoking Section 66A of the Information Technology Act which was declared unconstitutional by it more than six years ago. “Don't you think this is amazing and shocking? Shreya Singhal judgement is of 2015... It's really shocking. What’s going on is terrible," the Bench had told Parikh. Parikh had pointed out that despite express directions issued by the court in 2019 that all state governments should sensitise police personnel about the judgement, thousands of cases had been registered under the scrapped provision.The court had passed certain directions on in February 2019 to ensure that the dead provision wasn’t misused against people. It had directed that copies of the judgment of this Court in Shreya Singhal should remain available with every High Court as well as all the District Courts and that the police departments in the entire country i.e. all states and UTs be sensitized about the said judgment, the facts mentioned above show that not only the investigations under Section 66A by the police are continuing but even in the trial courts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abuse-of-dead-section-66a-sc-issues-notice-to-states-uts-on-pucls-plea-291866

02-08-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Former Union Minister Babul Supriyo to remain MP||Singer-politician Babul Supriyo said he would remain a Member of Parliament, although he would “withdraw from politics beyond the constitutional post”.Supriyo, a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Asansol in West Bengal, said he would continue to serve in his public capacity as an MP but would not refrain from politics beyond that. He also repeated that he would quit his official residence.Supriyo's statements came after a meeting with Bharatiya Janata Party’s national president JP Nadda on Monday.“There are several MPs who aren’t part of active politics,” he told the press. “I spoke to Naddaji and told him about my decision to withdraw from active politics. I told him that I’ve already taken this decision and intend to stand by it,” he told the press.“I say it again: I will fulfil my duties as MP without indulging in active politics. Several developmental projects are currently in progress in Asansol out of my MPLAD funds. I will continue to do everything that’s expected of an MP.”   His decision will be a big reprieve to the BJP as it would not have liked to be forced to contest a bypoll against the Trinamool Congress, which is upbeat after handing a comprehensive defeat to the saffron party in the recent West Bengal assembly polls. The development comes a few days after Supriyo (50) announced his decision to quit active politics. Supriyo, who has served as a Union minister for the Narendra Modi government, was removed earlier this month in a major cabinet rejig."Leaving, Goodbye. I spoke to my parents, wife, friends, and after listening to the advice, I am saying that I am leaving. I am not going to any other party - TMC, Congress, CPIM, nowhere. I am confirming that nobody has called me. "I am going nowhere. I am a one-team player! I have always supported one team, #MohunBagan - Have been with only one party - BJP West Bengal. That's it!! Leaving," Supriyo said in the first Facebook post.The singer-turned-politician said that he will vacate his government accommodation within a month."I have stayed for too long. I have helped somebody, have disappointed someone...it is for the people to decide. If you want to do social work, you can do it without being in politics. Yes, I am resigning from the post of MP," his post read.He indicated that differences with the state leadership could be one of the reasons behind his decision.Supriyo had unsuccessfully contested assembly polls against Trinamool Congress party's Aroop Biswas in the March-April assembly elections.— With PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-union-minister-babul-supriyo-to-remain-mp-291863
02-08-2021||New Delhi||Kisan Sansad passes resolution against Electricity Amendment Bill||Agitating farmers’ ‘Kisan Sansad’ on Monday passed a resolution against the ‘Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 or 2021’ and demanded that it should be withdrawn immediately.The parallel ‘Parliament session” also “directed” the Government “not to table this Bill or any other Bill containing similar provisions in this or subsequent sessions of the Parliament”. “Electricity being a basic resource for rural production and processing including by farmers, cottage industries, for health, education, and other civic services, the policy should be to provide free, high quality, regular supply of electricity, to enable rural people and farmers to benefit from the same,” it said, following deliberations on the policy directions and perspectives driving the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020, and the specific provisions of the Bill.A statement issued by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha read: “Whereas Electricity Amendment Bill 2021 has not been put out into the public domain by the Government and having received an assurance from the Government delegation on 30th December 2020 that the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 will be withdrawn as per the demands put forth by our farmers’ movement led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the House notes with shock and dismay that the Government has reneged on its promise of not tabling this or similar Bill whereas such a Bill is listed for Business in the monsoon session”.“Electricity as a form of energy is a national resource and should be seen as a basic entitlement of all especially the poor and marginalised. The Bill will impact tariff on all activities in rural areas by farmers, whether it is shops or dairy farming or flour grinders or other small enterprises, as they would get exposed to commercial charges,” the statement said.“Such privatisation would make electricity—which is a basic service that should be accessible to all citizens—costlier for ordinary consumers, and that the quality of supply to rural areas and for agricultural sector could become worse with the reforms embedded in the Amendment Bill.”“Farmers will end up paying large bills or face disconnection by the DISCOMS, and that in the new regime, delays, and arrears will be run up against farmers and other ordinary consumers; and all of this will be a death knell to crores of farmers who are dependent on groundwater for irrigation,” the statement said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kisan-sansad-passes-resolution-against-electricity-amendment-bill-291858
02-08-2021||New Delhi||India, China agree to resolve remaining issues in eastern Ladakh expeditiously||The Indian and Chinese armies on Monday described as “constructive” the 12th round of military talks on the eastern Ladakh row during which they agreed to resolve the pending issues in an “expeditious” manner, even as no concrete outcome came out of the negotiations on the much-anticipated disengagement process in the remaining friction points.A joint statement released here by the Indian Army, two days after the talks, said the two sides had a “candid and in-depth exchange” of views relating to the disengagement and that the meeting further enhanced mutual understanding.People familiar with the talks said some forward movement was made on the disengagement in the friction points of Hot Springs and Gogra and both sides will discuss about a detailed plan on it in the next round of talks.The joint statement said the two sides agreed to resolve the remaining issues in an expeditious manner in accordance with the existing agreements and protocols and maintain the momentum of dialogue and negotiations.Top commanders of the Indian and Chinese armies held a nine-hour meeting on Saturday with a focus on the disengagement process in remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh.“The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolution of remaining areas related to disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Western Sector of India-China border areas,” the statement said.“The two sides noted that this round of meeting was constructive, which further enhanced mutual understanding. They agreed to resolve these remaining issues in an expeditious manner in accordance with the existing agreements and protocols and maintain the momentum of dialogue and negotiations,” it said.The government usually refers to the eastern Ladakh region as Western Sector.The two sides also agreed that in the interim they will continue their effective efforts in ensuring stability along the LAC in the Western Sector and jointly maintain peace and tranquillity, the statement said.During the talks on Saturday, India insisted on resolving outstanding issues in Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.Ahead of the talks, sources in the military establishment had said that India was hopeful of a positive outcome on the disengagement process.India has been insisting that the resolution of the outstanding issues, including at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra, is essential for the overall ties between the two countries.The latest round of the meeting was held following talks between foreign minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Dushanbe on July 14 on the sidelines of a conclave of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).During the meeting, Jaishankar had told Wang that any unilateral change in the status quo along the LAC was “not acceptable” to India and that the overall ties can only develop after full restoration of peace and tranquillity in eastern Ladakh.The two sides had also held diplomatic talks under the framework of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) on June 25.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the sensitive sector.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February in line with an agreement on disengagement.

02-08-2021||Pune||Shops can remain open till 8 pm in low-positivity districts in Maharashtra: CM||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said his government will issue orders on Monday allowing shops to remain open till 8 pm in the districts where the Covid-19 positivity rate is low.He also said that allowing all segments of society in Mumbai local trains would be difficult “in the first phase” as the easing of curbs is being done slowly.Speaking to reporters in Sangli, some 230 kilometres from here, Thackeray, however, appealed for cooperation from people in those areas where relaxing the norms was not possible currently due to the caseload.“As far as giving relaxation is concerned, the state government is issuing an order today allowing shops to remain open till 8 pm (where positivity rate is low). However, where the number of cases is still not coming down, restrictions will remain the same,” he said.Many traders in the state and the opposition BJP have been demanding that the timings of shops be extended till 8 pm from the current deadline of 4 pm.Thackeray said the Covid-19 situation in all such districts, including Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg, was a cause of worry.“I have asked district collectors to increase the number of tests as well as doctors to ensure people are protected for Covid-19 as well as water-borne diseases,” he said.Speaking on the issue of medical oxygen, the CM said that as per an estimate, the amount of LMO required in a possible third wave might be double of what was needed in the second wave, when Maharashtra had to procure it from other states.Queried about allowing all segments of society in local trains in Mumbai, he said deciding on it “in the first phase” would be difficult as “what we are doing is giving relaxations slowly and going ahead by analysing the effects and side-effects of it”.He appealed to the private sector to split office timings to reduce the attendance in their premises at any one point of time, as well as opt for work from home and work in office turn by turn.He also asked the manufacturing sector and other business units to create bio-bubble for employees. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shops-can-remain-open-till-8-pm-in-low-positivity-districts-in-maharashtra-cm-291856
02-08-2021||Patna||Bihar CM Nitish Kumar favours inquiry into Pegasus controversy||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday favoured a thorough inquiry into allegations of phone tapping with the help of Pegasus spyware which has led to a logjam in Parliament.Kumar, whose JD(U) is an ally of the BJP at the Centre as well as in the state, however, qualified his statement with the remark “I know of this controversy only from whatever I have read about it in the newspapers”.“It is a known fact that modern technology can be put to sinister uses. If there have been any attempts to intercept people’s telephonic conversations, it would be better to get the matter probed for suitable action”, he told reporters here on the sidelines of his weekly public interaction programme.Asked about the opposition’s demand that the matter be probed by a Joint Parliamentary Committee, Kumar, who has been a former Union minister himself, said “I cannot comment on what is taking place on the floor of the Parliament”.“But those who have any concrete information with regard to such alleged snooping, must share the same with the government. I am sure the issue will be squarely addressed”, he added.Opposition parties have been aggressively protesting over Pegasus snooping case in Lok Sabha as well as in Rajya Sabha, crippling functioning of both houses of Parliament. Responding bashfully to his party colleague Upendra Kushwaha’s statement that the Bihar Chief Minister was a “Prime Minister material”, Kumar – who was at one point seen as a “secular alternative” to the Narendra Modi juggernaut – said “I have no such aspirations. I wish to serve Bihar for as long as I can”.Kumar expressed surprise when his attention was drawn towards a remark by his cabinet colleague and BJP leader Samrat Chaudhary who had complained about “compulsions of coalition politics” and “our voice is not being heard”.“He never expressed such sentiments at meetings or even during the recent assembly session. In any case, our coalition has been running smoothly for decades. He may enquire from his seniors in his own party”, said the JD(U) leader, who has been a BJP ally since the mid 1990s except for a 2013-17 hiatus.He also rejected the possibility of his recent meeting, at New Delhi, with former Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala leading to apprehensions in the BJP camp.“We share a very old relationship which goes beyond the political. We were in the same party at one point of time”, Kumar said referring to Chautala’s Indian National Lok Dal having been a splinter group of the erstwhile Janata Dal.A splinter group of the INLD headed by Chautala’s estranged grandson Dushyant Chautala is currently sharing power with the BJP in Haryana.

02-08-2021||New Delhi||For ‘public order’ to be disturbed, ‘public disorder’ must, says SC; quashes Telangana detention order||The Supreme Court on Monday quashed Telangana government’s detention order against a man, booked in several criminal cases related to fraud and forgery, saying that for ‘public order’ to be disturbed, “there must in turn be public disorder”, affecting the society at large.A close reading of the detention order, under the Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act (TPDAA), makes it clear that it was issued not on any apprehension of widespread public harm, danger or alarm but only because the detenu was successful in obtaining anticipatory bail/bail from the Courts in each of the five FIRs against him, the apex court said.A bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai allowed the appeal against the Telangana High Court order dismissing the plea filed by a woman challenging the detention order passed against her husband under the TPDAA.Multiple FIRs were lodged against her husband for cheating, fraud and criminal breach of trust but he had been successful in getting anticipatory bail/bail in all the cases against him.“We, therefore, quash the detention order on this ground. Consequently, it is unnecessary to go into any of the other grounds argued by the learned counsel on behalf of the Petitioner. The impugned judgment is set aside and the Detenu is ordered to be freed forthwith. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed,” the bench said.It said that in the facts of this case, it is clear that at the highest, a possible apprehension of breach of law and order can be said to be made out if it is apprehended that the detenu, if set free, will continue to cheat gullible persons. The bench said, “There can be no doubt that for ‘public order’ to be disturbed, there must in turn be public disorder. Mere contravention of law such as indulging in cheating or criminal breach of trust certainly affects ‘law and order’ but before it can be said to affect ‘public order’, it must affect the community or the public at large”.It said that this may be a good ground for the state to appeal against the bail orders granted and/or to cancel bail but “certainly cannot provide the springboard to move under a preventive detention statute”.The bench, while referring to earlier verdicts of the court in Madhu Limaye case of 1970, on the interpretation of ‘public order’ said that “to tear these observations out of context would be fraught with great danger when it comes to the liberty of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India”. “When a person is preventively detained, it is Article 21 and 22 that are attracted and not Article 19. Further, preventive detention must fall within the four corners of Article 21 read with Article 22 and the statute in question,” the bench said.The top court said that to therefore argue that a liberal meaning must be given to the expression ‘public order’ in the context of a preventive detention statute is wholly inapposite and incorrect.“On the contrary, considering that preventive detention is a necessary evil only to prevent public disorder, the Court must ensure that the facts brought before it directly and inevitably lead to a harm, danger or alarm or feeling of insecurity among the general public or any section thereof at large,” it said.It said that while it cannot seriously be disputed that the detenu may be a “white collar offender” as defined under provisions of TPDAA, yet a preventive detention order can only be passed if his activities adversely affect or are likely to adversely affect the maintenance of public order.The bench noted that a public order as defined under the Act is to be a harm, danger or alarm or a feeling of insecurity among the general public or any section thereof or a grave widespread danger to life or public health.“There can be no doubt that what is alleged in the five FIRs pertain to the realm of ‘law and order’ in that various acts of cheating are ascribed to the detenu which are punishable under the three sections of the Indian Penal Code set out in the five FIRs,” it said.The bench said that if a person is granted anticipatory bail/bail wrongly, there are well-known remedies in the ordinary law to take care of the situation and the state can always appeal against the bail order granted and/or apply for cancellation of bail.It said that in the facts of present case the main ingredients like harm, danger or alarm or feeling of security among the general public spoken of in the Act are “totally absent” and the real reason being that the man was successful in obtaining anticipatory bail/bail orders in the cases lodged against him.The detention order was issued against the man under the provisions of the TPDAA dated September 28, 2020 and it referred to five FIRs that have been filed against the detenu, under sections of forgery, fraud and criminal breach of trust.The top court said the facts contained in the FIRs are similar in nature and range from October, 2017 to December, 2019.

The AAHL will continue to adhere to all the guidelines laid out by the government in the interest of the aviation community at large,” the statement said. The Adani Group last month said it has taken over the management of Mumbai international airport from the GVK group.Mumbai International Airport is the country’s second busiest airport (after Delhi’s IGIA) by both passenger and cargo traffic.With the addition of Mumbai International Airport Limited, the Adani Airport Holdings Limited (AAHL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Adani Enterprises Ltd, will now control 33 per cent of India’s air cargo traffic, the company had said in a statement.

02-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC reserves order on Raj Kundra's plea against arrest in porn films case||The Bombay High Court on Monday reserved its order on petitions filed by businessman Raj Kundra and his associate Ryan Thorpe challenging their arrest in a case related to alleged creation and streaming of pornographic content through apps.The police in the HC argued that Kundra was not cooperating with the probe in the case, filed in February this year by the Mumbai crime branch,  and had destroyed evidence, a claim refuted by his lawyer. Kundra (45), the husband of Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty, and Thorpe, in their applications, have termed their arrest as illegal, contending mandatory provision of issuing notices to them under section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was not followed. The duo, in their pleas, sought the HC to direct for their immediate release and quash two orders passed by a magistrate after their arrest remanding them in police custody. As per section 41A, the police may, in cases where an arrest is not warranted, issue summons to the accused person and record his or her statement.While Kundra was arrested by the crime branch on July 19, Thorpe, who was employed as the IT head in Kundra's firm, was arrested on July 20. The duo is now in jail under judicial custody. Public prosecutor Aruna Kamat Pai on Monday told a single bench of Justice A S Gadkari that notices under section 41A were indeed issued to both Kundra and Thorpe before their arrest.“Kundra refused to accept it while Thorpe accepted it,” Pai said. She argued that the accused (Kundra and Thorpe) were arrested due to their conduct during the searches being carried out by the police at their office premises on July 19.“They (Kundra and Thorpe) were found deleting certain WhatsApp chats. The attitude of the applicant Raj Kundra speaks volumes of his cooperation in the investigation. We do not know how much data has been deleted. The police are still trying to retrieve it,” Pai said.She further told the court that section 201 of the IPC (destruction of evidence) was subsequently invoked against the accused persons. “If accused persons are destroying evidence, then can the investigating agency be a mute spectator?” Pai asked. “Kundra is the admin of the app HotShots (which is at the centre of the alleged porn racket). During searches, the police seized a laptop from the office of Kundra in which 68 porn videos were recovered. This is in addition to the 51 videos recovered earlier from the Storage Area Network,” Pai said. She further argued that from Kundra's laptop, the police have recovered scripts with sexual content and a presentation on the financial projection and marketing strategy of HotShots and another similar app BollyFame. Kundra's counsel Aabad Ponda refuted the police's allegations and said all his devices, including his phone and laptops, were seized by the police during the search. Thorpe's counsel Abhinav Chandrachud argued that while a notice under 41A was issued to Thorpe, he was not given time to comply or respond to it.  “Before Thorpe could act on the notice, he was arrested,” he said. Chandrachud further said there were several discrepancies, which cast a doubt on the prosecution's case.After the lawyers concluded their arguments, the HC reserved its order on the petitions.Kundra, in his plea in the HC, has also said the material which the police claimed to be pornographic did not depict explicit sexual acts but shows material in the form of short movies "which are lascivious or appeal to the prurient interest of persons at best".In a related development, a sessions court on Monday reserved its order on an anticipatory bail application filed by Kundra, seeking pre-arrest bail in a similar case related to porn content registered by the Mumbai police last year.The sessions court will pass its order on the pre-arrest bail plea on August 7. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bombay-hc-reserves-order-on-raj-kundras-plea-against-arrest-in-porn-films-case-291831
02-08-2021||New Delhi||Minorities have to be treated as “weaker sections”: NCM to SC||The National Commission for Minorities (NCM) has told the Supreme Court that minorities have to be treated as the “weaker sections” in the country, where majority community is so “predominant".     The NCM said despite the safeguards provided in the Constitution and the laws in force there persist amongst the minorities a feeling of inequality and discrimination.“In a country like India where the majority community is predominant, the minorities have to be treated as the weaker sections within the meaning of Article 46,” the NCM said in an affidavit.In 40-page affidavit, it stated that “numerically smaller or weaker classes are bound to be suppressed and overpowered by the dominant majority groups” if special provisions and schemes were not framed by the government.The submission was made in an affidavit filed in response to a petition which said welfare schemes cannot be based on religion.Article 46 states that "The State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation". The NCM also contended that it was founded with the objective to integrate minorities into the mainstream to improve their social and economic status. It also clarified that it does not administer any scheme nor provides grants to any community and in fact it is the government that runs schemes for them.Earlier, the Centre had told the top court that welfare schemes for religious minority communities are “legally valid” which aims to reduce the inequalities and does not violate the rights of members of Hindus or other communities."It is submitted that the schemes being implemented by the Ministry are to reduce the inequalities among the minority communities and to improve the level of education, participation in employment, skill and entrepreneurship development, reducing deficiencies in civic amenities or infrastructure. "The schemes are not in contradiction to the principles of equality as enshrined in the Constitution. These schemes are legally valid as they are only enabling provisions so as to achieve inclusiveness and do not suffer from any infirmity. The support given to disadvantaged/ underprivileged children /candidates of minorities communities through these schemes cannot, therefore, be faulted with," the affidavit had stated.The Centre had said the welfare schemes are meant only for the economically weaker sections/underprivileged, children/candidates/women of the minority communities and not for everyone belonging to a minority community. In addition, the scholarship scheme, coaching schemes, etc. have academic merit, as well as earmarking for girl students, it added.The petition, filed by Neeraj Shankar Saxena and five others, had said the petitioners are being unconstitutionally deprived of benefits available to similarly situated members of religious minorities in violation of their fundamental right.“The petitioners and other members of Hindu community are suffering because they have been born in majority community. The State cannot promote or give any benefit to any religious community whether minority or majority keeping in view the secular ethos embedded in the Constitution of India,” the petition said.The petitioners contended that by giving such “undue advantage”, the Centre is treating the Muslim community above law and the Constitution since no such benefits are given to the institutions of Hindu community.It has also sought the scrapping of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, as there is already a Backward Classes Commission to find out the conditions of the backward classes that need aid. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/minorities-have-to-be-treated-as-weaker-sections-ncm-to-sc-291828

The breakfast meeting is scheduled to be held at Constitution Club tomorrow.Sources said the aim is to forge a united opposition strategy on Pegasus spyware issue and other principal issues in both houses with the government unwilling to concede a debate.The government today offered a discussion on Pegasus under rule 193 in the Lok Sabha business advisory committee but the opposition declined.Likewise in Rajya Sabha the government offered the opposition to seek clarifications on IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw’s statement on Pegasus but the united like-minded parties said no.The opposition has demanded a structured debate on Pegasus in both houses under rules that entail voting and suspension of entire business to discuss the issue.The opposition has also asked the government to convene an all party meeting under the chairmanship of defence minister Rajnath Singh to find a way out.Rajnath Singh heads the cabinet committee on parliamentary affairs. The government has not yet responded to the opposition demand for debate on Pegasus and has sufficed to term the entire issue fabricated.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi again said today that the opposition was free to get clarifications on Vaishnaw’s statement that clarifies matters. Both Houses of Parliament remained dysfunctional for the 11th day today.The 19 sitting monsoon session ends on August 13 with complete washout on the cards.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-row-rahul-to-host-oppn-mps-leaders-for-breakfast-tomorrow-291810
02-08-2021||New Delhi||SC dismisses plea of rape survivor from Kerala to marry her assaulter, a defrocked priest||The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed the plea of a rape survivor from Kottiyoor, Kerala, who moved the Supreme Court seeking permission to marry her assaulter—a defrocked priest who is undergoing 20-year imprisonment.The top court also dismissed a separate plea of the defrocked priest seeking bail on the ground that he wanted to marry the survivor, who was a minor at the time of rape had given birth to a child.A Bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari told the former priest, “The High Court has taken a decision consciously and we would not like to interfere with its finding”.It told the victim that she may knock on the door of trial court with her plea to marry the former priest.                During the hearing, advocate Amit George, appearing for the former priest, said the High Court had passed sweeping directions in the case with regard to the marriage, which is a fundamental right.The Bench asked George what is the age of the victim and the former priest to which he replied that his client is 49, while the rape survivor is around 25.The top court then told George, “You yourself have invited sweeping directions from the High Court and it would not like to interfere.”           At the outset, senior advocate Kiran Suri, appearing for the woman, said that she has sought interim bail for the accused for two months, so that he can marry her and give some legitimacy to the four-year-old child.The Bench said that both the victim and the former priest can take recourse of whatever remedy is available under law.The woman, who was a minor when she was raped and later given birth to the child, has also sought that the former priest be released on bail. Robin Vadakkumcherry, who had initially tried to frame the woman’s biological father, was found guilty by a POCSO court in 2019 after she turned hostile as she claimed that they had a consensual relationship.On February 16, the Kerala High Court dismissed the plea of the former priest seeking bail to marry the survivor saying that it has no merit.The high court had said in its order that the trial court’s finding that the survivor was a minor at the time of rape is still in force and an appeal against the conviction of the accused is still pending before it.It had said that allowing the parties to get married while the trial court’s finding is intact would mean granting judicial approval to the marriage.On July 13, 2018, the top court had termed as “very serious” the charges in Kottiyoor rape case involving the minor and the then Catholic priest.It had refused to stay the trial of the case.Besides Vadakkumcherry, police had then booked two doctors and a hospital administrator under the provisions of POCSO Act for allegedly covering up the crime, not reporting it to the police after they had come in contact with the minor rape victim and destroying of evidences.The victim had given birth to the child at their hospital and was under their care.

Hence, I know the earlier UP very well. There was an atmosphere of fear in western UP because of which people were leaving the area, women felt unsafe, the land mafia was grabbing the land of the poor people, incidents of firing in broad daylight and riots were rampant,” Shah said“In 2017, the BJP promised that we will make UP a developed state and also revamp its law and order. Today in 2021, I can say with pride that Yogi Adityanath and his team have taken UP to the top spot in terms of law and order,” he added.Shah said, “The BJP governments do not work on the basis of caste, families, or for the people who are close to them. The BJP governments work for the development of the poorest person and to revamp law and order.”Adityanath along with Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma were present at the event.Terming the CM as “yashasvi” (glorious) and “safal” (successful), Shah credited him for effectively implementing development and welfare schemes in the state.“Today, in 44 development schemes, UP is on the top spot in the country. Making schemes is very easy, but implementing them, removing the intermediaries, and ensuring the benefits reach the beneficiaries without any bribe is very tough,” he added.“UP has made developments in every sector — be it industrial investment, successful implementation of schemes, law and order, loan waiver and purchasing crops of poor farmers, sending money directly to the account of farmers, making toilets in houses, giving homes to the homeless, giving gas cylinders to 1.47 crore households among others,” Shah said.Carrying forward Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to IPS probationers to work for changing the “negative image” of police, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said, “The police force is defamed due to either ‘no action’ or ‘extreme action’ and therefore suggested them to go for ‘just action’”.“Today policing is not confined to what was imagined 20 years ago, be it counterfeit notes, narcotics, narco-terror, cyber crime or cow smuggling. The day is not far when every district in UP will have a mobile forensic van, and there will be regional FSLs (forensic sciences laboratories),” the minister noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttar-pradesh-cm-yogi-adityanath-gets-pat-on-back-from-home-minister-for-law-order-291629

02-08-2021||New Delhi||Masood Azhar living in posh locality in Pakistan’s Bahawalpur as state guest: News channel||Pakistan has ensured that India’s most wanted terrorist Masood Azhar, who has been charge-sheeted in several cases from the 2001 Parliament attack to the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing, remains in a densely populated area so that an operation similar to the one by the US against Osama bin Laden is not possible, according to a report by a newly launched Hindi news channel.According to Times Now Navbharat channel, it has “accessed undeniable visual evidence” that confirms Pakistan’s “deep state is still providing a safe haven to terror masterminds” including Masood Azhar, who heads Jaish-e- Mohammed terror group.The news channel said in a release that Masood has two houses in Pakistan’s Bahawalpur with one located right next to the Osman-O-Ali Masjid and the National Orthopedic and General Hospital.Pakistani army jawans have been stationed outside his house to secure their prized asset, the release said, adding the motive is simple - with a mosque and hospital next to his house “an Osama-like operation becomes virtually impossible” while the residential surroundings will give Masood and his friends an opportunity to escape in case of a strike.The second house of Masood is also located in Bahawalpur, nearly 4 km away from the first.It also lies next to a mosque known as Jamia Mosque and the Bahawalpur bench of the Lahore High Court is just a km away from Masood’s second home, while the District Collector’s office is just at a distance of 3 km.Again, the channel said, Pakistani army personnel in uniform were seen guarding Masood’s bungalow and added that the “global terrorist resides in a posh locality of Pakistan as a state guest.”Azhar is wanted in the Parliament attack case, terror strike at Pathankot airbase and even in the 2019 case of a suicide attacker of the terror outfit killing 40 CRPF personnel in South Kashmir.He was among the three terrorists released by Indian authorities after the 1999 Kandahar hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane. He went to Pakistan and started his new terror outfit by the name of Jaish-e-Mohammed. India has been trying for sanctions against him at the United Nations but the same has been obstructed by China.After the Abbottabad incident in 2011 when the US Seals killed Al Qaeda terror mastermind Osama bin Laden, Pakistan seems to have ensured that Masood’s hideout remains in a densely populated area to avoid suspicion and a possible raid.The report is aimed at showing how Pakistan continues to shelter, secure and safeguard terrorists and use terror as a state policy.India has submitted dossiers after dossiers to Islamabad to bring the terrorists to book but to no avail.

02-08-2021||New Delhi||Stalemate in Rajya Sabha affects its productivity; Opposition draws the battleline||Two weeks of stalemate between the Opposition parties and the government in Rajya Sabha over Pegasus controversy has paralysed the functioning and productivity of the House.The abysmally low productivity calls in question the parliamentary ethics and pragmatism in the context of huge amount of taxpayers’ money going down the drain along with psychological resources and sap of the country limping back to normalcy after the nightmare of lockdowns and shutdowns due to Covid pandemic.Sample the data collated by the Rajya Sabha’s Secretariat regarding productivity of the House in the first two weeks, ending Friday, of the current Monsoon Session.The productivity fell to 13.70 per cent during the second week from 32.20 per cent during the first week, resulting in an overall productivity of 21.60 per cent for the first two weeks.Of the total 50 working hours available, 39 hours 52 minutes have been lost due to disruptions.The House sat for 1 hour 12 minutes beyond the scheduled time, but for which the productivity would have been much lower. During the nine sittings of these first two weeks, the Rajya Sabha could have only 1 hour 38 minutes of Question Hour which is primarily meant for ensuring the accountability of the executive to the Parliament.A paltry 1 hour 24 minutes was used for legislative business in which only four Bills were passed with only seven members intervening.There was total of about one minute of Zero Hour and another four minutes on Special Mentions.Covid-19 related issues were discussed for 4 hours 37 minutes during the first week.During the first two weeks, 130 Zero Hour Submissions and 87 Special Mentions, through which the members raise issues of public importance, could not be taken though they were admitted by House Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu.Union Labour and Employment Ministry directed UT Administrations of J&K and Ladakh Bills passed so far are The Marine Aids to Navigation Bill, 2021; The Juvenile Justice Amendment Bill, 2021; The Factoring Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and The Coconut Development Board (Amendment) Bill, 2021. The Limited Liability Partnership (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 were among the four Bills introduced in the Rajya Sabha. The disruptions of the House continued with vengeance by the Opposition Benches in spite of appeal by House Chairman Venkaiah Naidu to political parties during Business Advisory Committee (BAC) to maintain discipline and decorum and smooth functioning of proceedings.The Opposition members have drawn the battleline: Nothing less than a full-fledged debate on Pegasus issue. The government’s counterpoint is that it is willing but not with conditions imposed by them.The general feeling is that while the Benches seem to have attached a catch net to their innovative protests, including blowing a whistle in the House, they have walked straight into a rabbit hole dug by the government embattled by alleged bleak job growth, handling of second wave of Covid and country’s preparedness against projected third wave, inflations, border and farmers’ issue, etc.It suits the government just as well if the issues remained blind spots in the House, especially with the upcoming Assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stalemate-in-rajya-sabha-affects-its-productivity-opposition-draws-the-battleline-291375

He suggested to me that we should look into it,” he told reporters.Chuango said that he will discuss the matter with police officials concerned and remove the name of the Assam Chief Minister if there is no legal validity to substantiate the allegations against him.“I will hold discussion with the police officer who filed the FIR, and if there is no legal fit, we would like to remove the name of Assam chief minister from the FIR,” he said, adding that he was unaware of the development when the criminal case was filed against Sarma.The Chief Secretary, however, did not mention whether the cases filed against six Assam officials and 200 unidentified police personnel will be withdrawn.The Mizoram Police booked Sarma, four senior Assam Police officers and two officials on different charges, including ‘attempt to murder’, ‘criminal conspiracy’ and ‘assault’.The FIR was registered at the Vairengte police station by its officer-in-charge Lalchawimawia on July 26 soon after the violent clash with the Assam Police.At least seven people from Assam, including six police personnel, were killed in the violence amid the border dispute between the two Northeastern states.The four senior Assam Police officers named in the FIR are Inspector General of Police (IGP) Anurag Aggarwal, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Cachar Devojyoti Mukherjee, Cachar’s Superintendent of Police Cahndrakant Nimbalkar, and Officer-In-Charge of Dholai Police Station Sahab Uddin.Cachar Deputy Commissioner Keerthi Jalli and Cachar Divisional Forest Officer Sunnydeo Chaudhary were also booked.Besides, the Mizoram Police also registered criminal cases against 200 unidentified personnel of the Assam Police.The four senior Assam Police officers and two officials were asked to appear before the investigating officer at the Vairengte police station on Sunday.Meanwhile, the Assam Police also summoned Mizoram’s Rajya Sabha MP K Vanlalvena and six others officials, including Kolasib’s Deputy Commissioner H Lalthlangliana and Superintendent of Police Vanlalfaka Ralte, for questioning on Sunday.

02-08-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear pleas seeking probe into Pegasus snooping row on Thursday||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on August 5 the pleas, including the one filed by senior journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar, who have sought an independent probe by a sitting or a retired judge into the alleged Pegasus snooping matter.According to the cause list uploaded on the apex court website, a Bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant would hear on August 5 three separate petitions seeking probe into the reports of alleged snooping by government agencies on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli spyware Pegasus.On July 30, the top court had said it would hear next week the plea filed by Ram and Kumar in the matter.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the senior journalists, had told the court last week that the plea needed an urgent hearing in view of its wide ramifications.According to the plea, the alleged snooping represented an attempt by agencies and organisations to muzzle the exercise of free speech and expression of dissent in India.The petition also seeks a direction to the Centre to disclose if the government or any of its agencies obtained licence for Pegasus spyware and used it, either directly or indirectly, to conduct surveillance in any manner.The petitioners have claimed that investigations involving several leading publications around the world have revealed that several Indians, including journalists, lawyers, ministers, opposition politicians and activists, have been identified as potential targets for surveillance using the Pegasus software.Besides the plea filed by Ram and Kumar, two separate petitions on the issue have been filed in the apex court by advocate M L Sharma and John Brittas.In his plea, Sharma has sought a court-monitored probe by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) into the reports of alleged snooping.An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on a list of potential targets for surveillance using Israeli firm NSO’s Pegasus spyware.“The targeted surveillance using military-grade spyware is an unacceptable violation of the right to privacy which has been held to be a fundamental right under Articles 14 (equality before the law), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) by the Supreme Court,” said the plea, filed by the two journalists.The hacking of phones belonging to journalists, doctors, lawyers, activists, ministers and opposition politicians “seriously compromises” the effective exercise of the fundamental right to free speech and expression, it said.Such an act has an obvious chilling effect on expression by threatening invasion into the most core and private aspects of a person’s life, it added.According to the petition, hacking of phones using the Pegasus spyware constituted a criminal offence punishable under Sections 66 (computer related offences), 66B (punishment for dishonestly receiving stolen computer resource or communication device), 66E (punishment for violation of privacy) and 66F (punishment for cyberterrorism) of the IT Act, punishable with imprisonment and/or fine.
