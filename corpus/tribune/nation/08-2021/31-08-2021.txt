To promote gender equality and generate more opportunities, the government under PM Narendra Modi has allowed women to work in underground coal mines.Akanksha Kumari becomes the first woman mining engineer in Coal India headquarters to work in an underground mine. It’s a big day.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hazaribagh-girl-is-coal-indias-first-woman-engineer-to-work-in-an-underground-mine-304598

They can go to Kabul airport and travel to India to attend religious ceremonies. — Zabihullah Mujahid, Taliban SpokespersonNo security under USThey (US) are incapable of guaranteeing the security of Afghans. — Zabiullah Mujahid, Taliban SpokespersonThough the US had claimed its “self-defence unmanned over-the-horizon air strike” had taken out a car-borne suicide bomber, local media reported that those killed were two families waiting for word to leave for a flight to the US. Two cars and several houses in the city were also destroyed in the attack.The US had claimed its first drone strike in Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, had killed Taliban supremo Mullah Omar, who in reality died of TB in 2013. In that case, it was not known who was actually killed instead. The US initially said it had no indication of civilian casualties but faced with mounting photo evidence, it ordered a probe.The controversy has also raised doubts about claims of the United States to have killed the mastermind of the Kabul attacks a day later in an airstrike in a remote province.With its claims of providing security in Kabul under question after the bloodbath at the airport, the Taliban blamed American soldiers for bringing thousands of people to the airport. “They are incapable of guaranteeing the security of Afghans,” said its spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid.The local media was itself under pressure as images appeared of a TV anchor flanked by two armed Taliban gunmen, as he was reading the news, while 150 Afghan journalists wrote an open letter to the UN to protect them against threats. Tolo News journalist Behesta Arghand, the first woman scribe to interview a Taliban leader, has disclosed that she has already fled the country out of “fear of Taliban”.The United States’ military spent a busy day, evacuating 1,200 in 26 flights and fended off a spate of rocket attacks aimed at the airport, a day before it wraps up its presence in Afghanistan. Anti-missile defences intercepted as many as five rockets, said the White House.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-final-hours-of-exit-us-drone-kills-10-civilians-304332

Ghosh said the BJP was into vindictive politics. “They are trying to take away rights of the people.” TNSBase expansionTyagi yesterday said, “(Bihar Chief Minister) Nitish Kumar is not a candidate for the post of the Prime Minister but certainly PM material.” “The JD-U is the most trusted member of the NDA and PM Modi is the leader of the alliance. But he (Nitish Kumar) certainly is PM material,” he said. Apparently, the JD(U) also passed a resolution in its national council meeting that stated “Nitish Kumar has all qualities that a PM should have”.Later, briefing the media, Tyagi also suggested NDA coordination committees for smooth functioning like ones in the tenure of late PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.The JD(U), which has a knack for putting the BJP in a spot every now and then, recently backed the demand for an inquiry in the Pegasus spyware issue and a caste census along with the lead opposition in Bihar, the RJD.Aiming for a national party status, the party is now looking to expand base by contesting states like Manipur and Uttar Pradesh next year.Sources say BJP’s Bihar ally is aiming to contest “50 seats in the NDA coalition” in the 2022 elections to the 403-member UP Assembly and that it may contest 200 seats on its own, if the seat sharing formula with the BJP does not work out. Notably, the ruling BJP is expected to contest the high-stake UP elections, with existing allies like the Apna Dal and the Nishad Party having a specific caste base.The BJP and JD(U) are partners in governments in Bihar and the Centre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-is-and-will-be-ndas-pm-candidate-clarifies-ally-jdu-304338

When they realised they cannot wage a direct war, they resorted to a proxy war. —  Rajnath Singh, Defence MinisterHe said anti-national forces must not be allowed to encourage terrorism from across the border.Rajnath was speaking on national security as part of the Balramji Das Tandon lecture series organised by Panjab University. Tandon, a former Governor of Chhattisgarh, was a senior political leader of Punjab. He served as a Cabinet Minister and was a six-term MLA.Recalling the problems India has been facing at its borders over the last 75 years, the Defence Minister lauded the armed forces for overcoming every challenge that threatened national security.Without naming Pakistan, the minister said, “Ever since Independence, there has been a constant attempt by some anti-India forces to create an atmosphere of instability within the country. When they realised they cannot wage a direct war, they resorted to a proxy war. They began to train and finance terrorists to target India,” said Rajnath.“There hasn’t been any major terrorist incident in the hinterland of India in the last seven years. This shows that our armed forces have high morale and confidence,” he said.Referring to the cross-border strikes on terror camps, Rajnath said national security would not be compromised. “The anti-India forces have understood that they are no longer in a position to do much in the Kashmir valley, especially after the abrogation of Article 370. I want to assure you that no power can separate Jammu and Kashmir from India,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-keeping-close-watch-on-afghanistan-crisis-rajnath-singh-304340

Since there are so many mutations in the spike protein, it could result in immune escape and thus a challenge for the vaccination drive worldwide if allowed to spread,” said Ray, from Kolkata’s CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-virus-variant-may-be-more-infectious-304343

Seven of the officers have already completed 20 years of service, making them eligible for pension, while the eighth has been permitted to serve till March 2022 to enable her to complete 20 years.The officers had sought quashing of the assessment pertaining to the period between three to five years of their career since the consideration of these assessments had denied them permanent commission. At that time, the method of assessment was the Unit Assessment Card (UAC). This was prevalent from 1999 to 2005 for officers with less than eight years of service.The Tribunal ruled that UAC was applicable for the entire officer cadre for a particular time. It also observed that the eight women officers had not made the 60 per cent cut-off in the UAC.The officers had contended that their entire service profile where all of them had major professional achievements was not taken into consideration.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aft-upholds-denial-of-permanent-service-to-8-women-officers-304345

The second wave killed thousands and infected several lakh.“Status Quo is when no new mutant comes and New Variant is when 50% more infectious mutant comes by September. As one can see, the only scenario with some semblance of third wave is New Variant one for epsilon = 1/33. In this scenario, new cases rise to Rs1 lakh per day,” Agrawal tweeted.Last month, the model suggested that the third wave could peak between October and November and the daily cases could shoot between 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh every day if a more virulent mutant of SARS-CoV2 drive fresh infections.However, no mutant that was more infectious than the Delta, which drove the infections during the third wave, emerged.Last week’s forecast was the same, but only the range of daily cases has been brought down to 1-1.5 lakh in the latest one.With the fresh data, the daily infections are further expected to drop in the range of a lakh.Agrawal said the fresh data comprising the vaccinations that have taken place in July and August, the sero-surveys that gave insights about the anti-bodies were factored in while assuming the scenarios.According to a study by the researchers of Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the R or the Reproductive value of the coronavirus pandemic was 0.89. It is necessary that the R value is under one that can help arrest the spread of infection.Vaccination has been the biggest weapon worldwide to combat coronavirus and more than 63 crore doses have been administered in the country, according to the CoWIN dashboard. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-third-wave-could-peak-between-october-november-intensity-expected-to-be-quarter-of-second-wave-304199
