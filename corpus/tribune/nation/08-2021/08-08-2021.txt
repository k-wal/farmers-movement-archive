08-08-2021||Aizawl/Silchar/Hailakandi/Guwahati||Trucking resumes over Assam-Mizoram’s disputed border, railway line to be restored soon||Long lines of trucks from the rest of the country rumbled into Mizoram across a disputed border with neighbouring Assam on Sunday, some 13 days after a bloody clash between the police forces of the two states.After assurances of police escorts given on Saturday, truckers in ones and twos started moving out of Dholai near the tense border where they had parked their trucks, ever since violence broke out.What was a trickle on Saturday night became a flood of vehicles moving in convoys, guarded by police escorts, ferrying essential supplies including medicines, diesel and cooking gas to landlocked Mizoram, which had been complaining of shortages of medicines and gasoline.Truckers had kept their trucks parked and refused to move even after an informal blockade enforced by locals in Assam soon after violence broke out was lifted more than a week back. They started moving after two Assam Ministers Ashok Singhal and Parimal Suklabaidya on Saturday convinced them it was safe to travel across the border to Mizoram.Suklabaidya said movement of essential commodities from Hailakandi district to Mizoram, which had been hit since the violent face-off between the two states, too resumed from Sunday.Transportation through rail would begin once tracks, which were damaged during demonstrations following the July 26 flare-up, are repaired, he added.Kolasib Superintendent of Police (SP), Vanlalfaka Ralte said more than 50 vehicles have entered Mizoram since Saturday night till Sunday morning.“Traffic movement between the two neighbouring states as of now is quite smooth…However, we are still on alert as untoward incident can happen at any time,” Ralte, who is camping at Vairengte, told PTI over the phone. Cachar Superintendent of Police Ramandeep Kaur also confirmed to PTI that vehicles “have been moving under heavy police escorts. Though initially there was some resistance from locals, after the two ministers held negotiations, the vehicles started moving”.Silchar’s Mizoram House Liaison Officer (LO) Kaptluanga said that before trucking began in earnest, some  9 Mizoram-bound vehicles were attacked and vandalised by miscreants at Lailapur on Saturday evening. he resumption of  trucking happened after Assam and Mizoram ministers met last week to thrash out differences and agreed to maintain calm along the border.Some drivers however remained reluctant to move across the border. Rahul Hussain, a stranded driver, said they are willing to enter Mizoram but demanded written assurances.Despite an attempt by Union Home Minister Amit Shah to resolve a raft of long-standing border disputes between Assam and its neighbours earlier last month, at least six Assam Police personnel and one civilian were killed and more than 50 people injured in a fire-fight between the police of the two states on July 26, which broke out over a forested patch of the border near Dholai village in Cachar.The two states share a 164.6-km border between Assam’s Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts, and Mizoram’s Kolasib, Mamit and Aizawl districts. Both states have differing interpretations of their territorial border. While Mizoram believes that its border lies along an ‘inner line’ drawn up in 1875 to protect tribals from outside influence, Assam goes by a district demarcation done in the 1930s.

Our honourable RSS chief has clearly said that Muslims and Hindus are one and their DNA is also one,” he said.The BJP is a party that takes everyone along and this is its principle, he said.

But, when the BJP talks about the bullet train, no one questions it. You (BJP) had said that Varanasi will be transformed into Kyoto. But, what the city has turned into can be seen by anyone,” he said.The former chief minister claimed that if voted to power, the SP will take journalists to Kyoto.“The cleanliness in Kyoto cannot be imagined,” he said.Attacking Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, Yadav described him as “fake” and said, “The real Keshav is Mahaan Dal’s Keshav Dev Maurya”.Speaking on the occasion, Maurya said, “The BJP is saying that everybody is fighting the BJP. But, the reality is that everybody is fighting Akhilesh Yadav”.He said that he can merge his party with the SP to fight the BJP, if the need arises, and added that he will remain an ally of the SP, until he is thrown out of the alliance.Meanwhile, SP spokesperson Ashutosh Verma informed that the backward class cell of the party will hold ‘pichhdha varg sammelan’ in different districts of the state from August 9 (August Kranti Diwas).Under this, programmes will be held in Kanpur on August 9. On August 10, a programme will be held at the village of Phoolan Devi in Jalaun on her birth anniversary.‘Pichhdha varg sammelan’ will be held in Jhansi on August 11 in Mahoba on August 12, in Hamirpur on August 13 and in Kanpur Dehat on August 14.The programmes will culminate with an event in Fatehpur on August 15, the party spokesperson said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samajwadi-party-mahaan-dal-will-win-400-seats-in-upcoming-assembly-polls-form-government-in-uttar-pradesh-akhilesh-yadav-294889

08-08-2021||New Delhi||Cong alleges govt pressure behind Twitter action against Rahul Gandhi’s account||The Congress on Sunday demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi break his “silence” on the alleged rape and murder of the nine-year-old Dalit girl in Delhi and provide speedy justice to her family.The opposition party also alleged that Twitter acted in haste due to “pressure” from the Indian government and was “selective” in removing Rahul Gandhi’s tweet and “suspending” his account for putting up pictures of the victim’s family as no action was taken against some other handles which carried the same pictures.“To Twitter, I would say, ‘daro mat’ (don’t be afraid),” Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said.“This is a step taken in haste. We are highly enraged with what has happened. It is highly selective. Somebody who stands with the family seeking justice, you drop his tweet and block his Twitter account,” she said.Addressing a joint press conference, Shrinate and Ragini Nayak accused the government of not providing succour and support to the victim’s family.Delhi Congress leader Alka Lamba demanded that there should be a discussion on women’s safety and security in Parliament during the Monsoon session and a day should be dedicated towards this cause.Delhi Mahila Congress chief Amrita Dhawan demanded time-bound justice delivery and the death penalty to the culprits within six months.She claimed that had Rahul Gandhi not raised the issue, the crime would have been “brushed under the carpet”.Questioning the prime minister and home minister’s “silence”, Shrinate said such a major crime has taken place in the national capital but not a word has come from the government.“Why is the prime minister silent, why is the home minister silent. It is our demand that Modi ji should break his silence on the Delhi incident,” she told reporters.“It is unfortunate that the one who extends support to the family of the victim is being attacked. The BJP is indulging in ‘rape versus rape’ politics. This is not an issue of Congress versus BJP, it concerns the safety and security of women in the country,” she said, asking whether the issue does not bother the 11 women ministers in the Modi government.After Rahul Gandhi had met the victim’s family, the BJP had questioned his silence on rape cases in Congress-ruled states.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala claimed that BJP members and NCSC members too had put up pictures of the victim’s parents on Twitter.“Wah Modi ji, when the National Commission for Scheduled Castes on August 2 puts up the pictures of their meeting with the parents of the victim on Twitter, it is right.“When a former MP and NCSC Commission member puts up photos of the victim’s parents on August 3, it is right. And if Rahul Gandhi ji seeks justice for their daughter, then it is a crime,” Surjewala said in the tweet in Hindi.Shrinate and Nayak alleged that the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) chairman Vijay Sampla and member Anju Bala visited the victim’s family on August 2 and they shared the pictures of the family on August 2 and 3, but no action was taken against them.Nayak alleged that the Modi government “is using its force to suppress women” instead of providing them security.“Why is it that when Rahul Gandhi raises the issue, the government uses its force to get his tweet deleted. Why do you fear Rahul Gandhi so much? If the Modi government feels we will be stopped from raising this issue by getting a tweet deleted, it is mistaken,” Nayak said.The Congress had on Saturday claimed that Twitter has “temporarily suspended” the account of its former chief Rahul Gandhi, but later said it has been “temporarily locked” after the microblogging platform denied having suspended the account and stated that it continues to be in service.The action by Twitter came over a controversial post of Gandhi with a picture of him meeting the family of the Dalit girl who died here following an alleged sexual assault. Twitter has deemed that the account violated its rules against posting private information.

08-08-2021||Mumbai||45 cases of delta plus variant reported in Maharashtra so far: Govt||A total of 45 cases of the Delta plus variant of coronavirus have been reported in Maharashtra during genome sequencing, the state health department said on Sunday, adding one patient had died.At 13, the maximum number of these patients hailed from Jalgaon in north Maharashtra followed by Ratnagiri (11) in the coastal Konkan region.  "80 per cent of the samples sent for genome sequencing had tested positive for the Delta Plus variant (of coronavirus). The 45 patients are from Jalgaon (13), Ratnagiri (11), Mumbai (6), Thane (5), Pune (3), and one each from Palghar, Sindhudurg, Sangli. Nandurbar, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, and Beed," the department said in a statement.  Of these 45 samples, information about 35 patients have been taken by the health department. One death was reported while the rest of the patients reported mild to medium type symptoms, it said.  The exact number of samples sent for genome sequencing and the period during which they were analysed is not mentioned. Union Minister of State for Health Bharati Pawar informed Lok Sabha in a written reply on Friday that analysis of the genomic data is a continuous and ongoing process. Periodic updates are shared with experts and states and are also regularly made available in the public domain through the media bulletin of INSACOG (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortium). States are regularly advised to send samples for genome sequencing and provide clinical data of positive persons to enable greater epidemiological insights to identify the link between the surge in cases at various places to the variants, the minister stated.  Elaborating on the steps being taken to check the spread of the Delta variant, Pawar had said to monitor the variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus, initially, genomic sequencing was conducted through the National Institute of Virology, Pune.  Subsequently, the Union government established the INSACOG in December 2020 as a consortium of 10 laboratories of the Ministry of Health, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The network of INSACOG laboratories has since been increased to 28, Pawar stated. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/45-cases-of-delta-plus-variant-reported-in-maharashtra-so-far-govt-294882
08-08-2021||New Delhi||Class 10 to 12 students in Delhi can visit schools from Monday for admission, board practicals||The Delhi government on Sunday allowed students of class 10 to 12 to visit schools from Monday for work related to admission and practical activities for board exam, and also said health checkup camps situated on school campuses can resume.Through an order issued Sunday evening, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) also permitted the opening of weekly markets across the city from Monday with a rider that the vendors and visitors shall follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.The DDMA, however, specified that schools, coaching centres and colleges will remain closed for teaching purposes.“Students of class 10 to 12 in the city are permitted to visit their schools from August 9 (Monday) for admission-related work including counselling, guidance and practical activities for board exam.“Health checkups and referral services situated in schools or conducted from there can resume. Children of all age may visit these centres accompanied by their parents or guardians,” the DDMA order stated.It said the Directorate of Education shall issue appropriate guidelines with respect to these permitted activities to ensure that Covid-19 protocols are followed and children safety is ensured.The government had last month said that auditoriums and assembly halls in schools and educational institutions can be used for training and meeting purposes with 50 per cent occupancy.Schools in the national capital were closed in March last year ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of novel coronavirus. Schools were partially reopened for classes 9 to 12 in January this year but were again closed in April in view of the aggressive second wave of Covid-19.The DDMA order also said, “All weekly markets are allowed subject to strict compliance of guidelines issued by the government. No unauthorised weekly market is allowed to function.” The order added that roadside weekly markets will not be allowed.The weekly markets were closed after a lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 19 due to a surge in cases during the second Covid wave.Later, in mid-June, one weekly market in each municipal zone was allowed to open with strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and official guidelines.According to rough estimates, there are around 2,700 weekly markets that open on designated days in 12 of the municipal zones, Delhi Cantonment and the New Delhi Municipal Council. Around four lakh people depend on them for earning a livelihood, vendors claim.“In case any field officer of DDMA finds that Covid appropriate behaviour or prescribed SOPs and guidelines are not being followed in any weekly market then such market will be closed by the District Magistrate and Zonal Deputy Commissioner of municipal body concerned without any loss of time so as to completely avoid and prevent any upsurge and likelihood of next wave in Delhi.“RT-PCR tests of vendors or customers of weekly markets shall be conducted on random basis by the DM concerned regularly. In case of positive report test report, action should be taken as per the protocol prescribed by Health department with regard to quarantine, contact tracing and treatment etc,” the DDMA order said. The order by DDMA will be in force till August 23.

08-08-2021||New Delhi||India, UAE conduct naval drill off the coast of Abu Dhabi||India and the United Arab Emirates carried out a naval exercise off the coast of Abu Dhabi on Saturday, in reflection of a rapid upswing in bilateral military cooperation.The Indian Navy deployed its warship INS Kochi and two integral Sea King MK 42B helicopters for the ‘Zayed Talwar’ exercise, officials said.The UAE participated in the exercise with Al-Dhafra, a Baynunah class guided missile corvette, and one AS–565B Panther helicopter, they said.The exercise took place amid rising tension in the Gulf region after a drone attack on a merchant tanker off Oman killed a British national and a Romanian citizen over a week back.The UK and US pointed fingers at Iran for the attack on MV Mercer Street, operated by an Israeli-owned firm. Tehran has already rejected the charges.“As part of the exercise, the ships undertook tactical manoeuvres, over the horizon targeting, search and rescue and electronic warfare drill to enhance interoperability and synergy between the two navies,” Indian Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said.He said helicopters were extensively used all through the exercise ranging from search and rescue operations to the passing of targeting data to ships for simulated missile engagement drills.The naval exercise came a week after Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria visited the United Arab Emirates.In December last year, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane visited the UAE and Saudi Arabia in a first-ever visit by a head of the Indian Army to the two important Gulf countries.

Trials progressed as planned and system parameters proved satisfactory,” Indian Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said.He said the ship’s performance, including of the hull, main propulsion, power generation and distribution (PGD) and auxiliary equipment were tested during the sea trials.“Trials, which were reviewed by Vice Admiral AK Chawla, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Southern Naval Command on the last day, have progressed as planned and system parameters have been proved satisfactory,” Commander Madhwal said.The delivery of Vikrant is being targeted to coincide with celebrations to commemorate the 75th anniversary of India’s independence ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, he said.The warship will operate MiG-29K fighter jets, Kamov-31 helicopters, MH-60R multi-role helicopters. It has over 2,300 compartments, designed for a crew of around 1700 people, including specialised cabins to accommodate women officers.The aircraft carrier set off on its maiden sea trials, 50 years after its namesake played a major role in the 1971 war.“The ship with a high degree of automation for machinery operation, ship navigation and survivability, has been designed to accommodate an assortment of fixed-wing and rotary aircraft,” the Navy spokesperson said.Vikrant has a top speed of around 28 knots and a cruising speed of 18 knots with an endurance of about 7,500 nautical miles.The IAC is 262 metres long, 62 metre wide and it has a height of 59 metres. Its construction began in 2009.Commander Madhwal said that the successful completion of the maiden trials, despite challenges faced due to the coronavirus pandemic, is a testimony to the dedicated efforts of a large number of stakeholders.“This is a major milestone activity and historical event. The carrier would undergo a series of sea trials prior to its delivery in 2022,” he said.Around 550 Indian firms including about 100 MSMEs are registered with the Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) and they provided various services for the construction of the IAC,  India currently has only one aircraft carrier—INS Vikramaditya.The Indian Navy has been focusing on significantly bolstering its overall capabilities in view of China’s growing efforts to increase its military presence in the Indian Ocean Region.The Indian Ocean, considered the backyard of the Indian Navy, is critical to the country’s strategic interests.

08-08-2021||---||Covid-19: Hazards of not reopening schools too serious to be ignored, says parliamentary panel||New Delhi, August 8The hazards of not reopening schools after prolonged closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic are “too serious to be ignored”, according to a parliamentary panel.The committee has noted that the closure of schools has not only impacted social fabric of families in a negative manner, it has also increased involvement of children in household chores.“The closure of schools for over a year has had a deep impact on the wellbeing of students, especially their mental health. The hazards of not opening the schools are too serious to be ignored. The confinement of young children within the four walls of the house, being unable to attend school, has altered the relationship between the parent and the children adversely.“The closure of schools has impacted the social fabric of the family in negative manner leading to early/child marriage and increased involvement of children in household chores. The present situation has exacerbated the learning crisis that existed even before the pandemic with the marginal and vulnerable children getting adversely affected. Keeping this situation in mind, it becomes all the more imperative to open schools,” the panel has noted.This week the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports tabled in Parliament its report “Plans to bridge the learning gap caused due to school lockdown as well as review of online and offline instructions and exams and plans for reopening of schools” headed by Vinay P Sahsrabudhe.The seriousness of the matter should not be overlooked and a well balanced reasoned view may be taken for opening up of the schools, the panel said.Accentuating vaccine programmes for all students, teachers and allied staff so that schools may start functioning normally at the earliest; holding classes on alternate days or in two shifts to thin out students along with observance of physical distancing and compulsory wearing of face masks at all times, frequent hand sanitization etc; regular thermal screening at the time of attendance and conducting random RT-PCR tests to identify and isolate any infected student, teacher or staff immediately, are among the recommendations for reopening of schools made by the panel.“Each school should have at least two oxygen concentrators with trained personnel to address any eventuality and provide first aid till availability of outside medical help.Frequent surprise inspection of schools may be done by health inspectors and health workers to ensure strict adherence to hygiene and Covid protocols, the panel said.“Best practices being followed in different countries for opening of schools may be taken into consideration for taking an informed decision,” it said.The panel has also noted that the learning loss of more than one year due to prolonged school closure in wake of the pandemic would necessarily have weakened the foundational knowledge of students, especially in the subjects of mathematics, sciences and languages, at school level.“This learning loss is a big deficit and is likely to impair the cognitive capabilities of students,” the panel said in its report tabled in Parliament on Friday.“This might have a debilitating effect on vulnerable sections of the society like poor and rural students, marginalised sections of society and young women who might have been unable to connect to any form of digital education during the pandemic. This needs to be addressed and immediate remedial steps required to be taken,” the report said.Schools across the country were closed in March last year ahead of nationwide lockdown to contain spread of novel coronavirus.

Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23 last year amid the coronavirus pandemic. However, limited special international passenger flights have been operating since July 2020 under the air bubble arrangements formed with 28 countries, including the UK. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rise-in-airfares-dgca-asks-airlines-to-submit-details-about-fares-on-india-uk-flights-294849

It was found that the identified birds and their nestlings predominantly feed on insects, including crop pests. Tomar said 15 per cent of Rs 1.15-crore fund allotted to AINP on vertebrate pest management has been allocated to the programme on role of insectivorous birds in suppressing crop pests. C K Borad, ornithologist on the faculty of Anand Agricultural University, Gujarat, said that most birds survive on insects and only a handful prefer grain. “Even those which eat grain feed insects to their young ones so that the chicks can have a high protein diet. By eating insects harmful for crops or by gorging of crops – either way birds do not make much impact on the yield”, Borad said.Borad said that focus of agricultural ornithology should be conservation of birds. “Agricultural fields are habitats for many bird species which are endangered. The rampant use of insecticide by farmers and certain other agricultural practices are threatening the existence of these birds”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/482-insectivorous-birds-identified-under-agricultural-ornithologist-project-294815
08-08-2021||Dehradun||Experts recommend evacuation of Raini village in Uttarakhand||Haunted by horrifying memories of the February flash flood, residents of Raini village—the cradle of the Chipko movement—that bore the brunt of the calamity still cannot sleep peacefully, fearing what will happen to them if yet another disaster comes knocking at their doors.A hydel project on the Rishi Ganga River at Raini village had been totally demolished in the February deluge, which had also killed five of its residents. The fear of villagers about another imminent calamity is not unfounded, as a team of experts which conducted a study on the impact of the February flashflood on Raini recently recommended its evacuation at the earliest warning due to its increased vulnerability to natural disasters.Relocation and rehabilitation of disaster-hit villages in Uttarakhand is a long-drawn-out affair, as there around 330 villages affected by successive calamities are still waiting to be relocated."Raini is vulnerable at present and requires adequate slope stabilisation works to arrest slope failure activities. If appropriate measures are not taken, it may lead to mass movement activities in saturated, dynamic conditions and toe erosion by rivers," geological experts said in a report based on their field study of the affected village in Chamoli district."Therefore, the slopes in Raini village located on the confluence point of Rishi Ganga and Dhauli Ganga rivers should be treated or the entire village evacuated as early as possible," the report conducted under the Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery Initiative (UDRP) said."During the field visit, it was observed that the slope forming material is highly saturated due to incessant rainfall. The soil/debris material loses its strength when the slope forming material gets saturated. As a result, there are many slip areas in the village from toe to uphill of the slope," the UDRP report submitted already to the district administration said.The fear of villagers of an imminent disaster was deepened after a 40-metre stretch of Joshimath-Malari road just 10 metres below the village caved in a couple of months back, Raini village Pradhan Bhawan Rana said.Though the stretch has been repaired by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), cracks have appeared on it once again following heavy rains, he said.Residents of Raini are eagerly awaiting being moved to a safe location.Dhak and Subhai villages have been recommended by the team of experts in their report as the appropriate sites for their relocation.When asked whether the administration had initiated steps for the relocation of the village, Rana said the report has been sent to higher authorities in Dehradun for action."But nothing has been done yet despite district authorities being repeatedly told about the situation in Raini. The villagers are forced to live in constant fear, especially at night when running to safety, in case of a disaster, could be even more difficult if not impossible," Rana said.Even the school building where residents of Raini were shifted following the flash flood in February can be reached only after crossing a bridge, which may be at the risk of being washed away in case of a crisis, he said.There are around 30 families consisting of 122 people still residing in the village, Rana said."Those whose grown up children work in towns have shifted with them, but those who have no other option are forced to live in the village," the village pradhan said.Meanwhile, most disaster management officials in Dehradun expressed ignorance about the study report, of which a copy is available with PTI.While the Executive Director of Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre Piyoosh Rautela said he was not aware of the report, Disaster Management Secretary S A Murugesan said the report had not reached his office yet."Anything about Raini can be done only after we receive the report and study it," Murugesan told PTI."Raini is one among 400 disaster-hit villages across Uttarakhand which need to be rehabilitated and relocated. We are done with 70 of them. Work on the rest will be taken up in the order of priority. It is an endless process," he said.Though officials in Dehradun appear to be in no particular hurry to address the problem of Raini, the UDRP report should prompt them into immediate action as it warns of toe erosion of the slope base by rivers in the village, mass movement, loose, unstable and overhanging boulders on the slope surface posing danger to houses."Raini village is facing serious slope stability problems where whole inhabited area is affected by active subsidence whereas downslope is affected by toe erosion. During investigation wide cracks were observed in the walls and floors of many houses indicating active slope movement in the area."It is therefore advisable to rehabilitate Raini village to an alternate, safe location. The local administration has identified the sites for the rehabilitation of Raini Village, which have been inspected by the geological and geotechnical team," the report said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-recommend-evacuation-of-raini-village-in-uttarakhand-294812
08-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC to hear on Monday CBI’s plea in INX Media case involving Chidambaram, others||The Delhi High Court is scheduled to hear on Monday the CBI’s plea in the INX Media corruption case involving Congress leader P Chidambaram and his son Karti.The CBI has challenged a trial court’s order directing the agency to allow inspection of documents kept in the ‘malkhana’ (room where case properties are kept) by the accused and their counsel.The plea is listed for hearing before Justice Mukta Gupta.The high court had on May 18 stayed trial proceedings in the case involving Chidambaram and his son Karti.It had also issued notice and sought responses of Chidambaram and others on the CBI’s plea.The CBI has sought to set aside the special judge’s March 5, 2021 order to the extent that it directed the CBI to allow inspection of documents kept in malkhana by the respondents/accused/ their counsel.Besides, the CBI has also sought setting aside the observations in the order which says that the agency is required to file or produce before the court all the documents collected by it during investigation.The trial court had also said that the accused are also entitled to copies of such documents or inspections thereof, irrespective of the fact whether they are being relied upon by the CBI or not.The CBI had registered its case on May 15, 2017, alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board clearance granted to INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram’s tenure as finance minister.Thereafter, the ED had lodged the money laundering case.The CBI had said this case involved high level of corruption with wide ramifications on society and while the accused have a right to a fair trial, the collective interest of the society cannot be impinged.“A fair trial is not what the accused wants in the name of a fair trial but must soothe the ultimate justice. Although right of fair trial of the respondents/accused was not infringed, since all documents relied upon by petitioner-CBI were provided to the respondents/accused…,” it has said.It has added that it is trite that the right to fair trial is not singularly absolute, as is perceived, from the perspective of the accused and it also takes within its ambit and sweep the rights of the society at large.The agency has contended that the very essence of trial is to unearth the truth for which the court cannot assist the accused in search of a plausible defence.“This is against all principles of fair trial and due process of law. It is the basic principle of criminal law that though it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case, however, the accused is supposed to either give the true version before the court or remain silent.“An accused cannot build a false and imaginary defence, after examining the documents. A false defence is a circumstance which incriminates the accused,” the CBI has said in its petition.It has alleged that the trial court’s order reflected intrusion into the investigative process of the CBI which is impermissible in law and the special judge lost sight of the fact that further investigation in the present matter is underway and if the accused persons are allowed to inspect documents available at the malkhana, the same would subvert the probe and there is every likelihood that they may tamper with evidence available.“Secrecy is a pre-requisite of investigation into any offence. Confidentiality and insulation of the investigating agency and its investigation from leaks and disclosures at every stage has to be ensured”, it has said.It has added that this would impinge the power of the CBI to enquire and investigate into the allegations of huge economic fraud and corruption at the highest level, having national and international ramifications.“One cannot lose sight that the respondents/accused are highly influential people having huge resources, which can be gathered from the very fact that during the course of arguments, the respondents/accused referred to and also filed along with their applications, extracts/pages of relevant rules of the CBI Crime Manual 2020, although it is a restricted document and is meant for internal circulation within the CBI,” it has said.Seeking to set aside the trial court’s order, the agency has said the legitimate aim would suffer irreparably if protection is not given to the documents and record which was permitted to be inspected by the accused.It has said out of 14 accused, only Karti had made the prayer to inspect malkhana documents, however, the trial court erroneously allowed all the accused to inspect it and exceeded the judicial powers by giving relief which was not prayed for.“Further, not all respondents/accused preferred applications under Section 207 CrPC, however, documents were directed to be supplied to all of them and also, inspection was also permitted to all,” it has said.The Chidambarams are already out on bail in the case.The court had earlier granted interim bail to other accused on a personal bond of Rs 2 lakh and one surety of the like amount.Chidambaram was taken into custody on August 21, 2019 when he was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the INX Media corruption case.On October 16, 2019, the ED arrested him in the separate money-laundering case.Six days later, on October 22, 2019, the apex court had granted him bail in the case lodged by the CBI.On December 4, 2019, after 105 days of custody, Chidambaram was granted bail by the Supreme Court in the money laundering case lodged by the ED.

Seeking an enhancement of the budget for Ayush, he said the court should direct thegovernment to establish separate branches of meditation and shathkarma and research institutes under Ayush.The petition came four days after the SC said doctors, both allopathic and Ayush, rendered services to patients and there was “no rational justification” for having different dates for giving benefit of extended age of superannuation to them.“In our understanding, the mode of treatment by itself under the prevalent scheme of things, does not qualify as an intelligible differentia.
