15-08-2021||New Delhi||Pegasus row: SC to continue hearing batch of pleas seeking probe into alleged snooping||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday a batch of petitions, including those filed by the Editors Guild of India and senior journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar, seeking an independent probe into the alleged Pegasus snooping matter.A bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana and justices Suryakant and Aniruddha Bose will continue hearing the matter.On August 10, the top court had taken exception over “parallel proceedings and debates” on social media by some petitioners who have sought an independent probe into the alleged Pegasus snooping issue and said there must be some discipline and they must have “some faith in the system”.The top court had said that it would take a call on August 16 on whether to issue notice to the Centre on pleas seeking probe into the Pegasus row and emphasised that it is not against debate but when the matter is pending in the apex court it should be deliberated upon here.       The bench had said that it expects that petitioners who are interested in the matter would answer whatever queries the court would put to them by way of proper debate “in the court and not outside”.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had told the court that he needs instructions from the government on the batch of pleas. The apex court is hearing a batch of pleas, including the one filed by the Editors Guild of India, seeking an independent probe into the alleged Pegasus snooping matter.They are related to reports of alleged snooping by government agencies on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO’s spyware Pegasus.An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware.  Earlier, during the hearing of the matter, the top court had said that allegations of Pegasus related snooping are “serious in nature” if reports on them are correct.It had also asked the petitioners whether they had made any efforts to file a criminal complaint on this.The apex court, which had asked the petitioners to serve the copies of the pleas to the Centre, had also questioned why the matter has suddenly cropped up now when it had come to light way back in 2019.Editors Guild of India has sought in its plea that a special investigation team be set up to conduct a probe into reported surveillance of journalists and others. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-row-sc-to-continue-hearing-batch-of-pleas-seeking-probe-into-alleged-snooping-297965
15-08-2021||New Delhi||India provides refuge to 'sympathetic' Afghan officials||India has started providing refuge to fleeing former Afghan government officials who were sympathetic to New Delhi.These Afghans are arriving in Delhi by commercial flights, said sources. Among a group that landed from Kabul was the former police chief of Kandahar Tadin Khan, who was close to the notorious warlord Gul Agha Sherzai who also is believed to have fled to India.At least a dozen commercial airlines are still operating to Kabul including Air India which arrived with 129 passengers.Arvind Gupta, Director of the influential Vivekananda Foundation, which was headed by NSA Ajit Doval, leaned in favour of accommodating Afghans trying to flee Kabul, among them several friends of India. ``They are looking to come to India on legitimate visas. The Government should consider such requests on humanitarian grounds and save them from likely Taliban reprisals,’’ he said.Several Afghans who did not hide their empathy for India and are journalists, writers, and activists fear the worst in the coming days, even if the initial takeover may appear peaceful in keeping with frequent exhortations from western countries, said the sources.Besides many Hazaras and Tajiks, many of whose association with India is well known may need to be accommodated.Sources said the Indian embassy in Kabul is open and issuing visas on a case-to-case basis to Afghan nationals regardless of their religion. However, most of those who have arrived over the past few days had long-term Indian visas as they were considered close to the Foreign Office and the intelligence agencies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-provides-refuge-to-sympathetic-afghan-officials-297962

15-08-2021||Amaravati||Girl student stabbed to death in AP||A third-year engineering student was stabbed to death in broad daylight by an unidentified assailant on the main road in Guntur city of Andhra Pradesh, causing a widespread uproar.State Home Minister M Sucharita rushed to the Government General Hospital, where the girl's body was taken, and expressed shock over the incident.TDP general secretary and MLC Nara Lokesh deplored that the Dalit student's murder took place around the time when Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, in his Independence Day address, was waxing eloquent about women safety under his rule.Police launched a manhunt to nab the culprit while efforts were on to unlock her mobile phone for possible clues, police sources said.According to the police, the student was walking on the Kakani Road when a youth approached her on his bike. He asked her to get on the bike, to which she refused and an altercation followed.“The assailant then took out a knife and stabbed her repeatedly on the neck and the stomach and fled the scene. The locals rushed to the spot and immediately removed the profusely bleeding girl to hospital,” a police official said.She, however, died at the GGH.Guntur Urban Superintendent of Police Arif Hafeez visited the scene of offence to take stock of the situation.The Home Minister told reporters at the GGH that police have gathered some clues about the assailant and hope he would be nabbed soon.“Despite having tough laws… how to punish such psychopaths? Only capital punishment seems appropriate for such monsters,” the Home Minister remarked.She said the victim's parents and friends were also being questioned for possible clues.Lokesh, meanwhile, demanded that the culprit be brought to book immediately.“The Jagan government has been trumpeting a lot about the (non-existent) Disha Act. In the past two and a half years, in not one case of atrocities against women has any justice been done,” the MLC said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/girl-student-stabbed-to-death-in-ap-297951

15-08-2021||London||IPL founder Lalit Modi faces High Court case in UK: Report||The London-based founder of the Indian Premier League (IPL), Lalit Modi, is facing an approximately USD 7-million legal challenge in the High Court in England over allegations of misrepresentation by a former Indian model, according to a UK media report on Sunday.‘The Sunday Times’ reports that Modi denies the allegations and is defending the claim, brought by Gurpreet Gill Maag, now a Singapore-based venture capitalist also known as Blu.She alleges that Lalit Modi persuaded her to invest USD 2 million in a cancer treatment venture called Ion Care. He is accused of “falsely” naming prominent royals, including Prince Andrew – Queen Elizabeth II’s son—among patrons of the scheme.Modi is said to have proposed a global network of cancer centres utilising revolutionary single-dose radiotherapy that had been used on his wife, Minal, who passed away in 2018.“He told me that it had given her seven more years of life,” Gill Maag is quoted in the newspaper as having said.As part of his sales pitch, Modi is alleged to have produced an investor document, seen by ‘The Sunday Times’, that listed as patrons Prince Andrew, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates.Gill Maag alleges that other prominent figures, including former prime minister of Thailand Thaksin Shinawatra, were separately named by Lalit Modi as investors.The project, however, is said to have flopped by early 2019 and Gill Maag is now taking legal action, represented by Matthew Evans, a senior associate at Reynolds Porter Chamberlain law firm in London.The case is expected to go to trial at the High Court in London early next year.“Unfortunately, despite successfully treating a number of patients, the project was not able to obtain sufficient funding and the company went into liquidation,” reads a statement by Lalit Modi’s lawyers to ‘The Sunday Times’.“Mr Modi denies the allegations made by Mrs Maag and is defending the claim in full. The matter will be decided by the High Court in due course and Mr Modi is not able to comment further at this time. Mr Modi confirms that no criminal charges have been levelled in any Indian court against him by any of the Indian authorities,” it adds.Lalit Modi had relocated to London from India in 2010, amid scandals and controversies linked to the cricket IPL.A spokesperson for Prince Andrew, who has been embroiled in a separate controversy related to his alleged links with the late American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, said he has “never been a patron of Ion Care and had no knowledge of its existence”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ipl-founder-lalit-modi-faces-high-court-case-in-uk-report-297940
15-08-2021||New Delhi||CBI announces Rs 5 lakh award for information in case of Dhanbad judge's death||The CBI has announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh for anyone sharing "information of importance" on the alleged killing of Dhanbad judge Uttam Anand, who was mowed down by an autorickshaw on July 28, officials said on Sunday.A notice announcing the reward said Anand was killed on July 28 and the case is being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).It said if anyone has any information of importance, it can be shared with the special crime team of the CBI housed at the CSIR Satkar guest house in Dhanbad through phone numbers 7827728856, 011-24368640 and 24368641."Cash reward of Rs 5 lakh will be given to the person who will give worthwhile information relating to the crime," it said.The CBI has taken the custody of two men—autorickshaw driver Lakhan Verma and his accomplice Rahul Verma—who are accused in the case.The 49-year-old judge was allegedly mowed down by a heavy autorickshaw while he was on a morning jog in Dhanbad on July 28.CCTV footage showed that he was jogging on one side of a fairly wide road at the Randhir Verma Chowk when the autorickshaw veered towards him, hit him from behind and fled the scene.The CBI has recreated the accident scene, while experts of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) have also collected evidence from the spot.The case was handed over to the CBI by the Jharkhand government. The central agency had dispatched a 20-member team under its ace investigator VK Shukla, recently awarded as one of the best investigators by the Union home ministry, to probe the matter.The Jharkhand High Court and the Supreme Court are keeping an eye on the case.A high court bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad had directed the CBI to initiate a probe at the earliest.The court had also directed the state government to hand over all the documents of the case to the CBI.Taking cognizance of a letter filed before the court by the Dhanbad principal district judge in the case, Justice Ranjan had converted it into a writ petition and ordered the formation of an SIT headed by Additional Director General of Police Sanjay Latkar to look into the matter.Dissatisfied with the progress report, the bench had questioned the delay in registering an FIR into the case.The incident occurred at 5.08 am and the FIR was registered at 12.45 pm when it was clear from the CCTV footage that the judge was picked up from the spot and taken to a hospital, the court had said."Do the police register an FIR only on the basis of a statement? Do the police not register an FIR on their own? Why did the police take six hours to register the FIR?" the court had asked.It had also said there is fear among judicial officers following the incident and directed that the security of courts, including the high court, and that of judicial officers be strengthened.On July 30, the Supreme Court also took suo motu cognizance of the "sad demise" of the Dhanbad judge. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-announces-rs-5-lakh-award-for-information-in-case-of-dhanbad-judges-death-297936

Let no youth of our state be killed anymore," he said.The ULFA (I), which had been calling for Assam Bandh on Independence Day and Republic Day for several decades, refrained from the practice for the first time for Independence Day this year. The outfit has also declared a unilateral ceasefire since May this year in view of the pandemic situation. The chief minister had earlier urged Barua to come for peace talks after assuming power in May this year. Sarma thanked all Covid warriors, including doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians and ambulance drivers, for working tirelessly in the pandemic. Noting that Covid-19 vaccination for all eligible people was progressing well in the state, he said that 1.5 crore doses will be administered in the next one week.He congratulated boxer Lovlina Borgohain for her Olympic bronze medal and said that her success is an inspiration for all. Sarma paid tributes to the six Assam Police personnel killed in violence along the inter-state border with Mizoram on July 26, and conferred them the 'Chief Minister's Special Service Medal in a Crisis Situation' posthumously. He said that the Assam government is committed to resolving the border disputes without compromising with the state's constitutional boundary. "I urge the northeastern states to resolve the disputes through talks to keep the 'soul' of our region alive," he said.The chief minister said that the Assam Cattle Preservation Bill, 2021, which was passed by the assembly on Friday, shows the state government's resolve to protect the cultural ethos of the state. He said that the government is committed to eradicating poverty through population control and will carry on its war against drugs, human trafficking and other social menaces. Sarma said his government will fulfil its pre-poll promises including providing one lakh government jobs and waiving loans taken by women from micro-finance institutions. "We want to do away with red-tapism in bureaucracy," he said.The chief minister announced that freedom fighters' pension issued by the state government will be increased to Rs 36,000 at par with the central remuneration and state honours will be accorded to all these former revolutionaries during their last rites. He made 10 'requests' to the people of the state and urged them to comply with these to build a better Assam.Sarma urged people to observe birth and death anniversaries of Vaishanvite preachers Srimanta Sankardeva and Madhabdeva as opportunities to emulate their teachings. He called on people to make it a tradition to begin all programmes with a rendition of the state song and conclude those with the National Anthem.Urging people to take care of their aging parents, the chief minister said that his government will sanction seven days leave per year for its employees to visit their parents and requested other employers and businessmen to follow suit. To improve the work culture, he requested government employees to spend an extra hour at the office and leave no work pending. He appealed to people to stop using single-use plastics and do at least one 'good deed' this year like giving free tuition to needy students or organising health camps. Sarma urged people not to marry off their daughters till they attain the age of 21, and cooperate with police to fight drugs and human trafficking. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-cm-invites-ulfa-i-chief-for-peace-talks-297930

Students of DAV college in Jalandhar will perform 'Bhangra' for around one-and-half-hour," he said.The programme will conclude around 3 to 4 pm.Jamhuri Kisan Sabha general secretary Kulwant Singh said 'Kisan Mazdoor Azadi Sangram Diwas' is being celebrated across the nation."The ex-servicemen marched from the KFC restaurant till the main stage at the Singhu border. 'Kisan Mazdoor Azadi Sangram Diwas' is being celebrated across the nation where people are hoisting flags in support of the farmers," Patiala said.Another leader said the national flag was also hoisted at the Tikri border.He said there will be a 'Tiranga yatra' at the Ghazipur border."We hoisted the flag at 8 in the morning.

15-08-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi’s apology sought for saying Matangini Hazra was from Assam||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has demanded an apology from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for describing martyred Bengali woman freedom fighter Matangini Hazra as hailing from Assam.“Matangini Hazra from Assam? R u mad? U don’t know history. U have no feelings. You just read a written speech (that also by others) with drama. This is insult to Bengal. You must beg apology,” Kuman Ghosh, TMC general secretary Kunal Ghosh said in a tweet.“Now what did you say today ! That Matangini Hazra is not a freedom fighter from Bengal. My NEW & 10th Question for you : is this video doctored ? Or part of your Red Fort speech ?”, TMC leader in the Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien said in a tweet.Modi, while delivering the PM’s customary speech from the rampart of Red Fort today on the occasion of the 75th Independence Day, was talking about the contribution of women in the struggle for freedom. While uttering the names of some of the prominent women freedom fighters, Modi said “…apna Assam-me Matangini Hazra ki parakram ho…” (the courage of Matangini Hazra of our Assam).Matangini Hazra was shot by the colonial Indian police in front of Tamluk police station on September 29, 1942 in the present East Midnapore district of West Bengal when she was leading a demonstration organised as a part of the “Quit India” movement call given by Gandhi.Quoting a report from a contemporary newspaper, historian Bidyut Chakraborty wrote in his book “Local Politics and Indian Nationalism: Midnapur (1919-1944)”, that the 72 year old Matangini Hazra, despite shot in the forehead and both her hands, continued marching holding the Congress flag in her hand leaving the other volunteers behind.“Kanaklata Barua, a young woman activist of Assam, was shot by police for participating in the Quit India movement. Modi’s speechwriter seems to have mixed up Kanaklata with Matangini Hazra,” Samarjt Choudhury, a Kolkata-based journalist, remarked.West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, however, described the PM’s faux pas as a “small mistake”. “Thousands of people laid down their lives for the freedom of the country.

Today, I announce the setting up of the National Hydrogen Mission with the aim of becoming the new global hub of green hydrogen, and also its largest exporter,” PM Modi said in his Independence Day speech.The announcement comes ahead of COP-26 in Glasgow, where nations will be under pressure to pledge more ambitious climate action and substantial financing, especially regarding energy requirements.Energy is integral for any fast-growing economy and India has taken numerous steps, including emerging fuels, to tackle the global problem of climate change and is on the path of decoupling its emissions from economic growth. In those terms Hydrogen has great potential to emerge as a future source of energy. Last year in October, Prime Minister Modi outlined a new energy map of India with seven key drivers and one of them was development of emerging fuels, particularly hydrogen.The government had also announced the National Hydrogen Mission in the Union Budget 2021 for making a hydrogen roadmap for the country. Currently, work is going on a pilot project on blue hydrogen, hydrogen CNG and green hydrogen. Inclusion of hydrogen as an energy carrier in the future energy portfolio presents a unique opportunity to address emerging energy vectors, including power to gas, power to power, and power to mobility and even vehicle to grid applications, say officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-become-new-global-hub-of-green-hydrogen-pm-modi-297902

15-08-2021||---||Parliament temple of democracy, President Ram Nath Kovind after session washout||New Delhi, August 14President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday said Parliament was the temple of democracy and the highest forum of debate to decide issues of public good.The remarks made by the President in his address to the nation on the eve of the 75th Independence Day followed a washout of the monsoon session that was marked by disruptions and bitterness between the government and the Opposition.Mourns covid deaths“It is a matter of great pride for all Indians that our Parliament will soon be housed in a new building… It will honour our legacy while also walking in step with the contemporary world,” the President said.Noting that India was yet to emerge from the devastating effects of Covid recurrence, the President expressed grief at the loss of lives during the ferocious second wave. He hailed Covid warriors and said the leadership rose to the challenges as the second wave overwhelmed health systems. “The country can take solace in the fact that more lives were saved than lost in the pandemic,” the President added.In wide-ranging remarks, he hailed agriculture growth despite the pandemic, listed government’s pro-farmer measures to placate the agitating farmers, applauded India’s seven Olympic medal wins in the 121 years of participation and its daughters’ victories, urged the youth of J&K to participate in the region’s new awakening and flagged the perils of climate change.Calling India a miracle for its plurality and yet the most vibrant democracy, the President said, “When India won Independence 75 years ago, many sceptics thought democracy would not survive in India. Little did they know that roots of democracy were nurtured in this soil in ancient times, and even in modern times India was ahead of many western nations in offering franchise to all adults, regardless of any distinctions.”The President said J&K was witnessing a new dawn. “The government has initiated the process of consultation with all stakeholders who have faith in democracy and the rule of law. I urge the people, especially the youth, of J&K to utilise this opportunity and work on realising their aspirations through democratic institutions,” he said.Reflecting on the Covid-induced challenges, the President said new variants and unexpected factors led to a terrible second wave. “I am deeply sad that many lives could not be saved and many more suffered immensely in this phase of an unprecedented crisis. I speak for the whole nation when I say that I share the grief of all the affected families with the same intensity,” he lamented, asking everyone to get vaccinated and not lower their guard.The President especially hailed girls saying “in the success of daughters, I see a glimpse of a developed India and urge every parent to learn from the families of such promising daughters and provide opportunities to their daughters also to explore avenues of growth.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-temple-of-democracy-president-ram-nath-kovind-after-session-washout-297627

The proposal calls for speeding up the peace process, reaching a political deal, permanent ceasefire, joint government and a mechanism for transferring power. Russian Special Envoy on Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov has also spoken on similar lines.Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani met politicians, including those not aligned with him or the Taliban, and decided to form an authorised delegation for peace talks. The Taliban have not responded so far.Fierce fighting continued in the eastern and northern parts of the country in the battle for two large cities -- Mazar-e-Sharif and Jalalabad. The Taliban were 11 km away from Kabul after capturing another province.The Afghan forces conducted air attacks in Nangarhar that reportedly destroyed Taliban dumps and motorcycles. The Taliban were also attacking the security belt at the entrance of Mazar-e-Sharif.Taliban spokespersons have made themselves available to Indian media to convey that New Delhi’s military support to the Afghan government “is not acceptable”. The Taliban cautioned India against considering a military presence in Afghanistan.Taliban spokespersons Suhail Shaheen and Zabihullah Mujahid, however, appreciated India's help in national projects and said its embassies and diplomats would not be harmed. Germany on Saturday had a skeletal staff left while Norway and Denmark evacuated their diplomats. The US is in the process of deploying a huge military force to evacuate its people.11 km from KabulMazar-e-Sharif, 4th-largest city, has also fallen to Taliban. The insurgents have seized two more provinces and are barely 11 km south of Kabul.Taliban warn IndiaWarning India, a Taliban spokesperson said, “They (India) have seen the fate of military presence of other countries in Afghanistan.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-taliban-on-kabuls-doorstep-us-pushes-for-9-point-peace-deal-297621
15-08-2021||Visakhapatnam||Covid-19 third wave unpredictable: AIIMS director Randeep Guleria||AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said here on Saturday that the country might not see a third wave of coronavirus disease but it largely depended on people following Covid Appropriate Behaviour.Talking to reporters at the Gitam Institute, where he received the Foundation Day Award in recognition of his services, Guleria noted that the only unpredictable part was how the virus behaved.“But I don’t think that we will see a third wave which will be as bad as the second wave,” he observed.Referring to apprehensions that the possible third wave could infect children more, the AIIMS chief pointed out that children would be “more susceptible” because they were not being vaccinated.“The general feeling is that adults are getting vaccinated, children are not being vaccinated and therefore if there is a new wave it will affect those who are more susceptible. Children will be more susceptible,” he noted.More than 50 per cent of children have already been infected as per the sero survey and have antibodies, Guleria pointed out.But, he added, hopefully there would be a (anti-Covid) vaccine for children also coming up in another month or two.Then children would also start getting vaccinated.He said the vaccines were still effective as far as severe disease was concerned. “Vaccines are helping in preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Infections are still happening but those infected are predominantly those who have not been vaccinated. That’s why we are saying more and more people need to get vaccinated,” he added.“Those getting infected even after vaccination, what we call breakthrough infection, are predominantly getting milder infection. So vaccines are effective in giving protection from severe disease,” he noted.Guleria, a renowned pulmonologist, was presented the Gitam Foundation Day Award that carried Rs 10 lakh and a citation. Gitam Institutions chairman M Sri Bharat presented the award and felicitated Guleria on the occasion.

It said when the PM will arrive at the Red Fort, he will be received by Minister of Defence Rajnath Singh, Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt and Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar.Kumar will introduce Lieutenant General Vijay Kumar Mishra, General Officer Commanding (GoC), Delhi Area, to the PM.“The GoC Delhi Area will then conduct Modi to the saluting base where a combined Inter-Services and Delhi Police Guard will present general salute to the PM.

15-08-2021||Mumbai||IT rules 2021: Bombay HC orders interim stay on clauses mandating code of ethics for digital publishers||The Bombay High Court on Saturday ordered an interim stay to the operation of clauses 9 (1) and 9 (3) of the new Information Technology Rules, 2021, for digital media pertaining to adherence to a Code of Ethics.A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni said such compulsory adherence to the code of ethics was in breach of the petitioners' right to free speech guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution. It also said that clause 9 went beyond the scope of the Information Technology Act itself.The high court also refused the Union government's request to stay the order to enable it to file an appeal. The court, however, refused to stay clauses 14 and 16 of the IT Rules that deal with the constitution of an inter-ministerial committee and blocking of content in certain situations.Legal news portal The Leaflet and journalist Nikhil Wagle had filed petitions challenging the new rules, saying they were likely to have a "chilling effect" on citizens' right to free speech guaranteed by the Constitution. On Friday, the bench had asked the Union government what was the need to introduce the recently notified Information Technology Rules, 2021 without superseding the existing IT rules that came into effect in 2009.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the Union government, had argued that the need to bring in new regulations was felt for checking the spread of fake news. Rule 9 (1) reads: “A publisher referred to in rule 8 shall observe and adhere to the Code of Ethics laid down in the Appendix annexed to these rules”.Rule 9(3) says: “For ensuring observance and adherence to the Code of Ethics by publishers operating in the territory of India, and for addressing the grievances made in relation to publishers under this Part, there shall be a three-tier structure as under— (a) Level I - Self-regulation by the publishers; (b) Level II – Self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the publishers; (c) Level III - Oversight mechanism by the Central Government”.The IT rules 2021 have come under heavy criticism for being in violation of free speech. Critics of the present dispensation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi see it as an attempt to shut down dissent, especially with regard to the digital media.—  Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-rules-2021-bombay-hc-orders-interim-stay-on-clauses-mandating-code-of-ethics-for-digital-publishers-297568

He kept attacking the terrorist with the butt of his weapon in spite of sustaining a gunshot wound,” the Army said.“Unmindful of his injuries, Rifleman Mukesh Kumar neutralised the terrorist from point-blank range ensuring no injuries to own troops or the civilians,” it added.Sepoy Ahlawat has been conferred the Shaurya Chakra award for showing “exceptional gallantry beyond the call of duty and nerves of steel” during an anti-terror operation in Jammu and Kashmir on June 20 last year, the Army said.One hardcore Pakistani terrorist was eliminated in the operation, it said.Detailing about the incident, the Army said a group of terrorists was firing indiscriminately towards the inner cordon of the troops in a bid to escape, taking cover of civilians in the area as human shields.It said Ahlawat waited for an opportune moment and fired accurately on the fleeing terrorists after exercising extreme restraint and displaying composure in the face of a rapidly escalating situation.“One of the terrorists was eliminated on the spot. The second terrorist opened heavy fire towards Sepoy Ahlawat at close range. Despite the grave danger, he showed indomitable courage to hold onto his position and continued engaging the second terrorist, injuring him and damaging his sophisticated M-4 Assault Rifle,” it said.The gallant actions of Ahlawat led to the elimination of a Pakistani terrorist, the Army said.

15-08-2021||United Nations||Modi expected to address annual UNGA session in person on Sept 25||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to address the annual high-level UN General Assembly session in person on September 25, according to a provisional list of speakers released by the UN.The list and schedule are subject to changes and the presence of world leaders in the United Nations headquarters here for the high-level annual session will significantly depend on the global Covid situation, particularly as the highly transmissible Delta variant rages in the US as well as across other UN member nations.According to the first provisional list of speakers for the General Debate at the 76th session of the UN General Assembly, Modi is scheduled to speak at the high-level session on the morning of September 25, the first leader listed for the day.In 2019, Modi travelled to New York for the high-level UN General Assembly session. Last year, world leaders, including Modi, submitted pre-recorded video statements for the United Nations General Assembly session in September, as heads of state and government could not physically attend the annual gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic.It was the first time in the UN's 75-year history that the high-level session had gone virtual. This year too, the option has been kept open for the world leaders to send in pre-recorded statements since the pandemic continues to rage across several nations around the world.The General Debate begins on September 21 and US President Joe Biden is scheduled to address the session in person, his first address to the world organisation as the American leader.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Australian leader Scott Morrison are also listed to address the General Debate in person on September 24.With leaders of Australia, India, Japan and the United States expected to attend the General Assembly session in person, it is highly likely that the Quad Leaders' Summit could take place in September around the UNGA.The US, India, Australia and Japan had in 2017 given shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the "Quad" or the Quadrilateral coalition to counter China's aggressive actions in the Indo-Pacific region.
