12-08-2021||Vibha Sharma||Armed with OBC Bill, reservations and 27 ministers, saffron strategy for upcoming elections falls in place||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 12Armed with a legislation to restore states’ power to make their own OBC lists, 27 Other Backward Classes and 12 Dalit ministers in the council of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and reservation for OBCs and EWS in the All India Quota (AIQ) scheme for undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dental courses, the BJP’s strategy for important Assembly elections in 2022 and general elections in 2024 is falling in place.While the social composition of his new team in the Centre was seen as a message to the backward and Dalit castes ahead of crucial elections in seven states, especially Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, next year, the Constitution (127th Amendment) Bill, 2021, has given the saffron party additional support, as restoring powers of states to identify backward classes has been a demand of not just regional parties but also its own OBC leaders.Yesterday, while addressing a BJP event to felicitate the 27 OBC ministers, who are part of the PM’s Council, party president JP Nadda said PM Modi has given representation to every caste and region in his government. He also took a swipe at other parties and their governments for “not giving due representation to different social groups” because “they were driven by family interests”.Nadda said apart from the 27 OBC ministers, who make up for 35 percent of the Council, there are 12 SC, eight ST and 11 women in the council of PM Modi.Recently, the government also decided to provide 27 per cent reservation for OBCs and 10 per cent reservation for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) in the All India Quota scheme for undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dental courses. The move is also expected to help the BJP and alliance partners like JD-U and Apna Dal.Observers believe that all this will combine to provide the BJP with an effective pitch to woo the OBC community and also poor among upper castes, the ‘swaran jatis’, believed to be upset with the saffron party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/armed-with-obc-bill-reservations-and-27-ministers-saffron-strategy-for-upcoming-elections-falls-in-place-296720
12-08-2021||New Delhi||Govt accommodation meant for serving officials, not retirees as benevolence: SC||Government accommodation is meant for serving officials and not retirees as a “benevolence” and distribution of largesse, the Supreme Court has said while setting aside an order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court allowing a retired public servant to retain such premises.Right to shelter does not mean right to government accommodation, the apex court said, observing that direction to allow a retired public servant to retain such premises for an indefinite period is distribution of state largesse without any policy.While allowing the appeal filed by the Centre, a bench of justices Hemant Gupta and A S Bopanna set aside the high court order and directed the retired Intelligence Bureau officer, a Kashmiri migrant, to hand over vacant physical possession of the premises on or before October 31, 2021.The bench also directed the Centre to submit a report of action taken against retired public servants, who are in government accommodation post their retirement by virtue of orders of the high courts, by November 15, 2021.The officer, who was transferred to Faridabad where he was allotted a government accommodation, had attained the age of superannuation from service on October 31, 2006.“The right to shelter does not mean right to government accommodation. The government accommodation is meant for serving officers and officials and not to the retirees as a benevolence and distribution of largesse,” the bench said in its judgement passed last week.The top court was hearing a plea against the July 2011 order of a division bench of the high court which had dismissed a petition against its single judge order.The single judge had said it was not possible for the retired officer to return to his own state due to which the order of eviction shall be kept in abeyance. The high court had also said the authorities were at liberty to provide alternative accommodation to him on nominal licence fee in Faridabad.The officer had earlier given representation to the concerned authority to allow him to retain the government accommodation and he was allowed to retain the house for another one year.Later, he submitted another representation in June 2007 to allow him to retain the house allotted to him on a nominal licence fee till the circumstances prevailing in Jammu and Kashmir improve and the government makes it possible for him to return to his native place.He was served with a notice under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupant) Act, 1971 and later, an order for eviction was passed but it was stayed by a district court in Delhi.When an objection was raised about territorial jurisdiction of Delhi court, he withdrew his appeal and filed it in Faridabad court which dismissed it in August 2009. Later, the matter reached the high court.In its verdict, the apex court referred to several judgements delivered earlier and said it was held that government accommodation is only meant for in-service officers and not for the retirees or those who have demitted office.“The compassion howsoever genuine does not give a right to a retired person from continuing to occupy a government accommodation,” it said.It noted that according to a policy framed by the government, a displaced person is to be lodged in a transit accommodation and if it is not available, then cash compensation is to be provided.“There is no policy of the central government or the state government to provide accommodation to displaced persons on account of terrorism in the state of Jammu and Kashmir,” it said. “The hardship faced by them does not lead to a corresponding duty of the state to provide them alternative government accommodation.”It noted that a section of society, more so retired public servants who have earned pension and drawn retirement benefits, cannot be said to be in such condition where the government should provide government accommodation for an unlimited period.“A section of the migrants cannot be treated as preferential citizens to give them the right to shelter at the cost of millions of other citizens who do not have a roof over their heads,” it said.The bench said right of shelter to a displaced person is satisfied when accommodation had been provided in the transit accommodation.The bench said in terms of the policy, which was considered in an earlier verdict of the apex court, Kashmiri migrants are entitled to transit accommodation and if transit accommodation could not be provided then money for residence and expenses.It said the retired officer in the matter and such persons are not from the poorest section of migrants and have worked in the higher echelons of the bureaucracy.“To say that they are enforcing their right to shelter only till such time the conditions are conducive for their safe return is wholly illusory. No one is sure that at what point of time the condition will be conducive to the satisfaction of the migrants. Such benevolence and preferential right to section of the citizens is unfair to the serving officers,” it said.It set aside the high court’s order and restored the writ petition challenging the order under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupant) Act, 1971.

12-08-2021||New Delhi||64% rise in ransomware attacks in last one year: Report||There has been a 64 per cent increase in ransomware attacks between August 2020 and July 2021, revealed a report on Thursday.Barracuda, a cloud-enabled security solutions provider, in its latest Threat Spotlight, analysed 121 ransomware incidents between August 2020 and July 2021. They found many attacks are being led by a handful of high-profile ransomware gangs. Ransomware gang Revil accounted for 19 per cent of the attacks while new ransomware strain DarkSide caused 8 per cent of the attacks. "Ransomware criminals have refined their tactics to create a double extortion scheme. The initial steps towards safeguarding an organisation from any possible ransomware attack involve assuming vulnerability and setting a goal of not paying the ransom," said Murali Urs, Country Manager, Barracuda Networks India, in a statement. It is also "necessary to implement anti-phishing capabilities in email and other collaboration tools, and consistently train your users for email security awareness," and "crucial to stay put with a secure data protection solution that can identify your critical data assets and implement disaster and recovery capabilities", Urs said. Ransomware criminals are penetrating the foundation of the digital economy across the globe, from trusted software vendors to IT service providers. Attacks on corporations, such as infrastructure, travel, financial services, and other businesses, made up 57 per cent of all ransomware attacks between August 2020 and July 2021, up from just 18 per cent in Barracuda Network's 2020 study. Infrastructure-related businesses account for 10 per cent of all the attacks. In fact, ransomware attacks are quickly evolving to software supply chain attacks, which reach more businesses in a single attempt.While analysing the ransom payment trends in the past years, Barracuda researchers are also witnessing a dramatic spike in the amount. The average ransom being demanded per incident is over $10 million dollars.  Only 18 per cent of the incidents had less than $10 million ransom demand, and 30 per cent of the incidents had greater than $30 million dollars ransom asks. However, there have been multiple instances of victims reducing ransom payments by deploying negotiation tactics. JBS negotiated a $22.5 million ransom payment down to $11 million, and Brenntag, a chemical distributor in Germany, negotiated a $7.5 million ransom demand down to $4.4 million, the report said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/64-rise-in-ransomware-attacks-in-last-one-year-report-296708

The mission can be rescheduled some time again, he said.“ISRO has the resilience to bounce back. And it will. However, it should be allowed to function as a scientific and technological enterprise as put in place by Vikram Sarabhai and Satish Dhawan. There is far too much political grandstanding on it now,” Ramesh, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change, tweeted.Sarabhai is widely regarded as the father of the Indian Space programme. He died in 1971.Hitting back, Singh said, “Jairam ji, please don’t forget, most of Space related pitfalls, including mysterious midnight death of Vikram Sarabhai, happened during Congress regime. Going by the same analogy, had Congress refrained from political interference, Sarabhai could have contributed valuably for many more years.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isro-should-be-allowed-to-work-as-scientific-enterprise-says-jairam-govt-hits-back-296707

The review process by WHO has commenced. WHO usually takes up to six weeks to decide on Emergency Use Listing (EUL) submissions.”Developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research, Covaxin was approved for emergency use on January 3. Trial results later showed the vaccine has an efficacy of 78 per cent.

It shows how the BJP has politicised the central forces to serve its political interests. We have seen how CAPF were used to capture booths and kill people at Sitalkuchi in Coochbehar during the assembly poll in West Bengal,” she said.Four persons were killed in firing by the CAPF at a polling station at Sitalkuchi in Coochbehar on April, the fourth phase of polling in the state.“This (questions) is too much and completely unacceptable. What is the message they (Centre) are trying to send out through this incident ? That if you want to work in the central forces, you have to be a yes man of BJP and believe whatever canards they are spreading,” she said.The feisty TMC boss slammed the BJP for trying to destroy the “secular fabric and constitution of the country”.“This is politicising of the entire recruitment process. They (UPSC) are supposed to be neutral. It's an effort to malign all people who are in opposition. They (BJP) have also politicised the NHRC,” she added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/politically-motivated-questions-in-capf-recruitment-exam-mamata-296685

However, lander Vikram hard-landed on September 7, crashing India's dream to become the first nation to successfully land on the lunar surface in its maiden attempt.The orbiter of the mission is working fine and has been sending data to Chandrayaan-1, the first lunar mission, and showed evidence that there was water on the moon, the paper said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chandrayaan-2-detects-presence-of-water-molecules-on-moon-296662
12-08-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court stays Gujarat High Court order granting 2-week furlough to Narayan Sai||The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed a Gujarat High Court order granting two-week furlough to rape convict Narayan Sai, son of self-styled godman Asaram Bapu, who is also undergoing life term for another rape case in Rajasthan.The apex court, however, said it needs to examine whether the rules allow the annual furlough as per the calendar year or from 12 months after the last one was granted to a prisoner.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah issued a notice to Sai on the Gujarat government's plea challenging the high court's single-judge order and stayed it till further orders.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Gujarat government, said the single-judge order of June 24, 2021, granted furlough to Sai for two weeks but the division bench had stayed it till August 13 and, therefore, the state has moved the top court challenging the June 24 order.The bench said that under the Bombay Furlough and Parole Rules, applicable in Gujarat as well, a prisoner can be granted furlough once every year after he completes seven years in jail.“The idea of furlough is that a prisoner gets away from the environment of jail and is able to meet his family,” the bench said, and asked Mehta what are grievances with the order.Mehta replied that under the rules and even in a judgment of this court, it has been held that furlough is not an absolute right and it depends on various factors.He said Sai and his father were arrested for offences under rape charges and they wield considerable influence with money and muscle power.Mehta pointed out that they had even tried to bribe police officials, mobile phones were recovered from their cells in jail and even three prime witnesses crucial to their cases were killed.The bench said that now that he is convicted, all these contentions will not hold good as he was also granted furlough in December last year, which the state government has never challenged.Mehta said that last year Sai was granted furlough for two weeks as he wanted to visit his ailing mother and it was purely on humanitarian grounds that the state government did not find it appropriate to challenge that order.The bench then asked Mehta, whether during his last furlough were there any incidents of law and order situation or was there any danger to peace and tranquillity to which he replied that it is not on record. Mehta said, “Problem now is that he is seeking furlough as a matter of right that he should be released every year on furlough.”The bench said the point which needs examination is that under the rules it is said that a prisoner can avail furlough once every year after he serves seven year in imprisonment."Whether once every year means once every calendar year or once every year means since the last time he got furlough. This is the point we need to examine. We are issuing notice to the respondent (Narayan Sai),” the bench said.It asked the counsel appearing for Sai to file his reply within a week and posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.On April 26, 2019, Sai was convicted under the Indian Penal Code Sections 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offences), 323 (assault), 506-2 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (conspiracy) by a Surat court and sentenced to life imprisonment.In 2013, after Asaram was arrested for allegedly raping a girl in Rajasthan, two Surat-based sisters had accused Asaram and his son of sexual exploitation.The elder sister had accused Asaram of sexual assaults between 1997 and 2006 when she lived at his Ahmedabad ashram.The younger sister had accused his son of sexual assaults when she lived at Asaram's ashram in the Jahangirpura area of Surat between 2002 and 2005.The incidents of multiple sexual assaults and unnatural sex with the victim had taken place between 2002 and 2005, but the case against Sai had been filed only in 2013.Sai was arrested from the Delhi-Haryana border in December 2013.When Sai was in jail, Surat police had claimed to have unearthed elaborate plans to bribe police officers, doctors and even judicial officers to weaken the case against him.

The first shoot for 'The Sherlyn Chopra' app was to be done by Amsprime. It was a new experience for me as I had never connected earlier with any such app. It was a moment of hope and excitement. People are asking me where the shoot's location was," she wrote alongside the picture."This shoot was done at the studio of well-known Bollywood photographer Munna," she wrote along with the latest picture.Sherlyn had earlier been summoned by the Mumbai Crime Branch’s Property Cell and was asked to appear before them for questioning in connection to the pornography case involving Raj Kundra.The Property Cell had earlier summoned Chopra to appear before them on July 27 to record her statement in the pornography case. The actress had also applied to the Mumbai Sessions Court for anticipatory bail in the porn racket case, fearing arrest like co-accused Kundra. However, the Mumbai Sessions court had rejected her bail application. Chopra had moved the anticipatory bail application before the court through her lawyer.“My production company was never associated with Raj Kundra’s company. I signed an agreement with his company Armsprime as a celebrity artist. Hotshots made pornographic films with some other talent. Since hotshots, Bollywood Flame and Armsprime were all connected to Kundra and I had an agreement with his company. I was called in to throw some light on the terms and conditions. I told the officers that never did I shoot any videos for hotshots or other alleged apps of Mr Kundra," Sherlyn had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sherlyn-chopra-posts-new-picture-with-raj-kundra-photographer-munna-as-people-ask-shoots-location-296651

It will also allow customers the flexibility to pay via any payment options (online or cash) at the end of the journey, it added.SpiceJet launched SpiceScreen, a complimentary in-flight entertainment system in August last year, which is can be accessed on any of the passengers’ handheld devices, including a smartphone, tablet or laptop, by simply connecting to the onboard wireless network.The airline will also offer special discounted fares exclusively to passengers exercising this option for booking their cabs, it said, adding it will not charge for cancellation if a passenger fails to board the cab for any reason.Since the service aims to make the last mile connectivity all the easier, flyers will not have to carry their heavy luggage to the cab departure area as they will now be available right outside the arrival gate, SpiceJet said.“With the launch of our industry-first SpiceScreen midair airport transfer service, we aim to elevate the customer experience to the next level.

All of them were given show cause notice...one did not respond, so in view of the lack of response, his service is already terminated,” Vyas told the court.He said as far as the vaccine in general is concerned, it is optional, but so far as the Air Force is concerned, it is now made a service condition, which is in continuation of the oath taken at the time of enrollment in the service.Also, it is imperative to see to it that the Force is not put in a vulnerable state, and it is required for personnel to mandatorily get vaccinated, he told the court.Vyas also said since corporal Yogendra Kumar has responded to the show-cause notice, he can either appear before a proper authority or the Armed Forces Tribunal, under provisions of the Armed Forces Tribunal Act.On the plea of Kumar, challenging the notice after his unwillingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19, the HC on Wednesday directed the IAF to consider his case afresh.The court disposed of his plea after ordering that the interim relief granted to the petitioner unwilling to get vaccinated shall continue until his case is decided by the IAF, and the same shall not be implemented for a period of two weeks from the date of service of the order to the petitioner.Kumar had approached the court, seeking quashing of the show-cause notice, dated May 10, 2021, issued to him by the IAF after he declined to get vaccinated against Covid-19.The IAF had asked him to show cause why he should not be dismissed for not taking Covid-19 vaccine.He had also sought the court’s direction to direct the IAF to not take coercive action against him in furtherance of the show cause notice.Kumar also requested the court to direct the IAF to follow the Central Government’s order that the vaccine is purely voluntary and not mandatory.

Given the context of the pandemic, its evolving nature, following of “Covid-appropriate behaviour” has emerged as one of the most critical measures for preventing the spread of the disease, Pawar said in a written answer.It is the moral and ethical responsibility of the government to ensure that such critical messages are disseminated to people in the most effective manner. The format of vaccination certificate, including the message and presentation about the importance of following Covid-appropriate behaviour even after vaccination, is compliant with the WHO norms for vaccination certificates, Pawar said.All states/UTs are using Co-WIN application for Covid vaccination and the certificates are generated through Co-WIN in a standard format, Pawar added.Ketkar had also asked whether any central government before the present one made it compulsory to print the photograph of the Prime Minister on the certificate of any vaccine administered for deadly diseases such as polio, smallpox, etc. Pawar did not answer this question.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modis-photo-on-vaccination-certificate-inspires-covid-appropriate-behaviour-says-union-health-ministry-296627
12-08-2021||United Nations/Geneva||Covid numbers in South East Asia plateau mainly due to cases in India remaining stable: WHO||The Covid numbers in the South-East Asia region peaked in early May and have since largely plateaued over the past month mainly due to cases in India remaining stable and consistent decreases in Indonesia and Myanmar over the past month, the WHO has said.The Covid Weekly Epidemiological Update, released by the World Health Organisation on August 10, said the South-East Asia Region reported over 799,000 new cases, a five per cent decrease as compared to the previous week. However, several countries in the region continue to report increasing trends, including Sri Lanka and Thailand (26 per cent and 20 per cent increases, respectively).“Case incidences in the region peaked in early May and have since largely plateaued over the past month. This is largely due to cases in India remaining stable, and consistent decreases in Indonesia and Myanmar over the past month,” the update said.It added that following a steep increase in the mortality rate in the region, this is the first time in seven weeks that a decline in the number of new weekly deaths has been reported; a trend largely driven by declines in the Maldives and Myanmar this week.Large increases in weekly deaths were reported in several countries including Sri Lanka (47 per cent increase), Nepal (35 per cent) and Thailand (30 per cent).The highest number of new cases were reported from India (278,631 new cases; 20.2 new cases per 100,000; 2 per cent decrease), Indonesia (225,635 new cases; 82.5 new cases per 100,000; 18 per cent decrease), and Thailand (141,191 new cases; 202.3 new cases per 100 000; 20 per cent increase).In the region, the highest numbers of new deaths were reported from Indonesia (11,373 new deaths; 4.2 new deaths per 100,000; 9 per cent decrease), India (3511 new deaths; 0.3 new deaths per 100,000; 8 per cent decrease), and Myanmar (2045 new deaths; 3.8 new deaths per 100,000; 22 per cent decrease).Globally, cases of the Alpha variant have been reported in 185 countries, territories or areas, while 142 countries reported cases of the Delta variant, 136 countries reported cases of the Beta variant and 81 countries reported cases of the Gamma variant.The update said that on August 5, the cumulative number of Covid cases globally surpassed 200 million, just six months after reaching 100 million cases.This week alone, over 4.2 million new cases and over 65,000 new deaths were reported, a slight increase as compared to the previous week.

The SG had also told the HC that since the subject matter of the inquiry relates to probe of offences by agencies authorised to conduct such investigation, “there cannot be any inquiry into the same by any authority other than the court”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gold-smuggling-kerala-hc-stays-probe-against-ed-296508

12-08-2021||New Delhi||Punjab CM Amarinder meets PM Modi, seeks repeal of controversial farm laws||Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately initiate steps for the repeal of the three controversial farm laws, and amendment to the relevant law for including farmers in free legal aid category.The Chief Minister, who called on the Prime Minister here late this evening and submitted two separate letters, called for immediate review and revocation of the three farm laws that had triggered widespread resentment among farmers of Punjab and other states, who had been protesting at the Delhi borders since November 26 last year.Pointing to the prolonged agitation, which had cost the lives of more than 400 farmers and farm workers, the Chief Minister said the stir had the potential of posing security threats for Punjab and the country with Pakistan-backed anti-India forces looking to exploit the farmers’ disgruntlement with the government.Urging the Prime Minister’s intervention for expeditious redressal of the farmers’ legitimate concerns by the Government of India to explore an enduring solution, the Chief Minister said the continued agitation was not only impacting economic activities in Punjab but also had the potential to affect the social fabric, especially when political parties and groups take strong positions.Captain Amarinder noted that he had earlier, too, sought the Prime Minister’s appointment for a meeting with an all-party delegation from Punjab. He further underlined the need to compensate farmers for the management of paddy straw @ Rs 100 per quintal and also to address the fears of DAP shortage, which could aggravate the farmers’ problems and the crisis triggered by the farm laws.In another letter, the Chief Minister stressed that due to the fragmentation of landholdings, and persistent disputes with lessees and various market operators and agents, the farmers are also facing heightened litigation these days, causing stress on their meagre financial resources.Stressing the need to reduce the farmers’ financial burden as a result of such litigation, he noted that the Central Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, provides free legal aid to certain categories of persons, who are perceived to be the vulnerable sections of the society. Pointing out that the country’s farmers are also very vulnerable, he said that they are, at times, compelled to commit suicide due to financial problems, even though they remain proud and prefer to till their land even at the cost of their lives.“It is, thus, the need of the hour to amend Section 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, to include farmers and farm workers in the category of persons entitled to free legal services to pursue and defend themselves in the courts to secure their livelihood,” said Captain Amarinder. He felt this step would help reduce cases of farmer suicides and ensure better protection of their legal and financial rights.The Chief Minister urged the Prime Minister to advise the concerned central ministries dealing with farmer welfare and laws to carry out necessary amendments to the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, in the larger interest of the farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-cm-amarinder-meets-pm-modi-seeks-repeal-of-controversial-farm-laws-296233

12-08-2021||New Delhi||Chandigarh, Himachal, Rajasthan lead 1st national ranking on quality of life for elderly||Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Chandigarh lead the first national rankings on the Quality of Life for Elderly Index. This was released on Wednesday by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.The Index has been created by the Institute for Competitiveness to assess the challenge of ageing in India and determine the preparedness of states to deal with a rising elderly population.India is currently enjoying the demographic dividend but will be growing older, with persons above the age of 65 becoming the fastest-growing age group by 2050. Greying is not very rapid in India, as only 8.6 pc of its population are elderly. However, by 2050 the elderly population will grow by three times to 319 million, accounting for 19.5 pc of the total population.Further, there will be a significantly higher proportion of women than men in the higher age cohort due to higher life expectancy, marking an increase of 21.07 years over 19.10 years in their male counterparts.“India needs to grab the current opportunity to continuously evolve the systems and start putting positive change in motion for the next decades. The Index on Quality of Life for Elderly 2021 represents a beginning,” says the report, which separately ranks states and UTs on the elderly wellbeing index.Rajasthan is the top scorer in the aged states category defined as states with an elderly population of more than 5 million.Himachal Pradesh leads in the Relatively-Aged States section (below 5 million population).Mizoram leads in the North Eastern States category and Chandigarh among all UTs.The report identifies the regional patterns of ageing across the Indian States and assesses the overall ageing situation in India. The report presents a deeper insight into how well India is doing to support the well-being of its ageing population.The Index framework includes four pillars: Financial Well-being, Social Well-being, Health System and Income Security, and eight sub-pillars: Economic Empowerment, Educational Attainment & Employment, Social Status, Physical Security, Basic Health, Psychological Wellbeing, Social Security and Enabling Environment.Chairman, Economic Advisory Council to the PM Bibek Debroy said, “India is often portrayed as a young society, with a consequent demographic dividend. But, as with every country that goes through a fast process of demographic transition, India also has a greying cum ageing problem. EAC-PM requested Dr Amit Kapoor and his team at Institute for Competitiveness to report on an issue that is often not mentioned- the problems faced by the elderly.”The health system pillar of the elderly observes the highest national average of 66.97 at an all-India level, followed by 62.34 in the Social Well-being category.Financial Well-being observes a score of 44.7, which is lowered by the low performance of 21 States across the Education Attainment and Employment pillar, which showcases scope for improvementStates have performed particularly worse in the Income Security pillar because over half of the States have a score below the national average, i.e., 33.03 in Income Security, which is the lowest across all pillars. These pillar-wise analyses help states assess the state of the elderly population and identify existing gaps that obstruct their growth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chandigarh-himachal-rajasthan-lead-1st-national-ranking-on-quality-of-life-for-elderly-296199

After saying “sleepless night”, Naidu had an extended pause when he tried to control his emotions looking down at the desk in front of him. He finally said “last night” with some effort as his voice choked.Naidu said Parliament was like a temple of democracy and the area where the scribes (reporters who take down the speeches), the secretary general and the presiding officer sat was like the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. Devotees were not allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum ordinarily. But, this custom was being routinely violated in the House. Some members even climbed atop the scribes’ table to gain better visibility, the Chairman said.Naidu said Tuesday was a “golden opportunity” for opposition members to express their views on the three farm laws. “But it was not to be as their (opposition members’) sole intention seemed not to allow the House to function,” Naidu said.This attracted a loud protest from the opposition benches prompting Naidu to adjourn the House till noon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-chairman-venkaiah-naidu-broke-down-in-rajya-sabha-said-he-had-a-sleepless-night-296163

The date of reopening has been postponed many times."Protecting the health and safety of Canadians continues to be our top priority. After reviewing public health data, we have decided to extend the direct flight ban between Canada and India until September 21," Omar Alghabra, Minister of Transport of Canada, tweeted on Tuesday."The Government of Canada has suspended flights from India until September 21. During that period, passengers who travel to Canada from India via an indirect route will need to obtain a pre-departure negative Covid molecular test result from a third country before continuing their journey to Canada," Transport Canada said in a statement on Monday."Travellers who have previously tested positive for Covid must provide proof of a positive Covid molecular test conducted between 14 and 90 days before departure, instead of a negative Covid molecular test. This proof must be obtained in a third country before the continuation of the journey to Canada. You might need to seek entry and stay in a third country for at least 14 days," it said.Also, the Canadian government continues to closely monitor the epidemiological situation and will be working closely with the Government of India and aviation operators to ensure appropriate procedures are put in place to enable a safe return of direct flights as soon as conditions permit, the release said.
