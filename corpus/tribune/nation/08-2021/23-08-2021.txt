23-08-2021||New Delhi||Under BJP govt, country’s assets not safe: Congress on National Monetisation Pipeline||The Congress on Monday accused the BJP of selling the country’s assets after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveiled an ambitious Rs 6 lakh crore National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP).Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that under the BJP, the country’s assets will not be saved.“Sale of country’s properties worth Rs 6 lakh crore—roads, rail, mines, telecom, power, gas, airports, ports, sports stadium...Modi ji will sell everything from the earth to the sky. If there is BJP, then the assets of the country will not be saved,” Surjewala said in a tweet in Hindi, using the hashtag “#StopSellingIndia”.Finance Minister Sitharaman unveiled the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) that included unlocking value by involving private companies across infrastructure sectors—from passenger trains and railway stations to airports, roads and stadiums.As many as 25 Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports, including ones at Chennai, Bhopal, Varanasi and Vadodara, as well as 40 railway stations, 15 stadiums and an unidentified number of railway colonies have been identified for getting private investments.Stating that there is no transfer of ownership or land, she said, “The NMP talks about brownfield infra assets where investments have already been made, where there is a completed asset which is either languishing or which is remaining not fully monetised or which is remaining underutilised.”  “So by bringing in private participation into this, you are going to be able to monetise it better, and with whatever resources you obtain through the monetisation, you will be able to put in further investment into infrastructure,” she said.The total indicative value of NMP for core assets of the Central government has been estimated at Rs 6 lakh crore over the four-year period FY22 to FY25.

23-08-2021||Vibha Sharma||Air pollution impacting monsoon, India at a risk of losing 10-15% of mean rainfall in coming years: Experts||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 23While air pollution’s health and economic impacts are well established, experts say it is also impacting the Southwest Monsoon and the country is at a risk of losing 10%-15% of mean rains in coming years.Places with highest levels of air pollution will see maximum impact with some seeing a reduction in rains by almost half of their average rainfall, they say. Besides a decline in precipitation due to anthropogenic (human-led) emitting sources in the atmosphere, the country might also see a surge in extreme weather events such as torrential rains, severe hailstorms or increasing number of dry days on account of rising air pollution, they add.Air pollution is the result of suspended particles or aerosols in the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources along with natural dust. Monsoon, meanwhile, is a seasonal oceanic phenomenon governed by the change in the wind pattern due to differential heating of the tropics, driven by the temperature difference between land and ocean.While increase in the concentration leads to warming of the atmosphere it also simultaneously cools land surface and according to meteorologists, any kind of change in differential heating of land and ocean will impact the wind pattern.Dr Dilip Ganguly from the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT- Delhi, says air pollution is likely to decrease the Monsoon rainfall by 10%-15% for the entire country.“Meanwhile, some places might even see reduced rains as high as 50%.“Air pollution does not allow the landmass to warm up to the required levels. Due to the presence of pollutants, heating of land takes place at a slower rate. For instance, the required surface temperature is 40°C, while the presence of air pollution will result in restricting temperature up to 38°C or 39°C,” he adds.Endorsing the views, Prof S N Tripathi from IIT-Kanpur and Steering Committee Member, National Clean Air Programme, said, “the most affected places would be the areas with more pollution levels”. “The Southwest Monsoon is driven by the difference between land temperatures and ocean temperatures. Presence of a large scale of aerosols over the Indian landmass would lead to dimming of the land surface. The entire process would lead to weakening of the dynamics of Monsoon, which might even include delay in onset of Monsoon,” he added.Delhi gets its first smog towerDelhi, one of the most polluted cities in the country, today got its first smog tower, a 20-metre-tall structure in Connaught Place to combat rising air pollution, to varying opinions with some calling it “a waste of money” and others a “necessity that will improve lives of citizens”.It was inaugurated by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.Officials said the government will study the impact of smog tower on pollution and could add more such structures across the Capital.Smog towers are structures designed to work as large-scale air purifiers and are fitted with multiple layers of air filters and fans to suck the air.“This solution will hopefully reduce India’s urban air pollution thereby improving the lives of citizens. Large areas of cities can be covered if such smog towers are strategically placed at densely populated urban locations,” said Sandeep Navlakhe from Tata Projects Ltd, the makers of the tower.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-pollution-impacting-monsoon-india-at-a-risk-of-losing-10-15-of-mean-rainfall-in-coming-years-experts-301068
23-08-2021||New Delhi||Sikh bodies working on relief efforts for Afghan nationals arriving in India after Taliban takeover||Sikh humanitarian organisations in the Delhi-NCR have started working on relief efforts to help out Afghan nationals who have fled their country to arrive in India, following Afghanistan’s takeover by the Taliban.From arranging accommodations to making education provisions for the children of those who have come seeking aid, organisations like the Hemkunt Foundation, Khalsa Aid International, and the Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee (DSGMC) have stepped up to lend a helping hand.“Whatsoever effort is required to rehabilitate the Afghans coming to India, we will do that … whether it is accommodation or any other kind of financial aid,” DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa told PTI.He said the committee’s guest houses across Delhi would be available to all Afghans who were compelled to leave their own country, beginning Monday night.“People will start coming in from today, and arrangements have been made for them to stay at the Bangla Sahib gurdwara,” Sirsa said.Afghanistan has been in a state of panic ever since its former President Ashraf Ghani abdicated his chair earlier this month, leaving large parts of the country to be taken over by the Islamist militant group.What ensued was chaos across several Afghan cities, with thousands of Afghan citizens flooding the Kabul airport in the hope of leaving their homeland for a safer place.India has been evacuating people from Kabul over the last one week. On Sunday, 168 people, including 107 Indians and 23 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, were flown in from Kabul to the Hindon airbase near Delhi in a C-17 heavy-lift military transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force.Pre-empting the need for rehabilitating Afghans arriving in India in wake of the current circumstances in their country, the Hemkunt Foundation has recreated their tent city model from the Singhu border, one of the biggest protest sites of the ongoing farmers agitation, in Gurgaon.The facility has a capacity to house 500 individuals and will be functional from Tuesday afternoon, said Harteerath Singh, community development director at the Hemkunt Foundation.“In our tent city, we will be giving food and accommodation to refugees and Afghans who are here legally only. The women will be inside a permanent structure, and the men will be inside waterproof insulated tents. We have coolers, water, food and all kinds of provisions for them to be comfortable,” Singh said.He said that while the foundation will take in all Afghan nationals irrespective of their religion and caste, passports and visas will be checked.“At the moment, we are hoping to reach out to those in need through word of mouth, but we will be rolling out a helpline soon so that those seeking aid can call on that number,” Singh added.Similar efforts are being undertaken by the Khalsa Aid International which will be launching a helpline soon to make help accessible to those flying in from Afghanistan.“While the finer details are yet to be worked out, we will be launching a helpline soon so that Afghans coming in India and in need of help can approach us.“Provisions, including accommodation, as well as education for their children will be made available by us,” said Khalsa Aid director Amarpreet Singh.

I purchased the vehicle though it was old as it belonged to the actor in 2019. I have applied for the change of name for registration, but somehow it could not be done.”“We own two Rolls-Royce cars. Another is a new one. My children take Amitabh Bachchan’s car during Sundays and holidays. My daughter was travelling in the car when it was seized. The officers have asked her to come to the RTO office located in Nelamangala in the outskirts of the city. She had requested them to let her get dropped to the house, they have obliged,” he said.“I spoke to the Transport Commissioner and asked him not to trouble us unnecessarily. He explained that there are many cars running with a single registration number in the city and they are keeping tabs on that.  He had asked us to produce valid documents and get the car released. I will do so,” Babu explained.Transport department Additional Commissioner Narendra Holkar stated that the Rolls-Royce car was seized for not having proper documents. The owner produced a letter signed by Amitabh Bachchan stating that the vehicle is being sold to him.Incidentally, the man at the wheel at the time of the car’s seizure, was the driver whose name is Salman Khan.

According to the police, the woman identified as Nirmala smashed the head of her husband with a hand pounder after a fight.The Mangalagiri police have registered a complaint from the brother of the victim Chilaka Ramesh that states Chilaka Ramesh and Nirmala had fallen in love and married a decade ago. They were living in Tadikonda village.Around five years ago, Ramesh, who worked as a security guard, suffered from a brain stroke but recovered. But ever since, the couple started quarrelling and on several occasions, the wife even threatened to kill her husband.During a heated exchange, Nirmala had smashed her husband’s head after which she told the neighbours that Ramesh had hurt himself after a fall. He was shifted to Guntur General Hospital, where he died on Saturday.On Sunday, when his elder brother came for attending final rites, he spotted an injury on Ramesh’s head and immediately complained to the police who took Nirmala and her family members into custody.

23-08-2021||New Delhi||Umar Khalid calls Delhi riots conspiracy case ‘cooked up’, points to contradictions||Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in the north-east Delhi riots conspiracy case, told a Delhi Court on Monday that there were various contradictions in the police’s claims and called it a “cooked up” case.Khalid, along with several others, has been booked under the stringent anti-terror law UAPA. They are accused of being the “masterminds” of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. He has sought bail in the case.Trideep Pais, Khalid’s lawyer, told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that the FIR was cooked up and unnecessary, and was used selectively to target and frame them.The counsel pointed to two contradictions in Delhi Police’s claims. Firstly, he showed the court a 21-minute video clip of Khalid’s speech in Maharashtra, which the prosecution had allegedly labelled inflammatory.The lawyer, pursuant to showing the video, apprised the court that his client did not give any call for violence through the speech and in fact gave a message of unity to the people.“A message of unity based on Gandhi ji was given by Umar Khalid that day. It was termed as terror. Content is not seditious. He is talking about democratic power. He referred to Gandhi,” Pais added.Secondly, he argued that as per the police case, Khalid conspired with other accused on January 8 to cause riots during former US President Donald Trump’s visit, however, the news about his visit was announced only in February.“These are the kind of lies they are peddling. This is a joke. This FIR is a cooked-up theory. Is it that easy to prosecute people? Do you have no responsibility as a prosecution?” Pais said.Delhi Police had recently said the bail plea has no merit and that it will demonstrate the prima facie case against him before the court by referring to the charge sheet filed in the case.In April, the former JNU student was granted bail in one of the riot cases. The court while granting him bail noted that he was not physically present at the scene of the crime on the date of the incident.Besides him, JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have also been booked under the stringent law in the case.

23-08-2021||New Delhi||Aravali: Demolition of illegal structure to continue, observes SC; civic body says farmhouses razed||The Supreme Court on Monday said that demolition of all unauthorised structures standing on Aravali forest land in Faridabad’s Khori village has to continue, even as the municipal corporation informed it that some farmhouses have already been razed there.The apex court, while hearing an application filed by owners of some marriage halls which have received notices from the civic body, said that Faridabad Municipal Corporation has to proceed and demolish the unauthorised structures as per law.A bench comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said as per previous order of the apex court, the intervenors are supposed to make representation to the concerned authority which will consider them.“Let the corporation decide on your representation and after that is decided, we will consider what course of action can be adopted. Today, all unauthorised structures are being demolished and that has to continue,” the bench told the counsel appearing for the owners of some marriage halls.The counsel appearing for the municipal corporation told the bench that they have filed a compliance report in the matter on Monday and as far as representation is concerned, there is already a direction by the court and the authority will consider it in accordance with law.“We have already demolished few farm houses,” the lawyer appearing for the civic body said.When the bench said it would hear the matter after two weeks, the counsel appearing for marriage hall owners submitted that in the meantime, the authority should not demolish their structures while they consider their representation.The bench told the counsel that they can make representations and the authority will consider it.“If it is unauthorised, it has to be demolished as per the present law and legal position. The corporation has to proceed. Let them proceed,” the bench observed and posted the matter for hearing on September 6. The apex court had on August 3 said all unauthorised structures on Aravali forest land in Khori village will have to go as its order passed in the matter regarding demolition of such buildings was “very clear”.On July 23, the top court had granted four more weeks to the municipal corporation to remove encroachments on the Aravali forest land, after the civic body had said unauthorised structures on nearly half of the total 150 acre area has been cleared.The bench was last month informed that the municipal corporation has undertaken a planned drive to remove unauthorised constructions and so far, 74 acres out of 150 acres was cleared and back in the possession of the civic body.On June 7, the top court had directed state of Haryana and Faridabad municipal corporation to remove “all encroachments”, consisting around 10,000 residential constructions, in Aravali forest area near the village, saying “land grabbers cannot take refuge of rule of law” and talk of “fairness”.It had passed the June 7 order after hearing a separate plea filed by five alleged encroachers against the demolition drive of civic body.

23-08-2021||Kolkata||No instant solution on whether to reopen schools amid Covid-19 pandemic: Amartya Sen||There is no instant answer to the debate over the opening of school campuses amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen said.Speaking in an online discussion organised by Pratichi—an organisation founded with his Nobel endowment to promote education and alleviate poverty, Sen said on Sunday that children are suffering a lot as schools are closed but also concerns over their health cannot be ignored if campuses reopen.“In America, there is an ongoing debate between two groups on the same issue. In India, there are different opinions. But, what may be applicable in the east of Birbhum may not work in the west of Bankura. There cannot be a readymade reply, an instant reply at hand, the situation is not so,” Sen said.On the evaluation model in the present scenario, the economist said acquiring and sharing knowledge is more important.“Even if we put emphasis on the evaluation we must remember it is not the last thing. Acquiring and sharing knowledge comes first. There are reasons to believe that the issue should be seen from different sides and perspectives,” he said.“When we learn something for the first time, when we first comprehend the matter....is that linked with evaluation? We have to see. Evaluation will be certainly of use, but how much and in what way? We have to see if there is a link between evaluation and real education,” Sen pointed out.Asked about the threats to the environment, he said that either the world is aware of the problems and knows the solution but not proceeding in the right path or there need to be threadbare discussions to find the directions to solve the crisis.“Environment is an integral part of every work, every step taken by us,” he reasoned.Sen, who is currently a Thomas W Lamont University Professor, and Professor of Economics and Philosophy at Harvard University, also stressed on tapping alternative energy resources such as solar and nuclear to protect the environment.

After a preliminary inquiry, the Chennai police had found enough evidence to register an FIR and subsequently arrest him,” he said.Varma said the case (of the woman's death) "may have other facets which are not clearly visible at this stage".      The Russian Consulate was monitoring the case and would provide all required information and assistance to the Goa police, he added.

23-08-2021||New Delhi||Afghan crisis: Union minister Hardeep Puri outlines need for CAA||With Hindus and Sikhs settled in Afghanistan fleeing the country after its takeover by the Taliban, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri has outlined the need for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).In a tweet on Sunday, the senior BJP leader said, "Recent developments in our volatile neighbourhood & the way Sikhs & Hindus are going through a harrowing time are precisely why it was necessary to enact the Citizenship Amendment Act."The Government of India has undertaken a massive evacuation exercise to airlift Hindus, Sikhs and natives from the neighbouring country passing through a phase of volatile uncertainty for its people.The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, which came into force on January 10, 2020, witnessed widespread protests across the country with Delhi emerging as a hub of resistance against the legislation.Most of the Opposition parties vociferously protested against the Citizenship Amendment Bill, introduced in Parliament by the Modi government, alleging it of being "communal" in nature.The CAA grants citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on the grounds of religious persecution faced by them in their native country.India on August 17 announced that it would issue an emergency e-visa to Afghan nationals who wanted to come to the country in view of the prevailing situation in Afghanistan.All Afghans, irrespective of their religion, can apply for the 'e-Emergency X-Misc Visa' online and the applications will be processed in New Delhi."The Ministry of Home Affairs reviews visa provisions in view of the current situation in Afghanistan. A new category of electronic visa called 'e-Emergency X-Misc Visa' introduced to fast-track visa applications for entry into India," a home ministry spokesperson had said.The visa would initially be valid for six months, officials had said.

He has been arrested under UAPA and sedition.During the hearing, advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir, representing the accused, apprised Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that no part of his speech called for any kind of violence to be initiated.“When Sharjeel Imam says that this piece of legislation (CAA/NRC) is unconstitutional, and seeks to persuade the government to rethink and says if you don't do it, we will be on the streets, he cannot be hammered by sedition,” the counsel asserted.He further said that the right to protest, the right to blockade, and the right to bring the country to a standstill are not equal to an act of sedition.“The speech did not call for violence. He just called for a road blockade. He did not say that the northeast should become a different state and declare independence. That would have been seditious,” advocate Mir added.He emphasised that Imam is not a member of any banned organisation or terrorist gang but is merely a student.The alleged inflammatory speeches were made at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019, and at Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, 2019. He is in judicial custody since January 28, 2020.Imam is accused of offenses relating to sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief under the Indian Penal Code, and indulging in unlawful activities under the UAPA.Delhi Police had filed a charge sheet against Imam in the case, in which it alleged that he allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the Central Government and instigated the people which led to the violence in December 2019.“In the garb of CAA, he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block highways leading to major cities and resort to 'chakka jaam'. Also, in the name of opposing CAA, he openly threatened to cut off Assam and other Northeastern states from the rest of the country,” the charge sheet had said. è PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anti-caa-protests-sharjeel-imam-denies-inciting-violence-says-cannot-be-hammered-with-sedition-301013

23-08-2021||New Delhi||SC to consider listing of pleas for hearing on conferring senior designation to lawyers||The Supreme Court Monday said it would consider listing pleas related to conferring of senior designation to lawyers by some high courts by using “arbitrary and discriminatory” secret voting as a norm and mentioned that “some development” might take place in a week to two.A Bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana took note of the submissions of senior advocate Indira Jaising, on whose PIL the apex court had come out with a slew of guidelines for designating lawyers as seniors in 2017.Jaising has sought urgent listing of her fresh miscellaneous application alleging that some high courts have been using a secret voting process as the norm for conferring senior designation which is “arbitrary and discriminatory” and should be declared so.The designation of lawyers should be on the basis of marks given by the designated committee and the voting should be resorted to “only” when it is “unavoidable”, she said, adding that some high courts use the voting method as a norm and not an exception.“There are some problems about senior designation in various courts. The SCBA (the Supreme Court Bar Association) has also requested for senior designation. I want to take this up,” said the CJI.The bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, referred to the demise of senior advocate Soli Sorabjee, who was one of the members of the apex court’s panel for taking initial decisions on applications of lawyers for grant of senior designation and said that a new appointment has to be made.“You know one of our seniors Soli has passed away. We have to replace”, the bench said, adding that a three-judge bench would hear the case.“I will take up the matter. Please give it some time,” the CJI said.“It is a judgement (of 2017) which requires to be worked out by the court. This issue has been hanging fire for very long”, Jaising said.The plea referred to the use of secret voting process as norm by the Delhi as well as the Punjab and Haryana high courts despite the fact that the committees, set up for this purpose, assign the marks to the lawyers based on the on the “objective criteria” formulated by the 2017 judgment.In 2017, the top court had laid down guidelines for itself and 24 high courts to govern the exercise of designating lawyers as seniors.For the apex court, it had said that a five-member permanent committee headed by Chief Justice of India be set up for short-listing candidates for conferring senior designation.“All matters relating to designation of senior advocates in the Supreme Court and in all the High Courts of the country shall be dealt with by a Permanent Committee to be known as ‘Committee for Designation of Senior Advocates’,” it had said.The panel will be headed by the CJI and consist of two senior-most Judges of the apex court or “High Court(s), as may be,” and the Attorney General or the Advocate General of a state in case of a High Court will be its member, it had said.On giving the Bar representation, it had said “the four Members of the Permanent Committee will nominate another Member of the Bar to be the fifth Member of the Permanent Committee”.“Voting by secret ballot will not normally be resorted to by the Full Court, except when unavoidable. In the event of resort to secret ballot, decisions will be carried by a majority of the Judges who have chosen to exercise their preference/choice,” it had said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-consider-listing-of-pleas-for-hearing-on-conferring-senior-designation-to-lawyers-301006
23-08-2021||---||UP: Shah pays tributes to Kalyan Singh, says his death is big loss for BJP||Aligarh, August 23Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday paid tributes to former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh here, calling the death of the BJP stalwart a “big loss” for the party.Singh died at the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) in Lucknow on Saturday night. He was 89.“With the death of Kalyan Singhji, the BJP has lost a stalwart. It is a big loss for the party. The void created by Kalyan Singh’s death is difficult to fill for a long time,” Shah told reporters.He also paid tributes to Singh at PWD guest house in Atrauli town, where his native village Madholi is situated.“With his death, deprived, down-trodden and backwards have lost their well-wisher. He was big leader of the ‘Ram Janmabhoomi andolan’. For this, he did not hesitate in leaving the government. I spoke to him when the ‘Shilanyas’ was done and ‘Babuji’ said that his life’s target was achieved with it,” Shah said.The former Rajasthan governor always worked for the development of the state and devoted his life for the poor and wanted Uttar Pradesh to become the best state in the country, he said.“His life will encourage party workers as how he reached the top position despite coming from a poor family,” the Union minister said.Despite the fact that Singh was not in active politics since long, people, especially the youth, gathered here to pay their last respects, which shows his impact on them, he said.Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and other senior leaders were present on the occasion.The last rites of Singh will be performed later during the day at Rajghat in Narora of Bulandshahr district with full state honours, officials here said.Earlier, the mortal remains of the BJP leader, which were kept at Ahilya Bai Holkar stadium here, were taken to his Atrauli, where his native village Madholi is situated and from there body will be taken to Rajghat. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-shah-pays-tributes-to-kalyan-singh-says-his-death-is-big-loss-for-bjp-301004
23-08-2021||New Delhi||Stuck in Kabul? Use these OSINT maps of Taliban checkpoints, airport for safety||Embassies in Kabul and savvy netizens are pushing out important information to people stuck in Kabul as the Taliban tightens its grip over Afghanistan's capital city through checkpoints and by launching door-to-door searches for its 'enemies'.Netizens are using open-source intelligence (OSINT) to forewarn travellers about the situation in Kabul city.Besides updated information about movement within Kabul, and commuting to the airport, tech-savvy bloggers are uploading maps of Taliban militants' check points in Kabul.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has jeopardised rescue efforts. Even though the US controls the airport, it is finding it difficult to fly out its own citizens and Afghan allies as they are unable to reach the airport. OSINT experts have also made public the entry points to the Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA).Sporadic violence has been reported from the airport and its vicinity. The British forces alleged today that seven people were killed in the melee around the airport. Many similar incidents where innocent people lost their lives have happened since the Taliban took over Kabul on August 15.Just yesterday, Sikhs and Hindus proceeding to catch a flight to Delhi were stopped by the Taliban and many were sent back.Even the mighty US has told its citizens that they should travel to Kabul only when they find it is safe to do so as the Taliban fighters are controlling the highways. It has also refrained people from coming to the airport without prior intimation.Other Western embassies too are putting out information for their nationals and friendly Afghans. One of these is that people waiting to exit Kabul have to provide exact coordinates of their locations so that the security personnel can extricate them quickly.Other instructions include bringing as few belongings as possible and certainly no pets for the simple reason that people are the priority and not luggage.With a severe threat to the safety of people being evacuated, the western embassies have advised that even those who have to be rescued shall not arrive at the HKIA till they have been clearly asked to come to the airport. Also, the military section of the airport does not have much food and water.In the fear and chaos that has gripped Kabul, embassies have also requested people to arrive before 9pm, as the curfew remains from 9 PM-6 AM. This has become important as the Joe Biden administration has advised people to recognise the Taliban as the local authority.—IANS(The content is being carried under an arrangement with indianarrative.com)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stuck-in-kabul-use-these-osint-maps-of-taliban-checkpoints-airport-for-safety-301000

We presented all the arguments in favour of our case. The PM gave us a patient hearing and he has not denied our demand for a caste census as of now.”Leader of opposition in Bihar Assembly and RJD head Tejashwi Yadav, after the meeting, said he was thankful to the PM and everyone now awaited his decision.Questioning the perception that caste census would lead to divisions in society, Tejashwi said, “If caste census will lead to violence and chaos why are we counting people based on religion? Is it not the same issue? As far as the exit cost apprehension goes, that is misplaced because the census of SCs and STs has already been done. All you have to do is add one more column.”Tejashwi said, “Animals and trees are also being counted. Only once you know how many heads are there under the OBC segment will you be able to implement policies properly.:JDU, BJP, RJD, Congress, HAM, CPI, CPIML and LJP are among the parties represented at the PM’s meeting.The meeting came days after the government clarified in Parliament that the pending Census 2021 exercise would count only the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes as per the current practice, and not the OBCs.The demand for caste-based census had recently intensified at the time of the passage of the Constitution (127th) Amendment Bill in both Houses. The Bill enables states to enlist OBCs at their own level, over and above a central OBC list.The BJP has been arguing that the makers of the Constitution had a reason behind dropping the idea of a caste census which was last conducted in 1931 and retaining the need to count SCs and STs.The ruling party members also say that caste-based census could potentially divide society, by further deepening fault lines.Politically too, commissioning a caste-based census could put the BJP in a dock in Uttar Pradesh where elections are due in 2022.The BJP's 2017 sweep in UP came from a cross-section support of OBCs and upper castes.Closer to 2022 state polls, the BJP is hoping for the Ram Temple construction to emerge as a major electoral issue with significant emotional resonance, especially among the upper castes.Commissioning of a caste census could trigger suspicions - a possibility the BJP may not like to nurture on the UP election eve.Given these dilemmas, it remains to be seen how the ruling BJP balances the growing demands for caste census with real politics.Caste census is being backed not only by the SP, BSP, DMK and NCP but also BJP's allies like the JDU in Bihar and Apna Dal in UP.In fact, BJP's Lok Sabha MP from Badaun, Sanghamitra Maurya, during the debate on the OBC bill recently, backed a caste census saying, "Even cattle have been counted but not OBCs."The proponents of caste census further argue that the exact count of OBCs would ensure proper policy benefits.The Mandal Commission had estimated the OBC count in India at 52 per cent, but estimates have varied. The National Sample Survey Organisation in 2007 had put the OBC count at 41 per cent.The exact number of OBCs would also have major implications for the reservation debate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-hasnt-denied-our-demand-says-nitish-kumar-as-leaders-of-11-bihar-parties-meet-modi-over-having-caste-census-300997

Age-wise payroll data indicates that many first-time job seekers are joining organised sector workforce in large numbers.During the month, around 4.73 lakh net subscribers exited but rejoined EPFO by changing jobs within the establishments covered by it.“This shows that majority of subscribers opted to continue their membership with EPFO, using transferring of funds from previous job to the current PF account rather than applying for final withdrawal of their PF accumulations,” the Ministry’s functionary said.State-wise comparison of payroll shows that states of Maharashtra, Haryana, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are still at the forefront of payroll addition with addition of approximately 7.78 lakh subscribers during the month. This is around 60.61% of total net payroll addition across all age groups.Industry-wise payroll data indicates that ‘expert services’ category (consisting of manpower agencies, private security agencies and small contractors etc.) constitutes 41.84% of total subscribers’ addition during the month. In addition, month-on-month growing trend in net subscription has been noticed for industries like trading-commercial establishments, engineering products, building & construction, textiles, garment making, hospitals and financing establishments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/women-account-for-2-56-lakh-of-epfos-net-payroll-additions-300996

The total area under kharif crops in the corresponding week last year was 1,060.37 lakh hectares. When compared with five-year average of 1,010.48 lakh hectares, the area increased by 33.40 lakh hectares, states the data.Cotton has seen a decrease of 10.65 lakh hectares as compared to last year and constitutes the maximum component of the shortfall.

23-08-2021||Srinagar||Both factions of Hurriyat Conference likely to be banned under UAPA: Officials||A ban under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act may be imposed on both factions of the secessionist conglomerate Hurriyat Conference which has been spearheading the separatist movement in Jammu and Kashmir for over two decades, officials said.They said a recent probe into the granting of MBBS seats to Kashmiri students by institutions in Pakistan indicates that the money collected from aspirants by some organisations, which were part of the Hurriyat Conference conglomerate, was being used for funding terror organisations in the Union Territory.The officials said both the factions of the Hurriyat are likely to be banned under Section 3(1) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or the UAPA, under which “if the Central Government is of opinion that any association is, or has become, an unlawful association, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare such association to be unlawful.”                  They said the proposal was mooted in accordance with the Centre’s policy of zero tolerance against terrorism.The Hurriyat Conference came into existence in 1993 with 26 groups, including some pro-Pakistan and banned outfits such as the Jamaat-e-Islami, the JKLF and the Dukhtaran-e-Millat. It also included the People’s Conference and the Awami Action Committee headed by Mirwaiz Umer Farooq.The separatist conglomerate broke into two factions in 2005 with the moderate group being led by the Mirwaiz and the hard-line headed by Syed Ali Shah Geelani.So far, the Centre has banned the Jamaat-e-Islami and the JKLF under the UAPA. The ban was imposed in 2019.The officials said a probe into funding of terror groups indicated alleged involvement of secessionist and separatist leaders, including the members and cadres of the Hurriyat Conference who have been acting in connivance with active militants of proscribed terrorist organisations Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), Dukhtaran-e-Millat (DeM) and Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT).The cadres raised funds in the country and from abroad through various illegal channels, including hawala, for funding separatist and terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, they said.The funds collected were used for causing disruption in the Kashmir Valley by way of pelting stones on security forces, systematically burning schools, damaging public property and waging war against India as part of a criminal conspiracy, they claimed.Supporting the case for banning the two factions of the Hurriyat Conference under the UAPA, the officials cited several cases related to terror funding, including the one being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in which several of the conglomerate’s cadres were arrested and jailed.Many of the second-rung cadres of both the factions are in jail since 2017, they said.Among those in jail are Altaf Ahmed Shah, the son-in-law of Geelani; businessman Zahoor Ahmed Watali; Geelani’s close aide Ayaz Akbar, who is also the spokesperson of the hardline separatist organisation Tehreek-e-Hurriyat; Peer Saifullah; Shahid-ul-Islam, spokesperson of the moderate Hurriyat Conference; Mehrajuddin Kalwal; Nayeem Khan; and Farooq Ahmed Dar alias ‘Bitta Karate’.Later, JKLF chief Yaseen Malik, DeM head Asiya Andrabi and pro-Pakistan separatist Masarat Alam were also named in a supplementary charge sheet in a case of terror financing.Another case which is likely to be cited for banning the two Hurriyat Conference factions is the one against PDP youth leader Waheed-ur-Rahman Parra, who is alleged to have paid Rs 5 crore to the son-in-law of Geelani for keeping Kashmir in turmoil after the death of Hizbul Mujahideen terror commander Burhan Wani in 2016, the officials said.The NIA has alleged that after the death of Wani, who was killed in an encounter with the Army in July 2016, Parra got in touch with Altaf Ahmad Shah, alias Altaf Fantoosh, and asked him to ensure that the Valley was kept on the boil with widespread unrest and stone pelting.Also, the Counter Intelligence (Kashmir), a branch of CID department of Jammu and Kashmir Police, registered a case in July last year following information that several unscrupulous persons, including some Hurriyat leaders, were hand in glove with some educational consultancies and are selling Pakistan-based MBBS seats and admission in other professional courses in various colleges and universities.At least four persons, including Mohammad Akbar Bhat alias Zaffar Bhat, self-styled chairman of Salvation Movement which is part of moderate Hurriyat Conference, were arrested in this case.It is alleged that the constituents of Hurriyat Conference were “selling” MBBS seats in Pakistan to Kashmiri students and using the money collected, at least partly, to support and fund terrorism.During the probe, it had surfaced that individual Hurriyat leaders had their quota of seats which were sold to people desiring to obtain MBBS and other professional degrees in one way or the other, the officials said.The officials said evidence showed that the money was “put into channels that ended up in supporting programmes and projects pertaining to terrorism and separatism like payment for organising stone pelting.”          Citing investigation, the officials said that average cost of an MBBS seat in Pakistan was anything between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 12 lakh. In some cases, the fee was brought down on the intervention of Hurriyat leaders. Depending upon the political heft of the Hurriyat leader who intervened, concessions were extended to aspiring students, the officials said.

In fact,since 21/08/2021 the portal itself is not available,” the Income Tax department tweeted.As users complained of various glitches after a fortnight of launch, Sitharaman met key officials of Infosys on June 22 in which chartered accountants, who had also been invited, highlighted the issues faced by taxpayers and tax professionals on the portal. The Minister had then asked Infosys to address all issues without further loss of time, improve their services, and redress grievances on priority as it was impacting taxpayers adversely.“I wish it hadn’t turned out that way,’’ she had recently said. The Minister was also being provided with feedback every week by Infosys founder Nandan Nilekani.The inability of many to file income tax returns has led them to some of them being slapped with late fees, which the government has attributed to yet another glitch and has promised to fund. It has also affected the pace of refunds.Till August 26 last year, CBDT had issued refunds of over Rs 95,000 crore. This year, till August 16, refunds of about Rs 50,000 have been made, almost half the sanctions made last year, because people have been unable to file their returns due to faults in the portal.The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) website is also facing glitches. Several users have complained of long hours spent in trying to get business transacted, especially to get Aadhaar verified for e-nomination.In 2019, Infosys was awarded a contract to develop the next-generation income tax filing system to reduce processing time for returns from 63 days to one day and expedite refunds. Till June 2021, the government has paid Rs 164.5 crore to Infosys for developing the portal.Infosys India Business, which is the Twitter handle of Infosys India Business unit, in a tweet on Sunday said “The @IncomeTaxIndia portal continues to be under emergency maintenance. We will post an update once the portal is available again for taxpayers. We regret the inconvenience”.It had on Saturday tweeted that the Income Tax portal is “currently inaccessible due to planned maintenance”.Quoting the I-T department tweet, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Senior Advisor, Kanchan Gupta, tweeted “This is the second major GoI project @Infosys  has messed up. The first was #GST portal. Now it is #IncomeTax portal. Infosys bags GoI projects using L1 route which limits options  Clearly lacks either capacity or intent to deliver. Two ‘failures’ in a row cannot be coincidence”.Infosys had also developed the GST Network (GSTN) portal, used for GST payment and return filing. The software major had faced flak for slow functioning of the GSTN portal.Sitharaman last week had said that technical glitches in the new e-filing portal will be largely fixed in the next few days and that she has been constantly reminding Infosys about the issue.“I have been reminding Infosys constantly, and (Infosys head) Nandan Nilekani has been messaging me with assurances that next couple of days they will sort out majority of problems,” she had said, adding that to a large extent, the system is far better than what it was in June but still some issues remain.The revenue secretary is monitoring this on a weekly basis, she had said, adding the glitches will be fixed largely in the next couple of weeks.Earlier this month, in a reply to a Parliament question on whether technical glitches continue to mar the functioning of the new IT portal, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary had said most of the issues reported by taxpayers pertain to non-availability or technical issues of certain functionalities or forms.“Certain key functionalities like user profile, dashboard, filing of ITR 1,2 & 4, e-proceedings including Video conferencing requests, Digital Signing Certificate, viewing of old Income Tax returns, e-verification, e-PAN service, Aadhaar-PAN Linking, Adding Authorised Representative, etc. are available to the users,” he had said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/finance-minister-sitharaman-summons-infosys-ceo-as-income-tax-portal-goes-dark-300634

He was 89.“The country has lost a valuable personality and a capable leader. To fulfill the void left by him, we should do maximum hard work for his ideals, his promises and leave no effort in achieving his dreams,” Modi said.The prime minister said Singh lived true to his name given to him by his parents.“He lived his entire life for public welfare. He made ‘jan kalyan’ as the mantra of his life, and dedicated his life for the BJP, Bharatiya Jana Sangh family, for an ideology and for the bright future of the country,” Modi said.He hailed Singh as a committed decision maker who symbolised “trust” across the country.“For the most part of his life, he made efforts for public welfare. Whatever responsibility he had got, be it as an MLA, any post in the government, or as a governor, he had been a centre of inspiration for everyone. He became a symbol of trust for the public,” Modi added.“I pray to Bhagvan Prabhu Shriram to give Kalyan Singh ji a space at his feet. May Prabhu Ram give strength to his family in the hour of sadness to bear the loss. May Prabhu Ram give consolation to people in the country who believe in his values, ideals, culture and traditions,” the prime minister said.Modi, after reaching the residence of Singh here, paid tributes to him and placed a wreath at his body.He was accompanied by BJP chief J P Nadda, UP Governor Anandiben Patel, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also paid tributes to the former UP chief minister.Speaking to reporters here, Rajnath Singh said, “We used to tell him (Kalyan) that we are ‘bhootpoorv’ (former) chief minister, you are ‘abhootpoorv’ (unprecedented) chief minister, on which he used to laugh. I have seen him as an elder brother.” BSP chief Mayawati also paid homage to the departed leader.At around 12.30 pm, Singh’s body was taken to UP Vidhan Bhavan. From there, it will be taken to the office of the state BJP, party leaders said.On Sunday evening, the body is scheduled to be taken to Aligarh, where it will be kept in a stadium. On Monday morning, it will be taken to Atrauli—his “karmabhoomi” and “janmabhoomi”, Adityanath had said on Saturday.The last rites will be performed with full state honours in Narora town, around 60 kilometres from Aligarh, on Monday afternoon, he had said.Uttar Pradesh has announced three-day mourning and a holiday on Monday.Singh, who also served as the Rajasthan governor, was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the SGPGI in a critical condition on July 4.He died due to sepsis and multi-organ failure, the hospital said.Singh was the Uttar Pradesh chief minister when the Babri mosque was demolished by a mob of “karsevaks” in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992. Along with BJP veterans L K Advani and M M Joshi, he was among the 32 people acquitted in the demolition case in September last year.A Lodhi leader, Singh was instrumental in the rise of the BJP to power in Uttar Pradesh in the 1990s.He is survived by his wife Ramvati Devi, son Rajveer Singh, who is the Lok Sabha MP from Etah, and grandson Sandeep Singh, who is the minister of state for finance, technical education and medical education in Uttar Pradesh.
