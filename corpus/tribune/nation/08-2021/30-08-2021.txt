I and no worker of my organisation did any wrong at Jantar Mantar. I respect the court. I will surrender tomorrow, on August 31, around 12 pm before the Connaught Place police station and will cooperate with the police.“I never ran away from being arrested. It is the right of every person to go to the court and I did the same. All the allegations against me are false and baseless. I have devoted my life towards Hinduism and Hindutva. As long as I have breath, I will continue to do the work of religion,” he claimed in the video.The Delhi High Court on Friday had refused to grant interim protection from arrest to Bhupinder Tomar alias Pinki Chaudhary.Earlier this month, a sessions court here had dismissed Chaudhary’s anticipatory bail application.Hundreds of people had attended the protest organised by ‘Bharat Jodo Aandolan’.Shipra Srivastava, media in-charge of ‘Bharat Jodo Aandolan’, had said the protest was held under the leadership of advocate and former BJP spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay.However, she denied any links to those who raised anti-Muslim slogans.“The protest was held against colonial laws and demanding to abolish 222 British era laws. We have seen the video, but have no idea who they are. The police should take strict action against the persons who raised the slogans,” Srivastava had said.Upadhyay too had denied any involvement in the anti-Muslim sloganeering incident.The video of the incident had showed a group of people shouting inflammatory slogans and threatening Muslims during the protest at Jantar Mantar.Preet Singh is the director of ‘Save India Foundation’ while Deepak Singh, Deepak Kumar and Vinod Sharma are associated with different right-wing organisations. Sushil Tiwari is the chief of Hindu Army. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jantar-mantar-hate-slogan-case-accused-hindu-raksha-dal-chief-talks-of-surrender-in-online-video-304237

30-08-2021||New Delhi||Security assaulted gangster Ankit Gujjar after he slapped Tihar jail dy superintendent: Officials||The initial police investigation into the death of Ankit Gujjar inside Tihar jail has found that security personnel allegedly assaulted him after the gangster slapped the deputy superintendent, officials said on Monday. The police said they have recorded the statement of several inmates and jail employees during the probe.“The initial investigation has revealed that the jail authority was trying to shift 29-year-old Gujjar. He was not ready to shift and allegedly slapped the deputy superintendent, following which the security personal assaulted him,” a senior police officer said.Gujjar was found dead inside his cell in Tihar jail while two of his former cellmates, who were lodged in an adjacent lockup, were found injured on August 4.Gujjar was involved in several criminal cases, including killing a BJP leader.Tihar officials had earlier said the three inmates were lodged in the same cell till August 3 night when they had a fight with the jail staff after a mobile phone was found from outside their cell.The jail staff then shifted Gujjar to another cell from where his body was recovered the next morning, they had said.Following the incident, four jail officials, including the deputy superintendent, were suspended for alleged negligence.The Delhi Police Special Cell had arrested a 28-year-old man named Satender alias Satte who was allegedly planning to harm a senior jail official to avenge Gujjar’s death.    Satte had asked his associate to procure an AK-47 rifle to eliminate Deputy Superintendent of Tihar Jail, the audio of which later went viral.Satte was arrested on August 17 from the Outer Ring Road, and a semi-automatic pistol of .32 bore with six live cartridges were recovered from him.In the purported audio call, the accused was heard telling his associate that possessing AK-47 rifle would earn them more publicity and supremacy in the field of crime.Gujjar, who belonged to Sunder Bhati gang, was arrested from Uttar Pradesh’s Greater Noida along with three others in connection with the murder of BJP leader Vijay Pandit in 2014. Pandit was shot dead by four persons, including Gujjar, in Dabri on the night of June 7, 2014.

The JD-U is the most trusted member of the NDA and PM Modi is the leader of the alliance. But he (Kumar) certainly is a PM material.”Apparently, the party also passed a resolution at its national council meeting that Bihar Chief Minister has “all the qualities” that a PM should have.Briefing the media on the meeting, Tyagi also suggested NDA coordination committees for smooth functioning like during the tenure of late PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.BJP and JD-U are partners in the Centre and the state.Of late the JD-U has backed the demand for an inquiry in the Pegasus spyware issue and also a caste census, along with lead opposition in Bihar, the RJD.Stating that the JD-U wants to expand base and will be contesting Manipur and Uttar Pradesh elections, Tyagi also said in case no alliance is formed, it will contest alone.As it aims for a national party status, sources say the BJP’s Bihar ally aiming for “50 seats” in the 403-member UP Assembly and that it may contest “200 seats in UP in 2022, if the seat sharing formula with the BJP does not work out”. But its first priority is to contest with the BJP, they add.However, the ruling BJP is expected to contest the upcoming UP elections with existing allies like the Apna Dal and the Nishad Party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-is-and-will-be-ndas-pm-candidate-says-ally-jdu-304218
30-08-2021||New Delhi||Tomato prices crash to Rs 4/kg amid supply glut in most growing states||Tomato prices in wholesale markets in most producing states have crashed to as low as Rs 4 per kg amid supply glut, government data showed.In fact, the wholesale prices of tomato in 23 growing centres out of 31 monitored by the government were down by 50 per cent from the year-ago period or below three-year seasonal average.  Currently, tomato crop of the early kharif (summer) season of the 2021-22 crop year (July-June) is being harvested.According to the data, the wholesale price of tomato in Dewas in Madhya Pradesh—the country’s top tomato growing state—fell to Rs 8 per kg on August 28 of this year from Rs 11 per kg in the year-ago period.Similarly, the wholesale price of tomato at Jalgoan in Maharashtra—the country’s sixth largest tomato growing state—fell by 80 per cent to Rs 4 per kg on August 28 from Rs 21 per kg in the year-ago period.Tomato prices at Aurangabad declined to Rs 4.50 per kg from Rs 9.50 per kg, while that of Solapur to Rs 5 per kg from 15 per kg and in Kolhapur to Rs 6.50 per kg from 25 per kg in the year-ago period.“Prices have come under pressure in key growing states because of the supply glut. The tomato crop has been good owing to favourable weather,” National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) Acting Director PK Gupta told PTI.The tomato production from summer (early Kharif) season is estimated to be better than last year and farmers can be saved from falling prices if food processing companies come to their rescue, he said.No doubt, the favourable weather has helped boost the crop production, but farmers’ tendency to grow the crop the price of which was ruling higher at the time of sowing—has added to higher production, he added.                  “When production is higher, prices come under pressure,” Gupta said.According to the government data, wholesale price of tomato at Kolar in Karnataka—the country’s fourth largest tomato growing state—dropped to 5.30 per kg on August 28 from Rs 18.70 per kg in the year-ago period, while that of in Chickkaballapura fell to Rs 7.30 per kg from 18.50 per kg in the said period.Similarly in Andhra Pradesh, the country’s second largest tomato growing state, the wholesale price at Palamaner in Chitoor district fell to Rs 18.50 per kg from Rs 40 per kg.Palamaner and two more cities Madanpalle and Mulakalacheruvu in Chitoor district saw prices falling sharply from the year-ago period. And these three centres are identified as clusters for development under the government’s ‘Operation Green’ programme.In Uttar Pradesh too, prices fell in the range of Rs 8-20 per kg on August 28 this year from Rs 14-28 per kg in the year-ago period.                         In West Bengal, wholesale price of tomato declined to Rs 25-32 per kg in different growing areas from Rs 34-65 per kg in the said period, the data showed.In consuming markets too, wholesale prices of tomatoes showed a decline.In Delhi’s Azadpur mandi, wholesale price of tomato declined to 24 per kg on August 28 from Rs 36 per kg in the year-ago period.Wholesale price of tomato in Mumbai declined to Rs 12 per kg from Rs 30 per kg, while that of in Bengaluru to Rs 8 per kg from Rs 30 per kg in the said period.Tomato crop is ready for harvest in about 2-3 months after planting.India’s tomato production rose by 2.20 per cent to 21 million tonnes in the 2020-21 crop year (July-June) as against 20.55 million tonnes in the year-ago period, as per the Agriculture Ministry’s second advance estimate.

30-08-2021||New Delhi||1993 trains blast case: SC irked as accused jailed for 11 years without framing of charges||“Convict him or acquit him,” an anguished Supreme Court observed on non-framing of charges on an accused jailed for 11 years over serial blasts in multiple Rajdhani Express and other trains in 1993.              Underlining the right to speedy trial, the top court sought a report from the special Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act court judge in Ajmer explaining why charges have not been framed against Hameer Ui Uddin.“The Special Judge, Designated Court, Ajmer, Rajasthan is directed to submit a report to this Court within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order…The report shall clarify why charges have not been framed,” a Bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said. In its order passed recently, the Bench said that to facilitate the submission of the report expeditiously, the registrar (judicial) will communicate a copy of the order to the judge directly as well as through the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court of Rajasthan.During the hearing, advocate Shoeb Alam, appearing for Hameer Ui Uddin said the petitioner has been in custody since 2010 but charges have not been framed and trial is yet to commence.He said that detaining an accused indefinitely without trial is a gross abuse of rights of an individual under Article 21.Alam contended that the special TADA court ought to have granted bail to the petitioner as there is no prospect of the conclusion of the trial in the near future.“The allegations are yet to be proved in trial and there is no justification of pre-trial incarceration for 11 years,” he said.Advocate Vishal Meghwal, appearing for the state, admitted that that charges have not been framed against the accused, but contended he was absconding for nearly 15 years.The Bench then asked why the charges have not been framed when he has been in custody since 2010.“He is entitled to speedy trial. Convict him or acquit him, we have no problem with that but at least hold the trial. He cannot be kept in custody indefinitely without trial,” the Bench observed.Meghwal contended that the main reason for the delay in framing of charges is that one of the co-accused Abdul Karim Tunda is lodged in the Ghaziabad jail.“Then either you separate the trial or club the trial with his case but at least start the trial,” the bench said.Alam said the Tunda case is not mentioned by the state in its counter-affidavit.In his plea filed through advocate Farrukh Rasheed, the petitioner has challenged the TADA court of March 27, 2019, rejecting his bail application.As per the prosecution case, on December 5-6, 1993, serial bomb blasts took place in Rajdhani express trains—Bombay to New Delhi, New Delhi to Howrah, Howrah to New Delhi—Surat-Baroda Flying Queen Express and Hyderabad-New Delhi AP Express.Two passengers lost their lives in the blasts and 22 suffered injuries.Five different cases were registered at respective police stations in Kota, Valsad, Kanpur, Allahabad and Malkaj-Giri.These cases were later transferred to the CBI and re-registered under TADA at Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Hyderabad. Investigation found that the bomb blasts were outcome of one single conspiracy and hence all cases were clubbed together. On August 25, 1994, the CBI filed chargesheet against 13 accused, who were arrested, and nine other absconding accused.Hameer Ui Uddin was shown absconding.The charge sheet alleged that he was one of the accused who carried bomb devices and explosive substances to Kanpur on December 5, 1993.Hameer Ui Uddin was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Police and Lucknow Special Task Force on February 2, 2010, and was produced before the Ajmer TADA court on March 8, 2010 which remanded him to judicial custody.In 2010, an 8000-page charge sheet was filed against him under various provisions of TADA and Explosive Substance Act, Prevention of Damages to Public Property Act and the Indian Railways Act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1993-trains-blast-case-sc-irked-as-accused-jailed-for-11-years-without-framing-of-charges-304200

30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Afghan situation raises new security questions: Rajnath Singh||The current happenings in Afghanistan have raised new security questions, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday, adding that the government is alert and no anti-national force should be allowed to encourage terrorism from across the border by taking advantage of the situation.He also asserted the central government is capable of dealing with any situation.He was addressing virtually the third Balramji Dass Tandon Memorial Lecture organised by Panjab University on the issue of national security.“What is happening in neighbouring Afghanistan is raising new questions in terms of security and our government is constantly monitoring the developments there,” Singh said.Along with the security of Indians, he said, “Our government also wants that anti-national forces do not encourage terrorism from across the border by taking advantage of the development there”.“We have some more concerns which can become challenges from the point of view of national security,” he added.The Taliban took control of Afghanistan on August 15, capturing all major cities in a matter of days, two weeks before the US was set to complete its troop withdrawal after a vexatious two-decade war. Earlier this week, an Islamic State suicide attack outside the Kabul airport killed over 180 people.Singh said that the Narendra Modi government was alert and capable of dealing with any situation.“We are always prepared to deal with threats arising from anywhere—air, water and land,” he said.The defence minister laid stress on continuously upgrading and updating the national security system to face new challenges and said that some new threats have emerged because of the development of modern technology.स्वर्गीय बलरामजी दास टंडन व्याख्यानमाला के अंतर्गत ‘राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा’ विषय पर सम्बोधन। https://t.co/oBTbfn9xwRHe referred to the dropping of two bombs using drone at the Jammu air force station earlier this year.“We have to continuously update and upgrade the national security system for new challenges,” said Singh.He said the government’s aim is to make the country prosperous, strong and secure. “Such an India that does not scare anyone but develops a sense of security among small nations and that India’s growing power is not a threat to them,” he said.Singh also said that there was a trust deficit between India and Pakistan and the country needed to be vigilant of this fact from the point of view of national security.Singh said Pakistan had understood that they would not make any gains from   violations of ceasefire agreements.An agreement was signed between the Director General Military Operations (DGMO) of India and Pakistan to maintain ceasefire along the Line of Control in February this year, he said.“We are also in wait and watch mode because the trust deficit between both the nations is a major problem,” he said, adding that no ceasefire violation by the neighbouring nation has taken place ever since the agreement was signed.Pakistan understands that it is not in position to do much in Kashmir, especially after the nullification of Article 370, he said.He said Pakistan had suffered defeats in 1965 and 1971 wars and these defeats completely proved that it was not in a position to launch a full scale war against India.The minister said the inability to wage a direct war against India forced Pakistan to work on two policies—on the one hand, the neighbouring nation took steps towards finding an atomic way and on the other hand, it started working on the policy of giving ‘death by thousand cuts’ to India.Pakistan had commenced a proxy war against India, allowing their land for providing training to terrorists, money and weapons to target India, he said, adding that after 1980s Pakistan had become the “nursery of terrorism” in the whole world.On Jammu and Kashmir, Singh said an effective action by Indian security forces to stop terrorism has been going on for the last seven years there.“I believe that the remaining terrorism in Kashmir will also end. I have this belief because the strength and oxygen that the separatist forces used to get there due to Articles 370 and 35A are over now,” said Singh.He said the Modi government neither does politics nor allows it to happen on issues related to national security, and added that a free hand has been given to the security forces in performing their duties.“How high the confidence and morale of the army and security forces can be guessed from the fact that in the last seven years, they have not allowed a single major terrorist incident in the hinterland of India,” he said.“India is not only taking action against terrorism within the borders of the country, the brave soldiers of our army have done the work of destroying terrorist hideouts by crossing the border if needed,” he said, referring to the surgical strike after the Uri terror attack and the Balakot airstrikes after the Pulwama attack.“Today we can say that Pakistan-supported model of terrorism is getting demolished in India,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/afghan-situation-raises-new-security-questions-rajnath-singh-304193

In terms of higher education, India records the second highest influx of international students from Afghanistan after Nepal. Every year, an average of over 4,000 Afghan students enrol for higher education in India."Till date, our university has been home to 14 Afghan students across its various schools," they said.The Centre for Afghanistan Studies (CAS) in the Jindal School of International Affairs has active partnerships with a diverse set of educational and research institutions in Afghanistan, including the University of Afghanistan, Afghanistan Centre at Kabul University, Organisation for Social Cultural Awareness and Rehabilitation and The American University of Afghanistan, for joint research, seminars and faculty student exchange programmes. In March 2015, a delegation comprising Prof Raj Kumar and Prof Sreeram S Chaulia, Dean, Jindal School of International Affairs, visited Afghanistan for advising on internationalisation of higher education. Dr Abdullah Abdullah, former Government Chief Executive, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, too, visited the JGU campus in 2015 and delivered a distinguished public lecture on ‘The Future of Afghanistan-India Relations’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/op-jindal-global-university-offers-special-advance-fellowships-for-students%C2%A0of-strife-torn-afghanistan-304184

Interrogation of these four arrested people is under way,” he said.Police had said the arrested accused, identified as Altamash Khan, Mohammad Imran Ansari, Javed Khan and Syed Irfan Ali, all in the age group of 20 to 30, are inspired by a radical ideology.They spread inflammatory messages on social media related to a conspiracy to trigger communal riots at different places by creating a sense of discontent among people over some recent incidents in Indore city, police said.A case was registered against them under Section 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion) along with other sections of the Indian Penal Code, police said.The bangle seller, Taslim Ali, was thrashed in Govind Nagar of Indore on August 22 for using a “fake” name while selling bangles to women in the locality. Four persons were arrested in connection with the assault.Ali was later arrested for allegedly touching a minor girl inappropriately and also for forgery, police had said.

30-08-2021||New Delhi||Last mail delivered, Ram Sharan ‘Postman’ signs off from Parliament||Prime ministers changed as did ministers and there were new MP faces every five years but Ram Sharan ‘Postman’, assigned the Parliament beat, remained a constant – walking up and down the corridors of power for the last 21 years. Right till he delivered his last ‘daak’.The common man who found himself among India’s most powerful, Ram Sharan retires on Tuesday, content, he says, to have served “all with equal importance and without a single complaint”.“You don’t get to deliver mail inside the House for 21 years if you make mistakes and bring back complaints,” Ram Sharan told PTI, a day ahead of his final adieu from the postal service on Tuesday and three days after he dropped his last ‘daak’ in Parliament on Friday.Had Monday not been Janmashtami, today would have been his last working day “in Parliament”. After long hours of walking from one office to another to deliver mail inside the sprawling Parllament House complex, Ram Sharan said he would take a few moments to quietly sip tea outside the Red Cross building on Sansad Marg and reflect on the day that had been.“I never let anyone be disappointed. If anyone asked me about their mail not getting delivered, I’d make sure it reached them or at least knew where it was stuck. Be it a senior minister or an ordinary person like you or I, my job was to deliver their post which I did as best as I could,” Ram Sharan said.When he was posted at Parliament House in 2000, nobody wanted to take the “beat” because of its labyrinthian corridors and seemingly similar rooms and doors that appeared confusing to most.“People were afraid to be posted there. They would request to be shifted within two days. In the initial few days, I, too, was confused as the doors were the same, the rooms looked the same and some paths would end abruptly and you ended up at places you weren’t going to,” he recalled in a phone interview.The map was soon etched on his mind though, and he continued delivering mail to their recipients without error with the help of the House staff.Walking through the maze that is Parliament House, the postman said it was not unusual for him to come across ministers or their staff, who became familiar with the man with mail and helped him in small matters.“Prime ministers and ministers, all these people kept changing, but my focus was always on my duty. The post office gave me a duty and it was my responsibility to perform it with perfection,” said the 60-year-old.Much has changed since 2000 when he was given the beat.Back then, Mondays were the busiest as well as heaviest days.Every Monday, he would put three bags of mail, each weighing 50 kg, in the postal van, which then dropped the bags at the Parliament library.With the decreasing popularity of postal services—as communications entered the e-age, and the definition of mail changed to emails—the load has now reduced to one, maybe two bags on Mondays. The rest of the week, it’s barely 17 kg on average.There is a method in how every postman functions and Ram Sharan takes pride in the regimen he developed for himself.Talking about his day, Ram Sharan said he would reach Gol Dak Khana at 10 am from his home in Faridabad. For the next hour and a half, he would sort mail, make entries in the computer, load the mail and wheel out his cycle to make the one-kilometre journey to Parliament House.“It’s a rule in every postman’s life to arrange your mail in a way that you don’t have to visit a place again. If you do that half your work is done. And the second is to be patient and courteous... because you spend about an hour in the office and the rest with the public,” he said.The soft-spoken postman travelled his route on cycle every day, till one evening in 2011 when he met with an accident while returning to office.“I injured my foot and was told to do office duty for two months. Even though my foot healed I still cannot carry heavy weight, so I had to let go of my cycle,” he remembered.In the last 10 years, he would hire an autorickshaw from Gol Dak Khana to Parliament Library (paying from his own pocket) and walk back to office in the evening.He worked with the Railway Mail Service from 1981 till 1989, also a department of India Post. In 1989, India Post put out a notice for postman vacancies, for which he applied and got through after writing an exam.Since 1989, after his stint with the Railway Mail Service, he has been covering areas around Mandi House, including Rabindra Bhawan, Sangeet Natak Akademi, Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan and the Indian Council of Historical Research before it was shifted to Connaught Place.“ICHR used to receive so much mail that it was heavier than me and the front wheel of my cycle would go up,” he laughed.As he hangs up his boots and readies for his farewell tomorrow, Ram Sharan said there are no regrets. It has been a lifetime of work well done. The father of seven, all married and settled in their respective lives, now plans to become a member of the union of retired postmen. He believes it is important to keep meeting people and know new things “else your mind stops working”.“I was Ram Sharan Verma till school then I insisted on going without Verma. Now everyone knows me as Ram Sharan Postman. That is my identity.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/last-mail-delivered-ram-sharan-postman-signs-off-from-parliament-304172

They were arrested from neighbouring Gangotri Vihar."We waited for the heat to die down and interrogated Pradeep after conducting a thorough investigation. During sustained grilling, Pradeep broke down and owned up to the crime after which his aides were arrested," said the ACP.The three youths are school dropouts and wanted to make a fast buck for luxury living."A day before the robbery, the accused hammed out the plan, but in haste, Imran forgot to change his shoes while stepping out of the car. The accused also failed to notice a functional CCTV just next to the jewellery shop," said the police officer.They had all watched web series like 'Money Heist' on OTT platforms.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crime-web-series-money-heist-inspires-3-youths-to-rob-jewellery-store-304157
30-08-2021||Kolkata||Eminent Bengali writer Buddhadeb Guha passes away at 85||Eminent Bengali writer Buddhadeb Guha, author of many notable works such as ‘Madhukari’ (Honey Gatherer), is no more.He was 85.Guha died of post-Covid complications at a private hospital here on Sunday after a massive cardiac arrest, his family said.The writer, whose works of fiction reflected his closeness to nature and forests of eastern India, was suffering from post-Covid complications and had been hospitalised earlier this month after complaining of breathlessness and urinary infection, his family said.He had earlier suffered from Covid-19 in April and had been hospitalised for 33 days.Guha was predeceased by wife, eminent Rabindra Sangeet exponent Ritu Guha, and leaves behind two daughters.Born on June 29, 1936 in Kolkata, Guha had spent his childhood in Rangpur and Barisal districts of East Bengal (now Bangladesh). His childhood experiences and travels left a deep imprint on him, which were reflected in his works later.His novels and short stories have been highly acclaimed by critics, winning him fans across the sub-continent and several awards including Ananda Purashkar in 1976, Shiroman Purashkar and Sharat Purashkar.His important works besides ‘Madhukari’, include ‘Koeler Kachhe’ (Near the Koel Bird) and ‘Sobinoy Nibedon’ (Humble Offering).An award-winning Bengali film 'Dictionary' was made based on two of his works - `Baba Howa' (Being a Father) and `Swami Howa' (Being a Husband).He was also a popular children's writer creating the fictional character Rijuda, a hunter-turned-conservationist and his side-kick Rudra.Said Rupa Majumdar, Editor of Nabakallol and Shuktara magazines and director of publishing house Dev Sahitya Kutir, whose magazine recently serialised Guha's childhood memories in a story form, “He was a colossus, a literary star…people used to come just to watch him when he would visit our stall at any book fair. His books, some of which we published, were all best-sellers.”Majumdar said it was the duty of the publishing world and his heirs to have his works translated into other languages, including English, “so that the world at large realises his genius, which is so well recognised in Bengali literature”.A successful chartered accountant, Guha was also a noted classical singer and a proficient illustrator."Buddhadev Guha is no more. He was blessed as to be one with the divine on the night of Janmashtami. Do join his family and friends in celebrating his life," his elder daughter Maleni B Guha posted on social media.

The already-tense environment in the city was punctuated by an explosion that the Taliban said was a US attack on a suicide bomber heading for the airport.A shortwhile before the airstrike, the US State Department urged Americans near the Kabul airport to immediately leave the area due to a specific threat. In an apparent US-Taliban coordination, the airstrike targeted a potential bomber in a car but locals said a child was also hit.At UNSC, India to play major roleIndia was mentioned at a media interaction by Taliban senior leader Sher Muhammad Stanekzai, who is believed to have met Indian interlocutors earlier in Doha as part of back-channel talks. The Taliban, he said, wished to have good political and economic ties with India, including the air corridor that was operational under the previous regime.Changes in Kabul a challenge: RajnathThe changing equation in Afghanistan is a challenge for us...These situations have forced us to rethink. We are changing our strategy. Quad underlines this strategy.Defence MinisterIn another placatory signal to New Delhi, Taliban officials visited the Salma Dam which was built by India. The MEA did not react to this or the earlier observation by Taliban spokesman that Pakistan and India should resolve their issues bilaterally.India is poised to play a major role at the UNSC as it heads its Taliban sanctions committee, whose nod is crucial to delist some of the group’s top members.In fact, some of the Taliban’s negotiations team could not travel to Doha due to the consequent ban on international travel. Also, the IMF, World Bank and the US Treasury are unlikely to transfer funds to men listed as terrorists by the committee headed by senior Indian diplomat TS Tirumurti.India will also preside over the UNSC’s deliberations on Monday when it considers a joint Anglo-French proposal for a safe zone in Kabul to aid evacuation.As the August 31 withdrawal date for foreign forces neared, most nations wrapped up their evacuation operations while the Taliban held talks with Qatar and Turkey to run the airport’s security and operations.The Taliban also held talks in Kabul with the resistance in the Panjshir Valley led by Ahmad Massoud.Taliban’s elusive leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhund was reported to be in Kandahar for talks with Taliban leaders on government formation. The Taliban declared some Cabinet-level appointments but is yet to announce the head of government.

Speaking at the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC), Wellington, Tamil Nadu, he stressed on the need to view every dimension of national security.Takes dig at PakistanOne of our neighbouring countries has started resorting to proxy war. Terrorism has become an integral part of its state policy. It has started targeting India by providing arms, funds and training to terrorists. Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister.“India, despite its capabilities, has never attacked any country till date, he said. Though India believes in peace, it has always been ready on all fronts to protect self-respect and interest of its people and ensure their security,” he said. He reiterated the government’s resolve to protect the country against all types of external and internal threats. “After losing two wars, one of our neighbouring countries (Pakistan) has started resorting to proxy war, and terrorism has become an integral part of its state policy. It has started targeting India by providing arms, funds, and training to terrorists,” he said.“If a ceasefire (between India & Pakistan) is successful today, it is because of our strength. In 2016, cross-border strikes changed our reactionary mindset into a proactive mindset, which was further strengthened by the Balakot airstrike in 2019,” Singh added.On the Galwan Valley incident, he said the unilateral attempt to change status quo at the northern border was also dealt with a new dynamic. “Our soldiers displayed bravery as well as restraint, when required, to thwart enemy plans,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/situation-in-afghanistan-challenging-defence-minister-303899

Significantly, while attacking the Haryana Government for yesterday’s lathicharge on farmers, the farmer leader from western Uttar Pradesh also added that ‘kisan sabka hisab karega’.Worries in bjp campBrutality won’t be tolerated: TikaitWith members of farming/rural communities in the two neighbouring states sharing what is popularly known as “roti-beti ka rishta” (very close ties), “farmers’ unrest in Haryana may spell more trouble for the ruling BJP in poll-bound UP than it may have anticipated,” according to some observers.Notably, Jat leaders, including Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, have already criticised the police action amid the mounting Opposition’ attack against the Khattar government and the demand for a strict action against the officer caught on camera asking the police to “break farmers’ heads”.For the BJP leadership facing flak over “mismanagement” in UP during the second wave of Covid and trying to sooth upset farmers in western UP with better SAP for sugarcane, the happenings in Haryana could not have come at a more inappropriate time, the observers believe. Some independent surveys have suggested a dip in fortunes of the ruling party in the politically critical state. According to these surveys, BJP’s ratings have dropped by almost 10-12% in terms of votes as compared to what it polled in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-unrest-may-spell-trouble-for-bjp-in-election-bound-up-303913

The already-tense environment in the city was punctuated by an explosion that the Taliban said was a US attack on a suicide bomber heading for the airport.A short while before the air strike, the US State Department urged Americans near the Kabul airport to immediately leave the area due to a specific threat. In an apparent US-Taliban coordination, the air strike took out a potential bomber in a car but locals said a child was also hit.https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/us-airstrike-hits-suicide-bombers-targeting-kabul-airport-303791https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-india-to-continue-coordination-on-afghanistan-303789India was mentioned at a media interaction by Taliban senior leader Sher Muhammad Stanekzai who is believed to have met Indian interlocutors earlier in Doha as part of back channel talks.The Taliban, he said, wished to have good political and economic ties with India, including the air corridor that was operational under the previous regime.In another placatory signal at New Delhi, Taliban officials visited the Salma Dam which was built by India. The MEA did not react to this or the earlier observation by Taliban spokesman that Pakistan and India should resolve their issues bilaterally.India is poised to play a major role at the UNSC as it heads its Taliban sanctions committee whose nod is crucial to delist some of the group’s top members. In fact, some of the Taliban’s negotiations team could not travel to Doha due to the consequent ban on international travel. Also, the IMF, World Bank and the US Treasury are unlikely to transfer funds to men listed as terrorists by the committee headed by senior Indian diplomat T S Tirumurti.India will also preside over the UNSC’s deliberations on Monday when it considers a joint Anglo-French proposal for a safe zone in Kabul to aid evacuation and provide humanitarian air.As the August 31 withdrawal date for foreign forces neared, most wrapped up their evacuation operations while the Taliban held talks with Qatar and Turkey to run the airport’s security and operations.The Taliban also held talks in Kabul with the resistance in the Panjshir Valley led by Ahmad Massoud.Taliban’s elusive leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhund was reported in Kandahar for talks with Taliban leaders on government formation. The Taliban also declared some Cabinet level appointments but is yet to announce the head of government. The Taliban has said the next regime will be inaugurated in its spiritual heartland of Kandahar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taliban-makes-overtures-to-india-as-us-airstrike-in-kabul-hits-potential-bomber-303801
30-08-2021||---||US, India to continue coordination on Afghanistan||New Delhi, August 29External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar spoke on Sunday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to discuss continued coordination on Afghanistan and in the UN.The news was noticed in Kabul as Blinken and Jaishankar agreed to remain closely coordinated on “shared goals and priorities” to deepen the US-India partnership.While CIA chief William Burns met top Taliban leader Mullah Baradar in Kabul earlier this week, India is yet to publicly meet the new leadership in Afghanistan. The MEA holds that there are several entities in Kabul and it is waiting for the picture to clear.Read also:Taliban leader Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai has called for good ties with India but Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid has also spoken of India giving the people of Jammu & Kashmir their “right of self-determination”.“We the people of Afghanistan stand shoulder to shoulder with Kashmiris,” he had said.In Afghanistan, the Indian establishment opted for discretion over valour and was among the first among the major powers to completely evacuate its embassy. According to reports, the Taliban had contacted Indian diplomats, guaranteeing them safety if they stayed behind in Kabul. India had already shuttered its four consulates in Afghanistan much earlier. The takeover of Kabul’s security by fighters from the Haqqani network, said to be a “veritable arm of the ISI” is another cause for apprehension.But with memories of the 2008 attack on the Indian Embassy weighing heavily, India had turned down the offer. A suicide bomber had launched a complex attack on the Indian embassy gates killing 58 people, including Defence Attache Brig R D Mehta and diplomat Venkateswara Rao.As is the case with all attacks on Indian interests, Islamabad began suggesting that at worst, rogue ISI agents could be involved. But journalist Carlotta Gall later wrote in a book that “the bombing was no operation by rogue ISI agents. It was sanctioned and monitored by the most senior officials in Pakistani intelligence”. Washington had then rushed CIA deputy director Stephen Kappes to Islamabad to confront the ISI with the evidence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-india-to-continue-coordination-on-afghanistan-303789
