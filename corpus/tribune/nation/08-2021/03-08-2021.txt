03-08-2021||Kolkata||Bengal flood: 15 dead, 3 lakh affected; TMC, BJP engage in political slugfest||At least 15 people have died, and lakhs of people were rendered homeless or marooned, as the flood situation in six districts of West Bengal aggravated on Tuesday, triggering a slugfest between the ruling Trinamool Congress and the opposition BJP over the release of “excess water” by the DVC.Around three lakh people got displaced after heavy rain in the last few days, followed by discharge of water from Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) dams, inundated major parts of the districts of Purba Bardhaman, Paschim Bardhaman, Paschim Medinipur, Hooghly, Howrah and South 24 Parganas, officials said.The DVC, since July 31, has released 5.43 lakh cusec of water till Tuesday evening. Seven people died and 2.5 lakh have been affected by the flood Till Monday.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who keeps a tab on the relief and rescue operations and has sent ministers to the affected areas, is likely to conduct an aerial survey of Howrah and Hooghly districts on Wednesday to take stock of the situation.She will later conduct an administrative meeting, officials said.“We are collecting the details of all 15 people who have lost their lives due to the flood. Some deaths are due to electrocution, snake bite, wall collapse. We are waiting for a final report from district administrations,” an official said.Several areas in the six affected districts are reeling under flood, with people struggling to wade through waist-deep water.The districts of Hooghly, Howrah and West Midnapore are among the worst affected due to the floods.Around 79,000 people were affected in Hooghly district alone, whereas crops and livestock worth lakhs of rupees were destroyed.“Around 345 villages are affected by the floods, and more than 34 thousand hectares of crop area have been damaged. Around 1159 houses have been damaged in the district. We are presently running 89 relief camps,” a Hooghly district official said.The situation was worse in Kolkata’s neighbouring Howrah district, where around 1.8 lakh people were affected as 10 gram panchayats were severely affected by the floods.“Seven Gram Panchayats are completely under water, and three are partially submerged. The Udaynarayanpur block is the worst affected,” a Howrah district official said.Water from the Rupnarayan and the Dwarakeswar rivers have overtopped banks and entered residential areas, flooding homes, the official said.State Irrigation Minister Soumen Mahapatra conducted a tour of the Udaynarayanpur block in Howrah district and took stock of the relief and rescue operation.The Paschim Medinipur district administration has opened 212 relief camps as areas under 172 gram panchayats and seven municipalities were flooded. The link road between towns of Keshpur and Medinipur is under water.Over one lakh tarpaulin, 1,000 MT of rice, thousands of drinking water pouches and clean clothes have been sent to the shelters homes, an official stated.On Monday, the Army and the Air Force had undertaken rescue operations in Hooghly district, where rivers have overtopped banks and flooded villages.The ongoing flood situation triggered a political slugfest between the ruling TMC and the opposition BJP. Mahapatra accused the Central government-owned DVC of releasing water and causing a “man-made flood” situation.“The DVC deliberately released so much of water that it led to a flood-like situation. The Central government deliberately created this man-made flood situation in Bengal. We condemn such politics,” Mahapatra told reporters after his visit to Howrah.BJP state spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya termed the allegations “baseless”.“Before making such allegations, the TMC government should know why the water was released. There must be a logic behind DVC releasing the water. The fact is the state government has failed to conduct relief and rescue operations properly and are now blaming others,” he said.The DVC on Saturday said the storage facilities at Panchet and Maithon dams have reached their capacities due to heavy inflow of water from upstream Jharkhand, and discharge under such circumstances was “unavoidable”.A DVC official stated that the corporation released 5.43 lakh cusec of water till Tuesday evening since July 31.Water discharge is regulated by Damodar Valley Reservoir Regulation Committee, which has a representative from the state government, the official said.Teams of NDRF and SDRF, along with the state administration, are involved in the relief and rescue operation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-flood-15-dead-3-lakh-affected-tmc-bjp-engage-in-political-slugfest-292423
03-08-2021||New Delhi||Advocate seeks urgent hearing of plea against Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police chief||Advocate ML Sharma on Tuesday urged the Supreme Court to urgently take up his petition seeking contempt action against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for allegedly appointing Rakesh Asthana as the Delhi Police chief in violation of the court’s ruling on such appointments.“I have filed a contempt petition against the appointment of Rakesh Asthana,” Sharma told a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana.“If it is numbered, we will post it for hearing,” the CJI told Sharma.A day after the Delhi Assembly passed a resolution against Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police Commissioner, Sharma had filed a petition in the Supreme Court on July 30 seeking contempt action against Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Shah for allegedly violating the court’s ruling on such appointments.Sharma—who is known for filing PILs on various issues – contended that Asthana’s appointment by the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) went against the court’s ruling in Prakash Singh’s case on police reforms.The candidate should have had a minimum six months tenure left to be considered for being appointed as police chief, Sharma pointed out.A 1984-batch IPS officer from the Gujarat cadre, Asthana was the Director General of the Border Security Force (BSF) before being appointed as Delhi Police Commissioner.According to the judgment, as far as practicable the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) should consider officers with two years of service for such appointments and merit and seniority should be given due weightage, Sharma said and demanded that notification on Asthana’s appointment should be declared “illegal”.Three days before his retirement, the ACC had on Tuesday announced Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police commissioner.“The respondent no.1 (PM Modi) is the head of the ACC and respondent no.2 (Amit Shah) is the Minister of Home Affairs who jointly decided and did impugned appointment against the judgment of the Supreme Court. Hence, they are party to this for contempt of court,” Sharma submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/advocate-seeks-urgent-hearing-of-plea-against-asthanas-appointment-as-delhi-police-chief-292417

03-08-2021||Chennai||Madras HC strikes down ban on online gaming of rummy, poker||The Madras High Court on Tuesday struck down a recent amendment made to the Tamil Nadu Gaming Act, passed in 1930, which imposed a ban on online gaming of rummy and poker with stakes.The first Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy quashed the amendment made this year while allowing a batch of PIL petitions from Junglee Games India Private Limited and others.The Bench declared as unconstitutional, Part II of the TN Gaming & Police Laws (Amendment) Act, 2021, which banned betting or wagering in cyberspace and also games of skill if played for a wager, bet, money or other stakes.By imposing a wide-ranging complete ban, the least intrusive test was violated and the ban had thereby fallen foul of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution (right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business), the Bench said.The legislation assailed has to be regarded as something done capriciously and irrationally.It was excessive and disproportionate, it said.“This court, therefore, strikes down the amendment in its entirety as ultra vires the Constitution.”     The Bench, however, granted liberty to the State to pass another legislation, without any lacunae.It added that nothing in this judgment would prevent the state government from introducing an appropriate legislation conforming to the Constitutional principles of propriety.Earlier on July 26, when the court reserved its orders, Advocate General R Shanmugasundaram sought time to get instructions as to whether the new DMK government could amend the law, passed during the AIADMK regime in February this year, or promulgate an ordinance since the ban was imposed in public interest.However, the court declined the request and said there was no scope for the court to await the government’s decision after conclusion of arguments.When the AG claimed that online games were susceptible to manipulation, the Bench had quipped “you regulate it. You can’t ban the games altogether”.Roland Landers, CEO, All India Gaming Federation, welcomed the ruling.“We welcome the order of the Madras High Court, which iterates that the court is not against online gaming, and calls for the government to devise a regulatory framework to provide clarity to the sunrise online gaming industry with a view to encourage investments leading to technological advancements as well as generation of revenue and employment,” he added.He further said as the oldest online skill gaming industry body, the All India Gaming Federation has most of the stakeholders of the online gaming industry as its members.“We at AIGF have been at the forefront of ensuring global best practices for its stakeholders through the self- regulation skill games charter that cover all aspects of the online gaming business, overseen by an advisory of experts.To reinforce its process, AIGF has also partnered with Arthur D Little (ADL) and looks forward to wholeheartedly supporting and offering its expertise and experience if required to the government in this endeavour,” he added.In 2018, the All India Gaming Federation released the Skill games charter, which is based on the four foundations of integrity,legality, global best practices and good governance.The charter focuses entirely on player protection, responsible gaming, including guidelines for marketing and advertising, AIGF said in a press release.Through the adoption of principles and the disciplinary process, the AIGF has built a self-regulatory community and facilitative ecosystem for the offer of online games of skill in a transparent and fair manner, with due regard for consumer and stakeholder interests, it claimed in the release.

Claiming to be directly affected by the use of Pegasus spyware, petitioners, Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, SNM Abdi, Prem Shankar Jha, Rupesh Kumar Singh and Ipsa Shatakshi contended that it violated their fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.The Guild said all attempts to seek accountability and enforce Constitutional limits through Parliamentary processes have been stonewalled.“Through their intransigence, the Respondents have deliberately avoided public debate on this issue and have provided obfuscated answers, forcing the Petitioner to approach this Court,” read the petition which challenged the validity of electronic surveillance, hacking and use of spyware, and the existing legal architecture for surveillance, in light of the gigantic leaps in technology and surveillance capabilities.The Guild said journalists were tasked with enforcing the public's right to be informed, accountability, and to an open and transparent government and to be able to fulfil this role, freedom of the press must be safeguarded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-snooping-scandal-editors-guild-of-india-moves-sc-for-an-sit-probe-292410
03-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt approves 66 pc salary hike for MLAs||The Arvind Kejriwal government on Tuesday approved a 66 per cent hike in the salary and allowances of Delhi MLAs as proposed by the Centre, but expressed discontent that they were still among the lowest-paid legislators in the country.The hike that comes after a decade was given the nod at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and raises the existing monthly salary and allowances from Rs 54,000 to Rs 90,000, said a Delhi government statement.The Kejriwal government had requested the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) that the salary and allowances of Delhi MLAs should be at par with those from other states, it said.However, the MHA “restricted the proposal” of the Delhi government and capped the salary to only Rs 30,000, it added.“The BJP and Congress ruled states are currently paying 1.5 to 2 times higher salaries and allowances. The restriction imposed by the Centre has forced Delhi’s MLAs to be amongst the lowest earning MLAs in the country,” it said.The Delhi government had proposed a salary of Rs 54,000 for the MLAs at par with other states, however, the MHA did not allow this to happen and restricted it to Rs 30,000, government said.“Now the salary plus allowances of the MLAs of Delhi has been restricted by the MHA to Rs 90,000,” it said.Earlier, the MLAs were paid Rs 54,000 per month including Rs 12,000 salary and the remaining amount as allowances.The constituency allowance has been increased from Rs 18,000 to Rs 25,000, secretarial allowance from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000, telephone allowance from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 and conveyance allowance from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000.The salary and allowances of Delhi MLAs were last revised in 2011.Several BJP, Congress and regional party ruled states provide much more monthly salaries to their MLAs, even though living costs in Delhi are higher than most parts of India, the government said citing examples of Uttarakhand (Rs 1.98 lakh), Himachal Pradesh (Rs 1.9 lakh), Haryana (Rs 1.55 lakh), Bihar (Rs 1.3 lakh), Rajasthan (Rs 1.42 lakh) and Telangana (Rs 2.5 lakh).Many states provide several other perks to their MLAs like house rent, office rent and staff expenses, allowance for buying office equipment, vehicle, and driver allowance, that the Delhi government does not do.Delhi MLAs are also entitled to a daily allowance of Rs 1,000 (subject to a maximum of 40 days per year) for attending Assembly session or committee meetings, conveyance advance up to Rs 4,00,000 (repayable within office term), free medical facilities, Rs 4000 per month for electricity and water facility, annual travelling facility worth Rs 50,000, and Rs 30,000 per month for hiring two data entry operators.The government statement did not mention any change in these allowances.The proposal for an increase in the salary and allowances of Delhi MLAs was pending with the MHA for the last 5 years, the government claimed.“After several discussions, the MHA decided to restrict the increase to up to Rs 90,000 per month,” it said.The Delhi Cabinet approved the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, (Amendment) Bill 2021 and MLAs/Speaker-Dy Speaker/Chief Whip/Leader of Opposition of Legislative Assembly of Delhi (Amendment) Bills 2021.After the Cabinet nod, the proposal and draft bills will be sent for MHA’s approval before being placed in Delhi Assembly, it said.In December 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party government had got a bill passed in the Delhi Assembly raising emoluments of MLAs to Rs 2.10 lakh per month.The bill, however, became null and void as prior permission was not taken from the authorities concerned before tabling it in the Assembly.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP MLA Vijender Gupta “condemned” the AAP government for accusing the Centre of restricting the proposed hike.“Last year, they had sent a proposal for Rs 2.10 lakh per month salary and allowances which is a 400 per cent hike and cannot be justified. The Centre had approved the increase in the MLAs salary and perks six months ago and the blame put on it for delay by Kejriwal government is wrong,” Gupta said.Former Congress MLA Mukesh Sharma said the AAP government should also proportionately increase allowances of its employees and wages of workers who were worst hit by the Covid pandemic and lockdown.

However, the scores of 16,639 candidates have been held back.The CBSE has not yet given any timeline for the announcement of these results.“Either the data regarding marks of certain subjects was not available for these students or there were some calculation errors by the schools which were rejected by the portal for preparation of results.“The schools have been asked to resend their marks and their result be announced soon,” a senior board official said.The board exams were cancelled this year in view of the aggressive second wave of COVID-19 and the results have been prepared on basis of an alternative assessment policy announced by the CBSE.It is not just the over 16,000 class 10 students who have been kept waiting for their results.

03-08-2021||New Delhi||Parents of minor allegedly raped, murdered in Delhi demand capital punishment for culprits||The parents of the nine-year-old girl, who was allegedly raped and murdered in southwest Delhi, on Tuesday demanded capital punishment for the culprits.The Dalit girl died under suspicious circumstances, even as her parents alleged that she was raped and her body was forcibly cremated by a crematorium's priest in Old Nangal village, according to police.The girl's parents, along with several people, staged a sit in near the spot of the incident in Old Nangal area on Tuesday.The protest led to traffic snarls in and around the area.“My daughter went to get water from the crematorium when the incident happened. The priest showed me her body for a brief moment... her lips were blue. The priest cremated my child without our consent,” the girl's mother said.The woman said the priest is lying that the girl was electrocuted and alleged that he raped her.“Our community members doused the burning pyre and pulled the legs of my daughter. We need justice for her and the accused should get strict punishment,” she said.The father of the girl alleged that he was beaten up by a man who threatened him not file a police complaint."I was in the market when the incident happened. I got to know about it around 7.30 pm when her body was set on fire. A person from the nearby area assaulted me and threatened me to not file a complaint. He even offered me Rs 20,000, but I refused,” he said.“I suspect that the priest must have informed that person about the incident. We have only one demand that the accused must be hanged," the father said.On Monday too, agitated locals had blocked a stretch of road in the area and demanded strict punishment for the culprits following which additional police personnel were deployed.Deputy Commissioner of Police (southwest) on Tuesday said in a tweet, “We appeal to people not to believe rumours. Strict legal action has been taken under IPC, SC/ST Act and POCSO Act. An ACP rank officer will be the investigating officer.

Nowhere has the PM disputed the number we have put out of seven minutes. It is a cultural idiom that people understand. Would PM be happier if I used ‘dhokla’ instead?” the Trinamool Congress leader later told reporters.Dhokla is a popular Gujarati snack.“I speak in the language of the people. I have taken a serious fact and used a popular cultural idiom to spread the message,” O’Brien said.The MP and his Lok Sabha colleague Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar served ‘chaat’ to mediapersons on Tuesday and even had their share of the savoury snack.

03-08-2021||Chandigarh||Panel suggests handing over modernisation of landing facilities at defence airfields to AAI||A key Parliamentary panel has suggested that elements pertaining to navigation equipment and landing facilities in the Ministry of Defence’s project on Modernisation of Military Airfields Infrastructure (MAFI) be handed over to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for implementation as it would help increase operational efficiency and enhance flight safety of civilian aircraft, particularly in adverse weather conditions.Parliament’s Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture has recommended that civil aviation agencies form a high-level committee with the Indian Air Force to cull out activities from MAFI that are related to navigation equipment, approach landing systems, runway and threshold lights etc.“The utilization of these navigational aids, which have been installed across the country, is primarily done by AAI, which has domain knowledge. They are also familiar with the quality procurement process, maintenance and operational requirements of these instruments which they have been using for civil operations for over 50 years,” the committee said in its report tabled in Parliament on August 2.AAI manages 137, which include 23 domestic civil enclaves at military airfields. While the civil terminal building and facilities for civilian passengers are the jurisdiction of AAI, air operations at civil enclaves, including the runway, air traffic control and emergency services are owned and operated by the defence ministry.AAI also provides air traffic management services over the entire Indian airspace and adjoining oceanic areas.Expressing concern over the considerable delay in flight operations and cancellation of flights at various airports due to non-availability of Category-II and Category-III Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), the committee asked the Ministry of Civil Aviation to ensure up-gradation of air navigation infrastructure in the country on utmost priority and in line with international standards.Hoping that the MAFI, which is a turnkey project, would enhance the operational capability by facilitating air operations of civilian aircraft in poor visibility and adverse weather conditions while enhancing aerospace safety, the committee recommended that development of the reset of the infrastructure planned under MAFI may continue as envisaged for greater synergy between civil aviation requirements and the operational requirements of the IAF.MAFI is a multi-phase project to improve infrastructure and operational facilities at military airfields that includes installation and commissioning of modern airfield equipment like ILS, airfield lighting system, automation, upgrading of air traffic control services and refurbishment of runway and dispersal day surfaces.In the first phase, 30 airfields were upgraded, while in the second phase that commenced in 2020, another 37 airfields will be covered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/panel-suggests-handing-over-modernisation-of-landing-facilities-at-defence-airfields-to-aai-292379

The HC has reserved its order.But the magistrate noted that the investigating officer (IO) had recorded the reason for the arrest, as required. "This court on July 20 (during a remand hearing) came to the conclusion that the arrest of the accused is as per law," the judge said."The IO has already mentioned the reasons for the arrest of both the accused. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the accused are entitled to bail," the magistrate said.As per the IO's reply, Pradeep Bakshi, an accused who is a relative of Kundra, was absconding. Also, a huge amount of data was collected by the police and its analysis was still going on, the court said.Remanding the accused in judicial custody (as against police custody) does not mean that the probe is over, it said.The accused had deleted some incriminating data, and there was every possibility that they may tamper with evidence if released on bail, the court said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/raj-kundra-is-accused-of-offence-detrimental-to-societys-health-court-292374

We need to identify barriers within the labour room and address them through capacity and infrastructure building to improve breastfeeding practices," she said.Varghese further recommended investing in two aspects of critical importance.Firstly, counselling of pregnant women and their families on early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding during every interaction with them.Secondly, capacity building of labour room and postnatal care ward staff and retaining them in these facilities. While the disruptions in services and counselling have highlighted the deficiencies in our health and nutrition services, they also present an opportunity to adopt new approaches, the NGO said in a statement.“While India has a law to protect breastfeeding, it needs action for enforcement”, says Varghese.There is a need to accelerate efforts to make sure that the gains achieved in the past decades aren't lost. Children are the future and adequate investments in their health and nutrition need to be made to ensure a solid foundation for their growth and development, it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/re-focusing-on-breastfeeding-more-important-amid-pandemic-ngo-292353

In 2019, in all the 28 states in the country, 61 such cases were registered, of which 72 people died.The Minister said, since West Bengal did not provide data for the year 2019, the NCRB compiled the list of such registered cases and the number of victims on the basis of 2018 figures for the state.Among the states, Jharkhand topped the list with 49 cases registered and as many people becoming victims of such crime. But the maximum such incident took place in 2017 in the state with 44 people becoming a victim of murder with a political motive.As per the NCRB data, West Bengal witnessed the second-highest number of such murders (27) and Bihar was third with 26 deaths.Among the northern states, Punjab saw 10 such deaths in 7 cases in the three years, whereas Haryana registered 2 deaths in as many cases and in Himachal Pradesh there was only one death during the period.Meanwhile, responding to another question, the Minister said, as many as 348 people died in police custody in different parts of the country in the last three years, while 1,189 others were found to be tortured during detention.Rai said based on the information received from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), 136 people died in police custody in 2018, 112 in 2019 and 100 in 2020.Moreover, 542 people were tortured in police custody in 2018, 411 in 2019 and 236 in 2020, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/230-people-murdered-in-india-with-political-motive-during-2017-19-mha-292352

We must not forget the fact that we have achieved it while fighting the worst pandemic of the last 100 years. There are sports in which our players have qualified for the very first time,” Modi said in a virtual address.He was taking part in a Gujarat government’s event of distributing free ration to the poor. The event, held in Dahod, was part of the nine-day long celebration of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani’s five years in office.Modi in his speech said, “Our players haven’t just qualified, they are giving their best performance too. New India’s towering self-confidence is reflecting in each game. Our Olympics players and teams are giving a tough fight to their competitors having better rankings. The conviction and confidence of Indian players are at their peak.” He said the Indian players are more confident because of the transparency in the system and the identification of right talent.“This self-confidence comes naturally when the right talent is identified and promoted, when the system gets changed and transparency is brought in. This new self-confidence is now becoming the identity of new India and reaching every nook and corner of the country,” the PM said.Notably, India’s Mirabai Chanu ended the country’s over two-decade long wait for a weightlifting medal at the Olympics, clinching the 49kg category silver medal recently.In another achievement, PV Sindhu on Sunday became only the second Indian and the country’s first woman to win two Olympic medals, securing a bronze after a straight-game win in the badminton women’s singles third-place play-off.Debutant Lovlina Borgohain (69kg) assured India of its first boxing medal at the ongoing Olympic Games when she entered the semifinals on Friday.Two days back, the Indian men’s hockey team entered the Olympic semifinals following a 49-year gap.

Technical surveillance revealed that Manoj was also present near the same restaurant till 10.30 pm,” she said.Accused Mukesh was in regular touch with Manoj and from CCTV analysis and ground verification, it was established that Mukesh was also present at the same restaurant on July 29, police said.“During interrogation, Mukesh disclosed that he was hired by Manoj to give information about the movement of Kohli and was paid cash for this work. He did a recce of Kohli's movement for 10 days and passed all the information to Manoj,” said DCP Goel.“On July 29, when Kohli came outside Singh Chicken Corner and boarded an auto-rickshaw at 10.15 pm, Mukesh along with another associate immediately passed this information to Manoj, who was present there with three other associates and all of them started following him on two different two-wheelers," she said."After some distance, they overpowered him in his auto-rickshaw and took him to an unknown place and then murdered him in Sonipat,” the police officer said.Raids are being conducted to arrest the remaining accused including Manoj, who has two murder and attempt to murder cases registered at Najafgarh police station. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-hired-by-money-lender-to-kill-38-year-old-customs-clearance-agent-arrested-in-west-delhi-292331

Some $2 trillion will be spent on infrastructure in just the next decade. The bulk of the infrastructure needed for 2030 is yet to be built. That's why some 100 new airports are under planning or construction today alone,” he said.In his commencement address to the Jindal University School of Banking and Finance, the former US Ambassador to India told young students that India has the youngest workforce in Asia.“…and you'll hold that advantage until 2050. That's pretty formidable,” he said in his remarks on 'Driving Shared Prosperity — A 21st Century Priority for US-India Ties'.The first ever Indian-American envoy to India said the modern US-India relationship was quite young.“We mark the start of this era with President Clinton's visit to India in the year 2000.  It was a breakthrough visit after decades of being somewhat distant, and even at times, estranged,” he said.In his address, Verma asserted that it was now time for the relationship to deliver.“We can no longer look decades into the future. The time to deliver results for our people is now – it's today – that's a big challenge, but it's also exciting, for us here in America, and for all of you in India, especially as you start out on your studies and then careers,” he said.“The reason I care about this subject so much and want to talk to you about it today is that I do think this is the most consequential relationship of this century.  We can do so much together," he added."Whether it's battling a pandemic, countering terrorism and proliferation, or bringing to market all those new innovations and solutions that will make people's lives easier, safer, greener, more prosperous, more inclusive and more secure.  We can do that. We are not there yet, but can we get there,” he explained.Verma also said he first-hand witnessed the picture of India on the dramatic rise when he travelled to every Indian state.“It is why I am so excited for all of you. You have the world at your fingertips. Your country will have a leading seat in international institutions, your businesses will continue to power economic growth and innovations globally, and all of you can choose what role you want to play today and in the future.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/by-2030-india-might-lead-the-world-in-almost-every-category-former-us-ambassador-to-india-292288

Sources confirmed to The Tribune that the mutual disengagement from PP 17-A was expected to be physically implemented over the next 3-4 days. The disengagement at this point would entail increasing the distance between fully armed troops of either side, it’s like creating a “wider buffer zone” to prevent any flare-up. Currently, tanks, guns, missile launchers and troops are lined up within striking distance of each other on the Ladakh plateau, which is at an altitude of 14,000 ft. The Gogra disengagement was agreed upon at the 12th round of India-China Corps Commander-level talks held at the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point on July 31. There was no discussion on disengaging from the Depsang Bulge, a 972-sq km plateau.Disengagement over next 3-4 daysDisengagement from PP 17-A (Gogra) is expected to be physically implemented over the next 3-4 daysIt will entail increasing the distance between both armies to create a ‘wider buffer zone’ to prevent any incidentJoint statement released by MoDThe two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolution of remaining areas….

China in turn objects to the US missions, saying they do not help promote peace or stability.Washington has put countering China at the heart of its national security policy and seeks to rally partners against what it says are Beijing's increasingly coercive economic and foreign policies.India’s military deployment also comes on a day when Germany sent a warship to the South China Sea for the first time in almost two decades, joining other Western nations in expanding its military presence in the region amid growing alarm over China's territorial ambitions.Officials in Berlin have said the German navy will stick to common trade routes. The frigate is not expected to sail through the Taiwan Strait either, another regular US activity condemned by Beijing.Countries including Britain, France, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, have also been expanding their activity in the Pacific to counter China's influence.—  Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-navy-task-force-to-deploy-in-south-china-sea-western-pacific-291860
