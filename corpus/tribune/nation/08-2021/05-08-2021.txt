05-08-2021||New Delhi||Bail plea citing weak evidence lands accused in trouble, SC favours transfer of case||Vehement submissions to secure bail by an Army man in his wife’s death case by referring to weak evidence in the chargesheet landed him in bigger trouble as the Supreme Court on Thursday raised suspicion over police probe and asked the Rajasthan government to consider transferring the matter to an “independent investigating agency”. The apex court Bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana was hearing the bail plea of jailed 38-year-old Sahabuddin, a resident of Alwar in Rajasthan who is accused of abetting the suicide of his wife after a fight over a trivial issue and filming her death on his mobile.The Bench, which also comprised Justice Surya Kant, indicated its opinion at the outset to lawyer Abhishek Gupta for the accused saying that his own daughter has given the statement to the police about his involvement in the crime.It suggested that the offence was grave and it would not entertain the bail plea till the recording of statement of key witnesses.“You have killed your wife and had an illicit affair with other lady. You did not rescue your wife and rather video-graphed the suicide. Please do not invite observations on merits of the case,” the Bench said.However, the lawyer vehemently attempted to pursue the plea for bail by inviting the Bench’s attention to the chargesheet submitted by Rajasthan Police in the case saying there was no direct evidence linking him to the offence and moreover he is an Army personnel and his life would be ruined.The CJI instantly caught some weak-links in the chargesheet and said, “I have not seen such kind of chargesheet in my entire professional life” and instead of dismissing the bail plea, he issued the notice to the state government flagging the apparent shoddy probe.The Bench, which was advising the lawyer to take back the plea, did not allow him to withdraw it.   “Taking into consideration the manner in which investigation appears to have been conducted and consequential chargesheet dated June 30, 2021 filed against the petitioner, we are prima facie of the view that the matter should be transferred to an independent Investigating Agency for further investigation.“Issue notice to the respondent – State to consider about sending the instant matter to an independent Investigating Agency for further investigation taking into consideration the chargesheet filed against the petitioner,” the Bench ordered.Sahabuddin, presently lodged in Alwar jail, had filed an appeal in the apex court challenging the July 9, 2021 order of the Rajasthan High Court denying him the bail.The accused had married the deceased spouse in 2002 and it was alleged that he had extended some financial help to the brother of his wife and had a fight with her over demand of money, the high court had noted in its order.The accused said, after the verbal duel, he came out and his wife committed suicide after locking herself inside the room in April, this year.The accused said he had tried to save the deceased by making several requests to open the door of the room.

05-08-2021||Mathura (UP)||Mathura violence: Cult leader Ram Vriksh Yadav should be presumed alive, says his lawyer||The counsel of Ram Vriksh Yadav, who was killed in police action during clashes with his followers at Jawahar Bagh here in 2016, said on Thursday that the cult leader should be presumed alive since authorities have not provided any DNA test report confirming his death.At least 29 people, including two police officers, were killed in the clashes in June 2016 when the police tried to evict the cult members from the compound from where a large cache of arms was also recovered.After the violence, the Uttar Pradesh Police had said that Yadav was among those killed and that his body had been identified by his associates and family.Yadav and his supporters ran an illegal settlement at Jawahar Bagh in Mathura in Uttar Pradesh for over two-and-a-half years.Talking to reporters here, Yadav’s counsel Laxmikant Gautam said, “Since the report of scientific investigation (DNA test) has not been submitted in the court so far, it is presumed that he is still alive.”        Gautam said he would request the court to direct the CBI, which is now investigating the case, for early submission of the DNA test report.The counsel also said the CBI’s failure to submit the chargesheet even four years after the incident also raises doubt.

05-08-2021||Mumbai||790 child marriages stopped in Maharashtra during pandemic: Govt||As many as 790 child marriages have been prevented in Maharashtra during the Covid-19 pandemic so far, Women and Child Development Minister Yashomati Thakur said on Thursday.She was speaking to reporters after the state government, UNICEF and NGO Akshay Centre launched a new campaign to bring down the number of such marriages further.A sudden spurt in child marriages was witnessed during lockdown, which prompted the government to launch the latest campaign, which will run from August 5 to the end of September.According to officials, the district of Solapur led the list with 88 marriages of girls under 18 years being prevented since April 2020, followed by Aurangabad (62), Osmanabad (45), Nanded (45), Yavatmal (42) and Beed (40).Her department is also strengthening "ground level prevention mechanism" such as village child protection committees, child protection systems and the helplline `CHILDLINE 1098', the minister said.A committee has been constituted to suggest changes to the Child Marriage Prohibition Act, 2008, Thakur added.According to Rajeshwari Chandrasekar of UNICEF, Maharashtra is among the top five states in terms of incidence of child marriage in the country.The incidence of child marriage in the state declined from 47.7 per cent in 1998 to 21.9 per cent in 2019, but even now one in five marriages involves underage girls and there has been increase in such incidents in some districts, she noted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/790-child-marriages-stopped-in-maharashtra-during-pandemic-govt-293517

05-08-2021||Mumbai||Antilia bomb scare case: No bail for Waze; NIA gets more time to file charge sheet||A court here on Thursday gave the NIA one month’s time to file chargesheet in the case of an SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and murder of Mansukh Hiran, and rejected prime accused Sachin Waze’s plea for ‘default’ bail.The bail application of Waze, a dismissed police officer, was “meritless” and wasted the court’s time, the judge said.On June 9, the special NIA court had granted an extension of two months to the National Investigation Agency to submit its chargesheet.The central agency later sought another extension, saying the investigation was still underway.Waze, who has been dismissed from service, had sought bail on the ground that the probe agency failed to file the chargesheet within the stipulated time.He was arrested on March 13, 2021, following the death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran who had claimed that the SUV found near Ambani’s south Mumbai residence ‘Antilia’ on February 25 had been stolen from his possession.Besides Waze, former ‘encounter specialist’ officer Pradeep Sharma and a few other former policemen have been also arrested in the case.Seeking bail, Waze had argued, citing an earlier ruling, that he was first arrested under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) provisions, and booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) later.Hence, the NIA should have filed chargesheet within 90 days, as provided for offenses under the IPC, and not within 180 days as allowed under the UAPA, he contended.He was thus entitled to default bail on the 91st day of his arrest in the absence of chargesheet, Waze submitted.But judge D E Kothalikar rejected the argument, saying it was a “meritless application” and “precious time was wasted’ in its hearing.It did not impose any cost on the accused considering that he was in jail, the court said.The court had rejected a similar bail application by Waze in June too.

05-08-2021||Bhubaneswar||Once Doon School goalie, Odisha CM stands tall for hockey in India||When India won the hockey bronze in Tokyo, many praised Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who was the goalkeeper of Doon School hockey team, for singularly supporting the Indian team since 2018.When Sahara backed out from sponsoring the national men’s and women’s hockey teams, it was the Odisha government led by Patnaik that decided to sponsor both for the next five years. At that time, many expressed surprise over this move.Patnaik had then said, “Investment in sports is an investment in youth. Investment in youth is an investment in the future.”This statement has become a campaigning slogan for the development of sports in the state.The slogan stands out of the massive hoarding with a picture of the chief minister at the main gate of the Kalinga Stadium here.The chief minister was a hockey player during his school days. He was the goalkeeper of the Doon School team. He did not stop only with sponsoring the Indian hockey teams. He followed up the action by taking steps to promote hockey in the state.The Patnaik government has developed a world-class hockey stadium in Bhubaneswar and successfully hosted several national and international tournaments, such as the Champions Trophy (2014), Hockey World League (2017) and Odisha Men’s Hockey World Cup (2018).In 2019, in recognition of his government’s contributions to the sport, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) presented the prestigious FIH President’s Award to the chief minister.On May 29 this year, on the occasion of the completion of the second year of his government’s fifth term, Patnaik said, “We continue to focus on sports development in the state. Sports development projects worth more than Rs 1,000 crore have been taken up, including the development of India’s largest hockey stadium in Rourkela.”According to a government source, the state will invest more than Rs 350 crore on the development of the Birsa Munda International Hockey Stadium and practice pitch in Rourkela, and the expansion of the Kalinga Stadium. These two stadiums will host the next edition of the Men’s Hockey World Cup in 2023.With the raw talent available in the tribal belt, especially Sundergarh, hockey players such as the former captain, Dillip Tirkey, were essentially the torchbearers of the sport in the state.To popularise hockey in Sundergarh, the state government has decided to set up 17 training centres in the district at a cost of Rs 150 crore. These training centres will have synthetic hockey fields (sand dressed) and an administrative /changing room building, the source said.The state has also decided to develop sports infrastructure including indoor stadiums in different urban local bodies across the state with an investment of Rs 462 crore.With all these initiatives in place, the state was able to send four players—Amit Rohidas, Birendra Lakra, Deep Grace Ekka and Namita Toppo—to represent India at the Tokyo Olympics in both men’s and women’s hockey.After winning the bronze in Tokyo on Thursday, the Indian men’s hockey team captain Manpreet Singh thanked the chief minister for his support. “I also would like to thank Sri @Naveen_Odisha Ji for his constant support to Indian hockey!,” Singh tweeted.

05-08-2021||New Delhi||Modification of Arunachal ST list is a blow for NSCN (I-M)||At a time when the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isaac-Muivah) is protesting over what it terms as the Government of India’s “silence” on the agreement signed six years ago, the armed separatist group has been inflicted a fresh blow with the passing of a bill in the Rajya Sabha that will pave the way for denial of the existence of Nagas in Arunachal Pradesh.The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2021 passed by Rajya Sabha on Thursday to modify the list of Scheduled Tribes in Arunachal Pradesh would undermine the demand of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isaac – Muivah) group for bringing all Naga inhabited areas of the country under one unit to be called the “Nagalim”.The proposed Nagalim, or Greater Nagaland, is supposed to comprise Naga inhabited areas of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh also besides Nagaland.The bill unanimously passed by the Rajya Sabha today will result in the removal of the reference “any Naga tribes” from the ST list of Arunachal Pradesh and replace it with the specific names of Nocte, Tangsa, Tutsa and Wancho tribes.The formula could be also found attractive by Assam and Manipur, two states with a significant number of people known as the Nagas.Arunachal politicians have always been demanding modification of the ST list of the state to remove the “any Naga tribe” category and replace it with the specific names of the tribes. Senior Arunachal Pradesh Congress leader and former union minister Ninong Ering welcomed the step, saying it would benefit the youths of communities.“Youths belonging to these tribes face difficulties while taking the UPSC and other central services examination because the specific names of the tribes were not included in the schedule. I am happy that the problem is being addressed finally”, Ering said while speaking to this reporter over the phone.KG Kenye of the Naga Peoples Front (NPF), the lone representative of Nagaland in Rajya Sabha, did not take part in the discussion over the bill. Calls made to his mobile phone also went unanswered.The Nagalim map the NSCN (IM) had released sometime back included Tirap, Changlang, Longding, Anjaw, Lohit and Namsai districts of Arunachal Pradesh.“We are aware of the NSCN (IM)'s vision of Nagalim or Greater Nagaland, but there are no Nagas in Arunachal Pradesh. All the tribes inhabiting the State are Arunachalese”, All Arunachal Pradesh Students Union (AAPSU) general secretary Tobom Dai said.The NSCN (I-M) recently called for a 12-hour shutdown in Naga inhabited areas to protest against the “non-fulfilment” of the Peace Accord signed in 2015.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modification-of-arunachal-st-list-is-a-blow-for-nscn-i-m-293505

No matter how much these people try to stop the development of the country, this country is not going to be bound by them. The country is progressing rapidly on every front, challenging every difficulty,” he added.Speaking on Uttar Pradesh, the Prime Minister said in the past decades the state was always seen through the prism of politics.“The double engine government has changed the way we look at UP’s potential from a narrower vision. The confidence that UP can become the powerhouse of India’s growth engine has been born in recent years,” he said.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also present on the occasion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/august-5-will-be-remembered-in-history-article-370-was-abrogated-ram-mandir-associated-with-it-pm-modi-293502

Therefore, after successful demonstration of household purifiers in one village, concept is being replicated in Arsenic affected habitations for providing household purifiers.With as many as 20,956 rural habitations with quality issues in drinking water sources, Assam tops the list followed by Rajasthan (12,160), Bihar (3,966), Odisha (3,465) West Bengal (3,092) and Tripura (1,335).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-132-rural-habitations-in-punjab-reported-to-have-quality-issues-in-drinking-water-sources-293501

Those arrested include people living in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida and Gurgaon.The call centre was operational since last one year from the special economic zone (SEZ) in the Bisrakh area, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Noida) Ankur Aggarwal said."A total of 32 people have been arrested from the call centre that was duping American citizens. The accused would interact with the US citizens over internet and send bugs into their computer system but scare them by telling that their system has got a virus," he said."The accused would then offer them a solution for virus removal and ask the target to transfer money for the service being provided by them. The accused would then remove the bug created by them only," the officer said.The accused would seek up to USD 1,000 (approximately Rs 74,000 as per Thursday's exchange rate) in exchange of their "service", DCP Aggarwal told reporters."The call centre made a profit of up to USD 4,000 every night and they had been operational for around a year now, as per information gained from the accused during questioning. The fraud amount is well in crores of rupees," he said, adding that employees working on calls were paid Rs 20,000 a month while the manager was getting Rs 1.25 lakh to Rs 1.50 lakh monthly.He said around 15 to 20 more people, including the mastermind behind the con job, have been identified and search is on to track and arrest them.An FIR has been lodged at the Bisrakh police station under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and under provisions of the Information Technology Act, the police said.The police have seized 50 computers and related devices from the call centre, where people worked overnight in order to match the normal work hours in the US, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fake-call-centre-duped-over-rs-10-crore-from-us-citizens-32-arrested-293499

Both governments agree to take forward Ministry of Home Affairs’ initiatives to remove prevailing tensions and to find lasting solutions through discussions,” the Mizoram CMO tweeted.Assam minister Ashok Singhal said in a Twitter post, “With great optimism from both sides, we held our discussion with the Home Minister of Mizoram @Lalchamliana12 Ji & other officials on resolving the #AssamMizoramBorder issue. This is in continuation of the discussion initiated by HCM @himantabiswa Ji & HCM @ZoramthangaCM Ji.”          Both states have differing interpretations of their territorial border. While Mizoram believes that its border lies along an ‘inner line’ drawn up in 1875 to protect tribals from outside influence, Assam goes by a district demarcation done in the 1930s.

On the contrary, the subject of the study tour was enhancement of usage of web media. It is in this backdrop that the acceptance and sanctioning of the said tour creates a reasonable suspicion on the purpose and motivation behind it,” the PIL said.As much as Rs 14 lakh were spent on the tour from the state exchequer, it claimed.Further, replies to queries under the Right To Information said even though the proposal for the tour had been drafted hurriedly and violated several rules, it was nevertheless approved by the government, the petition said.The HC asked the petitioner’s lawyer if the Supreme Court was adjudicating upon a similar issue.Advocate Dande said the issues in a petition related to the Pegasus row before the apex court were different.The bench then issued notices and asked the respondents to “file affidavits in reply, if any, within four weeks.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-questions-maharashtra-officials-2019-israel-tour-lawyer-claims-it-was-to-acquire-pegasus-like-spyware-293494

Just before the onset of the parliamentary session, a campaign orchestrated by many of the elements hostile to the present government comes out,” he saidPrasad said that the opposition has not presented any proof that Pegasus spyware was used to tap into the phone numbers.“We are ready for a discussion in Parliament. When the Minister made a statement on the issue, these people tore it in front of him,” he said.The appearance of the report a day before the monsoon session was not a coincidence, he said, adding that India had “robust” systems to prevent illegal surveillance, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-prima-facie-evidence-to-back-up-allegations-about-phones-being-hacked-by-govt-bjp-293475

05-08-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala govt faces criticism over new Covid guidelines||The Kerala government has taken a lot of flak over its new Covid guidelines, but the Health Minister has said that there will be no change in the decision.State Health Minister Veena George announced the new guidelines on Wednesday, which says that those who enter shops, banks and other establishments should have at least one dose of vaccine or an RT-PCR certificate not older than 72 hours.In the Kerala Assembly, on Thursday, Leader of Opposition V.D. Satheesan led a walkout of the House in protest against George, who categorically said there would be no change in the norms."It's strange that to buy 2 kg of rice one has to be either vaccinated or carry RT-PCR certificate. Fail to understand what sort of rationale and logic is being used," said Satheesan.Incidentally, the relaxed new lockdown norms came hours after Kerala recorded 50 per cent of the daily new Covid cases in the country, and on Wednesday 22,414 new Covid cases were reported.Meanwhile, social media was flush with activity, trolling the Kerala government's new guidelines. Many termed it as illogical as only around 50 per cent of the state population has received their first dose, thus forcing the remaining 50 per cent to remain indoors.And, adding insult to the injury came a fresh Central government guideline which has asked states like Kerala having a high Covid spread to ensure that strict adherence to Covid protocols and festivals should not see any sort of crowding.With Kerala's traditional harvest festival—Onam all set to commence, the new set of guidelines are going to create a lot of confusion.According to the new guidelines, all shops, tourism centres and other establishments should display the status of vaccination of employees and the number of customers permitted at a time.It shall be the responsibility of the owner of such establishments to avoid crowding inside and outside the shop. Enforcement agencies will conduct checks and take action to ensure the above.All establishments in the public sector, including government offices, PSUs, companies, autonomous organisations, and commissions will function from Monday to Friday.It was also informed that persons who have taken at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine before two weeks, or who are in possession of RT-PCR negative certificate taken 72 hours before or who is in possession of Covid-19 positive results more than a month old will be allowed inside (workers/visitors) in shops, markets, banks, public and private offices, financial institutions, factories, industrial establishments, open tourist spaces and other establishments. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-govt-faces-criticism-over-new-covid-guidelines-293459
05-08-2021||Chennai||ISRO to launch Geo Imaging Satellite-1 on August 12||Three days prior to the celebration of its Independence Day, India will be sending up its earth observation satellite EOS-03 earlier named or the Geo Imaging Satellite-1 (GISAT-1), said the Indian space agency.The GISAT-1 will be the country’s first sky eye or earth observation satellite to be placed in geo-stationary orbit.The GISAT-1 will be launched by the rocket Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle-F10 (GSLV-F10) on Aug 12. The rocket is expected to blast off at 5.43 a.m. on that day from the second launch pad, said Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).India’s rocket port is located at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh.The GSLV-F10 rocket will leave the GISAT-1 at the geosynchronous transfer orbit from where the satellite will be taken up to its final position firing its on board motors.Once placed in geostationary orbit, the satellite will have a steady eye on the areas of interest (the satellite will move in sync with the rotation of the earth and hence would look stationary) unlike other remote sensing satellites placed in lower orbit that can come to a spot only at regular intervals.Originally, the GISAT-1 was slated for launch on March 5, 2020, but hours before the launch ISRO, announced postponement of the mission owing to some technical glitch.Soon after the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown delayed the mission. The rocket had to be dismantled and cleaned up.Subsequently, the GISAT-1 launch was slated for March 2021 but due to problems in the satellite’s battery side, the flight got delayed.With the replacement of the battery the satellite and the rocket were being readied for their flight at Sriharikota when the second wave of Covid-19 swept in affecting many at the rocket launch centre.The Indian space agency had earlier said the 2,268 kg GISAT-1 would provide a real time image of a large area of region of interest at frequent intervals. It will also enable quick monitoring of natural disasters, episodic events and any short-term events.The satellite will have payload imaging sensors of six band multi-spectral visible and near infra-red with 42 metres resolution; 158 bands hyper-spectral visible and near infra-red with 318 metres resolution and 256 bands hyper-spectral short wave infra-red with 191 metres resolution.A four metre diameter Ogive shaped payload fairing (heat shield) has been used in the rocket for the first time, ISRO had said.According to ISRO, after GISAT-1 launch, the other satellite to go up will be EOS-4 or Risat-1A is a radar imaging satellite with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) that can take pictures during day and night looking through the clouds.The satellite weighing over 1,800 kg will be carried by the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) this September, said ISRO.The EOS-4 is a repeat microwave remote sensing satellite of Risat-1 and is configured to ensure continuity of SAR in C-Band providing microwave data to the user community for operational services.The satellite will play a strategic role in the nation’s defence with its capability to operate in day, night and all weather conditions with a mission life of five years.The satellite has high data handling systems and high storage devices among other things.According to ISRO, the satellite will provide imaging data for various applications related to land, water and environment which find useful inputs for agriculture, forestry and water resource management, said ISRO.An ISRO official had earlier said an earth observation satellite will send pictures which will be used by different agencies as per their needs.The Risat-1 weighing 1,858 kg was launched in 2012 using a PSLV rocket. Its mission life was five years. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isro-to-launch-geo-imaging-satellite-1-on-august-12-293458
05-08-2021||Lucknow||‘Mission UP’ in mind, Akhilesh Yadav embarks on cycle yatra||With an eye on the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday embarked on a ‘cycle yatra’ here to raise issues like price rise, unemployment, farm laws and crime rate.Though the “cycle yatra” at the tehsil-level in all districts marks the birth anniversary of veteran socialist leader Janeshwar Mishra, the purpose, political observers say, is to galvanise the SP ahead of the upcoming state Assembly elections, barely few months away.Before pedalling down the streets of the state capital, Yadav told mediapersons at the party headquarters that his party will win 400 seats in the next assembly elections.“I was saying that we will win 350 seats. But seeing the anger of people, I can say we can now win 400 seats,” the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said.Uttar Pradesh has 403 Assembly seats.Flaying the BJP government in the state over management of the pandemic, he said, “I condole death of all those who died during the second wave of Covid. The government did not help those who lost their family members. It could not arrange oxygen and medicines and left people to die”.Attacking the BJP for allegedly inducting criminals, Yadav said that as elections are nearing, the saffron party has put its ideology on the back-burner.“Party has not read its election manifesto (of 2017). Now it is concentrating on ‘money-festo’. The BJP has no work culture and could do nothing in the past over four years except renaming projects of previous SP regime,” he charged. The BJP has made Uttar Pradesh the number one state in terms of number of malnourished children, custodial deaths and disposing bodies in River Ganga, he charged.Taking a swipe at Yogi Adityanath, he said that as the Chief Minister did not know how to operate a laptop, he did not distribute it to children.“He (CM) must not be knowing about DNA and its full form. You (media) persons can go and ask him,” he said when asked about laying the foundation of a forensic science institute in the state capital.The yatra, which will cover a distance of 5-10 km in all districts, is being taken out to protest the “anti-people” policies of the ruling BJP, price rise, unemployment, farm laws, rising crime and to demand release of jailed party leader Azam Khan, the party said.It said the cycle march in Lucknow will cover a distance of 6.5 km.Cycle is the SP’s election symbol and laying of cycling tracks along important thoroughfares, especially in the state capital, with demarcations painted red and green (colour of the party flag) has often incurred the wrath of its political rivals.The Samajwadi Party also plans to take out a ‘Rath Yatra’ in the state in October which will cover almost all the 75 districts of the state.The SP recently concluded a series of meetings with the workers of over 300 of the 403 assembly constituencies.During these meetings, the names of probable candidates for assembly segments were also discussed.The party has made it clear that it will not have an electoral alliance with any of the major parties. However, it is open for alliance with smaller parties, Yadav had told PTI in a recent interview.Making light of the cycle yatra, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said the SP is now remembering the late Janeshwar Mishra after the immense success of her party’s intellectual conferences.This move by the SP is aimed at gaining cheap popularity, she charged.BJP MP Jagdambika Pal said that for the past over four years Yadav was “working from home” and never came out on road on the issues of public interest and with the approaching assembly elections he has resorted to this “gimmick”.

The Taliban dissimulates on the issue to keep the more extremist factions on its side. One of its leaders recently stated that the question of converting Afghanistan into an Islamic Emirate would be discussed in the peace talks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/un-security-council-to-discuss-afghanistan-293445

The Biden administration has approved other direct commercial sales of arms to Taiwan since taking office.The package would include the howitzers, 1,698 precision guidance kits for munitions, spares, training, ground stations and upgrades for Taiwan's previous generation of howitzers, the Pentagon said.The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale on Wednesday.Taiwan's defense ministry expressed "sincere gratitude" to the U.S. government in a statement on Thursday, saying the sales would help its ground forces increase their "capacity for speedy reaction and fire support".The ministry called the continuous U.S. arms support a "basis for maintaining regional stability." Like most nations, the United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is required by law to provide the Chinese-claimed island with the means to defend itself and is its most important international backer, to Beijing's anger.Despite approval by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that a contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded.The Pentagon said BAE Systems Plc was the prime contractor for the weapons.

Registration of FIR by Bihar police was against article 177 of CRPC. Supreme court also had expressed satisfaction in the overall investigation by Mumbai Police," Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant tweeted.He said it had been more than 300 days now since the AIIMS panel ruled out murder."CBI is maintaining deliberate silence. This mockery of investigation by national investigation agencies is an apt example of how these agencies are being used by Modi government for their political agenda," he alleged in a tweet.In another tweet, Sawant claimed that Gupteshwar Pandey (former Bihar DGP) was being used to further political agenda of the BJP, which was to "malign" the image of the Mumbai police and "destabilise" the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra."BJP stooped to the lowest possible level when they openly gave murder, rape angles and used Sushant's death in Bihar elections as well," the Congress leader alleged.There was a "coordinated attack" on the MVA government, claimed Sawant, whose party shares power with the Shiv Sena and NCP in Maharashtra."Some pliable channels were asked to keep peddling murder theories. BJP leaders kept defaming Maharashtra. CBI and other agencies kept leaking fake info. Thousands of fake twitter, FB and YouTube accounts were created by BJP IT cell," he alleged.

We support collective efforts by all to ensure that the credibility and integrity of this Convention is maintained to the fullest,” Tirumurti added.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is likely to visit New York towards the middle of this month with key focus on Afghanistan.With India holding the Presidency of the UNSC this month, Jaishankar will quarterback India’s efforts to bring Afghanistan on the global agenda.India is already backing the efforts of Estonia and Norway, the “penholders” in the UNSC on Afghanistan, for moving forward on the issue.Three recent developments indicate that the stage may shift from Doha which sources do not believe was conducive to negotiations.The Taliban made the mistake of attacking a UN compound in Herat which gave the opportunity to India to marshal support for a condemnatory statement. Second, Afghan Foreign Minister Hanif Atmar has also been appealing for UNSC discussions, most recently in a call to Jaishankar.Third, the White House’s unequivocal backing to the Kabul regime indicates its distaste to matters being decided on the battlefield.

The trials will be conducted over an extensive period under all conditions before the warship is accepted as “proven at sea”. Built at a cost of Rs 23,000 crore, the carrier is expected to be fully operational by the second half of next year.The Navy will accept the warship and then conduct aviation trials, which will include take-off and landing of Russian MiG 29K fighter jets. The warship today saw the Navy’s Sea King helicopters doing a deck landing. It has been designed by Navy’s Directorate of Naval Design.The development comes at a time when India and China are in a race to expand their naval strength. China has two operational and two under-construction aircraft carriers and plans half-a-dozen more by 2030.India has one operational carrier, INS Vikramaditya, purchased from Russia, and the upcoming Vikrant. The plans for the third carrier haven’t been okayed yet.Vikrant is the largest and most complex warship ever to be designed and built in India. The country now joins a select group of nations having niche capability to indigenously design, build and integrate a state-of-the-art aircraft carrier. The US, UK, Russia, Italy, France and Japan have such capacities.South Korea too is pursuing a carrier programme.The warship has a top speed of 28 knots (52 kmph) and a cruising speed of 18 knots with an endurance of about 7,500 nautical miles (13,650 km). Around 550 Indian firms, including about 100 MSMEs, have been providing various services for the construction of the warship. It has 14 decks with 2,300 compartments for a crew of around 1,700. The carrier was scheduled to join the fleet in December 2018, but faced delays. The keel was laid in 2009 and it was set out at sea in 2013. The integration of the aviation complex on board and its mating with other sensors was the key. The propulsion and the complexity of making such warship added to the delays, which have led to the cost escalating beyond the originally sanctioned amount of Rs 19,341 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-indigenous-aircraft-carrier-sets-out-on-sea-trials-293070

Dahiya, a bronze medallist at the 2019 World Championships, fought back fiercely to first reduce the deficit to 7-9 and then managed to pin down Sanayev to win by fall.

Now Sanayev led 9-2 and Dahiya had to fight back furiously against an opponent who was discomfited by a head injury he had suffered earlier in the day. Dahiya won point after point with aggressive moves and eventually managed to pin Sanayev’s shoulders down and the referee stopped the bout.Dahiya later said he was not happy that he had conceded such a big lead to Sanayev, whom he has beaten twice in the past.Celebrations at NahriThe atmosphere at the chopal of Nahri village — around 18km from Sonepat — was electric through the day after Dahiya took to the mat for his first bout. Close to 500 people of two panchayats, Nahri and Nahra, were watching his progress to the final on a giant screen and dancing to the beat of the dhol after every victory.His father Rakesh Dahiya, a farmer, and mother Urmila Devi, a housewife, were overwhelmed by their son’s success and the massive support. “The whole village and the country wants Monu (Ravi) to win the gold. We pray to God that his hard work bears fruit,” Rakesh Dahiya said.The panchayats of Nahri and Nahra are famous for producing wrestlers.

Where is the prime minister? Where is the home minister? They are not attending Parliament. The home minister should come and tell us why the minor was raped in the national capital. I will shave my head if the HM comes and replies,” Brien said.Parliament’s monsoon session has remained dysfunctional since the start on July 19 with the opposition uniting on the demand to discuss snooping allegations.The opposition has been insisting on suspending entire business in both Houses to debate the issue under the rules that entail voting.The government has maintained that IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has already rejected all the allegations of spying in a statement to both Houses and the opposition can seek clarifications on that statement.“IT minister does not deal with national security. Home minister does and home minister should reply to the Pegasus debate which the government must agree to,” deputy leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said, adding that the rigid approach of the government is responsible for parliamentary impasse.The government in a Rajya Sabha business advisory committee meeting on Tuesday also offered the opposition to discuss Pegasus as part of debate on a statutory resolution moved by CPI’s Binoy Biswam on the new IT social media intermediary rules.The government allocated one hour for this discussion in the BAC meeting on Tuesday with the opposition not on board on any of the government’s proposals to break the current deadlock.The opposition is adamant on a stand-alone debate on Pegasus.The opposition also released a statement signed by leaders of 14 political parties conveying their steadfastness on the demand for a probe on the Pegasus and farmers’ issues.The statement has been signed by leaders of Congress Mallikarjun Kharge and Anand Sharma; TMC’s Derek O Brien and Kalyan Banerjee, NCP’s Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut, SP’s Ram Gopal Yadav, DMK’s Tiruchi Siva, RJD’s Manoj Jha, CPM’s Elamaram Kareem, AAP’s Sushil Gupta, IUML’s Mohammad Bashir, NC’s Hasnain Masoodi, CPI’s Binoy Viswam, RSP’s NK Premachandran and LJD’s Shreyams Kumar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-monsoon-session-nears-its-end-opposition-hardens-its-stance-292864
