26-08-2021||---||Unitech case: SC orders shifting of Sanjay Chandra, Ajay Chandra from Tihar to Mumbai jails||New Delhi, August 26The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered shifting of former Unitech promoters Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra from Tihar Jail in the capital to two separate jails in Mumbai after it was informed that they were flouting its orders in connivance with jail officials.While describing the conduct of Tihar Jail Superintendent as “shameless”, a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to personally hold an inquiry into the conduct of Tihar Jail officials in the matter and submit the report in four weeks.As per the top court’s order, the two brothers will now be shifted to Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail and Taloga Jail.The order came after two reports of Enforcement Directorate indicted Sanjay and Ajay for flouting the top court’s orders in connivance with Tihar jail officials.It has raised some “serious and disturbing” issues regarding undermining the court’s authority, the Bench noted.On behalf of the ED, Additional Solicitor General Madhavi Divan told the Bench the agency has unearthed a “secret underground office” which was being run by erstwhile Unitech founder Ramesh Chandra and visited by his sons Sanjay and Ajay when on parole or bail.Divan said both Sanjay and Ajay have rendered the entire judicial custody meaningless as they have been freely communicating, instructing their officials and disposing of properties from inside the jail in connivance with the prison staff there.The top court had on August 14 last year cancelled Sanjay’s interim bail and dismissed Ajay’s bail application. They have been in jail since August 2017. In June this year, Sanjay was, however, granted 15-day interim bail to attend the last rites of his father-in-law.The two brothers are accused of siphoning homebuyers’ money. The criminal case relates to complaints filed by home buyers of Unitech projects’—“Wild Flower Country” and “Anthea Project”—situated in Gurugram.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unitech-case-sc-orders-shifting-of-sanjay-chandra-ajay-chandra-from-tihar-to-mumbai-jails-302442

26-08-2021||Vibha Sharma||Cane politics: Farmers, SKM call FRP hike of Rs 5 announced by Centre ‘insulting’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 26The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which on Thursday completed nine months of protests at Delhi borders, has called the FRP hike of Rs 5 for sugarcane (announced by Centre yesterday) as an “insult” to farmers.Farmers unions, who are holding an all-India convention focused on expansion as well as intensification of their agitation against the three central laws and other agrarian issues to mark the completion of nine months, argued that unless any government actually reduces the price from one season to the other, the price next year can only be “highest ever”.“The Rs 5 a quintal hike is clearly an insult to sugarcane farmers of the country,” SKM leaders said“On the one hand, the CACP says the SAP of sugarcane should not be hiked in a differential manner and on the other hand the FRP is not fixed in a fair manner by Narendra Modi Government. After the recent historic struggle of farmers of Punjab who secured a Rs-50 hike per quintal of sugarcane, it is clear once again that cost of production figures are being suppressed, and farmers’ hard toil is being exploited,” they added.All eyes are now on the Yogi Adityanath government in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh where the farmers’ demand for an increased state advisory price (SAP) has remained unmet for past three years. Yesterday, soon after the Cabinet approved the FRP, Adityanath announced his government’s decision to raise SAP ahead of the ensuing crushing season.Notably making the announcement, union minister Piyush Goyal called the FRP of Rs 290 a quintal the “highest ever”. Goyal said the cost of production of sugarcane for the sugar season 2021-22 is Rs 155 per quintal, therefore FRP of Rs 290 per quintal at a recovery rate of 10% is higher by 87.1% over production cost, thereby giving the farmers a return of much more than 50% over their cost. Meanwhile, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait has also asked the centre to “reveal the formula” on the basis of which it calculated the increase of Rs 5 a quintal in the FRP. Tikait said that while the Centre is “patting its back by calling the Rs 5 hike in FRP a historic decision, states in north India are paying a much better SAP”. “Therefore the question is how will this price (the FRP of Rs 290 a quintal) be beneficial to sugarcane farmer, the centre should explain the formula,” he saidEarlier this week, the Punjab government announced SAP of Rs 360 per quintal.Sugarcane farmers in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh are demanding a much higher SAP than that. Their leaders say that with their movement gaining momentum and elections approaching, the “nervousness of the BJP government is visible”. “UP CM’s promise of completing pending payments from 2010 before the crushing season is manifestation of this nervousness,” they add.Currently, UP offers Rs 325 and Rs 315 for early and late varieties, respectively.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cane-politics-farmers-skm-call-frp-hike-of-rs-5-announced-by-centre-insulting-302433

No other airline in India uses Max plane.On March 13, 2019, SpiceJet had to ground 12 Max planes, forcing it to cancel a significant number of flights on that day as well as on the next day.Jet Airways also had five Max planes in its fleet but they were already grounded as on March 13, 2019 due to non-payment of dues to the lessors.A month later, the full-service carrier had shut down its operations due to lack of funds.In March 2019 itself, several countries grounded 737 Max planes.The March 10, 2019 accident near Addis Ababa was the second in a period of five months. In October 2018, a 737 Max plane operated by Lion Air had crashed in Indonesia, killing 180 people.

26-08-2021||London||UK, India Covid-19 study sets Guinness world record||A worldwide Covid-19 study led by UK experts and conducted at Indian hospitals among others around the world has been awarded the ‘Guinness World Records' title for the world's largest scientific collaboration, involving over 140,000 patients in 116 countries.The record for ‘Most authors on a single peer-reviewed academic paper' is now held by the Universities of Birmingham and Edinburgh after 15,025 scientists around the globe contributed to the major research into the impact of Covid-19 on surgical patients.The co-lead author of the study, Indian-origin surgeon Aneel Bhangu from the University of Birmingham, said the study was aimed at improving our understanding of the deadly virus.“Being awarded the ‘Guinness World Records' title for the world's largest scientific collaboration highlights the scale of our global partnership, which aims to contribute to our understanding of Covid-19 and help to save as many lives as possible around the world,” said Dr Bhangu.“It marks the commitment and hard work of thousands of medical colleagues around the world to understand the changes that are needed in how surgery must be delivered if we are to beat the virus and reduce its impact on surgical patients,” he said.Funded by the UK government's National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), the researchers concluded that patients waiting for elective surgery should be treated as a vulnerable group and access Covid-19 vaccines ahead of the general population – potentially helping to avoid thousands of post-operative deaths linked to the virus.This was seen as particularly important for low and middle income Countries (LMICs) where access to vaccination remains limited and mitigation measures such as nasal swab screening and Covid-free surgical pathways to reduce the risk of virus-related complications are not available for many patients.Overall, the scientists estimated that global prioritisation of pre-operative vaccination for elective patients could prevent an additional 58,687 Covid-19-related deaths in one year.The CovidSurg Collaborative international team of researchers published its findings in the ‘British Journal of Surgery' (BJS), Europe's leading surgical journal, after studying data from 1,667 hospitals in countries including India, the UK, Australia, Brazil, China, the UAE and the US.In India, the study was conducted across 56 hospitals – among the largest alongside Germany and Italy.Co-author James Glasbey, a surgical trainee from the University of Birmingham, commented: “Over 15,000 surgeons and anaesthetists from across 116 countries came together to contribute to this study making it the largest ever scientific collaboration, surpassing even ground-breaking research from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland.“Every day we hear in the news that waiting lists are growing, and patients are unable to access the surgery that they need. This situation sadly is deteriorating in countries all over the world. Policy makers can use the data from this scientific collaboration to safely restart elective surgery.” Launched in March 2020, the CovidSurg Collaborative has provided data needed to support changes to surgical delivery in the fastest time frame ever seen by a surgical research group, Birmingham University said.Research from this huge study group has also explored the timing of surgery after Covid infection, preoperative isolation, and risks of blood clots, all published in the field-leading journal 'Anaesthesia'.According to the experts, during the first wave of the pandemic, up to 70 per cent of elective surgeries were postponed, resulting in an estimated 28 million procedures being delayed or cancelled.Whilst surgery volumes have started to recover in many countries, ongoing disruption is likely to continue throughout 2021, particularly in the event of countries experiencing further waves of Covid-19.Vaccination is also likely to decrease post-operative pulmonary complications, reducing intensive care use and overall healthcare costs. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-india-covid-19-study-sets-guinness-world-record-302418

26-08-2021||Bengaluru||Mysuru gang-rape: Karnataka minister says Congress trying to ‘rape’ him||Karnataka Home Minister Araga Jnanendra’s statements that the gang-rape victim and her male friend should not have gone to the deserted place, and his claims that the opposition Congress was trying to “rape” him, by targeting him, following the incident has evoked sharp reactions from the Congress.He also accused the Congress of trying to gain political mileage from such an “inhuman” incident.Hitting out at the home minister and the ruling BJP, the Congress said they are “incapable” of protecting the people of the state.“Around 7-7:30 pm (on Tuesday) they (the victim and male friend) had gone there, it is a deserted place, they should not have gone, but we can’t stop anyone from going, they have gone. It is a deserted place and no one usually goes there as no one will be there,” Jnanendra said in response to a question.Speaking to reporters here, he said there are concerns about lack of police patrolling in such places, and that he was going to Mysuru and will discuss with officials to rectify the lapses.Reacting to opposition Congress’ criticism on the law-and-order situation in the state after the gang-rape incident, the minister said, “Rape has happened there (in Mysuru), but the Congress was trying to rape me, they are trying to rape the home minister. They are trying to gain political mileage. it is an inhuman act.”“When such incidents happen, instead of exerting pressure to see it from a humanitarian perspective and detect (the culprits), attempts are on to get political mileage in such a situation. People will see it. I will not say much on this. Instructions have been given on what has to be done by the police, so that such things don’t recur and we are at it,” he added.Attacking the home minister for his statement, state Congress president DK Shivakumar urged the police to arrest his partymen involved in “raping the home minister”, whether it is him or Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah or any other leader.“He (Home Minister) has claimed that Congress was raping him, he is using the word rape very lightly...it seems he likes that word. I seek the response of BJP leaders on this statement. When home minister is saying that Congress is raping him, what is the administration of the state doing,” he said.Targeting Jnanendra for his comment that the victim should not have gone to deserted place, the Congress party said, “Home minister you have the onus of protecting the state, are you not ashamed of making such a shabby remark?”“With this statement he (Home Minister) has agreed that it was dangerous to venture out even at 7:30 pm under a BJP rule,” it said.Pointing out that it has been nearly 48 hours since the incident happened and no arrest has been made, Shivakumar said it is a shame on the police department, and the party was concerned about the image of Karnataka.He said the party is constituting a team to look into the incident, under the chairmanship of former MP V S Ugrappa; they will visit Mysuru and submit a report, and the party will do everything possible to get justice for the victim.A college girl was allegedly raped by five men near Chamundi Hill in Mysuru late on Tuesday, and the incident came to light on Wednesday.The girl and her male friend, who was assaulted by the gang, are undergoing treatment in a private hospital. Earlier in the day, Jnanendra said that the government and the police department have taken the gang-rape incident in Mysuru “seriously” and all efforts are on to nab the culprits.

The second surge has not yet concluded. It is not over and therefore, we have to maintain all necessary precautions, particularly in light of our experience that after every festival we see a spike.”“The coming months of September and October are crucial for us because we would be celebrating a few festivals. Thus, festivals have to be celebrated with Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he added.The government said 41 districts in India were reporting a Covid-19 weekly positivity rate of more than 10 per cent.According to the government, 58.4 per cent of the total Covid-19 cases last week were reported from Kerala.“Kerala is the only state reporting over 1 lakh active Covid-19 cases, while four states have 10,000 to 1 lakh active cases and 31 states have less than 10,000 active cases,” it said.The government said over 400 evacuees were brought back from Afghanistan so far and that some of them have tested positive for Covid-19. The infected people have been isolated and are being treated.With 46,164 people testing positive for coronavirus infection in a day, India’s total tally of Covid-19 cases has increased to 3,25,58,530, while the active cases rose to 3,33,725, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Thursday.The death toll climbed to 4,36,365 with 607 fresh fatalities, according to the data updated at 8 am.The active cases comprise 1.03 per cent of the total infections, while the national Covid-19 recovery rate was recorded at 97.63 per cent, the ministry said.

This is a huge loss. If the rate is close to Rs 300 per crate, then it is a no profit and no loss matter for us," Ravindra Chavan, deputy sarpanch of Dhamori Khurd village in Gangapur said.The state government should look into the matter and if the rates come down further, the government should compensate to make up for losses, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-dump-tonnes-of-tomatoes-during-protest-at-nagpur-mumbai-highway-302403

26-08-2021||Mumbai||Rane undermined Maharashtra’s pride and prestige, his days in Union Cabinet numbered: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Thursday claimed Union minister Narayan Rane undermined the pride and prestige of Maharashtra and action against him was taken as per the law over his controversial remarks against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ also claimed that “Rane’s days in the Union cabinet were numbered”.Earlier this week, Rane sparked off a row over his remarks about slapping Thackeray for what he claimed as the latter’s ignorance of the year of India’s independence.  He was arrested from Ratnagiri in Maharashtra on Tuesday and later granted bail by a court at Mahad in Raigad. His remarks had led to protests across Maharashtra. The Shiv Sena and BJP activists also clashed with each other near his residence in Mumbai on Tuesday. On media reportage of his ‘imminent arrest’ in the case, Rane had said hours before his arrest that he was not a ‘normal’ (ordinary) man and cautioned the media against such reportage.The editorial in ‘Saamana’ said, “Since Rane is not a normal person, he undermines the pride and prestige of Maharashtra. The BJP should at least understand now.”It claimed that Rane has said Maharashtra can’t fight the Centre since there is a BJP government.“Even Maharashtra’s enemies did not undermine the state like Rane did,” the Marathi daily said.It said action against Rane over his remarks against the CM was done as per the law.“Law is same for everyone - be it a normal or an abnormal person. At least now the BJP should not ask if the rule of law prevails in the state,” said the Sena, which shares power with the NCP and Congress in Maharashtra.It said a case was filed against Rane, like it would have been done in any other case.“Someone threatens a person, who then files a case under the IPC and then police act as per the procedure...nothing different happened in Rane’s case. Hence, the opposition BJP’s claim of a Talibani rule in the state is baseless,” it said.Notably, Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday said the BJP does not support Rane’s comments, but the “party stands behind him 100 per cent”. Alleging that the state police force was being used as a tool for “vendetta politics”, the former chief minister had said there should be law and order and “not Taliban-like governance”. The Marathi publication said Fadnavis supports Rane, but not his threat to the chief minister. “This wasn’t expected from Fadnavis, who is a lawyer by profession,” it said. “If Rane stops considering himself as great, a lot of problems in his life will be resolved without medication,” it quipped. “If Rane thinks he is great because of his induction into the Union cabinet, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi will surely bring him down from the pedestal,” the editorial claimed. It said Modi considers himself a “fakir”, while Rane thinks he is great.  “Surely, Rane’s days in the Union cabinet are numbered and Fadnavis will have no doubt about this in mind,” the Thackeray-led party said. It also said the Shiv Sena and the BJP differed earlier on several occasions, but the kind of clashes that took place following Rane’s comments and arrest never happened before. “Rane and his supporters in the BJP are responsible for this,” the edit claimed.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the decision to increase the FRP will benefit farmers as well as workers of sugar mills.Interacting with reporters here on Wednesday evening, Tikait said, “The hike in FRP of sugarcane is not acceptable to the farmers because it is inadequate in comparison to the rise in prices of petrol and diesel.”              He demanded that the hike in the fair and remunerative price of sugarcane should be on par with the rise in prices of petrol, diesel and other items that farmers use to raise the crop.Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal has said the Centre’s decision would benefit around 5 crore sugarcane farmers and their dependents, as well as about 5 lakh workers employed in sugar mills and related ancillary activities.

When a political party is in power, police officials take side of the particular (ruling) party.“Then when another party comes into power, the government initiates action against the police officials. This needs to be stopped,” the bench said.The bench, also comprising Justice Surya Kant, directed the state government to file its responses to the two separate petitions within four weeks during which the police officer will not be arrested.Senior lawyers FS Nariman and Vikas Singh appeared for the suspended police officer and the state government was represented by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Rakesh Dwivedi.Two cases pertaining to the offence of sedition and for amassing disproportionate assets, respectively, have been lodged against Singh by the Congress-led Chhattisgarh government.

They have repeatedly expressed fear over the laws doing away with the minimum support price (MSP), and leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.“It is sad that it's been nine months but the government is still not ready to talk. But we should not feel de-motivated. During this convention we will reflect on what we have lost and what we have gained over the last nine months,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait while addressing the protesters at the Singhu border.

Even the input cost of cultivation of any crop is not recovered. The dues of sugarcane sold to sugar factories are unpaid," he said in the plea.Claiming that there was a good price for ganja in the market, Patil sought permission to cultivate it on his two-acre land.He also asked the district administration to give him permission by September 15 to grow ganja plants on his farmland, failing which he would start the cultivation from September 16, presuming that he has been given the nod for it."If any offence is registered against me for ganja cultivation, the administration will be responsible," he said in the application.However, Mohol police station's senior inspector Ashok Saykar said the farmer's application was just a "publicity stunt"."If he resorts to such an act (cultivating ganja), we will register an offence against him," he said.

It asked the Centre to provide necessary manpower and infrastructure to the agencies.The Bench said it would pass a detailed order on the issue even as it maintained that it wasn't expressing any opinion on their work as it would lower their morale. However, it said they agencies should ensure that trials were completed expeditiously.While hearing a PIL seeking fast-tracking of criminal trials against lawmakers, the Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, however, said, "We are not against withdrawal of cases, if there is malicious prosecution. But this needs to be examined by the high court. If the high court agrees then the cases can be withdrawn."The Bench also made it clear that lawmakers can't be given priority in hearing of criminal appeals. Amicus Curiae Vijay Hansaria told the court that 51 MPs and 61 MLAs/MLCs faced cases under PMLA, while 121 cases were pending in CBI courts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-unhappy-over-ed-cbi-probe-against-lawmakers-302151

He contended that according to prevalent policy, he was entitled to ex-gratia payment for his disability, which then amounted to Rs 5.4 lakh. He had taken up the case with Army Headquarters, but received no response.The Tribunal’s bench comprising Justice Rajendra Menon and Lt Gen PM Hariz observed that while the policy letter of December 2011 states that lump-sum ex-gratia is authorised to those who are boarded out from service on account of disability or injury attributable to military service, the letter does not contain any instruction for payment of ex-gratia to battle casualties retained in service.The bench also observed that for the same category of personnel, different slab rates have been prescribed, where these slab rates correlate to the revision in rates as promulgated in various government letters and gazette notifications.A detailed reading of various letters and notifications indicate that since the date of applicability of these orders have been indicated, it would imply that any case being considered for ex-gratia would be entitled to enhanced rates, but nowhere do these state any case which occurred earlier than the said date will not be entitled to the enhanced rate, the bench said.“We are of the opinion that once the enhanced rates have been promulgated, any case which is being adjudicated or considered after that date must be entitled to the enhanced rate,” the bench ruled.“Even if the cause for grant of ex-gratia or compensation accrued earlier but in a case where compensation has not been paid or the ex-gratia has not been granted, the person concerned would be entitled to enhanced rate of ex-gratia or compensation as was applicable on the date when his claim is considered and settled, the bench said while referring to earlier Supreme Court judgements.Stating that there was no dispute about the medical category and disability of the soldier and the only issue to be examined was the quantum of payment, the bench ordered that in accordance with revised rates, an ex-gratia of Rs 8 lakh be released to the disabled soldier within two months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-pending-cases-of-ex-gratia-to-battle-casualties-entitled-enhanced-rates-rules-aft-301993

26-08-2021||Vibha Sharma||Centre approves Rs 290 per quintal as FRP of sugarcane||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 25The Centre on Wednesday approved Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane for the sugar season 2021-22 at Rs 290/quintal, calling it the "highest ever". The increase over last year is Rs 5. The approved FRP will be applicable for the sugar season 2021-22, starting October 1, and is being seen in light of the upcoming Assembly election in the key growing state, Uttar Pradesh."Keeping in view the interest of sugarcane farmers, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved FRP of sugarcane for the sugar season 2021-22 (October -September) at Rs 290 per quintal for a basic recovery rate of 10 per cent, providing a premium of Rs 2.90 per quintal for each 0.1 per cent increase in recovery over and above 10 per cent and reduction in FRP by Rs 2.90 per quintal for every 0.1 per cent decrease in recovery," Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal said.The decision will benefit five crore sugarcane farmers and their dependents, as well as the five lakh workers employed in the sugar mills and related ancillary activities, he added.There will be no deduction in case of sugar mills where recovery is below 9.5 per cent, Goyal said, adding that such farmers would get Rs 275.50 per quintal in 2021-22 in place of Rs. 270.75 per quintal in current sugar season, 2020-21.The cost of production of sugarcane for the sugar season 2021-22 is Rs 155 per quintal. The FRP of Rs 290 per quintal at a recovery rate of 10 per cent is higher by 87.1 per cent over production cost, thereby giving the farmers a return of much more than 50 per cent over their cost, the minister said. The government is also encouraging sugar mills to divert excess sugarcane to ethanol which is blended with petrol, which not only serves as a green fuel but also saves foreign exchange on account of crude oil import, he added. With the election on mind, Punjab's Congress government on Tuesday announced a hike in state advised price (SAP) of sugarcane by Rs 50 per quintal over the last year’s price, fixing it at Rs 360 per quintal.FRP and SAP are the rates at which sugar mills pay farmers for their raw material. The FRP is announced by the Centre. It is determined on the basis of recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) and after consultation with state governments and other stake-holders.While SAP is a fixed amount, FRP is based on the recovery rate, or the amount of sugar that mills are able to extract from sugarcane. Traditionally SAPs are much higher than FRPs, and, at times, also result in losses for sugar mills.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-approves-rs-290-per-quintal-as-frp-of-sugarcane-301949

They had corrupted my house. I did what it took to cleanse my house,” 59-year-old ex-Army man Rao Rai Singh reportedly said in his confessional statement to police on Wednesday.“My daughter-in-law and the tenant had illicit relations and he was neither paying rent nor leaving my house. I had no choice. I only wanted to kill the two of them, but tenant’s wife Anamika got up. She said she did not want to live without her husband so I killed her also. Thinking about children leading a miserable life as orphans, I liberated them also,” he reportedly said.The accused’s claims were supported by his 48-year-old wife Bimlesh who was arrested by police. In her statement, Bilmesh said while she was not part of the murder plan, but was present and did not object when her husband went on the hacking spree around the house.“I am his wife and have to stand in whatever he does. In our culture, husband is always right and we don’t say anything in their matters,” Bimlesh told police. The husband-wife duo was produced in court. Rai Singh was taken on two-day remand, while she was sent to judicial custody.The police have, meanwhile, also procured CCTV footage in which Singh is seen coming out of house carrying “the weapon” used in the crime.Speaking to the Tribune an investigation officer said in his statement Singh said after attacking five, including four of tenant’s family and his daughter-in-law, he changed his blood-drenched clothes and washed them. He then went to a small park he had maintained and gave its key to neighbour saying it was his duty now. The family of deceased daughter-in-law has refuted claims of extra-marital affair, alleging the in-laws were pressuring her to sell 1 acre land she had inherited from her father. Her brother Ashok Kumar has moved police with these allegations.“Investigation is on and we are looking into statement of the accused, deceased’s families and neighbours. The claims of the key accused are incoherent. The CCTV footage is also being analysed,” said Rajiv Yadav, ACP, city.Meanwhile, the sole survivor of the murderous attack, 3-year-old Vidhi, spend entire day yesterday waiting for admission at Safdurjung hospital. She got an admission today only. A senior police officer said that she is stable and admitted to general ward.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gurugram-multiple-murder-accused-unrepentant-says-killed-to-cleanse-my-house-301892
