Be it the corona period or the current crisis of Afghanistan, the world has experienced it continuously. Hundreds of people from Afghanistan are being brought to India under Operation Devi Shakti,” the prime minister said.India’s complex mission to evacuate its citizens and Afghan partners from Kabul after its takeover by the Taliban has been named ‘Operation Devi Shakti’.“There are many challenges. The circumstances are difficult but we also have ‘Guru Kripa’ (blessings of gurus),” he said.The country has done its utmost to assist those in need in recent years, he said, adding that laws have been made taking inspiration from the teachings of Gurus. “In the past years, the country to discharge this responsibility has worked hard. Keeping the lessons in humanity given by Gurus in the forefront, the country has made new laws for the people who have suffered,” he said, in an apparent reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019.According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 and face religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.The prime minister said that current global conditions underline the importance of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ and underscore the need for ‘Aatmnirbharta and Aatmvishwas’.

28-08-2021||Mumbai||Malegaon blast case: Witness who spoke of Lt Col Purohit delivering terrorism lecture turns hostile||A key witness in the 2008 Malegoan blast case was declared hostile by the special NIA court here on Saturday after he retracted his statements made before the Maharashtra ATS.The witness had told the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad, when it was probing the case, that, in 2008, he had attended an “adventure camp” where a discussion on the spread of terrorism in India as well as Pakistan’s role in weakening the country through other means like drugs and fake currency was held.In his statement at the time, the witness had said Lieutenant Colonel Shrikant Prasad Purohit, one of the seven accused in the case, had delivered a lecture at this event.The witness also said though it was called an “adventure camp”, nothing about adventure was taught there.However, while recording his testimony before the court on Saturday, the witness denied giving any such statements, after which he was declared hostile by special judge P R Sitre.So far, 188 witnesses have been examined, and this was the second witness to turn hostile, said special public prosecutor Avinash Rasal.Besides Purohit, the other accused in the case are Bhopal BJP Lok Sabha MP Pragya Singh Thakur, Major Ramesh Upadhyay (retd), Ajay Rahirkar, Sudhakar Dwivedi, Sudhakar Chaturvedi and Sameer Kulkarni, all of whom are out on bail.They are facing trial under provisions of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and Indian Penal Code (IPC).On September 29, 2008, six people were killed and over 100 injured when an explosive device strapped on a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon town, some 200 km from Mumbai.

28-08-2021||New Delhi||Rahul thought my black cap was linked to RSS: Maharashtra governor Koshyari||Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari took a swipe at Rahul Gandhi on Saturday as he recalled that the Congress leader believed that the black cap, a traditional headwear from Uttarakhand, he wears was linked to the RSS and thought Hindutva ideologue Veer Savarkar was from the Sangh.Speaking on the launch of his book “Bhartiya Sansad Main Bhagat Singh Koshyari”, the former Uttarakhand chief minister, who has been associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, also said the government will have to deal with the kind of situation witnessed in Parliament’s last session when people like him, a reference to Gandhi, are leading the opposition.Before Koshyari’s speech, Union minister Piyush Goyal had slammed the opposition’s conduct in the session as he lauded the Maharashtra governor’s “sincere and dignified” role as an MP in Parliament.He must be feeling pained at what happened in Parliament, Goyal said.The Monsoon Session was a virtual washout as a united opposition disrupted its proceedings through except for the discussion on a bill linked to the Other Backward Classes. Rajya Sabha also witnessed a debate on COVID-19.Noting that opposition members torn papers, threw papers at the Chair and allegedly manhandled marshals, the government has accused them of unruly conduct never seen before.  The opposition has accused the government’s unparliamentary conduct for the impasse.In his speech, Koshyari said many people would react seeing his black cap in a same way as a bull does when shown a red cloth.“Rahul Gandhi asked me (then BJP MP) why do you wear a black cap? I told him people wear it in Uttarakhand. He says ‘no, no, you are from the RSS’. I said I am from the RSS but the cap is from Uttarakhand. People have been wearing it there before the RSS was born,” he said.A few months later, the Congress leader again enquired him about the cap while he was chatting with some MPs in Parliament, Koshyari said.“He again asked me why you wear a black cap... He said this is a RSS cap. I told him that I had said earlier too this is not a RSS cap. He still insisted. I asked him have you read anything about the RSS? He said ‘yes, yes, I have read Savarkar’... Piyush ji you will have to live with this din and everything when such people are in leadership,” he added.Though Savarkar is a Hindutva ideologue, he was never in the RSS.While the 79-year-old leader mocked at Gandhi, he praised Congress leader Jairam Ramesh.During a parliamentary debate on environment, Ramesh, who was the environment minister then, urged the Chair to give him more time to speak as he liked the content, Koshyari recalled.When the Chair disallowed the request, forcing the BJP MP to wrap up his speech, Ramesh came to him and said that he would reply to debate the next day instead of the same day as scheduled.He told Koshyari to speak what he could not say during the speech while seeking clarification on his reply, the former BJP leader said.While he feels disappointed at the state of Parliament, Koshyari said and named several leaders, many former opposition stalwarts, for their rich contribution to debates in the past and expressed confidence that people will elect members who will restore its earlier glory.

28-08-2021||New Delhi||Leading Indian leprologist SK Noordeen no more; WHO mourns loss||The World Health Organisation on Saturday mourned the loss of legendary Indian leprologist Dr Shaik Khader Noordeen who led the global fight against leprosy during its most critical years and oversaw the rollout of multi drug therapy, the mainstay of leprosy treatment to date. SK Noordeen was 88.WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus led the condolences for the pioneer in leprosy research and said, “Saddened by the loss of Dr SK Noordeen, a key contributor to WHO leprosy elimination strategy. He coordinated WHO’s leprosy research from 1979-1984, leading to multidrug therapy. His passion and dedication were crucial in the fight against the disease.”Hailing from Chennai, Dr Noordeen was the director of the WHO’s Action Programme for the Elimination of Leprosy from 1994 to 1998 – during the crucial years that saw the global roll-out and implementation of multidrug therapy (MDT) which remains, to this day, the main tool for the treatment and elimination of the disease.Notably, Noordeen strongly supported global efforts to reduce stigma and social exclusion associated with leprosy, by disseminating information on the effectiveness of treatment, and by making it available for free to all those in need through large-scale donations made to WHO.Prior to that and in 1991, SK Noordeen had played a crucial role in the adoption of World Health Assembly Resolution 44.9 which reaffirmed WHO’s commitment “to attain the global elimination of leprosy as a public health problem by the year 2000”.After his retirement, Dr Noordeen contributed in many ways to the global fight against leprosy.He led the International Leprosy Association, was a Founding Trustee and Chair of the Sasakawa-India Leprosy Foundation and a Member of the Technical Resource Group of India’s National Leprosy Eradication Programme.Before joining WHO, Dr Noordeen had led the Central Leprosy Training and Research Institute in his native state of Tamil Nadu.In recognition of his contribution and work, Government of India had honoured him with the prestigious Padma Shri Award.Dr Noordeen was passionate about leprosy and contributed to transform a disease of neglected people into a solvable public health problem.“Dr SK Noordeen was one of the pioneers of leprosy research in India and globally. His passing is a big loss for global health community, but his legacy will live on,” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/leading-indian-leprologist-sk-noordeen-no-more-who-mourns-loss-303336

ICHR’s removal of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad is petty and an injustice. India will not forget that the RSS chose to stay away from the Indian freedom movement,” Gogoi said on Twitter.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera asked if one’s stature would rise by removing Nehru’s photo.“Will removing Nehru’s photo increase one’s stature? A dwarf will remain a dwarf,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.“It is not merely petty but absolutely ahistorical to celebrate Azadi by omitting the pre-eminent voice of Indian freedom, Jawaharlal Nehru. One more occasion for ICHR to disgrace itself. This is becoming a habit,” said  Tharoor while sharing the picture of the ‘Azaadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ celebrations.Ramesh also shared the picture and said, “Not surprising from this regime and its toadies masquerading as scholars but atrocious nevertheless.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-leaders-rap-ichr-for-omitting-nehrus-image-from-azaadi-ka-amrit-mahotsav-celebrations-303335

28-08-2021||Mumbai||80 per cent of Nariman point, Mantralaya will go under water by 2050: Mumbai civic chief||Mumbai Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has made a sinister prediction for the city, saying that by 2050, a major portion of south Mumbai, including the business district of Nariman Point and state secretariat Mantralaya, will go under water due to the rising sea level.Speaking at the launch of Mumbai Climate Action Plan and its website at the hands of Maharashtra Environment and Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray on Friday, Chahal said about 70 per cent of the city’s A, B, C and D wards in south Mumbai will be under water due to climate change.He said that nature has been giving warnings, but if people do not “wake up” then the situation would turn “dangerous”.“Eighty per cent of the areas like Cuffe Parade, Nariman Point and Mantralaya will be under water...Means going to disappear,” he said.The civic chief also said that it is a matter of just 25-30 years as 2050 is not too far.“We are getting warnings from nature and if we do not wake up, it will be a dangerous situation for the next 25 years. And it will not only be the next generation but the current generation will also suffer,” Chahal warned.He said that Mumbai is the first city in South Asia that is preparing its climate action plan and acting on it.“Earlier, we used to hear about climate change events like melting glaciers, but not directly affecting us. But now it has come to our doorstep,” he added.Chahal said that last year for the first time in 129 years, a cyclone (Nisarga) hit Mumbai and thereafter in the last 15 months, there have been three cyclones. After that, on August 5, 2020, about 5 to 5.5 feet water was accumulated at Nariman point.“There was no cyclone warning that day, but considering the parameters, it was a cyclone,” Chahal said.Highlighting that the city has witnessed some extreme weather condictions recently, he said that the city faced Tauktae cyclone in Mumbai and witnessed 214 mm rain on May 17, though monsoon arrives here on June 6 or 7.Before June 9, Mumbai recorded 84 per cent of the June rainfall and in July, 70 per cent of month’s average rainfall was received in just four days – from July 17 to 20, he said.Under the Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP), the data assessment has identified areas and communities most vulnerable given increasing climate uncertainty, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said in a release.Data from across BMC’s 37 automatic weather stations (AWS) over the past 10 years suggests that on an average, Mumbai has seen six heavy, five very heavy, and four extremely heavy rainfall days per year. And for all the rainfall that occurs during the monsoon season in Mumbai, each year, approximately 10 per cent falls under the heavy category, nine per cent very heavy, and six per cent extremely heavy.According to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) classification, daily rainfall from 64.5 mm to 115.5 mm is considered ‘heavy’, 115.6 mm to 204.4mm ‘very heavy’ and more than 204.5mm is ‘extreme’.“The four-year period between 2017 and 2020 has seen a steady increase in the extremely heavy rainfall events. This indicates that the frequency of such extreme weather events is increasing for the city of Mumbai especially over the past four years,” said Lubaina Rangwala, Associate Director, WRI India Ross Center for Sustainable Cities.

28-08-2021||New Delhi||If previously Covid-19 infected, single Covaxin dose draws same antibody response as two doses||A single dose of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin in previously Covid-19-infected individuals elicits a similar antibody response as obtained with two doses of the vaccine in those without a previous history of the disease, according to an ICMR study.The study was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research on Saturday."If our preliminary findings are confirmed in large population studies, a single dose of BBV152 vaccine may be recommended to previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals so that the naive individuals could attain the larger benefit of a limited vaccine supply," it said.India's first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, codenamed BBV152, was approved by the government for emergency use in January. Two doses are given with a gap of four to six weeks.The study was undertaken to examine SARS-CoV-2–specific antibody responses after day zero (baseline, before vaccination), day 28 plus/minus two days post-first dose (month 1) and day 56 plus/minus two days post-first dose (month 2) of BBV152 in a group of healthcare professionals as well as frontline workers.The antibody response of individuals with confirmed pre-vaccination SARSCoV-2 infection was compared with those individuals without prior evidence of infection.As a part of the study, blood samples were collected from 114 healthcare professionals and frontline workers who received Covaxin at vaccination centres in Chennai from February to May 2021."Overall, good vaccine-induced antibody responses were seen in prior SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals, except in two, who received a single dose of BBV152 vaccine that was similar to antibody responses seen after a two-dose vaccination course administered to infection-naive individuals," the study stated."Our results in a varied group of healthcare professionals and frontline workers lend support to the previous studies (albeit mainly focused on mRNA vaccines) that increased levels of SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies are present after a single vaccine dose in previously infected individuals and are comparable to the levels seen after two doses in those without prior infection," it added.The study offers evidence in support of public health-oriented and immunologically sustained vaccine strategies. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-previously-covid-19-infected-single-covaxin-dose-draws-same-antibody-response-as-two-doses-303290
28-08-2021||New Delhi||Hate speech: Delhi court dismisses bail plea of Jantar Mantar event organiser Preet Singh||A Delhi court has dismissed the bail application of one of the organisers of an event near Jantar Mantar where communal slogans were raised earlier this month.Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil denied relief to Preet Singh, arrested by the Delhi Police in the case, saying right to assemble and freedom to air one’s thoughts are cherished under the Constitution, however, these are not absolute and have to be exercised with inherent reasonable restrictions.Singh was accused of creating enmity between different groups and inciting the youth to propagate against a particular religion at a rally at Jantar Mantar on August 8.The judge, on the basis of the material placed on record and submissions put forth by the prosecution, observed that prima facie there had been active participation by the accused in his individual capacity and also as the main organiser of the event itself.In its order passed on August 27, the court also noted that the event was conducted at Jantar Mantar in spite of the denial of permission by the Delhi Police and in total disregard to Covid­ protocol issued by the Union government.“It is apposite to mention that the applicant not only voluntarily organised the event but also actively participated and provided support to the views and contents of inflammatory speeches, which were being made by the participants/accused persons at that time, by acknowledging and endorsing via gestures and clapping intermittently,” the judge observed in the order.He said given the stature of the accused, it was expected that he ought to have exercised his authority, in these circumstances, and prevented participants from the airing such inflammatory opinions in the larger interest of the public and committee welfare.On the other hand, the applicant is clearly seen actively participating in the incendiary speeches along with his other associates, he said.“In addition, on prima facie analysis of the inflammatory and incendiary content of the speeches or interviews of the participants members of the event, comments especially those pertaining in express pejorative references to a religious community, and keeping in view that the applicant was an active organiser of the event, he cannot later absolve himself of the responsibility of the content or consequences arising therefrom,” he said.The court also noted that an anticipatory bail application moved by co-accused and president of Hindu Raksha Dal, Pinki Chaudhary, on similar ground was dismissed earlier.The court also held that being an active, main organiser of the event, the accused was an influential personality and there was a possibility of him interfering with the investigation and influencing the witnesses of the case, if released on bail.While opposing the application, the prosecution told the court that the accusations were severity in nature and the investigation was still at a nascent stage.It also said a number of accused people were absconding and evading the process of law and the entire incriminating material is yet to be recovered.

The aircraft had skidded and overturned on one side. Akhtar, his co-pilot Shiv Jaiswal and another officer were injured in the incident.As per the suspension letter, Akhtar “flew the aircraft very low and failed to sight the arrester barrier” before the runway. Besides, “the approach profile of the aircraft was not appropriate for landing in the touchdown zone and resulted in hitting the arrester barrier”.The DGCA had issued a show-cause notice to Akhtar on July 1, but the explanation given by him was found to be “not satisfactory”, the letter said.The accident had occurred due to a manual error and the DGCA noted that his actions not only jeopardised the safety of the aircraft, but were also in violation of the aircraft rules.The Madhya Pradesh government had bought the aircraft, a seven-seater Beechcraft King Air B-200GT VT MPQ, from American company ‘Textron Aviation’ for more than Rs 65 crore last year only, sources in the state aviation department said.Following the crash, the plane was reduced to scrap. It has been kept at the Gwalior airbase for over three months now, allegedly due to lack of maintenance and repair, as it was not insured at the time of the incident, they added. — PTIAircraft owned by MP Govt damaged||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pilots-licence-suspended-for-a-year-over-crash-landing-at-gwalior-airport-302950

The party organisation, however, needed to be strengthened across the state, including in constituencies where there were MLAs of the Alliance, the Kaliabor MP said.“The Alliance was finalised only a few months before the 2021 elections. Prior to that, the party has fulfilled its duty as an opposition party on its own, “ Gogoi, whose late father Tarun Gogoi was CM of the state for 15 years, pointed out.

Dharchula SDM AK Shukla said a State Disaster Response Team is still scouring the debris to find her but the chances of the woman's survival are low as it has been more than 12 hours since was buried under the debris falling from the hillside.Heavy overnight rains damaged large portions of the Rishikesh-Gangotri and Rishikesh-Badrinath national highways causing complete suspension of traffic along the affected stretches for public safety, an official said.The Rishikesh-Gangotri highway (NH-94) was closed for traffic from Narendra Nagar to Chamba while the Rishikesh-Badrinath highway (NH-58) was closed from Tapovan to Maletha, Tehri District Magistrate Eva Ashish Shrivastava said.Traffic will remain completely suspended along these stretches of the two highways until they are fully repaired, she said.A large portion of NH-94 caved in near Fakot in Tehri district, while landslide debris falling from the hillside blocked the road at a number of places.

Maintaining that it has put its new privacy policy on hold, it had said it would not limit the functionality for users not opting for it.A single judge of the Delhi High Court had on April 22 dismissed petitions filed by Facebook and WhatsApp against an order passed by the CCI for a probe into WhatsApp’s new privacy policy.Though it would have been “prudent” for the CCI to await the outcome of petitions in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court against WhatsApp’s new privacy policy, but not doing so would not make the regulator’s order “perverse” or “wanting of jurisdiction”, Justice Navin Chawla had said.WhatsApp and Facebook had originally moved the high court against the CCI’s March 24 order directing a probe into the new privacy policy, contending that when the top court and the Delhi High Court were looking into the privacy policy, then the CCI ought not to have “jumped the gun” and intervened in the issue.Privacy policy matterFacebook and WhatsApp have challenged the Delhi High Court’s single-judge order dismissing their pleas against a probe ordered by the Competition Commission of India into the instant messaging app’s new privacy policy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cci-probe-delhi-high-court-to-take-up-appeals-by-facebook-whatsapp-in-october-302961

He will be visiting the state next week and will take stock of the schemes. He will travel to Bastar and Sarguja. The Gujarat model has failed. We will showcase the Chhattisgarh model under Rahul Gandhi’s leadership now. Today we told our leader all that was in our heart and discussed everything from politics to governance,” Baghel said, indicating he had won a temporary breather. Signs of anxiety were, however, palpable in the CM’s camp.As many as 53 MLAs arrived in the Capital today in show of support to Baghel with many terming the CM a “farmer leader working for OBCs and tribals” in a bid to set him apart from rival TS Singh Deo, incumbent state health minister and an erstwhile royal.Ten mayors from Chhattisgarh also came to Delhi and demanded that Baghel retain the CM’s post.On the issue of CM’s rotation — a promise Gandhis are learnt to have made to Deo once 2.5 years of the state government ended, Baghel said, “I was appointed CM by the high command. I will stay as CM as long as the high command wants me to. State in-charge PL Punia has already conveyed what had to be conveyed on the issue of rotation of CM’s post. What is left to be said now?The anti-CM camp has flagged to Rahul a recent move by the state government to acquire by legislation a cash-strapped medical college owned by a family into which Baghel’s daughter is married.

Mali, in a note posted on Facebook, alleged that a hateful campaign had been launched against him by the Punjab Chief Minister and some Akali, BJP and AAP leaders. Rawat said there was no question of any state Congress chief being a dummy chief, “but they must act and decide within the party constitution and norms.” Sidhu had told a gathering on Thursday: “Mine is a politics of hope and faith. If I am able to meet the expectations of people, I will ensure the Congress retains power in Punjab for the next 20 years.

The toll in the blasts crossed 100 as on Friday and included 13 US Marines whose deaths Biden has vowed to avenge. Twenty-eight members of the Taliban were among those killed.“We will hunt you down and make you pay,” Biden said at a quickly summoned press conference soon after the attacks. The US President, who at one point rested his chin on his hands, was resolute with words, promising to get every American out of Afghanistan even after the troops have withdrawn on August 31. “America will not be intimidated. These terrorists will not win. We will get out Afghan allies. The mission will go on,’’ the President declared. The US and its coalition partners have so far evacuated over one lakh people over the past 12 days, which carried on even after the bomb attacks.In its condolence statement expressing sympathy with the victims’ families, the UN Security Council noted that “no Afghan group should support terrorists operating on the territory of any country” and that all parties “ensure the territory of Afghanistan should not be used to threaten or attack any country”. President of UNSC TS Tirumurti, presiding over a briefing on Ethiopia, touched on the Kabul attacks. “They (attacks) reinforced “the need for the world to stand united against terrorism and all those who provide sanctuaries to terrorists,” he said.The blasts have stalled India’s evacuation plans, though the MEA’s assessment is that the vast majority of Indians, who wished to return, have already been evacuated. “We are aware of the very difficult situation on the ground, so we are in touch with various parties on when we can mount evacuation flights,” said Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi at a briefing.India has so far evacuated over 550 persons in six separate flights either directly from Kabul or via Dushanbe, of whom about 260 were non-official Indians.Though Bagchi claimed India would “stand by the Afghans who stood by us”, the deportation of two-time woman Afghan parliamentarian Rangina Kargar, who held a long-term visa, clashed with the assertion. India has evacuated a Hindu and Sikh Afghan MP along with their relatives from Afghanistan while turning away Kargar, who had earlier visited India several times.The MEA claims that the Afghan MP’s deportation to Turkey took place due to the complex circumstances at that time. The security situation in Afghanistan had deteriorated and there were reports of groups of people raiding the Indian embassy’s outsourcing agencies, leading to the loss of Afghan passports. The authorities were in a state of high alert. India was also moving towards an e-visa arrangement. All these factors led to confusion, “leading to the unfortunate incident of denial of entry in the country”, Bagchi said.Not willing to put a firm figure on the number of Indians left behind, he admitted that a group of 20 Indians was stranded in Kabul as it was unable to get past the checkpoints and crowds amassed at the airport. The MEA had “no comment” on being asked whether India planned to send its military to Afghanistan.The MEA said currently there was a lack of clarity or no clarity about any entity forming a government in Kabul. “I think we are jumping the gun regarding recognition.
