Later in mid-April, the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal confirmed that the pig deaths were due to ASF.

This goes against all facts & authentic history. We know PM wants to obliterate Nehru’s legacy, but this is unconscionable! He must rise above his prejudices and tell ICHR to fix it,” Ramesh said.According to Oommen Chandy: “It is not only petty for the ICHR to omit Pandit Nehru & Maulana Azad from Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav but it also indicates the unfortunate attempts to tamper with Indian history. It only reflects poorly on the incumbent government & doesn’t diminish the greatness of Nehru.”Calling the ICHR explanation “ludicrous”, P. Chidambaram accused the ICHR of “bowing to hate and prejudice”.“ICHR Member-Secretary’s explanation for the omission of Jawaharlal Nehru from the first digital poster to celebrate 75 years of independence is ludicrous,” Chidambaram said, questioning whether “it would omit Henry Ford while celebrating the birth of the motor car or Wright brothers while celebrating the birth of aviation”.“If he was celebrating Indian science, will he omit C V Raman? After bowing down to prejudice and hate, it is best the Member-Secretary shuts his mouth.”Shashi Tharoor called it “not merely petty but absolutely ahistorical to celebrate Azadi by omitting the pre-eminent voice of Indian freedom, Jawaharlal Nehru. One more occasion for ICHR to disgrace itself. This is becoming a habit!”ICHR director Om Jee Upadhyay was quoted as saying that they are not diminishing anybody’s role but making several pages on the issue. He also said that people whose contribution to the Freedom Struggle was downplayed should also be highlighted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/under-fire-ichr-says-posters-in-coming-days-will-feature-nehru-303800

The 40-year-old accused, Dodda Sunil Kumar, was found guilty under sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and a fine of Rs 11,000 was also levied on him.The sentencing was pronounced by the Additional District Judge Mohammad Abdul Rafi in a special fast-track court for POCSO cases. However, eight staffers of the school, who were co-accused and booked for not reporting the offense, were acquitted by the court as their involvement could not be proved.The matter had been reported in December 2020 after one of the five girls, a seven-year-old class 2 student, fell ill and was taken to hospital for a check-up. Upon questioning, the girl informed her mother about the sexual assault by the headmaster. The mother approached the Laxmidevipally police, and a case was registered.Once the case was investigated, it came to light that the headmaster had sexually abused four other girls. The abuse had begun in August 2020 during lockdown when Sunil took the girls one by one to his home under the pretext of teaching them. The headmaster also threatened the girls with a knife in case they mentioned the sexual abuse to anyone.Additional District Judge examined 24 witnesses during the trial, and the case was concluded within nine months after Kumar was arrested.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/headmaster-gets-20-years-for-sexual-assault-303798

29-08-2021||Noida||UP cops bust international human-trafficking racket, 12 women brought back to India since April||Nargis (45, name changed) from Unnao district in Uttar Pradesh was living separately from her husband after several years of marriage, along with her two daughters and a son.Financially weak, the woman came across an opportunity to work as a domestic help in Oman that would help her earn Rs 25,000 per month.In February, with the help of a travel agent based in Kanpur, she reached the Gulf country, only to realise that she had fallen into the trap of a human-trafficking nexus."As soon as I reached Oman, my phone was taken away, and I was subjected to physical and mental torture. Ayesha, a Sri Lankan woman, was handling me. I begged her to let me return to India, but she demanded Rs 4 lakh for my release," Nargis told PTI over the phone.Her daughter Sophia (name changed) said, "Ammi somehow informed us about her ordeal over the phone, after which I reported the matter to the Kanpur police, along with details of the travel agent."On August 15, as the country marked its 75th Independence Day, Nargis returned home, along with two more women, courtesy the Kanpur police and the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).During investigation, the police found a larger human-trafficking nexus spread across several countries and targeting women aged between 24 and 50 years on the pretext of getting them employed as domestic helps for a good salary in Gulf countries such as Oman, Qatar, Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, officials said.The victims are not only from Uttar Pradesh, but also from other parts of India like Punjab, Goa, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, while the nexus has also trapped women from neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan as well as from some African nations, they claimed.Kanpur's Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Salman Taj Patil said the lid blew off the human-trafficking racket when they started investigating a complaint in April from a city resident, who alleged that his wife was "trapped" in Oman, only to uncover the larger international nexus."When we extended the scope of the investigation, the officers soon understood that the matter was related to human trafficking. Police Commissioner Asim Arun engaged Kanpur's Anti-Human Trafficking Unit to go deeper in the case, while central agencies like the MEA were also alerted and their help was sought in rescuing the victims."In the last four months, 12 such women—six from Kanpur, two each from Punjab and Chennai and one each from Goa and Karnataka—were brought back to the country safely with the MEA's help," the officer told PTI.He said the police investigation has revealed that Ayesha, the Sri Lankan-origin woman in Oman, handles the entire network abroad while her key India stooges, who are based in Bengaluru, have connections with "travel agents" in states who trap women and send them to foreign countries on a "tourist visa".During the probe, two Kanpur residents—Muzammil and Ateequr Rahman—who worked as travel agents and had sent some women to Gulf countries were arrested, according to police officials.The two led the police to the all-India network operated by Bengaluru-based Amin, who too was arrested, they added."The gang sent about 18 women from Kanpur and adjoining cities to Gulf countries in the last two years. Most of these women are in the age group of 24 to 40 years, and three are in the age group of 40 to 50 years. These women were sent to Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Oman," one of the officials said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-cops-bust-international-human-trafficking-racket-12-women-brought-back-to-india-since-april-303770

29-08-2021|| New Delhi||SC issues fresh SOP to facilitate resumption of physical hearing of some cases from September 1||The Supreme Court has issued fresh standard operating procedures to accord final hearing of cases in physical mode from September 1, and will employ a hybrid option from Tuesday to Thursday amid strict observance of Covid appropriate norms.The top court has been hearing cases through video-conferencing since March last year due to the pandemic and several bar bodies and lawyers have been demanding that physical hearings should resume immediately.The SOP, issued by the Secretary General on August 28, made it clear that the courts would keep hearing miscellaneous cases through virtual mode on Mondays and Fridays.“Wearing of mask, frequent use of hand sanitiser and maintaining physical distancing norms are mandatory for all entrants into the Supreme Court premises, including into the Courtrooms,” the SOP said.The procedures mandated that once litigants and the lawyers opt for the hearing through physical mode then “hearing through video/tele-conferencing mode to the party concerned will not be facilitated”.The SOP has been issued on the directions of Chief Justice N V Ramana who took note of the recommendations of the Judges’ Committee set up earlier to consider representations and requests of bar bodies that the hearing through physical mode be started keeping in mind the financial and technical difficulties being faced by many lawyers.“With a view to gradually facilitate resumption of physical hearing, the final hearing/regular matters listed on non-miscellaneous days may be heard in the physical mode (with hybrid option), as may be decided by the Bench, considering the number of parties in a matter as well as the limited capacity of the Court rooms;  further, any other matter may be heard in physical mode on such days, if Bench directs likewise.“All other matters, including those listed on miscellaneous days shall continue to be heard through video/teleconferencing mode,” it said.The bench, hearing cases through physical mode, may decide to take a break during the hearings for a period of about 15 minutes, so that the courtroom may be sanitized, it said.If the number of advocates for parties are more than 20, the average working capacity of the courtrooms as per Covid norms, the bench “at any given time” resort to the virtual mode of hearing, the SOP said.“In a matter listed for physical hearing..., one AOR (or his nominee), one arguing counsel and one junior counsel per party will be allowed entry; one registered Clerk per party, as may be chosen by the AOR, shall be allowed entry to carry paper books/journals etc...,” it said.Lawyers will have to register on the apex court’s portal and submit their preferences for appearing before the bench within 24 hours of listing of the case for hearing, it said.“The entry of the counsels/parties into the HSZ (high-security zone) to appear for physical hearing will be through daily ‘Special hearing passes’ which will be issued by the Registry, on the basis of authorization by the concerned Advocate-on-Record on the portal,” it said.Multiple chair along with tables are being placed inside courtrooms and it shall be incumbent upon lawyers and litigants to maintain “minimum prescribed physical distancing norms”, it said, adding every entrant will have to undergo “thermal and such other scanning devices as may be installed for detecting body temperature, infection status, etc.”               The entry of parties in a matter will be permitted not earlier than ten minutes prior to the start of hearing, it said.Earlier in March this year the apex court had commenced hybrid proceedings, a combination of virtual and physical hearing, amid demands by lawyers for resumption of complete physical hearings but the system could not take off due to the onset of the second wave of Covid pandemic.On August 18, the top court had indicated that physical hearing in the apex court, which is conducting proceedings virtually amid the Covid-19 pandemic since March last year, may resume soon.A bench headed by the CJI had then said that physical hearing in the apex court may start within 10 days. In July this year, the SCBA had written a letter to the CJI urging that physical hearing in the apex court be resumed saying the Covid-19 situation in the national capital has become “almost normal”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-fresh-sop-to-facilitate-resumption-of-physical-hearing-of-some-cases-from-september-1-303761
29-08-2021||New Delhi||UP Assembly election: BSP, SP to counter BJP’s strategy to win over Muslim votes||The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh have independently decided to counter Bharatitya Janata Party’s moves to win over Muslim voters with an eye on the crucial upcoming Assembly poll in the State.The election will be held in February-March next year.“The BJP has lost ground in Uttar Pradesh due to mishandling of Covid pandemic. Hence, it is trying to impress Muslim voters, which BSP will counter,” a top BSP leader told TNS.Sources say Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)—the fountainhead of “Sangh Parivar”—has greenlighted to the BJP on meaningful inclusion of Muslims in its political calculus apropos of the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.Top RSS functionaries had discussed the issue during their five-day meet at Chitrakoot in Madhya Pradesh held in the second week of July. It was attended by its head, Mohan Bhagwat.An internal assessment in a  section of the BJP is that the party’s popularity has plummeted by about 10-12 per cent of the votes it polled in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, even though the BJP leaders will not verify this officially for obvious reasons. This putative erosion of votes may benefit the BSP and the SP, which are the other dominant players in Uttar Pradesh politics and strong symbols against the BJP.The assessment, however, is also that the decimation in the vote bank would not affect the BJP’s prospects of winning the elections, but the Muslim minority should not be left behind. The party believes it should favourably involve them in its programmatic and electoral calisthenics.Sources further said that the section in the BJP that's pushing for the inclusion of Muslims wants at least 10-12  Muslims candidates to be given tickets for the coming assembly elections. Their view is said to be gaining currency in the BJP with 20/20 hindsight of the results of the last West Bengal assembly elections.Varying estimates project Muslims constituting 18-20 per cent of voters in UP. They are a determining factor in about 70 out of the total of 403 assembly seats in the StateBSP and the SP are alarmed at BJP plans to zero in on socially and economically backward sections in Muslim demography.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-assembly-election-bsp-sp-to-counter-bjps-strategy-to-win-over-muslim-votes-303760

29-08-2021||New Delhi||Resting on climate action a USD 11 trillion opportunity for India: Report||India must act now to prevent the country losing USD 35 trillion in economic potential over the next 50 years due to unmitigated climate change, a new report from the Deloitte Economics Institute has said.The report, titled ‘India’s turning point: How climate action can drive our economic future’, also reveals how the country could gain USD 11 trillion in economic value instead over the same period, by limiting rising global temperatures and realising its potential to ‘export decarbonisation’ to the world.“We have a narrow window of time - the next 10 years - to make the decisions needed to alter the trajectory of climate change. No one is immune to the impact of climate change, but for India this is a window of opportunity to lead the way and show how climate action is not a narrative of cost but one of sustainable economic growth,” according to Atul Dhawan, Chairperson, Deloitte India.As India aspires to be a USD 5 trillion economy, it is not just foreign and domestic investments that will be key in driving growth, the country must also take this opportunity to align its ambitions with climate choices, he noted.With no action taken on climate change, the average global temperatures could rise by 3 degrees celsius or more by the end of this century. This will make it harder for people to live and work, as sea levels rise, crop yields fall, infrastructure is damaged, and other challenges emerge, threatening the progress and prosperity that the nation has enjoyed in recent decades, the report said.Over the next 50 years, the top five most impacted industries in terms of economic activity are expected to incur a significant share of climate-related loss.These industries—services (government and private), manufacturing, retail and tourism, construction, and transport—currently account for more than 80 per cent of India’s GDP. Together, they form the basis of the country’s contemporary economic engine, it added.Deloitte estimates that by 2070, these five industries alone would experience an annual loss in the value added to GDP of more than USD 1.5 trillion per year.The report also said that if governments, businesses and communities act boldly and rapidly in the next decade to address climate change, average global temperature rises can be limited to around 1.5 degrees celsius by 2050 -- a scenario that will minimise the impact of climate change for India and the rest of the world. At the same time, India can achieve significant economic growth by supplying the products, services, and financing the world will need to limit temperature increases.India is home to many enterprises that are already world-leading producers of the advanced solutions countries will need to address climate change. These include green hydrogen and negative-emission solutions, both natural and technological, the report said.“We need to transform the world’s economies towards new, low-emission pathways and India is well positioned to play a leading role in this process globally. By making the right choices now, India could chart a more prosperous path towards a low-emission future, accelerating progress in the rest of the world by exporting key technologies, processes, and know-how,” said Viral Thakker, Partner and Sustainability Leader, Deloitte India.Accelerated decarbonisation could bring significant benefits to India and the world. India could use the transition to a low-emission footing to restructure its economy towards growth in advanced industrial sectors, leveraging lower cost clean energy export markets, as the region experiences a rapid increase in energy demand over the coming years.Deloitte said as a developing nation, India’s transformation to a low-emission footing is likely to be more complex and challenging than much of the rest of Asia Pacific.It will have to strike a delicate balance between the need for sustained economic development - and the corresponding rise in energy demand - and investing in and transitioning to emerging, low-emission technologies. The structural adjustment costs associated with reducing India’s emissions profile are expected to be significant, but the cost of inaction will be greater.The report sets out four key stages for India’s climate transition. According to the Deloitte forecasts, economic benefits would be observed from the first year that bold climate policy decisions start delivering rapid investment and technology development. In 2070 alone, this would equate to GDP growth of 8.5 per cent.“These start with the government and businesses making bold decisions to act on climate change now, and develop or expand their related strategies. Those decisions would see the economy start to decarbonise between now and 2030,” the report said.        From 2030 to 2040, India and the world would need to complete large and coordinated shifts to reduce carbon emissions by tackling how energy is produced and consumed. 2040 to 2055 is the turning point, where the world avoids locking in temperature increases of 3 degrees celsius or more.“By this period, the process of decarbonising high-emission industries would be almost complete, the cost of green solutions would start to fall, and wider net economic gains would begin to emerge,” according to Deloitte.After 2055, India’s economy would have been radically transformed and be producing near-zero emissions. There would have been a rapid gain in economic dividends from global decarbonisation, while global temperature rises would have been limited to reaching a maximum of 1.5 degrees celsius by the end of the century.

He also said Union Home Minister Amit Shah should “take the responsibility and resign immediately”.An FIR was registered against Deshmukh and some unidentified persons on April 24 this year on charges of corruption and misconduct following a preliminary enquiry (PE) that the CBI conducted in compliance with the high court’s order.Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked some police officers to collect Rs 100 crore per month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Deshmukh resigned in April after the PE was ordered but denied the allegations.“The Investigation Officer of the CBI in the PE had concluded that there is no role of Anil Deshmukh ji in the so called Rs 100 cr collection allegation by former CP Parambir Singh and had closed the inquiry,” Sawant tweeted.“We demand an SC-monitored inquiry into this conspiracy to find out at whose behest the CBI changed its stand by overriding the report of the IO (Investigation Officer)? The HC had only asked for a Preliminary Enquiry (against Deshmukh) but filing an FIR by misguiding the high court is a huge crime of the CBI,” he said in another tweet.Deshmukh, a senior Nationalist Congress Party leader, had said the ongoing CBI inquiry against him was illegal since the Central agency had not taken prior sanction from the Maharashtra government to prosecute him.Sawant said this is a “clear example as to how these agencies have become political weapons of the Modi government to target their opponents”.“Even courts misguided, rules are bent, inquiries kept unending. Such conspiracies happen only in Autocracy. High time Entire nation comes together in saving our democracy,” Sawant alleged.He said a “conspiracy” by the Modi government to target Anil Deshmukh and “defame” the MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi), of which the Congress is one of the constituents, has been exposed.NCP national spokesman and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik demanded the CBI clarify the “exact status” of the Anil Deshmukh case.“The CBI document which has given a clean chit to Deshmukh is doing rounds on social media and is in several newspapers today. This is a serious issue, and if the document is true, there can’t be a more serious political vendetta than this,” he told reporters on Sunday.

If he was celebrating the birth of aviation, will he omit the Wright brothers? If he was celebrating Indian science, will he omit C V Raman," Chidambaram asked in a series of tweets.The exclusion of Nehru's image from the poster of the 'Azaadi ka Amrit Mahotsav' celebrations by the ICHR has triggered a controversy, with opposition parties slamming the government for it and dubbing it as "petty and atrocious". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chidambaram-slams-ichr-for-omitting-nehrus-photo-from-poster-celebrating-indias-independence-303745

Let us transform the mantra of ‘Sabka Prayas’ (everyone’s effort) into reality,” he said.Noting that the world has been paying heed to Indian spiritual traditions and philosophy, the prime minister said people then also have a responsibility to carry forward these great traditions.“That which was temporary and has perished has to be left behind but what is timeless has to be carried forward. Let us celebrate our festivals, understand their scientific meaning, and the connotation behind them. There is an underlying message in every festival,” he said, wishing people a happy Janmashtami, which falls on Monday.Noting that the Vishwakarma Puja will be observed in the coming days, he said the festival is essentially an ancient Indian practice of paying tributes to different skills.Modi also mentioned a FM radio station in Gujarat’s Kevadiya through which radio jockeys are working to promote Sanskrit, and said the ancient language through its thoughts and medium of literary texts nurtures knowledge and also strengthens national unity.Modi also urged people to continue to maintain COVID-19 precautions.“More than 62 crore vaccine doses have been administered in the country, but still we have to be careful, be vigilant,” he said.

Totalitarian governments are known for their constant reliance on falsehoods to consolidate power... we see there is an increasing trend among countries around the world to manipulate Covid-19 data,” Justice Chandrachud said delivering the “Sixth Chief Justice MC Chagla Memorial Lecture” online.“We should put these truth providers through intense scrutiny and questioning to convince ourselves of the veracity of the claims made by them. It’s equally important for those making truth claims to be transparent,” he said while talking on “Speaking Truth to Power: Citizens and the Law”.“It is important to consider why truth is so important to democracy, a form of governance adopted to avoid tyranny of the law and of the few. Truth is important in modern democracies which have been described as spaces of reason since any decision must be backed by adequate reason and because a reason based on falsehood, would be no reason at all,” he said.He asked people to be vigilant and open to reading about, debating and even accepting different opinions. “One can consider speaking truth to power as a right of every citizen which they must have in a democracy but equally a duty of every citizen,” he added.Justice Chandrachud, who had termed the Centre’s vaccination policy prima facie arbitrary forcing it to change it, said in a democratic country it’s important to hold governments in check and guard against falsehoods, false narratives and fake news.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-rely-only-on-state-for-truth-citizens-must-be-more-vigilant-sc-judge-chandrachud-303473

He said horrors like the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and Partition spoke of the sacrifices made for India’s freedom and should not be forgotten as these inspired to keep the country above all.Recounting the impact of the ghastly 10-minute incident in Jallianwala Bagh on April 13, 1919, the PM said, “It inspired countless revolutionaries and freedom fighters, including martyrs Bhagat Singh and Udham Singh, to die for the cause of free India.” Those 10 minutes, he said, became immortal in the Indian freedom struggle, due to which the country was able to celebrate the Amrut Mahotsav of freedom today.Modi said it was the responsibility of every nation to preserve its history as it taught the countrymen and gave them the direction to move forward. “Therefore, we have decided to observe August 14 every year as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day. India witnessed horrors like Jallianwala Bagh and many more during Partition… Punjab people have been the biggest victims of Partition,” he said.Underlining the brave tradition of Punjab, he said following the path of Gurus, sons and daughters of the state had stood fearlessly against all dangers facing the country.Noting that efforts were on to preserve this rich heritage, the PM said, “Fortunately, auspicious occasions like the 550th Parkash Utsav of Guru Nanak Dev, 350th of Guru Gobind Singh and 400th of Guru Teg Bahadur had taken place in the last seven years and the Union Government has tried to spread the teachings of the Gurus through these holy occasions.”He also mentioned about initiatives like turning Sultanpur Lodhi into a heritage town and Kartarpur corridor. He said it was due to ‘Guru Kripa’ (blessings of the Gurus) that the government was able to bring the ‘swaroop’ of Guru Granth Sahib along with stranded citizens back to India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-inaugurates-renovated-jallianwala-bagh-303469

Some of the farmers reportedly hurled stones at the police personnel. In the clash, 10 policemen and 12 farmers were injured.Subsequently, several farmers’ leaders, including BKU (Charuni) state core committee member Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, were detained. They were let off later in the evening.The police action triggered a statewide protest by farmers, who blocked the Panchkula-Sonepat national highway. State highways in Karnal, Hisar, Jind and Kaithal districts too were blocked. Asking the farmers to get their medico-legal reports (MLR) prepared, Charuni said: “The next course of action will be chalked out in Karnal on Monday. The farmers had assembled peacefully at the toll plaza, but the police used force against them.” Ganga Ram Punia, SP, however, said they had only used “mild force.”Farmers said since the police had sealed all roads leading to the venue of the BJP meeting, they decided to assemble at Bastara. At 11 am, they headed for Karnal but were stopped by the police. “We had appealed to the farmers to express their point of view in a democratic way, but they did not do so, forcing the police to take action,” explained Karnal Range IGP Mamta Singh.It’s shamefulThe blood of farmers has again been shed, shaming India. Rahul Gandhi, CongCM flays farmersIt is unconstitutional to oppose any meeting. If they had to protest, it should have been peaceful.

The reaction followed a tweet by Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari, who questioned the high command’s silence on Sidhu’s comments daring the party. “I will go to Punjab in two-three days and meet the CM, Sidhu and anyone else who wants to meet me,” Rawat said.The high command wants the two camps to resolve their differences and work together in larger electoral interest, but no amount of admonishment appears to be helping the reconciliation process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/harish-rawat-briefs-rahul-gandhi-on-punjab-will-visit-chandigarh-next-week-303466

They said these elements had started working on their plan to export jihad to Central Asia and later to India. Intelligence inputs suggested that the ISIS-K leadership was now planning to recruit youngsters and carry out terror strikes. “On top of their ideological agenda is to establish the rule of the Caliphate, including in India,” the sources said.Youngsters from Kerala and Mumbai have already been there in the ranks of ISIS with the terror group finding significant traction among radicalised Indian youth. “This is a matter of great concern in the present situation as ISIS-K operators can activate the radicals to harm India and Indians,” said an intelligence official.Another intelligence input suggested that Jaish-e-Mohammed leadership with the help of Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI has shifted base to Afghanistan’s Helmand province, bordering Kandahar. They said even the Lashkar-e-Taiba leadership, responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks, was shifting to Kunar in east Afghanistan. The sources said the two terror outfits, after shifting base to Afghanistan, had quickly joined hands with ISIS-K.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isis-k-aims-to-have-caliphate-in-india-intel-303465
