The approval for world’s first DNA based ‘ZyCov-D’ vaccine of @ZydusUniverse is a testimony to the innovative zeal of India’s scientists,” Prime Minister Modi tweeted.“A momentous feat indeed,” he added.Vaccines Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V are being given to only those above 18 years of age and unlike ZyCoV-D, which is three-dose, these are administered in two doses.The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) said that ZyCoV-D is the world’s first DNA-based vaccine against the coronavirus and when injected produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and elicits an immune response, which plays a vital role in protection from the disease as well as viral clearance.

20-08-2021||New Delhi||India seals deal with Russia to procure AK-103 rifles||India has finalised a deal with Russia to buy a sizeable number of AK-103 series of assault rifles for the Indian Army under the provisions of emergency procurement, people familiar with the development said on Friday.The Army is implementing a mega infantry modernisation programme under which a large number of light machine guns, battle carbines and assault rifles are being purchased to replace its ageing and obsolete weapons.“A deal has been finalised with Russia for direct purchase of a batch of AK-103 series of assault rifles,” one of the persons cited above said without specifying the number of rifles or the cost of procurement.There is no official announcement on the deal yet.The people said the rifles are being procured under the emergency financial powers granted to the three services to make urgent purchases.In October 2017, the Indian Army began the process to acquire around seven lakh rifles, 44,000 light machine guns (LMGs) and nearly 44,600 carbines.The government has accorded priority to the modernisation of the armed forces and the infantry modernisation has been initiated as part of the larger process to further enhance the combat capability of the Army.Meanwhile, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh approved a proposal on putting up relevant details of planned procurements by the three services on their or the defence ministry’s website.“To promote ‘Ease of Doing Business’ and provide more transparency in the capital acquisition process, aligning with the aspirations of industry, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has approved a proposal mandating the service headquarters to publish the relevant details on the service headquarters/MoD website within one week of receipt of approvals,” the defence ministry said in a statement.“The details shared will be subject to sensitivities keeping the security aspect in mind,” it added.

20-08-2021||Patna||Opposition meet: Tejashwi seeks ‘driving seat’ for regional parties||The opposition in the country must get cracking for the next Lok Sabha polls and regional parties must be allowed to be in the “driving seat” wherever these were strong, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav asserted on Friday.Addressing a meeting of opposition parties via video conference from here, convened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi, the RJD leader said that recent assembly polls in West Bengal, where BJP was trounced, and Bihar where the NDA could just scrape through, could serve as an inspiration for the big battle in 2024.The 33-year-old, who steered his party to an impressive show in the Bihar assembly polls last year thereby emerging out of the shadow of his father Lalu Prasad, underscored that the opposition needed to bring in “dhaar” (edge) and “nayaapan” (novelty) in its electoral issues.“The opposition must fight polls on its own agenda.....the experience of West Bengal and Bihar has shown how we should be taking on the BJP”, said the RJD leader whose party has ended up in the opposition in the state though it has the largest number of MLAs.“We must start working on our strategy for 2024 now. The opposition has opted for the beaten track for the past seven years..... We must bring in ‘dhaar’ and ‘nayaapan’ in the issues we raise”, said the former Bihar deputy chief minister.He asserted that the opposition must start “hitting the streets” besides finalising its alliances well in advance since coalitions stitched shortly before elections left confusion in the minds of the people.Yadav lamented that the opposition had “innumerable issues” at hand but was “unable to cash in on these despite palpable public anger”.He also stressed on the need for “better communication among opposition parties at national as well as state levels”.“The opposition must put up a credible alternative by sending across a message of unity and shared vision and programme among the parties.“Moreover, in states where regional parties are strong, these should be allowed to be in the driving seat”, the RJD leader asserted.Notably, in Bihar, a fine performance by Yadav’s party notwithstanding, old ally Congress emerged as the proverbial weak link as it could bag less than 20 seats despite contesting 70. The performance of the Left was said to be the best in recent decades though its strike rate too was not much to speak about.A few months later in adjoining West Bengal, Yadav extended his support to Mamata Banerjee’s TMC, despite his alliance in Bihar with Congress and the Left which were decimated in the assembly polls that turned out to be a straight contest between the firmly entrenched ruling party and the rapidly growing BJP.He also appealed to all opposition parties to put pressure on the Narendra Modi government for conducting the census caste-wise.“It is an important issue. The BJP government did not make public even the findings of the socio-economic survey conducted in 2011 when the Congress-led UPA was in power,” said the leader of the opposition who is expected to be part of the delegation of political leaders from Bihar, headed by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, which would raise the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi next week. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-meet-tejashwi-seeks-driving-seat-for-regional-parties-299901
20-08-2021||Mumbai||Quarantine, Covid-19 testing remain key concerns for international travellers: Report||Quarantine and Covid-19 testing remain key concerns for international travel even as domestic travel in India begins its recovery following the second wave of the pandemic, according to a research report.The research report from Collinson also showed that while physical well-being has been at the forefront of discussions around the recovery of the travel sector, travellers are now just as worried about their mental wellbeing as they are about their physical wellbeing.The report is based on analysis and data comparison of 18,500 travellers in late-2019 (pre-pandemic) and 12,607 travellers in late-2020 (during the pandemic).Collinson is a global end-to-end travel experiences, airport services and travel medical company.According to the report, societal awareness regarding the importance of mental health has increased sharply in the past few years, including the impact of travel on our mental well-being.As much as 84 per cent of Indian respondents have said they will prioritise their mental wellbeing more when they travel now than they did before COVID-19, it said.There was already a concern among travellers about the impact journeys were having on their physical wellbeing. A total of 58 per cent of respondents surveyed from India went on to say the pandemic had heightened these concerns, according to the report.Despite there being a pent-up demand for travel, over two-thirds (67 per cent) of travellers think post-pandemic travel will be more stressful.When asked what travel brands could do to help the situation, 24 per cent of Indian travellers said they value propositions that show there is consideration for their mental health on their journeys, it stated.“While there are increasingly positive signs for a travel recovery, the only way to make it a success is to understand how traveller needs and fears have been changed by their experiences through the pandemic,” said David Evans, joint CEO at Collinson.He added that it is so important that the travel industry recovers, and it is even more important that the industry is able to do so in a collaborative and informed way. “What this research lays out is how to go about rebuilding traveller confidence, by focusing on mental as well as physical health, and understanding the factors causing stress,” Evans said.The report findings also show that Indian travellers are specifically looking for visible health and hygiene measures when they travel, such as hand sanitisers, throughout the airport (92 per cent).They are also looking for socially distanced spaces in which to ‘de-stress’ and ‘relax away from the crowds’ — with 38 per cent of Indian respondents saying that they would pay for lounge access to better protect their well-being at the airport.When asked why they might be hesitant to travel in light of Covid-19, according to research findings, the top reason Indian travellers gave was that they were worried they would need to be quarantined either on arrival or return (48 per cent).Wanting to avoid long quarantine periods is likely a reason why Indian passengers (50 per cent) see testing on arrival as an important component to their travel experience.However, a similar 48 per cent of Indian respondents said pre-departure testing was also important. It indicates that COVID-19 testing has now crossed the line from being just a government pre-requisite for travel to some destinations, to an element that people want to see in order to give them the confidence to take to the skies once more, it said.“Despite many of us planning holidays to relax and recharge, the pandemic is resulting in the travel section of our trips being viewed as more stressful than before.“In return, many travellers are now paying more attention to their mental well-being while travelling, not only their physical,” said Priyanka Lakhani, commercial director (Middle East and Africa) and director (South Asia) at Collunson.According to Collinson, data was collected from a total of 18,500 travellers in 2019, of which 17,000 were leisure travellers and 9,000 travel for business.On an average, leisure travellers took 2.24 trips per year and business travellers 2.34, according to the findings.In data collected from a total of 12,607 travellers in 2020, 11,159 were leisure travellers and 7,904 travel for business.The research was carried out in Australia, Brazil, China, India, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Singapore, the UAE, the UK and the US, it stated.

Farmers are protesting for many months, it's an anguishing picture for a democratic country like India. The nation is facing many  issues like inflation, economic slowdown, Covid mitigation, unemployment, border disputes, issue of the minority communities etc," he tweeted.The present government has failed to address these issues, he said. "Those who believe in democracy and secularism, those who like to work together for saving  the democratic principles and ethos of our country must come together," Pawar said."A time-bound action programme needs to be taken up collectively, and I strongly suggest that instead of dealing with all these issues together, we must collectively prioritize each issue and solve them one by one to give our country a good present and future," he said.A total of 19 parties, including the NCP and the Shiv Sena, participated in the meeting.

20-08-2021||New Delhi||ED officer Rajeshwar Singh applies for retirement; may contest UP Assembly polls||ED officer Rajeshwar Singh has applied for retirement from government service and is expected to join the BJP and contest the forthcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, official sources said on Friday.Singh is currently posted as the joint director of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) at its zonal office in Lucknow.A BTech and PhD in police, human rights and social justice, Singh joined the federal anti-money laundering investigations agency in 2009 on deputation from Uttar Pradesh where he was serving as a state police service officer.Sources told PTI that Singh has applied for retirement from government service. They said there are chances he may join the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh and also contest the assembly polls in the central Indian state expected to be held early next year.The application is yet to be accepted, they added.His sister Abha Singh, a lawyer based in Mumbai, also posted a message on her Twitter handle with a photograph of her and Singh stating: “Congratulations to my brother #RajeshwarSingh of the #ED for opting for early retirement to serve the country. Nation needs you.”        Singh, who hails from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh, was permanently absorbed into the ED cadre in 2015.He has headed some important and high-profile investigations like the 2G spectrum allocation case, 2010 Commonwealth Games alleged irregularities, and money laundering probe against former Union finance minister P Chidambaram and his son Karti Chidambaram, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda.He also headed the headquarters investigation unit (HIU) of the ED located in the national capital that probes sensitive money laundering and foreign exchange violation cases including those with political links.Meanwhile, the officer has had his share of controversies.In June, 2018 the Union finance ministry had submitted a secret report to the Supreme Court apparently carrying details of a phone call received by Singh from Dubai.The report is said to have been prepared by country’s external intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) and handed over to the Department of Revenue in the finance mnistry, under which the ED functions.The then ED Director Karnal Singh had issued a press statement, saying the said overseas call received by Singh pertained to an “ongoing investigation” and he was a responsible officer with outstanding career records.The government had subsequently launched an investigation against Singh for writing a letter in which he had made a scathing attack on the then revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia questioning him if he has developed animosity against him by “siding with scamsters and their affiliates”?Singh was subsequently issued a notice seeking an explanation for alleged “insubordination” in context of this letter by the revenue department, to which he had replied with a “regret” and explained his side of the story.That letter, sources had said, was sent through “official channels” to the agency’s chief (Karnal Singh) but it was never forwarded to Adhia.Accusations of certain other alleged irregularities made against Singh were probed by the ED, CBI and CVC, and a report was sent to the court and the government stating that there was “no merit” in the allegations and hence the enquiry was closed.Singh, who carried out numerous encounters during his stint in the uniform, is married to IPS officer Laxmi Singh who is currently serving as the Inspector General of Lucknow range.

20-08-2021||New Delhi||India to prioritise granting visas to civil society members, opinion makers, women activists from Afghanistan||In line with its historical ties with Afghan people, India will prioritise granting visas to civil society members, opinion makers, women activists, students and NGO workers from Afghanistan in view of the current situation in the country, people familiar with the development said on Friday.Afghan people feeling threatened or facing the fear of persecution and those who supported India in rolling out various welfare and development projects will also be given priority for grant of visas, they said.However, they said the government's immediate priority is to evacuate the stranded Indians from Kabul and arrangements are being made in coordination with the US and other partner countries to bring them home. It is learnt that all back-up plans have been put into place to facilitate their return at the earliest. Amid fears of a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, a number of countries such as the UK, Canada, have already announced resettlement schemes for Afghan refugees while several others have agreed on providing temporary shelter to them. Two days after Kabul fell to the Taliban, India on Tuesday introduced a new category of electronic visas called "e-Emergency X-Misc Visa" to facilitate the grant of visas to Afghan nationals after reviewing the situation in the conflict-ridden country. The people cited above said India will continue to stand by those Afghan people who have supported India in various ways. Following the Taliban's takeover of Kabul, thousands of people rushed to the airport in the Afghan capital in a desperate attempt to flee the country fearing the Taliban's brutality. "We have a historical relationship with the Afghan people and I think that relationship will continue to guide our thoughts and outlook," External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said in New York on Thursday. India has been a key stakeholder in Afghanistan and it has invested nearly USD 3 billion in carrying out nearly 500 projects across Afghanistan. The people said another priority for the government has been to facilitate the evacuation of the members of the Hindu and Sikh minorities from Afghanistan. The majority of the people from the Sikh community in Afghanistan possess long-term Indian visas. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Monday set up a round-the-clock special cell set to keeping track of stranded Indians in Afghanistan, ascertaining assistance being sought and advising a further course of action.The Taliban swept across Afghanistan this month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities including Kabul in the backdrop of the withdrawal of the US forces. Kabul fell to the Taliban on Sunday.By Tuesday, India completed the evacuation of all its diplomats and other staff members from the Afghan capital under a difficult and complicated exercise, effectively closing its mission for the second time since 1996 when the militant outfit captured power. The mission to evacuate close to 200 people including the Indian envoy and other staffers in two military aircraft was accomplished with support from the US. Following the evacuation, the MEA said the focus now would be to ensure the safe return of all Indian nationals from the Afghan capital. The MEA said the immediate priority for the government is to obtain accurate information about all Indian nationals currently staying in Afghanistan. It also requested the Indians as well as their employers to urgently share the relevant details with the special Afghanistan cell. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-prioritise-granting-visas-to-civil-society-members-opinion-makers-women-activists-from-afghanistan-299894

The woman's sister and nephew, who tried to save her, also suffered burns and were hospitalised.According to the police, 21-year-old Ramulamma, who hails from Chowdavada village in Pusapatirega Mandal of Vizianagaram district, was in a relationship with the woman for two years.The two were to be married in October 2021. But suspecting the woman to be involved with someone else, Ramulamma showed reluctance towards marriage.The woman's family approached the police, and with the intervention of village elders, Ramulamma agreed to the wedding.The woman's mother said that Rambabu often visited their house around midnight for the past few days."He would climb the terrace, see her and then leave. We asked his mother why he was doing this; she said he was doing it casually, so we didn't do anything. We never thought he would set her on fire," she told the police.Last night he did the same, but instead of leaving, he set the man on fire. Rambabu has since been taken into police custody and has been interrogated about the motive of the crime.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-man-sets-fiance-on-fire-299888

20-08-2021||Kolkata||TMC MP fires volley of questions at PM Modi, his cabinet ministers on just-concluded Parliament session||Mounting a fresh attack on the BJP-led Centre, TMC's Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien on Friday posed several questions over the just-concluded Parliament session, one of them being the reason for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's absence during a debate on the constitutional amendment bill on other backward classes (OBCs).O'Brien, in a video, asked as many as nine questions to Modi and his cabinet of ministers on a range of issues, claiming that the opposition was "not allowed" to hold discussions on the Pegasus controversy and the contentious farm laws in the two Houses.The TMC leader in Rajya Sabha further wondered why the Parliament session was wrapped up ahead of schedule."Why did you (PM) not bother to reply to any query asked by the opposition...? Why was our PM missing during the OBC debate in Parliament? Former PMs Deve Gowdaji, Manmohan Singh ji were present. Where was Modiji?" O'Brien said in the video posted on his Twitter handle.A constitutional amendment bill to restore the powers of the states to make their own OBC lists was passed by Parliament on Wednesday, the last day of the monsoon session.The Rajya Sabha MP noted that "38 bills were passed in both Houses with an average discussion time of 10 minutes on each of them." He claimed that Modi hasn't replied to any question raised in Rajya Sabha in the past five years.O'Brien also sought to know the rationale behind the delay in electing a deputy speaker to Lok Sabha, a post that has been lying vacant over the last two years."Why was the opposition not allowed to discuss Pegasus internal security issues and farm laws? The government must have its way, and the opposition must have its say," O'Brien observed.In his last question to the cabinet ministers, he said, "Whose business is it to wrap up Parliament. Is it government's responsibility or opposition's? Who is the government accountable to? The people. We are accountable to the people." Taking a dig at O'brien and his party, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said the TMC was "staging a drama", after having disrupted proceedings in both Houses of Parliament."The conduct of Trinamool MPs in Parliament brought disgrace to Bengal. Their only intention was to disrupt proceedings and gain political mileage. Important discussions on the pandemic could not be properly held due to the irresponsible behaviour of opposition leaders."Mr O'Brien and others should first explain the rationale behind their conduct," Ghosh added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-mp-fires-volley-of-questions-at-pm-modi-his-cabinet-ministers-on-just-concluded-parliament-session-299882
20-08-2021||---||Afghanistan in turmoil; embassy seeks adjournment in SC||New Delhi, August 20As Afghanistan descends into chaos and anarchy following the recent takeover by the Taliban, its embassy here is unsure about the stand to be taken before the Supreme Court in a case relating to a dispute with a Delhi-based construction contractor. On behalf of the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in New Delhi, advocate Ejaz Maqbool on Thursday sought an adjournment of hearing in the Afghan embassy’s dispute with KLA Construction Technologies Private Limited. In a letter written to the Supreme Court Registry, Maqbool said he was unable to get instructions from the ambassador of Afghanistan in India as the country was in turmoil. He requested a Bench led by Justice Vineet Saran to adjourn the case for six weeks. "Do you think the situation will get settled in six weeks?" asked the Bench. "No… but at least I will be able to get instruction from the new regime. We should pray that things get settled over there,” Maqbool responded. "In view of a letter circulated by learned counsel for the petitioner seeking an adjournment of six weeks, let the matter be listed after six weeks," the Bench said in its order.The case relates to a decade-old dispute between the Afghan Embassy here and KLA Construction Technologies Private Limited over certain repair work undertaken by the company at the embassy premises. The issue was if arbitration of the dispute should be held in India or Afghanistan and the Afghan embassy has moved the top court against a Delhi High court order that went in favour of the company.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/afghanistan-in-turmoil-embassy-seeks-adjournment-in-sc-299881

20-08-2021||New Delhi||Facebook removes Rahul Gandhi's post for policy violation||After Twitter, Facebook has removed a content posted by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi that identified the family of a nine-year-old victim of alleged rape and murder in Northwest Delhi, saying it violated the social media platform's policies.According to sources, Facebook has informed Gandhi and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) about the removal of the posts from Facebook and Instagram.Earlier this week, Facebook had written to Gandhi asking him to remove the said post from Instagram—Facebook's photosharing platform."We have taken action to remove the content as it was in violation of our policies," a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Friday.Facebook takes action against a content if it violates its Community Standards or upon receiving a valid legal request as per Indian laws.Last week, NCPCR had asked Facebook to take appropriate action against Gandhi's Instagram profile over violation of provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and the Indian Penal Code, and demanded the removal of the video from the platform.Following the communication from Facebook to Gandhi earlier week, NCPCR withdrew its direction to the company to appear before the commission with an explanation over non-action regarding Gandhi's post.Earlier this month, Gandhi had met the family of the nine-year-old girl and asserted that he is with them on the path to justice and "will not back down even an inch". Later, he posted a picture of his meeting with the girl's parents on Instagram.Similar posts were also shared on Twitter. The microblogging platform had locked accounts of Gandhi as well as many other Congress leaders who tweeted the controversial post. On August 14, Twitter restored Gandhi's account after the Congress leader submitted a consent letter from the family of the victim.Twitter, however, continues to withhold the tweets that contain the images saying they violate India's laws."As part of the appeal process, @RahulGandhi (the official Twitter handle of Rahul Gandhi) has submitted a copy of the formal consent/authorisation letter to use the referenced image via our India Grievance Channel," a Twitter spokesperson had said.The law provides that the identity of a juvenile victim of sexual assault cannot be disclosed. Tweeting pictures of the family violated that, and so the accounts were locked. During the period the accounts were locked, the owner could access the account but not allowed to send out new tweets. This was to allow them to delete the contentious tweets.But neither Gandhi nor Congress and its leaders did that. Instead, they submitted a consent letter from the family of the alleged rape victim for use of their images."We have followed the necessary due diligence process to review the appeal in order to protect the safety and privacy of the affected individuals. We have updated our enforcement action based on the consent provided by the people depicted in the image," the Twitter spokesperson had said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/facebook-removes-rahul-gandhis-post-for-policy-violation-299851

20-08-2021||New Delhi||Breakthrough infections in India show high proportion of Delta variant of SARS-CoV2||Breakthrough infections of coronavirus cases comprise a very high proportion of the Delta variant, the INSACOG, a genome sequencing government consortium of laboratories, has said.The continuing Covid outbreaks across India are attributable to the Delta variant, a susceptible population and reduced vaccine effectiveness in blocking transmission, the INSACOG added.However, vaccination continues to be very effective in reducing severe disease and death, and public health measures to reduce transmission and inoculation remain critical, the INSACOG stressed in its latest bulletin dated August 16."As of now, sequencing of vaccination breakthroughs in India is also showing a very high proportion of Delta variant. Investigations for any new variants are ongoing," the INSACOG said.Of the 30,230 samples of Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest sequenced by the INSACOG, 20,324 were of Delta, it said.The Delta variant is currently driving the pandemic across several countries with China and Korea seeing new highs. Korea has reported that the new surge is due to Delta plus K417N mutation.The Delta variant resulted in a deadly second wave in the country between March to May that wreaked havoc on the health infrastructure, overwhelming hospitals. It infected lakhs and killed thousands.In India, new cases of AY.1, AY.2, AY.3 (Delta Plus) are being seen in July samples from Maharashtra at a frequency of about 1 per cent. However, at this time none of these sub-lineages has been found to have a growth advantage over the Delta parent lineage, it noted.According to INSACOG (the Indian SARS-CoV2 Genomics Consortium), 61 samples of Delta Plus variants have been detected in the country so far."Delta variant is the major VOC in India at this time. Continuing outbreaks across India are attributable to Delta, a susceptible population, reduced vaccine effectiveness in blocking transmission, and opportunities for transmission," the INSACOG said.Daily coronavirus cases have seen a significant plunge since the second wave which peaked in May.

20-08-2021||Lucknow||Probe report on Vikas Dubey’s encounter giving clean chit to police tabled in UP Assembly||A three-member commission probing the encounter of gangster Vikas Dubey has given a clean chit to police, stating their version of events about his death was supported by evidence.The commission said the Kanpur ambush in which eight cops were killed occurred because of "poor planning" by the police as they did not assess the situation correctly and there was "total failure" of Kanpur local intelligence.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna tabled the report in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly on Thursday."The evidence adduced in the (Dubey encounter) case supports police's version of the incident. The injuries suffered by policemen could not be self-inflicted or fabricated. Dr RS Mishra, who was on the panel of doctors, conducted the post-mortem and clarified that the injuries found on his person (Dubey) could be caused as per the version of police," the report said."Nobody came forward from the public and media to controvert the police version and no evidence is filed in rebuttal. Richa Dubey, wife of Vikas, filed an affidavit calling the incident a fake encounter but she did not appear before the commission," it said, adding that in such eventuality, no suspicion or doubt arises about the police's version.A magisterial inquiry conducted by Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Kanpur Nagar, has a similar finding.Eight police personnel, including deputy superintendent of police, were killed during a raid on Dubey's house at Bikru village in Kanpur district on the night of July 2-3, 2020.Later, Dubey was killed in an encounter when a police vehicle carrying him from Ujjain to Kanpur met with an accident and he tried to escape from custody, the police had said.The commission comprised Justice BS Chauhan (retd), Justice SK Agarwal (retd) and former UP director general of police KL Gupta. It had submitted an 824-page report to the state government on April 21.The commission said there is "sufficient material on record" to show that Dubey and his gang were patronised by the local police, revenue and administrative officials."He (Vikas) and his associates had been in touch with such officials, and the officers were also communicating with them. If any person lodged any complaint against Vikas or his associates, the complainant was humiliated by the police. Even if higher authorities gave directions to lodge a complaint, the local police dictated the terms," it said.Though his name appeared in the list of top 10 criminals in the circle, he did not feature among top 10 criminals of the district, it said, adding that the members of his gang were included in a peace committee to resolve communal disputes."His wife was elected as a Zila Panchayat member and his brother's wife was elected as Bikru village's pradhan. They were both living in Lucknow. If any person of the area wanted help from them, he would contact Dubey and he would resolve their problem. The elected people never came into the picture," the report said.Most of his family members had arms licences, and recommendations for them had been made by competent authorities by concealing material facts of their involvement in criminal cases. Their position was the same when it came to issuance of passports in their favour and/or grant of fair price shop licences, the commission noted.

Maintaining that the menace of terrorism cannot be and should not be associated with any religion, nationality or ethnicity, he said it was vital that the international community must condemn all manifestations of terrorism. “There cannot be any justification for a terrorism act,” he said, while decrying attempts to take “selective, tactical or complacent view of problems”.The events unfolding in Afghanistan enhanced concerns about regional and international security and the heightened activity of Haqqani network “justifies this anxiety,” said Jaishankar.The Haqqani group had links with Al Qaida and had run terrorist training camps, including for Kashmir groups, but was now well represented in the higher Taliban command and its fighters control most of the security in Kabul.Jaishankar reiterated his eight cardinal principles to eliminate terrorism, which include not to glorify terrorism and place blocks on listing of terrorists at UN, enlist and delist terrorists from the UN list objectively, not on political or religious grounds, and provide greater funding to the UN office on counter-terrorism.While all speakers from UNSC members focused on ISIL and Al Qaida, academician Davood Moradian, who escaped from Kabul 48 hours earlier, sought UN peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-terror-groups-continue-to-operate-with-impunity-external-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar-299491

The US should support the “cause of freedom” rather than abandon Afghans to the Taliban. “You are our only remaining hope,” he said.There were conflicting reports about clashes taking place at Charikar which is within striking distance of the Bagram military airport. But it was confirmed that remnants of Uzbek leader Abdul Rashid Dostum’s militia, which had been defeated in Balkh, had arrived in Panjshir Valley. Social media has shown Afghanistan’s First Vice-President Amrullah Saleh, who has declared himself President of Afghanistan, meeting with Massoud while some other pictures showed a congregation of fighters labelled as belonging to the Uzbek and Saleh-Massod camps.Massoud and Saleh might be going against the current since most major powers have said the war is over while many Afghans on social media are appealing to the Panjshir leaders not to plunge the country into a civil war. But Saleh remains defiant. In a dig at the Pakistan-assisted takeover, he said: “Nations must respect the rule of law, not violence. Afghanistan is too big for Pakistan to swallow and too big for Talibs to govern. Don’t let your histories have a chapter on humiliation and bowing to terror groups.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahmad-massouds-son-appeals-for-assistance-to-resist-taliban-299492

Researchers analysed 25,80,021 test results from over 3,80,000 participants.People, who had been vaccinated after already being infected, had even more protection than vaccinated individuals who had not had Covid before. However, Delta infections after two vaccine doses had similar peak levels of virus to those in unvaccinated people; with the Alpha variant, peak virus levels in those infected post-vaccination were much lower.Professor Sarah Walker of University of Oxford and Chief Investigator for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said: “We don’t yet know how much transmission can happen from people who get Covid after being vaccinated but the fact that they can have high levels of virus suggests that people who aren’t yet vaccinated may not be as protected from the Delta variant as we hoped. This means it is essential for as many people as possible to get vaccinated — both in the UK and worldwide.”This study from the Covid-19 Infection Survey is the largest to evaluate, and directly compare the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines against all infections, including those without symptoms, after the Delta variant has dominated.Combating Covid25,80,021 test results3,80,000 participants90% genome sequenced cases in India are of Delta lineage48 countries have the variantFindings of the studyGlobal cases rising for two months: WHO||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-doses-best-bet-against-delta-oxford-299494

20-08-2021||---||Fortis Healthcare ex-promoter Shivinder Singh’s wife Aditi Singh duped of Rs 200 crore||New Delhi, Aug 19Delhi Police on Thursday said they have registered a case on the complaint Aditi S Singh, wife of former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Singh, who alleged that she was cheated of Rs 200 crore by a man posing as an official of the Union Ministry of Law on the promise of helping her in her husband’s cases.Additional Commissioner in the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police RK Singh in an official statement said, “She reported that that she received a call in June 2020, on her mobile phone and in which the caller introduced himself as a senior officer in Ministry of Law and proposed to help her in securing bail for her husband.”The person demanded money for getting the work done and conveyed the modalities regarding delivery of money to Singh, he added.On the complaint and after registering the case an enquiry was conducted in which it was established that Sukash Chandra Shekar alias Sukesh, who was lodged in Rohini Jail, is the mastermind behind this offence, the Police official said.In order to unearth the entire conspiracy, a trap was laid to capture the person getting the delivery of money and thus accused Pradeep Ramdanee and Deepak Ramnani were arrested in this case on August 7 and 8, 2021 respectively.“The interrogation of the arrested accused persons led to the revelation that Sukash Chandra Shekar was running this extortion racket by using mobile phones from inside the jail. Accused Sukash has spoofed the landline numbers of the ministry to make the victim believe that the phone was received from the ministry,” the Police official said, adding that he was arrested and the mobile phone used in the crime was seized from his possession.Later in view of the requirement of a specialised investigation, the case was later transferred to Economic Offences Wing (EOW) from Special Cell, Lodhi Colony, the Police official said.“During investigation, the connecting links between the main accused Sukash and his associates are being established. The interrogation of accused Deepak Ramnani revealed that the accused was being facilitated by Jail officials who used to receive gratification in lieu of the facilities provided,” the official said.Ramnani also disclosed the identity of the officials as well as the vehicles used by them to collect the money. Based on the disclosure of Ramnani, Dharam Singh Meena (Assistant Jail Superintendent) and Subhash Batra (Deputy Superintendent) were found involved in the racket.Later it was found that Komal Poddar, Manager at RBL Bank, Connaught Place, along with two of his associates -- Avinash Kumar and Jitender Narula -- was involved in the dubious transactions for circulation of funds and arrangement of cash. All those found to be involved in the case have been arrested, the Police official said, adding that further searches are being conducted at various places to get the leads and the proceeds of crime.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fortis-healthcare-ex-promoter-shivinder-singhs-wife-aditi-singh-duped-of-rs-200-crore-299465

20-08-2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC stays certain sections related to interfaith marriages in new anti-conversion law||The Gujarat High Court on Thursday stayed the operation of some sections related to interfaith marriages of the state’s new anti-conversion law, in a setback to the state government.A division bench comprising Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav said the interim order has been passed to protect people from unnecessary harassment.While the state BJP government has so far not made any public statement on the high court’s order, legal experts and social activists welcomed the interim stay saying the “entire law is against the spirit of the Constitution” and liberty of citizens to choose their religion.The Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, which penalises forcible or fraudulent religious conversion through marriage, was notified by the state government on June 15.Similar laws have also been enacted by BJP governments in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.Last month, the Gujarat chapter of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind filed a petition, claiming that some of the amended sections of the state’s new law were unconstitutional.On Thursday, Chief Justice Nath said, “We are of the opinion that pending further hearing, rigors of section 3,4, 4a to 4c, 5, 6, and 6a shall not operate merely because the marriage is solemnised by a person of one religion with another religion without force, allurement or fraudulent means and such marriages cannot be termed as marriage for the purpose of unlawful conversion.”“This interim order is to protect the parties which solemnised interfaith marriages from unnecessary harassment,” he said.The stay on these sections effectively means that an FIR under this law cannot be lodged merely on the basis of his or her interfaith marriage.When state Advocate General Kamal Trivedi sought a clarification, saying what if a marriage results in forceful conversion, Chief Justice Nath said, “There has to be a basic element of force or allurement or fraud. Without that you will not (proceed), that’s all we have said in the order.” Section 3 of the state’s new law defines what is “forcible conversion”.It says “no person shall convert or attempt to convert any person from one religion to another by use of force, or by allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage or by getting a person married or by aiding a person to get married, nor shall any person abet such conversion”.As per Section 4, people found guilty of violating the provisions of Section 3 will face up to three years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs 50,000. If the victim is a minor, a woman or from SC or ST community, then the jail term will be four years with a fine of Rs 1 lakh.Section 4A specifically deals with “marriage by unlawful conversion” part of Section 3. It says “conversion by marriage or by getting a person married or by aiding a person to get married is concerned, shall be punished with imprisonment not less than three years, but may extend up to five years along with a fine of Rs 2 lakh”.As per Section 4B, any marriage which was done for the purpose of unlawful conversion “shall be declared void by family court”.Under Section 4C, institutions or organisations will be tried under this law if they are found involved in unlawful conversions, as defined under Section 3 of the law.Section 5 of the law mandates that religious priests must take prior permission from the district magistrate for converting any person from one religion to another. Moreover, the one who got converted also needs to “send an intimation” to the DM in a prescribed form.As per Section 6, prior sanction of the DM or a sub-divisional magistrate is necessary to start prosecution against the accused. However, as per Section 6A, the burden of proof is on the accused “who has caused the conversion”.Meanwhile, city-based legal expert Shamshad Pathan welcomed the HC’s order.“In my opinion, the high court should have taken up this issue suo motu (on its own) immediately after the original law was enacted in 2003. Not just the new sections, this entire Act is against the spirit of the Constitution and liberty of citizens to choose their religion. Law cannot decide which religion people should follow. I welcome today’s verdict,” the lawyer told PTI.Echoing similar views, social activist Dev Desai claimed the entire law was “unconstitutional” from the beginning.“Once a man and a woman attain adulthood, they are free to make decisions regarding their marriage or religion they want to follow. Government cannot have any role in it. Inter-caste or interfaith marriages are actually necessary to eliminate casteism from the society and create harmony among communities,” he said.“I believe the high court should scrap the entire law,” said Desai, who is associated with the NGO Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD), formed in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots.The BJP government had passed the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill in the Assembly during the budget session earlier this year, and Governor Acharya Devvrat gave his assent to it on May 22.The Gujarat chapter of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind filed a petition against the law last month.During a previous hearing, the petitioner’s lawyer, Mihir Joshi, claimed the amended law had vague terms which were against the basic principles of marriage and right to propagate, profess and practice religion, as enshrined in Article 25 of the Constitution.Since the law says no person shall be converted by use of force, allurement, fraudulent means and by marriage, Joshi had contended that it becomes an offence if two persons of different faiths get married as per the new law.In his response, Advocate General Trivedi, on behalf of Gujarat government, told the bench on August 17 that people should not have any fear about the law.“Why this fear? So long as genuine conversion is there, people need not worry. (Inter-faith) marriage per se is not prohibited in this law. It only prohibits forcible conversion by marriage. The law says no person shall be converted by use of force, allurement, fraudulent means or by marriage for the purpose of conversion” Trivedi told the court two days back.He had also said no FIR was lodged merely on the ground of interfaith marriage under this law, as it does not prohibit such marriages per se.“This is not the usual IPC section. The law mandates that the case must be investigated by a Deputy SP rank officer, not any constable or PSI. Further, prosecution will not start without the sanction of the District Magistrate or the Sub Divisional Magistrate. These are the safety valves given the law” Trivedi had argued.He had also said the focus of the law was unlawful conversion and not marriages, as stated by the petitioner.Trivedi had also informed the court that only three complaints were registered across the state under this law so far.

We can issue notice to the boat owner and decide to modify the order,” the bench said, adding that it may request the Kerala high Court to decide it, but it can be done only after hearing Freddy.On June 15, the top court had brought the curtains down on the 9-year old pending criminal proceedings in India against two Italian marines, Massimilano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, who were accused of killing the two fishermen, after Rs 10 crore in compensation was paid by Italy to the heirs of the deceased and the boat owner.It directed Rs 4 crore each be given to the dependents of two deceased fishermen and the rest Rs 2 crore would be given to the vessel owner.The top court had referred the matter to the Kerala High Court to oversee the disbursement.In the fresh plea, the 10 fishermen said they were also injured in the incident and hence, entitled for the compensation. They have sought a stay on the disbursement till their claims are determined.The top court had also said earlier that as per the international arbitral award accepted by India, Italy shall resume further investigation in the case against the two marines and quashed the FIR, registered at Coastal Police Station of Neendakara, Kollam in Kerala and re-registered by NIA in 2013, and all the proceedings in the case.It had closed the case after the Arbitral Tribunal constituted under Annex VII of UNCLOS delivered its award on May 21, 2020 under which Italy agreed to pay Rs 10 crore compensation, over the ex-gratia amount already paid.“We also further direct that the amount of Rs 10 crore now lying with the Registry of this Court be transferred to the High Court of Kerala, out of which Rs 4 crore be paid to the heirs of each deceased and Rs 2 crores be paid to the owner of the boat - St. Antony,” the bench had said.It had requested the Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court to nominate a Judge to pass appropriate order of disbursement/investment of the amount to the heirs and ensure the compensation is duly received by them and not diverted/ misappropriated.“The remaining amount of Rs 2 crore be paid to the owner of the boat - St. Antony by an account payee cheque,” the bench had said.The top court noted that Kerala, the heirs of the deceased fishermen and the owner of the boat have agreed to accept the award.In February 2012, India had accused the two marines on board the MV Enrica Lexie—an Italian flagged oil tanker—of killing two Indian fishermen who were on a fishing vessel in India’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).Latorre, who had suffered a brain stroke on August 31, 2014, was first granted bail and allowed by the apex court on September 12, 2014 to go to Italy for four months and after that, extensions have been granted to him.In Italy, Latorre underwent a heart surgery after which the top court granted him extension of his stay in his native country.The complaint against the marines was lodged by Freddy on whose vessel two Kerala fishermen were killed when marines opened fire on them under the misconception that they were pirates.

With the new set of rules, the ministry wants to increase the number of cities which qualify for such electronic monitoring.Maharashtra has a maximum of 19 cities, followed by 17 in Uttar Pradesh, 13 in Andhra Pradesh and nine in Punjab.

The NHRC had recommended a CBI probe into the incidents.Welcoming the court order, Dilip Ghosh, president of the BJP in West Bengal, said the state police refused to register complaints of violence. “There was no other choice but to approach the court,” Ghosh said, adding that about 1,000 BJP supporters who fled their homes fearing attack by TMC workers could not return home even now.TMC MP and senior party leader Saugata Roy said he was not happy with the order. “Law and order is a state subject.
